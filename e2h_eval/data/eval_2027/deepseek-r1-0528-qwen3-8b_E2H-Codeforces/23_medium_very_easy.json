            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and then one of 'm', 'p', or 's'.\n We have three tiles initially.\n\n We can draw any number of extra tiles (each draw adds one tile) and we want the minimum number of draws to form at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if she already has a mentsu (0 draws).\n    - Koutsu: three identical tiles (same digit and same suit). \n        Example: ['1m','1m','1m'] -> valid.\n    - Shuntsu: three consecutive digits (with step 1) in the same suit, regardless of order.\n        Example: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> valid. But note: [5m,4m,3m] is also valid because we can rearrange.\n\n 2. If not, consider drawing 1, 2, or 3 tiles. But note: we are allowed to draw any tiles, and we are only concerned with forming one mentsu.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win\", meaning that we don't necessarily need to use all the tiles? Actually, the problem says \"have at least one mentsu\". So we don't need to form a complete hand, just one mentsu.\n\n But note: the hand initially has three tiles. We can draw more, and then we look for one mentsu (which is three tiles). So we are effectively trying to form a triplet or a sequence from the available tiles (original plus drawn ones).\n\n Since we can draw any tiles arbitrarily, we can consider:\n\n Option 0: Already have a mentsu -> 0.\n\n Option 1: With 1 extra tile, can we form a mentsu?\n   - For koutsu: if we have two identical tiles, then drawing one more of the same will complete the triplet. So if there is a tile that appears at least twice, then we can complete with one draw (if there are two, then one more; if there are three, then already done). But note: we might have two different pairs? Actually, we have three tiles. Let's break down:\n\n   Possibilities for 0 draws:\n     - Check for koutsu: three same -> 0.\n     - Check for shuntsu: three consecutive in same suit -> 0.\n\n   Now, with one draw:\n\n   Case 1: Drawing to complete a koutsu.\n        If there is a tile that appears at least two times, then we can draw one more of that same tile to get a triplet.\n\n   Case 2: Drawing to complete a shuntsu.\n        We need to check for each suit separately: group by suit, then sort the numbers.\n\n        Example: hand = ['1m','2m','4m'] -> we are missing a '3m'. So one draw would add the 3m to form [1m,2m,3m,4m] and then we can take [1m,2m,3m] as a shuntsu.\n\n        But note: sometimes we can form a shuntsu by drawing one tile in two ways? Actually, we are only concerned with having at least one mentsu. So we can form a shuntsu even if we have more than three tiles? However, we are adding one tile, so we will have four. But that's acceptable because the mentsu is defined as three tiles. We just need one set of three.\n\n        However, the problem does not require to use all the tiles, just having a mentsu.\n\n   So how to check for one-draw shuntsu?\n\n        We can group by suit, and for each suit, consider the distinct numbers (but note: duplicates? Actually, we can have duplicate numbers? The input has three tiles. But duplicates are allowed. However, in a shuntsu we need three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n        Actually, note: the problem states that the initial hand has three tiles. They are represented as three strings.\n\n        Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> then we have two 1m and one 2m. Then we can form a shuntsu by drawing a 3m? But then we have [1m,1m,2m,3m] and we can form [1m,2m,3m] (ignoring the extra 1m). Alternatively, we might form a koutsu by drawing another 1m (then we have three 1m). So we can do it in one draw either way.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal draws is 0, 1, or possibly 2 or 3.\n\n 3. We must consider that we can draw more than one tile, but we are looking for the minimum.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let n = number of tiles (initially 3). We are allowed to draw d tiles (d>=0) such that we can form at least one mentsu.\n\n However, note: we are not required to use the entire hand. We just need one mentsu (three tiles). So the total set of tiles (original plus drawn) must contain a mentsu.\n\n We can think of it as: we have a multiset T of three tiles, and we can add up to d tiles arbitrarily (any tile, including duplicates). We want the smallest d such that there exists a mentsu (triplet or sequence) in T union {drawn tiles}.\n\n We can break down by the type of mentsu:\n\n Triplet (koutsu): requires three identical tiles.\n\n Sequence (shuntsu): requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n We can consider:\n\n d=0: Check if there is a triplet OR a sequence.\n\n d=1: \n   Check if there exists a triplet: if we have two of the same tile, then drawing one more of that tile gives a triplet (so d=1).\n   Check if there exists a sequence: \n        Group by suit. For a given suit, let the set of distinct numbers be S (but we can have duplicates). We want to know if by adding one tile (of any number and that suit) we can form a sequence.\n\n        How? In a suit, we have some numbers. We can try to form a sequence that uses two of our existing tiles and one missing one. Or maybe we have one tile and we can form a sequence by adding two? Actually, no: we are only adding one. So we need to complete a sequence that is missing exactly one tile.\n\n        Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> we can add 3m to complete [1m,2m,3m]. But what if we have [1m,2m,3m] already? Then we don't need to add. Also, [1m,3m,4m] -> we can add 2m to complete [1m,2m,3m] or [2m,3m,4m]. \n\n        However, note: we can also form a sequence that uses two tiles from our hand and one drawn. But we are only adding one tile.\n\n        Conditions for forming a sequence with one draw in a particular suit:\n\n          Let the distinct numbers in that suit (without duplicates) be D. But note: if we have duplicates, we might have multiple copies. However, for a sequence we need three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n          We can consider: \n            - We have three tiles in the same suit: [a, b, c] (sorted). Then we can check if they form a sequence? But we are considering one draw.\n\n          Actually, we are going to consider each suit separately. For a given suit, we have a multiset of numbers. We are allowed to add one tile (same suit, any number) to complete a sequence.\n\n          Steps for a suit:\n            - Count the frequency of each number in that suit (from 1 to 9). But note: the hand has three tiles, so we have at most three numbers (or repeated).\n\n          We can try to see if we can form a sequence by adding one tile. There are several cases:\n\n          Case A: We have two consecutive pairs that are adjacent but not overlapping too much? \n\n          Actually, we can iterate over the possible sequences (there are only 7 sequences per suit: [1,2,3], [2,3,4], ..., [7,8,9]) and check for each sequence if we have two of the three numbers (and then we can complete with one draw). But note: we can have duplicates, so if we have two of one number, then we can use one of them and the other two are needed.\n\n          However, we can also have a situation where we have two tiles that are part of two different sequences? \n\n          Example: [1m,2m,4m]: \n            Sequence [1,2,3] is missing 3.\n            Sequence [2,3,4] is missing 3.\n\n          But note: we can only draw one tile. So we choose to draw 3m and then both [1,2,3] and [2,3,4] are available. But we only need one.\n\n          However, we cannot draw two different tiles. So we must pick one tile that completes at least one sequence.\n\n          Another example: [1m,2m,2m] (so two 2m). Then we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 3m, or [2,3,4] by drawing 3m (but wait, we have two 2m, so for [1,2,3] we need one 1 (we have one), one 2 (we have two, so we can use one) and one 3 (to be drawn). Similarly, [2,3,4] would require one 2 (we have two, so one is available), one 3 (draw) and one 4 (not present). So we can complete [1,2,3] but not [2,3,4] with one draw.\n\n          So the condition for a particular sequence (i, i+1, i+2) in a suit is:\n            We must have at least one occurrence of i, one occurrence of i+1, and we can complete with i+2 (if we don't have i+2). But wait, we can also use duplicates: for example, if we have [2,2,3] then we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 1? Actually, [1,2,3] requires a 1. But we don't have a 1. Alternatively, [2,3,4] requires a 4. \n\n          Actually, let me reframe: For a fixed suit, we have a multiset of numbers. We are going to add one number (say x) to this multiset. Then we can form a sequence if there exists a consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) such that for each number in the triplet, the count in the new multiset (with the added x) is at least one.\n\n          But note: the added tile is one, so we can only cover one missing number.\n\n          So for a sequence (a, a+1, a+2) to be formed, we need:\n            (a is present) and (a+1 is present) and (a+2 is present) OR\n            (a is present) and (a+1 is present) and (a+2 is missing) and we add a+2 -> then we have a, a+1, a+2.\n            Similarly, (a is missing) and (a+1 is present) and (a+2 is present) and we add a.\n            Similarly, (a is present) and (a+1 is missing) and (a+2 is present) and we add a+1.\n\n          However, we cannot fix two missing numbers with one draw. So we require exactly one of the three numbers to be missing, and the other two must be present (at least once).\n\n          But note: if we have duplicates, then we might have more than one copy. However, for the sequence we only need one copy of each. So if we have two copies of a number, that doesn't help us for the sequence unless we are using that number in two different sequences? Actually, no: the sequence requires three distinct numbers.\n\n          Example: [1m,2m,2m] and we want to form [1m,2m,3m]: we have one 1, two 2s (so we have at least one 2) and we are missing 3. So we can add 3.\n\n          Example: [2m,2m,3m] and we want to form [1m,2m,3m]: we are missing 1. So we can add 1.\n\n          Example: [2m,2m,4m] and we want to form [2m,3m,4m]: we are missing 3. So we can add 3.\n\n          Example: [1m,3m,4m] and we want to form [1m,2m,3m]: we are missing 2. So we can add 2.\n\n          Example: [1m,3m,4m] and we want to form [2m,3m,4m]: we are missing 2. So we can add 2.\n\n          Example: [1m,1m,1m] (already a triplet, so 0) -> but if we consider shuntsu, we can't form a shuntsu by adding one tile? Because we have three 1m, which is a triplet (so we don't need to form a shuntsu). But if we were to form a shuntsu, we would have to change the suit? Actually, we can draw a tile of a different suit? But wait, the triplet is already present, so we don't need to form a shuntsu. However, the problem says: we need at least one mentsu. The triplet is a mentsu. So we are done.\n\n          Now, what about if we have two different suits? For example, we have two tiles of one suit and one tile of another. Then we can form a triplet by drawing the last tile of the first suit, or we can form a sequence in the second suit if we have two tiles and we complete the sequence.\n\n          However, note: the mentsu must be formed by three tiles. The tiles must be from the same suit for a sequence, but for a triplet they must be identical (same suit and same number).\n\n          So we can break the hand into groups by suit.\n\n          Steps:\n\n          Let tiles = list of three strings.\n\n          Step 0: Check for triplet (any suit): \n            - Group by (number and suit). If there is a group with at least three, then triplet exists.\n\n          Step 1: Check for sequence (any suit):\n            - For each suit, consider the distinct numbers (but we can have duplicates, but for a sequence we only need one copy of each). So we take the set of numbers for that suit. Then, we look for a consecutive triplet in that set.\n\n          But wait: we have three tiles. So if we have three tiles in the same suit, we can check if they form a consecutive triplet (when sorted). But note: [5,6,7] is consecutive, [5,5,6] is not (because we need three distinct consecutive numbers). \n\n          Actually, the definition: a shuntsu is three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit. So the numbers must be distinct and consecutive. \n\n          Therefore, for a given suit, we have a multiset of numbers. We are interested in the distinct numbers. Then, we check if there is any consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) contained in the distinct numbers.\n\n          However, note: we might have duplicates, but the sequence requires three distinct numbers. So duplicates don't help in forming a sequence.\n\n          Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> distinct numbers {1,2}. No consecutive triplet.\n\n          Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> distinct numbers {1,2,4}. Then we can form [1,2,3] if we add 3, or [2,3,4] if we add 3. But wait, we can only add one tile, so we can complete one of these.\n\n          However, we are not limited to the three tiles we have? We can draw one tile and then we have four. But the sequence must be three consecutive. So if we have [1m,2m,4m] and we draw 3m, then we have four tiles, but we can form [1m,2m,3m] (using the 1m,2m and the drawn 3m). \n\n          So for a given suit, we can form a sequence with one draw if there exists a consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) such that the set of distinct numbers in that suit contains at least two of {a, a+1, a+2}. \n\n          Why two? Because we can draw the missing one.\n\n          But note: if we have two, then we can complete the sequence by drawing the third. However, if we have one, then we cannot complete the sequence by drawing one because we need two more? Actually, no: the sequence requires three distinct numbers. So if we are missing two, then we cannot complete the sequence by drawing one. \n\n          Actually, we require that the drawn tile is the only one missing. So we require two of the three numbers to be present (at least one copy of each) and the third missing.\n\n          Therefore, for a sequence (a, a+1, a+2) to be completable by one draw in a given suit, the suit must have at least two of the three numbers (each appearing at least once) and the third number must not be present.\n\n          Example: \n            Hand: [1m,2m,4m] for suit 'm': \n                For sequence [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 2, missing 3 -> valid.\n                For sequence [2,3,4]: we have 2 and 4, missing 3 -> valid.\n\n          But note: the sequence [1,2,3] and [2,3,4] both require 3. But we can only draw one tile, so we can complete one of them. But we don't care which one.\n\n          Therefore, if there exists at least one sequence (over all suits) that can be completed by one draw, then we can do it in one draw.\n\n          However, what if we have two different suits? We can draw a tile in one suit to complete a sequence in that suit, ignoring the other suit.\n\n          So overall for one draw:\n\n          Condition 1: There exists a tile that appears at least two times (so we can complete a triplet by drawing one more). Then d=1.\n\n          Condition 2: There exists a suit and a consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) such that the hand (in that suit) has at least two distinct numbers from the triplet and the third is missing. Then d=1.\n\n          But note: we might have both conditions satisfied? Then we still answer 1.\n\n          However, what if Condition 1 is not satisfied, but Condition 2 is? Then 1.\n\n          What if neither Condition 0 nor Condition 1 holds?\n\n          Then we try two draws.\n\n          d=2: \n            Possibility 1: Complete a triplet: if we have one duplicate (one pair) then we need two draws (to complete the triplet). Or if we have three different tiles, then we can't form a triplet by two draws? Actually, we can draw two tiles of the same type as one of the existing ones. But wait, we are allowed to draw any tiles. So if we have a pair, then we need one draw (as above). But if we have no pair, then we cannot complete a triplet with two draws? Actually, no: we have three distinct tiles. Then we can draw two more of one of them? That would give a triplet. But wait, we have three distinct, so we can choose one of them and draw two more. Then we have four tiles: the triplet and the other two distinct. So that forms a triplet.\n\n            However, we are only concerned with having at least one mentsu. So if we have three distinct tiles, we can draw two of one of them to form a triplet. So Condition for triplet with two draws: if there is at least one tile that appears at least once, then we can draw two more of that tile to complete the triplet. But wait, we have three tiles. Each tile is distinct, so each tile appears once. Then we can choose one and draw two. So yes, two draws.\n\n            Possibility 2: Complete a sequence: we can complete a sequence by drawing two tiles. There are two ways:\n\n            Case A: We have two tiles that are part of a sequence, but we are missing two numbers. Then we can draw the two missing numbers.\n\n            Case B: We have one tile, and we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles (the other two consecutive numbers). \n\n            However, note: we can also have multiple suits. But let's focus on one suit.\n\n            How to check for two draws for a sequence in a particular suit?\n\n            We need to check if there exists a consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) such that the hand (in that suit) has at least one of the three numbers, and the total number of distinct numbers we have in the triplet is at most two (so we are missing at least one) and the total missing numbers (counting multiplicities? Actually, we only need one copy for the sequence) is at most two.\n\n            Actually, we can draw two tiles to complete the sequence. The condition is: the set of distinct numbers in the suit must be a subset of {a, a+1, a+2} (for a fixed sequence) and the size of the set is at least 1 and at most 3. But we can also form a sequence by drawing two tiles if the set is missing two numbers.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider: for a fixed suit, we can form a sequence with two draws if there exists a consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) such that the hand (in that suit) has at most two distinct numbers from the triplet (so we are missing one or two). Then we can draw the missing ones.\n\n            But wait: we are allowed to draw two. So if we are missing one, then we can complete with one draw (so that would be one, not two). So we are only considering two draws when one draw isn't enough.\n\n            Actually, we are breaking down by d. We already checked d=0 and d=1. Now we check d=2.\n\n            Conditions for d=2:\n\n            Condition A: Triplet: if there is at least one tile that appears at least once (which there is, because we have three tiles) then we can always form a triplet by drawing two of one of the existing tiles. So if we don't have a triplet already, and we don't have a pair (so no triplet via drawing one) then we can form a triplet by drawing two. But wait: even if we have a pair, we already considered one draw. So if we have a pair, then we can form a triplet by one draw. So for d=2, we are considering the case when we don't have a triplet and we don't have two identical tiles (so all three are distinct). Then we can draw two of one of them to form a triplet.\n\n            Condition B: Sequence: we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles. This can happen in two ways:\n\n            Way 1: We have two tiles that are part of a consecutive triplet, but we are missing two. Then we can draw the two missing.\n\n            Way 2: We have one tile, and we draw the other two to complete the consecutive triplet.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,3m] -> already a sequence (so d=0). \n            Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 3 (so d=1). \n            Example: [1m,3m,5m] -> we can complete [3,4,5] by drawing 4. But wait, we have 3 and 5, so we are missing 4. Then we can complete [3,4,5] by drawing one tile (d=1). \n            Example: [1m,4m,5m] -> we can complete [4,5,6] by drawing 6 (d=1). \n            Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> we can complete a triplet (by drawing one more 1m) or a sequence? In the same suit, we have two 1m and one 2m. For a sequence, we need three distinct consecutive. We have [1,2] but we need a 0 or a 3? Actually, the numbers must be between 1 and 9. So we cannot have 0. Then we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3. But wait, we have two 1m. So we can use one 1m and the 2m and the drawn 3m. But then we have two 1m left. So we can form the sequence. So d=1.\n\n            So why would we need two draws for a sequence? \n\n            Example: [1m,2m,2m] -> already we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 3 (d=1). \n\n            Example: [1m,3m,4m] -> we can complete [2,3,4] by drawing 2 (d=1). \n\n            Example: [5m,6m,7m] -> already a sequence (d=0).\n\n            Example: [5m,6m,8m] -> we can complete [5,6,7] by drawing 7 (d=1).\n\n            Example: [1m,9m,8m] -> same as [1,8,9] (sort: [1,8,9]). We can form a sequence? The consecutive triplets that include 8 and 9: [7,8,9] (missing 7) and [8,9,10] (invalid). So we can complete [7,8,9] by drawing 7 (d=1).\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,5m] -> we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3 (d=1). \n\n            Example: [1m,2m,9m] -> we can form [7,8,9] by drawing 7 and 8? But wait, we only need one draw? Actually, no: we are missing two numbers (7 and 8) for the sequence [7,8,9]? But we have 9. Then we need 7 and 8. That would be two draws. \n\n            However, note: we can also form [1,2,3] by drawing 3 (only one draw). So we don't need to consider [7,8,9] for this hand because we already have a candidate with one draw.\n\n            So the example that requires two draws for a sequence is when there is no sequence that can be completed with one draw, but there is one that can be completed with two.\n\n            Example: [1m,5m,9m] -> no two numbers are consecutive. Then we cannot form a sequence by drawing one tile (because we would need two consecutive numbers to anchor the sequence). \n\n            How to complete a sequence from [1m,5m,9m]?\n                Possibilities:\n                  [1,2,3] -> missing 2,3 (two draws)\n                  [2,3,4] -> no 1,5,9 in common -> not helpful\n                  [3,4,5] -> we have 5, so we are missing 3,4 (two draws)\n                  [4,5,6] -> we have 5, missing 4,6 (two draws)\n                  [5,6,7] -> we have 5, missing 6,7 (two draws)\n                  [6,7,8] -> no\n                  [7,8,9] -> we have 9, missing 7,8 (two draws)\n\n            So we need two draws.\n\n            Therefore, Condition for two draws for a sequence: \n                There exists a consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) such that the hand (in that suit) has exactly one of the three numbers (or none) and the number of missing numbers is two. Then we can complete by drawing two.\n\n            But note: we can also have two draws for a triplet? Actually, if we don't have any pair, then we can form a triplet by drawing two of one of the tiles (since each tile appears once). So that is also two draws.\n\n            Therefore, if we don't have a triplet and we don't have a pair, then we can form a triplet by two draws. Also, if we don't have a sequence that can be completed by one draw, but we have a sequence that can be completed by two draws (in some suit), then two draws.\n\n            However, note: we might have both a triplet and a sequence that can be completed by two draws? Then we still choose two draws.\n\n            But wait: the minimal draws. We are checking d=0, then d=1, then d=2, then d=3.\n\n            Actually, we can also consider d=3: \n                We have three tiles. We can draw three tiles arbitrarily. Then we can form a triplet by drawing three of one of the tiles (if we have one copy, then we can draw two more to get three). But wait, we have three distinct tiles, so we can draw three of one of them? Then we have four copies of one tile and one copy of the other two. That forms a triplet. \n\n                Alternatively, we can form a sequence by drawing three tiles? But we can form a sequence by drawing three tiles if we have one tile and we need two more, but wait: actually, we can form a sequence by drawing three tiles only if we have no tiles in a suit and then we draw three consecutive? But we have three tiles. \n\n            However, note: we are allowed to draw any tiles. So we can draw three tiles of the same type as one of the existing ones to form a triplet (if we have one copy, then we need two more -> that's two draws, not three). \n\n            Actually, the minimal draws for a triplet if we have one copy of a tile is two. So d=2 is the maximum we need to consider? \n\n            But wait: what if we have three distinct tiles and no two are consecutive? Then we cannot form a triplet by two draws (we have to draw two of one, which we can do) and we cannot form a sequence by two draws (unless we have a suit with two tiles that are consecutive and one missing one, but wait: if we have three distinct tiles and they are not consecutive, then in each suit we have at most one tile (unless two tiles share the same suit). \n\n            Example: ['1m','1p','1s'] -> three distinct tiles, all different suits and same number. Then we can form a triplet by drawing two more 1m (for example) to get three 1m. So two draws.\n\n            Example: ['1m','2p','3s'] -> three distinct tiles, no two are the same. Then we can form a triplet by drawing two of one of them (e.g., two 1m). So two draws.\n\n            But note: we can also form a sequence by drawing three tiles? Actually, no, because we need three consecutive in the same suit. We have one tile per suit. So we would have to draw two more in one suit to form a sequence? Actually, no: we have one tile, say 1m. Then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (three draws). But wait, we can do it in two draws by drawing two 1m to form a triplet? \n\n            So the minimal draws is two.\n\n            However, what if we have three tiles that are all in different suits and the numbers are such that we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles? \n\n            Example: ['1m','2p','3s'] -> we can draw one more 2p to complete [2p,2p,2p] (triplet) -> that's one draw? But wait, we have one 2p, so we need two more to make a triplet. That's two draws. Alternatively, we can draw one 1p and one 3p to form a sequence [1p,2p,3p] in pinzu? But wait, we have 2p already. So we can draw 1p and 3p (two draws) to form [1p,2p,3p]. \n\n            But note: we can also form a triplet by drawing two 2p. So two draws is the minimal.\n\n            However, we might have a scenario that requires three draws? \n\n            Example: We have three tiles that are all different and we cannot form a triplet or a sequence with two draws. \n\n            Actually, the problem says: we are allowed to draw any tiles. We can always form a triplet by drawing two of one of the existing tiles (if we have at least one tile, which we do). So two draws is always sufficient.\n\n            But wait: what if we have three tiles that are all different and we cannot form a triplet by two draws? Actually, we can: we choose one tile and draw two copies of it. Then we have four copies of that tile and one copy of the other two. Then we have a triplet.\n\n            Therefore, the maximum minimal draws is two? \n\n            Let's reexamine:\n\n            d=0: 0 draws.\n            d=1: 1 draw (if we have two of a tile, or if we can complete a sequence by one draw).\n            d=2: 2 draws (otherwise).\n\n            But wait: what if we have three tiles that are all the same? Then we have a triplet (d=0). \n\n            What if we have two the same and one different? Then we can complete a triplet by one draw (if we draw the same as the pair) OR we might complete a sequence by one draw (if the two same and the different form a sequence). \n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> we can complete triplet by drawing one 1m (d=1) and we can complete sequence [1,2,3] by drawing 3m (d=1). So d=1.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','3m'] -> triplet by drawing one 1m (d=1). Sequence? We have two 1m and one 3m. We can form [1,2,3] by drawing 2m (d=1). So d=1.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','4m'] -> triplet by drawing one 1m (d=1). Sequence? [0,1,2] invalid, [1,2,3] missing 2,3 -> no, [2,3,4] missing 2,3 -> no, [3,4,5] missing 3,5 -> no, ... so no sequence with one draw. But we can complete the triplet with one draw, so d=1.\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','2m'] -> triplet by drawing one 2m (d=1). Sequence: [1,2,3] -> we have 1 and two 2s, so we are missing 3 -> one draw. So d=1.\n\n            Example: ['1m','3m','3m'] -> triplet by drawing one 3m (d=1). Sequence: [2,3,4] -> we have 3 and one 1, so we are missing 2 and 4? Actually, we have 1 and 3. Then [2,3,4] requires 2 and 4. We can complete [2,3,4] by drawing 2 and 4? But that's two draws. However, we can also complete [1,2,3] by drawing 2. So d=1.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','1m'] -> triplet (d=0).\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> sequence (d=0).\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> sequence by drawing 3m (d=1).\n\n            Example: ['1m','3m','5m'] -> sequence by drawing 2m,4m, or something? Actually, we can complete [3,4,5] by drawing 4m (d=1).\n\n            Example: ['1m','5m','9m'] -> no one-draw solution, so d=2.\n\n            Therefore, we have:\n\n            d=0: if there's a triplet OR a sequence.\n\n            d=1: if there's a pair (so we can complete a triplet) OR there exists a suit and a consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) such that the hand (in that suit) has at least two distinct numbers from the triplet.\n\n            d=2: otherwise.\n\n            But wait: what if the hand is ['1m','1m','1m']? Then d=0.\n\n            However, what if the hand is ['1m','1m','2m']? Then d=1.\n\n            What if the hand is ['1m','2m','3m']?",

If so, it immediately returns 0.\n\n2. **One-Draw Check**:\n   - **Triplet Completion**: If any tile appears at least twice, drawing one more of the same tile completes a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Completion**: For each suit, the code checks if two numbers of a potential sequence (three consecutive numbers) are present. The missing number can be drawn to complete the sequence.\n\n3. **Two-Draw Check**:\n   - If no existing or one-draw mentsu is found, the code defaults to two draws. This is because drawing two tiles of any kind will always allow forming either a triplet (by drawing two of an existing tile) or a sequence (by drawing the necessary two missing numbers in a suit).\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws required, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum input size.",
