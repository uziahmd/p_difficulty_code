    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a simpler approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the entire string might be considered, but if no duplicate substring of positive length exists, we output 0.\n 2. Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1 until we find one that appears at least twice.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n   Let n = len(s)\n   We can consider all substrings and record their starting indices and lengths? But that might be too heavy.\n\n Another approach: \n   We can use a dictionary to store all substrings (with their lengths) and then look for the maximum length that has at least two occurrences.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and occurrences can overlap.\n\n But note: if we have \"aaa\", then substring \"a\" appears many times, but we are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n Example: \n   Input: 'abcd' -> output 0 (no duplicate substring of any length)\n   Input: 'ababa' -> output 3 (substring 'aba' appears twice: at index0 and index2, and also 'bab' appears twice? Actually, let's check: \n        'ababa': \n          length 5: only one occurrence (the whole string)\n          length 4: two substrings: 'abab' and 'baba' -> each appears once?\n          length 3: \n            'aba' (0:2) and then 'aba' again at index 2:4 -> so two times.\n            'bab' (1:3) and then 'aba' doesn't match, but wait: \n                substring starting at 0: 'aba'\n                substring starting at 1: 'bab'\n                substring starting at 2: 'aba' (again)\n            So 'aba' is of length 3 and appears twice.\n\n          length 2: \n            'ab' appears twice? \n                index0: 'ab', index1: 'ba', index2: 'ab', index3: 'ba' -> so 'ab' appears twice, and 'ba' appears twice. But the longest is 3.\n\n   Input: 'zzz' -> output 2 (because the substring 'zz' appears twice: at index0 and index1)\n\n How about: \n   We want the maximum L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n We can do:\n   For L from floor(n/2) down to 1 (or from n-1 down to 1) and check for each substring of length L if it appears at least twice.\n\n However, note: the two occurrences must be contiguous? Actually, we are considering every substring, and the substring is defined by contiguous characters.\n\n Steps:\n   Let s be the input string, n = len(s)\n   We'll iterate L from min(n, n) [actually from n down to 1] but actually we can start from the maximum possible duplicate: the entire string cannot be duplicated (unless the string is repeated, but the problem says at least twice in the same string). Actually, the two occurrences must be in the same string and can overlap.\n\n   But note: if we have \"aaaa\", then the substring \"aaa\" appears three times (starting at 0,1,2). So we are counting multiple occurrences. We just need at least two.\n\n   However, the maximum L we can have is n//2? Actually, no: consider \"abcabc\", then the substring \"abc\" (length 3) appears twice, and n=6, so 3 is half of 6. But what about \"aaa\"? Then the maximum duplicate substring length is 2: because \"aa\" appears three times (if the string is \"aaa\", then we can take two consecutive a's: at index0 and index1). \n\n   Actually, the maximum L we can have is floor(n/2) ? Not exactly: consider \"abcdeabcde\" (n=10) then the substring of length 5 \"abcde\" appears twice, and 5 is more than 10/2=5? Actually 10/2=5, so yes.\n\n   But wait: two non-overlapping occurrences of a substring of length L would require at least 2*L characters. However, the problem allows overlapping. So even if we have overlapping, we can have two occurrences that are adjacent without being non-overlapping? Actually, overlapping means they can share some part.\n\n   Example: \"ababa\": substring \"aba\" (length 3) appears at index0 and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution must efficiently handle all edge cases, including strings with no duplicate substrings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters (substring) within a string that appears at least twice. The key observation here is that the solution must consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates, but doing this naively would be computationally expensive for larger strings. However, since the input string length is guaranteed to be no more than 100, a brute-force approach is feasible.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible substring length from the maximum possible down to 1, we check if there are at least two distinct starting positions where the substring occurs. The first such length found will be the answer because we are checking from the largest possible length downwards.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves iterating over all possible substring lengths in descending order. For each length, it checks all possible substrings of that length in the string. If any substring of the current length appears at least twice, the length is returned immediately as the result. If no such substring is found for all lengths, the result is 0.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n^3) in the worst case, where n is the length of the string. This is because for each possible substring length (O(n)), we check all starting positions (O(n)), and for each starting position, we compare substrings (O(n)). Given the constraint that n ≤ 100, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # We'll check from the maximum possible substring length (n-1) down to 1.\n    # But note: the maximum duplicate substring cannot exceed n//2? Actually, no: \n    # Example: \"abcabc\" has a substring \"abc\" of length 3, which is half of 6.\n    # However, we can have overlapping duplicates, so the maximum length could be up to n-1? \n    # But consider: if the entire string is of length n, then the only way to have two occurrences is if the string is periodic, but even then, the maximum length might be less than n.\n    # However, we can simply iterate from L = n-1 down to 1, and check for each L if there's at least two occurrences of any substring of length L.\n    \n    # But note: two occurrences must be non-overlapping? No, they can overlap. So we just need to find two different starting indices where the same substring appears.\n    \n    # However, we can optimize by starting from the maximum possible L (which is n-1) down to 1, but note: the maximum duplicate substring cannot be longer than floor(n/2) in some cases? Actually, consider \"aaa\": the maximum duplicate substring is \"aa\" (length 2), which is floor(3/2)=1, but wait, 2 is greater than 1. So that doesn't hold.\n    # Actually, the maximum length of a substring that can appear twice is limited by the condition that there must be two starting indices i and j (i < j) such that the substring of length L starting at i equals the substring starting at j. The minimal distance between i and j is L (if they don't overlap). But they can overlap, so the condition is just that j - i >= L? No, they can overlap, so j can be as small as i+1, but then the substrings would be of length L and start at i and i+1, requiring the characters to repeat every character. \n\n    # Actually, the maximum L we need to check is from n-1 down to 1. Because a substring of length n-1 can appear at most once unless the string is like \"aaa...a\", but then a substring of length n-1 would still appear only once if the string is exactly n characters long. \n\n    # Let me clarify: for a string of length n, a substring of length L can appear multiple times. The condition for two occurrences is that there exist two indices i and j (i < j) such that the substring starting at i of length L equals the substring starting at j of length L. The minimal requirement is that j >= i + L, but since they can overlap, j can be as small as i + 1, meaning the substrings share L-1 characters. \n\n    # Therefore, we should iterate L from min(n-1, ...) but actually, we can iterate L from n-1 down to 1. However, in practice, the answer will likely be found much sooner.\n\n    # We'll iterate L from n-1 down to 1:\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                # We found at least two occurrences\n                print(L)\n                return\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = start\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace. If the string is empty, the result is immediately 0.\n2. **Iterate Over Substring Lengths**: The algorithm checks all possible substring lengths from the largest (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it examines every possible starting position in the string.\n3. **Substring Comparison**: For each substring of the current length, it checks if the substring has been seen before. If a duplicate is found, the current length is printed as the result, and the program exits.\n4. **Result Handling**: If no duplicate substring is found for any length, the program outputs 0, indicating no such substring exists in the input string.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest duplicate substring by leveraging a dictionary to keep track of seen substrings, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
