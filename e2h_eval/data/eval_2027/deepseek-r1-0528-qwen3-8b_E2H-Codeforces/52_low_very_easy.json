Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of old candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour.\n   - When we burn a candle, it becomes an old candle.\n   - After burning, if we have collected 'b' old candles, we can make one new candle from them.\n\n Steps:\n   Let:\n     hours = 0\n     current_candles = a\n     leftover = 0\n\n   However, we can think of it as:\n     While we have candles (either new or leftover from making new ones) to burn:\n        Burn all available candles (which gives us hours equal to the number of candles burned, and then we get as many leftovers as we burned)\n\n   But note: we can use the leftovers to form new candles.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate:\n     total_hours = 0\n     current = a\n     leftover = 0\n\n     while current > 0:\n         # Burn all current candles\n         total_hours += current\n         leftover += current\n         current = 0\n\n         # Now, with leftover, we can make new candles: floor(leftover / b)\n         # Then, we set current to that number, and the leftover becomes leftover % b\n         current = leftover // b\n         leftover = leftover % b\n\n   However, let's test with the example: \"4 2\"\n\n     Start: a=4, b=2\n        Step1: \n            current = 4\n            Burn 4: total_hours = 4, leftover becomes 4.\n            Then, current = 4 // 2 = 2, leftover = 4 % 2 = 0.\n        Step2:\n            Burn 2: total_hours = 4+2 = 6, leftover becomes 2.\n            Then, current = 2 // 2 = 1, leftover = 0.\n        Step3:\n            Burn 1: total_hours = 7, leftover becomes 1 -> which is less than b, so next current is 0.\n\n        Output: 7 -> matches.\n\n   Another example: \"6 3\"\n        Start: a=6, b=3\n        Step1: \n            Burn 6: total_hours=6, leftover=6.\n            current = 6//3 = 2, leftover=0.\n        Step2:\n            Burn 2: total_hours=8, leftover=2 -> not enough to make a new candle (since 2 < 3), so stop.\n\n        Output: 8 -> matches.\n\n   But wait, what about the possibility of having leftover from multiple cycles? The above simulation works because we are always combining all leftover at the end of each cycle.\n\n   However, note: in the first example, after burning the initial 4, we have 4 leftovers, then we make 2 new ones. Then when those 2 burn, we get 2 more, which combined with the leftover from the previous step (which was 0) we have 2, and then we make 1 more. Then that 1 burns and leaves 1 leftover which isn't enough.\n\n   But wait, actually in the simulation above, we are resetting 'current' to the newly made candles, and the leftover is updated by the total burned in the current step. This seems correct.\n\n   However, there's another way to think: we start with a candles. Each candle provides one hour and one leftover. Then, for every b leftovers, we get one new candle. So the total number of candles we can burn is:\n\n        total_candles = a + floor(a / b) + floor((a + floor(a/b)) / b) ... \n\n   But that is the same as the simulation.\n\n   Since the constraints are small (a, b between 1 and 1000) and the numbers don't grow too large (because we are dividing by at least 2 each time), we can use a while loop.\n\n   However, we can also compute without a loop by using a formula, but the problem is small so a loop is acceptable.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the above simulation uses integer arithmetic and accumulates the hours.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Read the input line, split into two integers.\n\n   Then, initialize:\n        hours = 0\n        current = a\n        leftover = 0\n\n   Then, while current > 0 or leftover >= b: \n        Actually, we can break when current==0 and leftover < b, but we can also just use a while current>0 as above.\n\n   However, the above simulation breaks when current becomes 0 and then leftover is not enough to form a new candle. But the condition in the while loop is on current, which gets reset from leftover. The simulation does:\n\n        total_hours += current",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and recycling the leftover burned candles into new ones until it's no longer possible to form new candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of initial candles (a) and the number of burned candles required to make a new one (b).\n2. **Simulate Burning Candles**: \n   - For each iteration, burn all available candles (either new or recycled). Each burned candle provides one hour of light.\n   - After burning, collect all the burned candles (leftovers) which can be used to create new candles.\n   - Calculate the number of new candles that can be made from the leftovers (leftover // b) and update the remaining leftovers (leftover % b).\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are no more candles (both new and recycled) to burn. The total hours accumulated during the burning process is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    hours = 0\n    current = a\n    leftover = 0\n    \n    while current > 0:\n        hours += current\n        leftover += current\n        current = leftover // b\n        leftover = leftover % b\n        \n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `hours`, `current`, and `leftover` are initialized to zero. `hours` will keep track of the total burning time, `current` holds the number of candles available to burn in each iteration, and `leftover` stores the unused burned candles.\n3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as there are candles (`current > 0`) to burn. In each iteration:\n   - The number of hours is increased by the number of candles being burned (`current`).\n   - The burned candles are added to `leftover`.\n   - New candles are calculated by dividing `leftover` by `b`. The remainder of this division is the leftover burned candles that couldn't form a new candle.\n4. **Output**: After the loop terminates, the total hours (`hours`) is printed, representing the maximum time Vasily can light his room.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the candle-burning process, ensuring optimal use of both initial and recycled candles to maximize the total burning time.",
