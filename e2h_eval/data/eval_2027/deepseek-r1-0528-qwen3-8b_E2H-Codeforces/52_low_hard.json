Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of old candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles.

So we don't need to wait until the end of the hour to collect the leftovers? Actually, the problem states: \"When Vasily lights up a new candle, it first burns for an hour and then it goes out.\" And then he can use the went out (burned) candles to make new ones.\n\n   The above simulation uses the fact that after burning, we have the same amount of leftovers as the number of candles burned.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not say that we can only use the burned candles from the previous hour. It says: \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle\". This implies that whenever we have at least b went out candles, we can form a new candle.\n\n   The simulation above is doing:\n\n        total_hours += current\n        leftover += current   (so we have all the burned candles from the current set)\n\n        Then we use these leftovers to make new candles.\n\n   But note: we might be able to mix the leftovers from different sets. The problem doesn't specify timing, but the key is that we can use any went out candles.\n\n   Since we are burning all available candles at once (and then using the leftovers to make more), the simulation is valid.\n\n   However, we can also solve without a loop by using a formula:\n\n        total = a\n        leftover = a\n        while leftover >= b:\n            # From 'leftover', we can make new_candles = leftover // b\n            total += leftover // b\n            leftover = leftover % b + leftover // b   ? \n\n        But wait, actually:\n\n        In the loop above, we burn all current (which is initially a, then the new candles we made). So the total_hours is the initial a plus the new candles we make from leftovers.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        Let n = a   (total candles we have, which will be burned and then converted)\n        Then the process",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The solution involves simulating the process where each candle burns for an hour, and then the burnt candles can be combined to form new candles based on a given ratio.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial number of candles (a) and the ratio (b) which indicates how many burnt candles are needed to make a new one.\n2. **Simulation Loop**: \n   - **Burning Candles**: For each iteration, burn all available candles, adding their count to the total hours.\n   - **Recycling Burnt Candles**: After burning, calculate how many new candles can be made from the burnt candles. This is done by dividing the total burnt candles by the ratio (b). The remainder from this division becomes the leftover burnt candles that cannot form a new candle.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are not enough burnt candles left to form a new candle (i.e., when the count of burnt candles is less than b).\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal usage to maximize the total burning hours.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    current_candles = a\n    leftover = 0\n\n    while current_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += current_candles\n        leftover += current_candles\n        current_candles = leftover // b\n        leftover = leftover % b\n\n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The program reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (ratio for making new candles).\n- **Loop**: The loop runs as long as there are candles to burn (`current_candles > 0`).\n  - **Burning Phase**: Each iteration adds the number of candles burned to `total_hours` and accumulates these burnt candles into `leftover`.\n  - **Recycling Phase**: The burnt candles (`leftover`) are divided by `b` to determine how many new candles (`current_candles`) can be made. The remainder of this division becomes the new `leftover` for the next iteration.\n- **Output**: Once no more candles can be made (i.e., `leftover < b`), the loop exits, and the total hours (`total_hours`) is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that Vasily uses his candles optimally, maximizing the burning time by recycling burnt candles whenever possible.",
