He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n        f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n But note: We are given m (required number of trailing zeros) and need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. So we can use binary search to find the range of n for which f(n) = m.\n\n Observation:\n   For a fixed m, there might be a contiguous set of n's that have the same number of trailing zeros? Actually, no: \n   The value of f(n) increases only when n is a multiple of a power of 5. But between two multiples, the function stays constant.\n\n   However, note: \n     f(4) = 0, f(5)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2, etc.\n\n   So for a given m, we want to find the smallest n1 such that f(n1) >= m and the largest n2 such that f(n2) <= m?\n   Actually, we want n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (call this lower_bound).\n     2. Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1 (call this next_bound). Then the numbers with exactly m zeros are from lower_bound to next_bound-1.\n\n   But wait: if we have f(n) = m, then we need to check if there exists any n such that f(n)=m.\n\n   However, note: sometimes there might be gaps. For example, if m=1, then n from 5 to 9 have f(n)=1. But if m=2, then n from 10 to 14 have f(n)=2.\n\n   But what about m=0? Then n from 1 to 4.\n\n   However, the problem states: m>=1.\n\n   But note: the example input is 1, and the output is the numbers 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n   What if no n exists? \n        Example: m=100000, but note that f(n) grows roughly as n/4 (since each 5 adds one and higher powers add more). \n        We must consider that m can be up to 100000.\n\n   However, note that the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Let L = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n        Let R = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then the numbers n with exactly m zeros are from L to R-1.\n\n        But note: it is possible that there is no n with f(n)=m? Actually, the function f(n) is non-decreasing and increases by at least 1 at some points (when n is a multiple of 5) but sometimes it jumps by more than one. However, for consecutive m, we know that the set of n for which f(n)=m is contiguous and non-empty for every m? \n\n        Actually, no: consider m=0. But our m starts at 1. For m>=1, is every m achieved?\n\n        Example: \n            m=1: achieved for n=5 to 9 -> 5 numbers.\n            m=2: achieved for n=10 to 14 -> 5 numbers.\n\n        But wait: \n            f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2, f(11)=2, f(12)=2, f(13)=2, f(14)=2, f(15)=3.\n\n        So the pattern is that for each m, the set of n that yield m trailing zeros is a contiguous block of 5 numbers? Not necessarily.\n\n        Actually, the length of the block is determined by the next multiple of 5. When we have a jump, we break the block.\n\n        However, note that f(n) only increases at multiples of 5. So between two consecutive multiples of 5, the number of zeros remains the same.\n\n        But the jump at 25: \n            f(24)=4, f(25)=6 (because 25 contributes two factors of 5: 5 and 5 again) so from 24 to 25, zeros jump from 4 to 6.\n\n        Therefore, for m=5: \n            We need to find n such that f(n)=5.\n\n            f(20)= floor(20/5)+floor(20/25)=4+0=4.\n            f(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6.\n\n            So there is no n such that f(n)=5.\n\n        Therefore, we must check if there exists any n with f(n)=m.\n\n        How to do that?\n\n        We can use:\n            Let L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n            Let R = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then the condition for having at least one n with f(n)=m is that f(L) == m, and also that L < R.\n\n        Actually, the set [L, R-1] are the n's with f(n)=m if and only if f(L) = m and f(R-1)=m and f(R)=m+1 or more.\n\n        But note: if m is not achieved, then L would be the first n with f(n)=m+? (jumped over m) and then the set would be empty.\n\n        So:\n\n            Step 1: Define a function to compute trailing zeros (f) for a given n.\n\n            Step 2: Binary search for the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (lower_bound)\n            Step 3: Binary search for the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1 (upper_bound)\n\n            Then the numbers n such that f(n)=m are the integers from lower_bound to upper_bound-1.\n\n            But note: if f(lower_bound) != m, then there is no solution? Actually, no: because we defined lower_bound as the smallest n with f(n)>=m, and if the minimal n achieving at least m is actually achieving m+something (like in the case m=5) then there is no n with exactly m.\n\n        However, in that case, we must output 0 and nothing else.\n\n        Example: m=5 -> lower_bound would be the smallest n with f(n)>=5. Since f(20)=4, f(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6 -> so lower_bound=25. Then the set would be [25, ... until the next jump?] but wait, we are looking for exactly 5. There is no n with f(n)=5.\n\n        So we can say: the set of n with f(n)=m is non-empty if and only if f(lower_bound) == m.\n\n        But note: it is possible that the smallest n with f(n)>=m has f(n)=m, and then we have a contiguous set until the next jump.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n            def zeros(n):\n                count = 0\n                div = 5\n                while div <= n:\n                    count += n // div\n                    div *= 5\n                return count\n\n            low = 0\n            high = something big enough? We know that m<=100000, and the maximum n needed: \n                Since zeros(n) ~ n/4 (roughly), so n is about 4*m. But m can be 100000, so n up to 400000? But note that the function zeros(n) counts all multiples, so we can set an upper bound.\n\n            We can set an upper bound for the binary search. Since zeros(n) is increasing and we know m (at most 100000), we can set:\n\n                high = 5 * m   (but sometimes we need more, because of higher powers? Actually, the standard bound for trailing zeros is that zeros(n) >= n/5 (if we ignore higher powers, but actually the formula is more accurate). Alternatively, we can set high = 5 * m * 5? Or we can use:\n\n            Actually, we can set an initial high. Note that zeros(n) <= n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... < n/4.\n\n            So we require n/4 >= m  => n >= 4*m. But sometimes we might need a little more because of the floor divisions. Let's set:\n\n                high = 5 * m   (this might not be enough, because if m=100000, then 5*m=500000, and zeros(500000) is much larger than 100000). \n\n            Alternatively, we can set:\n\n                We know that zeros(n) >= n//5 + n//25 + ... and we want zeros(n) >= m.\n\n                We can set an upper bound: n_max = 5*m (but that might not be enough). Actually, we can set:\n\n                n_max = 5 * m   (but let's test: for m=1, 5*1=5 -> zeros(5)=1, which is correct. For m=5, we know the answer is 0, but we need to find the smallest n with zeros(n)>=5, which is 25. So 5*m=25? 5*5=25, so that works for m=5? \n\n                But wait: 5*m for m=5 is 25, and zeros(25)=6, which is >=5. So yes, 25 is the lower_bound for m=5. Then we try to find the smallest n for m+1=6: zeros(25)=6, so that is the lower_bound for m+1=6. Then the set for m=5 would be from 25 to 24? That doesn't make sense.\n\n            Actually, we must set an upper bound that is definitely beyond the point where zeros(n) >= m. Since zeros(n) is about n/5 (ignoring floors) we can set:\n\n                high = 5 * m * 5   (i.e., 25*m) but wait, for m=100000, 25*100000=2500000, which is acceptable.\n\n            Alternatively, we can set a safe upper bound:\n\n                Let n = 0\n                while zeros(n) < m:\n                    n *= 2\n                    if n > 10**18: break   # but m is only up to 100000, so we don't need to go that high.\n\n            But we can do without that.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Read m.\n\n            Step 2: Define function zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n            Step 3: Binary search for the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m. Call this low_bound.\n\n            Step 4: Binary search for the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m+1. Call this high_bound.\n\n            Then, the numbers n that satisfy the condition are from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n            However, if zeros(low_bound) != m, then there is no n with exactly m zeros. In fact, if zeros(low_bound) > m, then there is a gap (like m=5). Then the set is empty.\n\n            But note: the definition of low_bound is the smallest n with zeros(n)>=m. Then if zeros(low_bound) is greater than m, then we skipped m. So the set is empty.\n\n            Therefore, we can output:\n\n                k = (high_bound - low_bound)   [if there exists n with zeros(n)=m, then the set is non-empty]\n\n            But wait, how do we know the set is non-empty? We know that the set [low_bound, high_bound-1] has zeros(n)=m if and only if zeros(low_bound)==m and zeros(high_bound-1)==m and zeros(high_bound)>=m+1.\n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n                zeros(low_bound) >= m, and zeros(high_bound) >= m+1.\n\n            But note: we defined low_bound as the smallest n with zeros(n)>=m, so zeros(low_bound) is the first time we hit at least m. Then the condition for having exactly m is that zeros(low_bound)==m.\n\n            However, it is possible that zeros(low_bound) > m? Yes, as in the example m=5, low_bound=25 and zeros(25)=6>5.\n\n            So we must check: if zeros(low_bound) != m, then there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n            But note: what if m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't worry.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                low_bound = smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m\n                high_bound = smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m+1\n\n                Then if zeros(low_bound) != m:\n                    Then print \"0\"\n\n                Else:\n                    k = high_bound - low_bound\n                    Then we output k and then the numbers from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n            However, note: the example m=1:\n\n                zeros(5)=1 -> so low_bound=5, zeros(5)==1 -> yes.\n                Then we find high_bound: smallest n with zeros(n)>=2 -> n=10 (since zeros(9)=1, zeros(10)=2).\n\n                Then the numbers are from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\n            Example m=5:\n\n                low_bound = smallest n with zeros(n)>=5 -> n=25, zeros(25)=6 !=5 -> so we output 0.\n\n            Example m=6:\n\n                low_bound: smallest n with zeros(n)>=6 -> n=25 (zeros(25)=6) -> so low_bound=25.\n                Then we need to find the next jump: zeros(25)=6, so we look for zeros(n)>=7: \n                    n=26: zeros(26)=6, n=27:6, n=28:6, n=29:6, n=30:7 -> so high_bound=30.\n\n                Then the numbers are from 25 to 29, i.e., 5 numbers.\n\n            Example m=0 (though m>=1, but just for understanding):\n\n                m=0: \n                    zeros(0) is 0, so low_bound=0. Then we need zeros(n)>=1 -> n=5. Then the set is from 0 to 4, but note that the problem says positive integers n. So we must consider only n>=1.\n\n            But the problem states: positive integers n.\n\n            Our function zeros(n) for n=0 is 0, but we are searching for n>=1? Actually, the problem says positive integers, so n>=1.\n\n            We should adjust the binary search to start from 1? Or note that m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n            However, the problem says m>=1, so we can assume m>=1.\n\n            But note: our zeros(n) function: for n=0,1,2,3,4 returns 0. Then for m=1, we are looking for zeros(n)>=1, and the smallest n is 5.\n\n            So the code:\n\n                m = int(input().strip())\n\n                def zeros(n):\n                    if n == 0:\n                        return 0\n                    cnt = 0\n                    div = 5\n                    while div <= n:\n                        cnt += n // div\n                        div *= 5\n                    return cnt\n\n                # Binary search for the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m\n                lo, hi = 1, 5*m   # We set hi to 5*m, but wait: for m=100000, 5*m=500000, but zeros(500000) is about 100000/4? Actually, zeros(500000) = 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + ... = 124999 (approx). But we need to cover m=100000, so we need zeros(n)>=100000. We can set hi to 5*m, but sometimes 5*m might not be enough? \n\n                Actually, we can set hi = 5*m * 5   (to be safe) or use:\n\n                Alternatively, we can set hi = 5*m * 5  (so 25*m) but m=100000 -> 2500000, which is acceptable.\n\n                However, we can also set hi by doubling until we exceed m.\n\n                But since m is up to 100000, and the zeros(n) is about n/4, we can set hi = 4 * m * 5  (or 20*m) to be safe.\n\n                But let's think: the maximum n we need is the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m. The worst-case is when m is large and the last jump is from a power of 5. The zeros(n) function is O(log_5 n). \n\n                We can set:\n\n                    hi = 1\n                    while zeros(hi) < m:\n                        hi *= 2\n\n                Then we use this hi for the binary search.\n\n                But the problem says m can be up to 100000, and zeros(hi) for hi=5*m (which is 500000) is 124999, which is >100000, so we can set hi = 5*m.\n\n                However, to be safe, we can set hi = 5*m * 5, but that might be too high? Actually, 5*m*5 = 25*m, and for m=100000, that's 2500000, which is acceptable for binary search (log2(2500000) is about 22 steps).\n\n                But note: we are doing two binary searches (for m and for m+1). So we can do:\n\n                Steps:\n\n                    m_val = int(input().strip())\n                    # If m_val is very large, we need to set an upper bound.\n\n                    # Let's define a helper function for zeros(n)\n\n                    # Function for zeros(n) as above.\n\n                    # Now, we do two binary searches:\n\n                    # First, find the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m_val.\n\n                    lo, hi = 1, 5 * m_val * 5   # 25*m_val, which is 2500000 for m_val=100000.\n\n                    while lo < hi:\n                        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n                        if zeros(mid) >= m_val:\n                            hi = mid\n                        else:\n                            lo = mid + 1\n\n                    low_bound = lo\n\n                    # Now, if zeros(low_bound) != m_val, then there is no solution.\n\n                    # Then, we do the same for m_val+1.\n\n                    if zeros(low_bound) != m_val:\n                        print(0)\n                    else:\n                        # Now find the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m_val+1\n                        lo2, hi2 = 1, 5 * (m_val+1) * 5   # again, we can set hi2 = 5*(m_val+1)*5, but note: the previous hi was 25*m_val, and now m_val+1 is bigger, so we can set hi2 = max(hi, 5*(m_val+1)*5) but to be safe, we set hi2 = 5*(m_val+1)*5, but if m_val=100000, then 5*(100001)*5 is 2500025, which is acceptable.\n\n                        while lo2 < hi2:\n                            mid = (lo2 + hi2) // 2\n                            if zeros(mid) >= m_val+1:\n                                hi2 = mid\n                            else:\n                                lo2 = mid + 1\n\n                        high_bound = lo2\n\n                        # Then the numbers are from low_bound to high_bound-1, inclusive.\n\n                        k = high_bound - low_bound\n\n                        # Output\n                        print(k)\n                        # Then print the k numbers in increasing order.\n\n                        # But note: k might be 0?

Actually, we do: if zeros(low_bound)==m_val, then we enter the else branch. But if zeros(low_bound)==m_val, then we must have at least one number (low_bound) and then the next jump is at high_bound. Then k = high_bound - low_bound, which is at least 1? \n\n                        # But wait: if m_val=0, then zeros(0)=0, and we are looking for m_val=0, then the next jump (for m_val+1=1) is at n=5. Then k=5-0=5, but then we output 5 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4.

So we have to print the k integers in increasing order, one per integer? Or space separated?\n\n            The example output is: \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\" -> meaning the first line is the count (5) and the second line is the five numbers.\n\n            But wait, the example output format is two lines. \n\n            But the problem does not specify the exact format of the second line. It says \"print these k integers in increasing order\". We can print them in one line separated by spaces, or one per line? \n\n            The example output uses one line for the count and then one line for the numbers.\n\n            So:\n\n                if zeros(low_bound) != m_val:\n                    print(0)\n                else:\n                    # Compute high_bound\n                    # Then k = high_bound - low_bound\n                    print(k)\n                    # Now, if k>0, we want to print the numbers from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n                    # But wait, the problem says: print the k integers in increasing order.\n\n                    # We can do:\n                    #   print(\" \".join(str(x) for x in range(low_bound, high_bound)))\n                    # However, if k is very large (like 100000) then we are creating a list of 100000 integers and then converting to string. This might be acceptable for m up to 100000? \n\n                    # But note: the maximum k is 5 (as we saw for m=1,2,... until a gap) but wait: the set of numbers with the same number of trailing zeros is at most 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n                    # Why 5? Because the trailing zeros increase by one at each multiple of 5, except when the multiple is divisible by 25 (then it increases by two, etc.).

The next multiple of 5 is (n0 + (5 - (n0 % 5))) if n0%5!=0, then the next multiple is ceil(n0/5)*5. But wait, the zeros(n) increases at multiples of 5, so the next change is at the next multiple of 5 that is beyond n0.\n\n                    # However, we found the set by the next jump (for m+1) so the length is (high_bound - low_bound). \n\n                    # But note: the set is contiguous and the length is (high_bound - low_bound). \n\n                    # Example m=1: low_bound=5, high_bound=10, so k=5, and the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n                    # Example m=6: low_bound=25, high_bound=30, so k=5, numbers 25,26,27,28,29.\n\n                    # Example m=100000: if there is a gap, we output 0.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such integers \\( n \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is essentially the number of times 5 appears in the factorization of all numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is calculated by summing \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots \\) until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\) (lower bound) and the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the count is at least \\( m+1 \\) (upper bound). The valid integers \\( n \\) lie between these two bounds, inclusive of the lower bound and exclusive of the upper bound, provided the lower bound's trailing zeroes exactly match \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Checking Validity**: If the trailing zeroes at the lower bound do not equal \\( m \\), it means there is no integer \\( n \\) with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, and the answer is 0. Otherwise, the valid integers form a contiguous block from the lower bound to one less than the upper bound, and their count is \\( \\text{upper\\_bound} - \\text{lower\\_bound} \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef zeros(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    cnt = 0\n    div = 5\n    while div <= n:\n        cnt += n // div\n        div *= 5\n    return cnt\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m_val = int(data[0].strip())\n    \n    lo, hi = 1, 5 * m_val * 5\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if zeros(mid) >= m_val:\n            hi = mid\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n            \n    low_bound = lo\n    if zeros(low_bound) != m_val:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    lo2, hi2 = 1, 5 * (m_val + 1) * 5\n    while lo2 < hi2:\n        mid = (lo2 + hi2) // 2\n        if zeros(mid) >= m_val + 1:\n            hi2 = mid\n        else:\n            lo2 = mid + 1\n            \n    high_bound = lo2\n    k = high_bound - low_bound\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        numbers = [str(i) for i in range(low_bound, high_bound)]\n        print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `zeros(n)`**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by counting the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., up to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search Setup**: The main function reads the input value \\( m \\) and initializes binary search bounds. The initial high bound is set to \\( 5 \\times m \\times 5 \\) to ensure it covers all possible values of \\( n \\) that could have at least \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n\n3. **Finding Lower Bound**: The first binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\). If the trailing zeroes at this \\( n \\) do not exactly match \\( m \\), it prints 0 and exits.\n\n4. **Finding Upper Bound**: The second binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the trailing zeroes is at least \\( m+1 \\). The valid integers \\( n \\) are those from the lower bound to one less than this upper bound.\n\n5. **Output**: The count of valid integers \\( k \\) is printed, followed by the integers themselves if \\( k \\) is positive. The integers are listed in increasing order, separated by spaces.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search, leveraging mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes, and handles edge cases where no solution exists.",
