They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. For each edge (u, v), we are given two numbers: gcd and lcm.\n Conditions for an edge (a, b) with gcd = g and lcm = l:\n   We must have g | a and g | b, and also we must have a * b = g^2 * (l/g)^2? Actually, note that the relation between gcd and lcm is:\n   a * b = gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b)   [This is a known identity]\n\n However, note that the problem says: on every edge they wrote two numbers, the GCD and the LCM of the two lawn numbers.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check for each edge: \n      - The gcd must divide the lcm (since gcd divides both a and b, then gcd divides any linear combination, and in particular the lcm which is a multiple of the gcd). So if gcd does not divide lcm, then it's invalid.\n\n 2. For each edge, we can recover the two numbers a and b as divisors of the lcm, and such that gcd(a,b)=g and lcm(a,b)=l.\n    Actually, note: for a candidate pair (a, b) we must have:\n        a * b = g * l\n        and also, we must have that g divides a and g divides b.\n\n    But note: from the identity, we know that the product of the two numbers is g*l. However, there can be many pairs (a, b) such that gcd(a,b)=g and lcm(a,b)=l.\n\n    Alternatively, we can set:\n        Let a0 = a / g, b0 = b / g. Then gcd(a0, b0)=1 and lcm(a0, b0)=l/g. Also, a0 * b0 = (a*b)/(g*g) = (g*l)/(g*g) = l/g.\n\n    So we require that the two numbers a0 and b0 are coprime and their product is l/g. Then we can let a0 and b0 be factorizations of l/g into two coprime factors.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require us to recover the exact numbers uniquely. But we must assign numbers to all vertices so that for every edge (u, v) the conditions hold.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can try to use the following:\n\n   For each node, we will maintain the set (or the product) of prime factors? But note: the numbers can be up to 10^6 and there are up to 10^5 edges and 10^5 nodes.\n\n Alternatively, note the condition: for each edge (u, v) we have two numbers: g and l.\n\n We know that the number at node u must be divisible by g, and similarly for v. Moreover, the product of the two numbers must be g*l.\n\n But wait: the entire graph might be disconnected. However, note that the assignment must be consistent across edges.\n\n Another idea: assign to each node a value x_i. Then for each edge (i, j) we have:\n      gcd(x_i, x_j) = g, and lcm(x_i, x_j) = l, and note that x_i * x_j = g * l.\n\n However, the equation x_i * x_j = g * l is necessary because of the identity. But note: the identity holds for any two positive integers: a * b = gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b).\n\n Therefore, we can use the equation: x_i * x_j = g * l for each edge.\n\n Now, consider: what constraints does the graph impose?\n\n   If we have two edges (u, v) and (v, w), then we have:\n        x_u * x_v = g1 * l1\n        x_v * x_w = g2 * l2\n\n   Then x_u * x_w = (g1 * l1 * g2 * l2) / (x_v^2) ? Not exactly, but note that we don't know x_v.\n\n However, we can also note: the value at node v must be such that it divides the product from two different edges. But we can also use the fact that the gcd and lcm conditions must hold.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. For each edge, check that g divides l (otherwise output \"NO\").\n 2. Then, for each edge, we can set:\n        base_value = g\n        remaining_product = l // g   # This is the product of the two numbers divided by g^2? Actually, no: \n        But note: if we write x_i = g * a_i, x_j = g * b_j, then we have:\n            gcd(g*a_i, g*b_j) = g * gcd(a_i, b_j) = g   => gcd(a_i, b_j)=1.\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign numbers of mushrooms to each lawn in a forest such that for every given road (edge) between two lawns (vertices), the GCD and LCM of the numbers on those lawns match the provided values. The solution involves verifying consistency across all edges and ensuring that the assigned numbers satisfy all given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires assigning numbers to vertices such that for each edge, the GCD and LCM of the connected vertices match the given values. The key insight is leveraging the mathematical identity that for any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a \\times b = \\text{GCD}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\\). This identity allows us to derive potential values for the vertices based on the edge constraints.\n\n2. **Edge Validation**: For each edge, check if the given GCD divides the LCM. If not, the arrangement is impossible, and we return \"NO\".\n\n3. **Graph Processing**: Use a graph traversal approach (like BFS or DFS) to process edges incrementally. For each vertex, maintain a set of candidate numbers derived from the edges incident to it. The candidate numbers must be divisors of the product \\(g \\times l\\) (from the edge constraints) and must satisfy the GCD condition with adjacent vertices.\n\n4. **Consistency Check**: During traversal, ensure that all candidate numbers for a vertex are consistent. If at any point a conflict arises (i.e., no common candidate number satisfies all edge constraints for a vertex), the arrangement is impossible.\n\n5. **Solution Construction**: If all constraints are satisfied, output the candidate numbers for each vertex. If multiple valid assignments exist, any one can be chosen.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    edges = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(m):\n        u = int(data[index]); v = int(data[index+1]); g_val = int(data[index+2]); l_val = int(data[index+3])\n        index += 4\n        edges.append((u-1, v-1, g_val, l_val))\n        \n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for u, v, g_val, l_val in edges:\n        graph[u].append((v, g_val, l_val))\n        graph[v].append((u, g_val, l_val))\n        \n    candidates = [set() for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        candidates[i].add(1)\n        \n    for u, v, g_val, l_val in edges:\n        base = g_val\n        prod = l_val // g_val\n        if l_val % g_val != 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n        total_prod = base * base * prod\n        \n        candidates[u].add(total_prod // (base * g_val))\n        candidates[v].add(total_prod // (base * g_val))\n        \n    visited = [False] * n\n    q = deque()\n    for i in range(n):\n        if len(candidates[i]) == 1:\n            start = i\n            visited[i] = True\n            q.append(i)\n            \n    while q:\n        node = q.popleft()\n        for neighbor, g_val, l_val in graph[node]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                continue\n            base = g_val\n            prod_val = l_val // base\n            total_prod = base * base * prod_val\n            cand_neighbor = total_prod // (base * g_val)\n            if cand_neighbor not in candidates[neighbor]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n                \n            visited[neighbor] = True\n            q.append(neighbor)\n            \n    ans = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if len(candidates[i]) > 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n        ans.append(str(list(candidates[i])[0]))\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n    print(\" \".join(ans))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of vertices \\(n\\) and edges \\(m\\). Each edge is stored with its GCD and LCM values.\n2. **Graph Construction**: A graph is built where each vertex points to its connected edges along with the GCD and LCM values.\n3. **Candidate Initialization**: For each vertex, a set of candidate numbers is initialized. Initially, only the number 1 is considered as a candidate.\n4. **Edge Processing**: For each edge, the product \\(g \\times l\\) is computed. The candidate numbers for the connected vertices are updated to include divisors derived from this product.\n5. **Consistency Check**: Using BFS, vertices with single candidate numbers are processed first. For each neighbor, the candidate numbers are checked against the edge constraints. If any inconsistency is found, the solution is deemed impossible.\n6. **Output**: If all checks pass, the candidate numbers for each vertex are printed. If any vertex has more than one candidate, the solution is invalid, and \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the feasibility of the mushroom count assignment by leveraging graph traversal and mathematical constraints, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
