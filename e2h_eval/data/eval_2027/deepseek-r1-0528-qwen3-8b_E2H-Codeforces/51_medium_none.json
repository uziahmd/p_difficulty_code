Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to combine the first two lines (guest's name and host's name) and then check if the sorted letters of the combined string match the sorted letters of the pile, but also ensuring that there are no extra letters.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines.\n 2. Concatenate the first two lines (without any spaces or other characters, as the problem states only uppercase letters and no empty lines).\n 3. Compare the sorted version of the concatenated string with the sorted version of the third string.\n\n However, note: the example input has multiple test cases? Actually, the example provided is a list of three different examples. But the problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as:\n ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n This seems to be three separate test cases? Actually, the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning one test case per run?\n\n Let me clarify: the problem statement says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we are to read three lines.\n\n However, the example output is a list of three strings: ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'].\n\n So, the example input actually has three test cases? But the problem says each line length <=100 and the input has three lines.\n\n Actually, looking at the example input: \n   Input: \n      SANTACLAUS\n      DEDMOROZ\n      SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Then another test case? \n\n Wait, the example input is provided as a single string in the example, but the problem says:\n\n   Input:\n     The input file consists of three lines: ...\n\n And then they give an example with three lines. But then the example output is three answers? \n\n Actually, the example input is just one example. The problem says the input file has three lines. So we are to process one test case.\n\n But the example output is three letters: YES, NO, NO. That suggests the example provided is showing three different inputs, but the problem says \"the input file\" (singular) with three lines.\n\n I think the example input format is one test case: three lines. However, the example shows three test cases. \n\n Let me read the problem again: \n   \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n   Input: \n      The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\n So, for one test case, we have three lines.\n\n But then the example input is given as a list of three different examples. \n\n How should we handle this? \n\n Actually, the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning one set of three lines. But the example input is provided in a way that it includes three test cases? \n\n Let me check the example input: \n   Example Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Example Output: \n        YES\n\n   Then they show two more test cases and their outputs.\n\n So, the problem expects one test case per run.\n\n However, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, which might be three test cases. \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\". So if we are reading from stdin, we read three lines.\n\n Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one test case.\n\n Therefore, the code should read three lines and then output either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n Steps for one test case:\n   - Read the first line (guest_name)\n   - Read the second line (host_name)\n   - Read the third line (pile)\n\n   - Combine guest_name and host_name to form the expected string.\n   - Check if the sorted(expected_string) equals the sorted(pile)\n\n But note: what if there are extra letters? Then the sorted pile would be longer than the sorted expected string.\n\n So, we can do:\n\n   expected = guest_name + host_name\n   pile_str = third_line\n\n   If the length of expected != length of pile_str, then output \"NO\"\n\n   Otherwise, compare the sorted(expected) and sorted(pile_str)\n\n Alternatively, we can sort both and then compare.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   expected = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   pile_str = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But wait, the example input for the third line is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is the same as the combined string? \n\n   Actually, let me count:\n\n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> 10 letters\n   Host: DEDMOROZ -> 8 letters\n   Combined: 18 letters.\n\n   Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> let's count: \n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 18 letters.\n\n   Now, sorting expected and the pile should give the same.\n\n   But note: the example input has the third line as \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", but the example output is \"YES\".\n\n   However, note that the example input provided in the problem statement is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a string that has three lines? Actually, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, but each string is one test case.\n\n   This is confusing because the problem says the input has three lines (one test case). \n\n   Clarification from the problem: the example output is a list of three strings, but that example output corresponds to three separate inputs.\n\n   Since the problem says the input file consists of three lines (so one test case), we will write code for one test case.\n\n   But if the problem intended multiple test cases, then we would need to adjust.\n\n   Looking at the example output: \n        ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   This suggests that the input is actually three test cases, each with three lines. \n\n   However, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning one set of three lines.\n\n   Let me re-read the problem statement: \n        \"The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\"\n\n   This is for one test case.\n\n   But then why is the example input given as a list of three test cases? \n\n   It appears the example input is showing three independent examples. \n\n   The problem does not specify the number of test cases. \n\n   However, the constraints say the length of each line does not exceed 100, but nothing about the number of test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement says \"The input file consists of three lines\", we must assume one test case.\n\n   But the example output has three answers. \n\n   After reading the problem statement again, note that the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is actually three separate test cases, each being a string that has three lines? \n\n   Actually, each element of the list is a string that contains three lines (with newline characters). \n\n   But wait, the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n   This confusion arises because the example input is provided as a list of three strings, and each string is a representation of a test case that itself has three lines.\n\n   However, the actual input for one test case would be three lines, not a single string containing three newlines.\n\n   Let me look at the sample input format:\n\n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   So, if we are to read from stdin, we would do:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n   Then, we check if the sorted(guest+host) equals sorted(pile) and that len(guest)+len(host) == len(pile).\n\n   But note: the example second test case:\n\n        Input: \n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Expected: NO\n\n        Why? \n        Expected string: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\" (length: 9 + 9 = 18)\n        Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" (length: let's count: J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I -> 20 letters)\n\n        So, the pile has 20 letters, while expected is 18 -> so we output \"NO\".\n\n   Similarly, the third test case:\n\n        Input: \n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Expected: NO\n\n        Let me check: \n            Guest: \"BABBONATALE\" -> 11 letters\n            Host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> 14 letters\n            Combined: 25 letters.\n\n        Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> count: \n            B A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R -> \n            Let me break it down: \n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n            Without counting manually, we know the example says NO because there's an extra letter.\n\n        Actually, the example says \"there's an extra letter 'L'\", meaning the pile has an extra 'L' and possibly missing a letter? \n\n        But note: the example says \"In the third sample there's an extra letter 'L'.\" \n\n        However, the combined string (guest+host) has a certain frequency of letters. The pile must have exactly the same frequency.\n\n        In the third sample, the expected string is \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\". \n\n        Now, let's count the letters in the expected string and the pile:\n\n        Expected: \n            B: 3 (from BAB and then one in BONATALE? Actually, BABBONATALE has two B's at the beginning and one in BONATALE? \n            Let me write: \n                BABBONATALE -> B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E -> so B:3, A:3, ... \n            Actually, let me do it properly:\n\n            Expected: BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\n            But wait, the example input for the third test case is:\n\n                BABBONATALE\n                FATHERCHRISTMAS\n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            So, expected string = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n            Now, the pile is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            We can compare the sorted expected and sorted pile.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"There's an extra letter 'L'\", meaning the pile has one more 'L' than the expected string.\n\n        So, we can do:\n\n            if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                if sorted(guest+host) == sorted(pile):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        This will work.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read three lines.\n   Step 2: Strip any extra whitespace (like newline) from the lines.\n   Step 3: Combine the first two.\n   Step 4: Check the length of the combined string and the third string.\n   Step 5: If lengths differ, output \"NO\".\n   Step 6: Else, sort both the combined string and the third string and compare.\n\n   Example 1: \n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\", host = \"DEDMOROZ\", pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n        combined = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> 10+8=18\n        pile length = 18 -> proceed to sort.\n\n        Sort combined: sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\") -> sorted string of 18 letters.\n        Sort pile: sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\") -> same sorted string.\n\n        Output \"YES\"\n\n   Example 2:\n        guest = \"PAPAINOEL\", host = \"JOULUPUKKI\", pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n        combined length = 9+9=18, pile length = 20 -> output \"NO\"\n\n   Example 3:\n        guest = \"BABBONATALE\", host = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", pile = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n        combined length = 11+14=25, pile length = 25 -> same length, but let's check the letters.\n\n        However, the example says there's an extra 'L'. Actually, the example input for the pile is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Count of 'L' in the combined string: \n            In \"BABBONATALE\": \n                BABBONATALE: L appears once (at the end)\n            In \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\":\n                FATHERCHRISTMAS: L appears once (in CHRISTMAS? No, there's no L in CHRISTMAS, but wait: \n                Actually, \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\": \n                    F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S -> no L.\n\n            So total L in expected: 1.\n\n        In the pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n            Let's break it down: \n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            There are two L's in \"ALLE\": one in \"ALLE\" and one in the original \"L\" from the guest? Actually, the guest is \"BABBONATALE\", which has an 'L'. Then the pile has \"BONATALLE\", which has two L's.\n\n            So the pile has 2 L's, but expected has 1 -> so the sorted strings will be different.\n\n        Therefore, we output \"NO\".\n\n   So the code:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n        if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a list of three test cases, but the problem says one test case. \n\n   But the problem statement example output is three answers. \n\n   This implies that the example input is actually three test cases, each being three lines.\n\n   How can we handle multiple test cases?\n\n   The problem does not specify the number of test cases. \n\n   Looking at the constraints: the input file consists of three lines (for one test case). \n\n   But the example input is provided as three separate test cases (each test case having three lines). \n\n   Since the problem statement says \"The input file consists of three lines\", we assume one test case.\n\n   However, the example input format in the problem is ambiguous.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is a list of three strings, each string being a concatenation of three lines (with newlines). \n\n   This is unusual for standard competitive programming problems. Usually, the input is one test case.\n\n   But the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we are reading three lines.\n\n   However, if the judge runs the program with multiple test cases (i.e., multiple sets of three lines) then we would need to read until EOF.\n\n   The problem does not specify that. \n\n   Given the ambiguity, let me assume that the input is one test case (three lines). \n\n   But the example output is three answers. \n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be designed to have multiple test cases, but the input format is described for one test case.\n\n   Since the constraints say the length of each line <= 100, and the example input is given as three test cases, we must consider the possibility of multiple test cases.\n\n   However, the problem statement says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we are to read three lines.\n\n   But wait, if the input file has three lines, then we read three lines and process one test case.\n\n   How did the example output become three answers? \n\n   I think the example input was meant to be three separate runs. \n\n   So, if the user runs the program three times, then they get three answers.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem intended to have multiple test cases, but the input format is described incorrectly.\n\n   Since the problem is from a competition, and the example input is provided as a list of three, but the problem says three lines, I will write the code for one test case.\n\n   If the input is multiple test cases, we would need to read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem says the input file consists of three lines. \n\n   Let me check: the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning one test case.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   But the example output is three answers. \n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input and output.\n\n   The example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   And the output is:\n\n        ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   This example input is actually three test cases, each test case represented by a string that contains three lines (with newline characters). \n\n   So, the input file for three test cases would be:\n\n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   But note: the example input string is given without spaces between the test cases. \n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, but when reading from stdin, we cannot have multiple test cases without knowing the number.\n\n   The problem statement says the input file consists of three lines (for one test case). \n\n   I think the example is showing three independent examples, but the actual input is one test case.\n\n   Therefore, I will write the code for one test case.\n\n   However, if we are to support multiple test cases (as the example output has three answers), we must read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n   There are two possibilities:\n\n   Possibility 1: The input file has three lines (one test case) and we output one answer.\n\n   Possibility 2: The input file has multiple test cases, each test case consisting of three lines, and we output one answer per test case until EOF.\n\n   How can we know? \n\n   The problem statement does not specify.\n\n   But note: the constraints say the length of each line does not exceed 100, but nothing about the number of test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement says \"The input file consists of three lines\", we assume one test case.\n\n   But the example input is provided as three test cases. \n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   Let me look at the problem source: it is from a competition. \n\n   In many competitions, problems can have multiple test cases. \n\n   The typical way is to read until EOF.\n\n   However, the problem says \"three lines\", so if we are to read three lines and then stop, then we are done.\n\n   But the example input is given as three test cases, so perhaps the input is given with three lines per test case, and the entire input has three test cases (each test case being three lines) so total 9 lines.\n\n   But the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each string being three lines (with newline characters). \n\n   How would we read that? \n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as a string that contains three lines, but the problem says the input file has three lines (without the newline characters). \n\n   I'm getting confused.\n\n   Let me try to interpret the problem as follows:\n\n   The problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning the entire input file has three lines. \n\n   Then the example input is one test case, and the output is one answer.\n\n   But the example output is shown as three answers, which is for three test cases.\n\n   This suggests that the example input is not the entire input file, but rather three separate examples.\n\n   Therefore, I must assume that the actual input may contain multiple test cases.\n\n   How to handle multiple test cases?\n\n   We can read until EOF. The problem says each line length <=100, and the input file has three lines per test case.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the input file consists of three lines. \n\n   If the input file consists of three lines, then we read three lines and that's one test case.\n\n   But if the input file has more than three lines, then we must read three lines, then process, then continue until EOF.\n\n   However, the problem statement does not specify.\n\n   Another approach: the problem says the input file has three lines. So we read three lines and output one answer.\n\n   But then the example input is three test cases, so they must have provided three test cases in the input file.\n\n   This is inconsistent.\n\n   I decide to follow the problem statement literally: read three lines and output one answer.\n\n   If the competition judge provides multiple test cases, then the input file will have 3 * n lines.\n\n   But the problem statement says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   After further thought, I think the problem statement example input is just illustrating the problem, and the actual input for the judge will be one test case (three lines). \n\n   Therefore, we output one answer.\n\n   But the example output is three answers. \n\n   This is likely a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the constraints do not specify the number of test cases, I will write code that works for one test case.\n\n   If the judge runs the program with multiple test cases, we would need to read until EOF, but the problem says three lines.\n\n   To be safe, I'll assume one test case.\n\n   Code for one test case:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n        if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, if the judge provides multiple test cases, we would need to change the reading method.\n\n   But the problem says three lines, so we read three lines.\n\n   Let me submit the code for one test case.\n\n   If the judge provides multiple test cases, then the above code will fail because after the first test case, there are still more lines.\n\n   But the problem says the input file consists of three lines, so the judge should provide one test case.\n\n   We'll go with that.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as three test cases. \n\n   This is a known issue. \n\n   I'll write the code as described.\n\n   However, note: the example input is provided as a string that contains three lines (each test case). \n\n   But if the judge provides three test cases, then the input file has 9 lines (three test cases, each three lines). \n\n   So, the problem statement is incorrect.\n\n   Since the problem statement says three lines, and the example input is three test cases (which would be 9 lines), I think the problem intended to say that each test case has three lines.\n\n   But the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning the entire input file has three lines.\n\n   This is very confusing.\n\n   I decide to ask for clarification, but since I cannot, I will assume the input has exactly three lines (one test case).\n\n   If the judge provides more than three lines, the program may read beyond the intended three.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read exactly three lines and ignore the rest. \n\n   But the problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   I'll stick to the literal interpretation.\n\n   Code:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n        if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But note: the example input uses uppercase letters. We are using strip() to remove newline, but the input may have newline characters. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        guest = input().replace('\\n', '')\n        host = input().replace('\\n', '')\n        pile = input().replace('\\n', '')\n\n   But strip() removes any whitespace, and the problem says only uppercase letters and no empty lines. \n\n   It's safer to use strip().\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n\n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\", host = \"DEDMOROZ\", pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Example 2 and 3 are handled by the length check.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   However, if there are spaces in the input? The problem says \"only uppercase Latin letters\", so no spaces. \n\n   We are safe.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n        total_length = len(guest) + len(host)\n        if total_length != len(pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            # Sort the combined guest and host names, and the pile\n            if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, the example input for the third test case has a pile string that is 25 letters, and the expected is 25, so we don't catch the extra 'L' by length, but by sorting.\n\n   That is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input for the second test case is caught by length (18 vs 20) so we output \"NO\".\n\n   This matches.\n\n   We'll submit this.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input file consists of three lines. \n\n   We read three lines.\n\n   This should be correct.\n\n   However, if the input has more than three lines, then our program will read the first three and ignore the rest. \n\n   But the problem says the input file consists of three lines, so we assume three.\n\n   If the judge provides three lines, we are good.\n\n   Let me hope.\n\n   If the judge provides multiple test cases (each three lines), then the program will only process the first three lines and then stop, which is not what we want.\n\n   But the problem statement says three lines, so we do as stated.\n\n   End of reasoning.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name without any extra or missing letters. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Check Lengths:** First, we check if the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. If not, it's immediately impossible to form the names from the pile, so we output \"NO\".\n3. **Compare Sorted Strings:** If the lengths match, we sort the combined letters of the guest's and host's names and compare them with the sorted letters of the pile. If both sorted strings are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the names, so we output \"YES\". Otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the possibility by leveraging sorting to handle permutations and length comparison to ensure no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    total_length = len(guest) + len(host)\n    if total_length != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines of input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Length Check:** The combined length of the guest's and host's names is compared to the length of the pile. If they don't match, the answer is \"NO\" because there are either extra or missing letters.\n3. **Sorting and Comparison:** If the lengths match, the code sorts the concatenated string of the guest's and host's names and compares it to the sorted pile string. If they match, it means the pile contains exactly the right letters in the right quantities, so the answer is \"YES\". Otherwise, the answer is \"NO\".\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine if the pile can be rearranged to form the required names by leveraging simple string operations and comparisons.",
