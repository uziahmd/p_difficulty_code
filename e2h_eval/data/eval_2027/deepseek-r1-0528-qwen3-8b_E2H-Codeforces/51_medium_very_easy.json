Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to combine the first two lines (guest's name and host's name) and then check if the sorted list of letters in the combined string is the same as the sorted list of letters in the third line (the pile).\n However, note: the example input is given as a list of strings for multiple test cases? Actually, the problem states that the input file consists of three lines. But the example provided is a list of three inputs and outputs.\n\n But wait, the example input format is shown as:\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n However, looking at the problem statement, the input consists of three lines. So we are going to read three lines.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line (guest's name)\n 2. Read the second line (host's name)\n 3. Read the third line (pile)\n\n Then, combine the first two lines into one string and remove any spaces (if present). Similarly, process the third line by removing spaces.\n\n Alternatively, note the example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n But wait, the example input has three lines, but the third line is a single string without newlines? Actually, the example shows that the third line is provided as a string.\n\n However, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n So, we can do:\n\n   guest = input().strip()\n   host = input().strip()\n   pile = input().strip()\n\n Then, let total_string = guest + host\n And we need to check if the frequency of each letter in total_string is the same as in pile.\n\n But note: the example input may have been given as a list of three strings, but actually the sample input is just three lines.\n\n Example: \n   Input:\n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n However, the example output is YES.\n\n Approach:\n   - We can count the frequency of each character in the combined string (guest+host) and compare with the frequency in the pile.\n\n But note: the example second sample input is:\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n Output: NO\n\n Why? Because there is an extra letter 'L' and missing a 'P'? Let me check:\n\n   Guest: PAPAINOEL -> letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L\n   Host: JOULUPUKKI -> letters: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I\n\n   Combined: \n        P: 2 (from guest) + 1 (from host) = 3\n        A: 2\n        I: 2\n        N: 1\n        O: 2\n        E: 1\n        L: 1\n        J: 1\n        U: 3\n        K: 2\n\n   Now, the pile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI -> wait, let's break down the pile string (without spaces) and count:\n\n   But the sample input for the second case is provided as a string in the list: \n        'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'\n\n   Actually, the example input for the second sample is:\n\n        ['PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', ...]\n\n   But wait, the problem says the input is three lines. So the three lines are:\n\n        Line1: \"PAPAINOEL\"\n        Line2: \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n        Line3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   However, the example output is 'NO'. \n\n   Let me count the letters in the pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   Break it down: \n        J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I\n\n   Now, let's count:\n\n        J:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n   Compare with the combined guest and host:\n\n        Expected: \n          P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:3, K:2\n\n        In the pile: \n          P:2 (but expected 3), A:2 (ok), I:2 (ok), N:1 (ok), O:2 (ok), E:1 (ok), L:3 (expected 1), J:1 (ok), U:3 (ok), K:2 (ok).\n\n   So the issue is that the pile has one less 'P' and one more 'L' than expected.\n\n   Therefore, we can use:\n\n        if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the lengths must be the same. We can also check the length first.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        s1 = ''.join(input().split())   # but the input doesn't have spaces? The problem says uppercase letters and no spaces?\n        Actually, the problem says: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" and the example has no spaces.\n\n        So, we can simply strip and then compare.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        s_combined = input().strip() + input().strip()\n        s_pile = input().strip()\n\n        if len(s_combined) != len(s_pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(s_combined) == sorted(s_pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, what if the input has multiple words? The problem says: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\"\n\n   So, no spaces. We can safely use strip.\n\n   However, the example input is provided with \\n, so we should use strip to remove newline characters.\n\n   But note: the input() function in Python by default returns a string without the trailing newline? Actually, input() reads a line and returns it without the trailing newline.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        guest_name = input().strip()\n        host_name = input().strip()\n        letters = input().strip()\n\n        if len(guest_name + host_name) != len(letters):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(guest_name + host_name) == sorted(letters):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let's test with the first example:\n\n        guest_name = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        host_name = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        letters = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Combined length: 11 + 8 = 19\n        Length of letters: 19\n\n        Now, sort both:\n\n        Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> sort: \n            A,A,C,D,D,E,L,M,N,O,R,S,T,U,Z? Actually, we need to sort the entire string.\n\n        But note: the example pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is the same letters as the combined? \n\n        Let me break down the combined: \n            Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> Wait, actually the guest name is \"SANTACLAUS\": \n                S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> 10 letters? Actually, \"SANTACLAUS\" has 10 letters.\n\n        Wait, the example input says:\n\n            Input: \n                SANTACLAUS\n                DEDMOROZ\n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        So:\n\n            Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> 10 letters\n            Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> 8 letters\n            Combined: 18 letters.\n\n        The pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> let's count: \n            S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S -> 18 letters.\n\n        Now, sort the combined and the pile.\n\n        Combined: \n            SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ -> letters: \n            A: 3, C:1, D:2, E:1, L:1, M:1, N:1, O:1, R:1, S:2, T:1, U:1, Z:1\n\n        Pile: \n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> same set? \n            A:3, C:1, D:2, E:1, L:1, M:1, N:1, O:2, R:1, S:2, T:1, U:1, Z:1\n\n        Wait, the pile has two O's? But the combined has only one O (from the host: DEDMOROZ -> one O) and the guest: SANTACLAUS -> no O? Actually, wait:\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> no O.\n        Host: DEDMOROZ -> D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z -> two O's.\n\n        So combined: two O's.\n\n        Then the pile should have two O's. But the pile string: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> \n            S,A,N,T,A,M,O,R,O,Z,D,E,D,C,L,A,U,S -> indeed two O's.\n\n        So the example first sample is correct.\n\n        But wait, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n        This is confusing because the example input string includes the word \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" which is the same as the combined? \n\n        Actually, the example input is three lines:\n\n            Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n            Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n            Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        So the code above should work.\n\n   However, the second example:\n\n        Input: \n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        We already saw that the counts don't match.\n\n   Third example:\n\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Let's check:\n\n            Guest: BABBONATALE -> 11 letters\n            Host: FATHERCHRISTMAS -> 14 letters\n            Combined: 25 letters.\n\n            Pile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> count the letters.\n\n            Without counting, let's check the length: \n                Combined: 11+14=25\n                Pile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> we can count the characters.\n\n            But note: the example output is NO.\n\n            There is an extra letter? The problem says: \"there's an extra letter 'L'\", meaning the pile has an extra 'L'. \n\n            So the length of the pile is 26? Then our length check will fail.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            if len(guest_name + host_name) != len(letters):\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                if sorted(guest_name + host_name) == sorted(letters):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        This will catch the third example because the length of the pile would be 26 (since there's an extra letter) and the combined is 25.\n\n   So, we can rely on the length check first.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the example input might have been provided with spaces? The problem says: \"contain only uppercase Latin letters\". So no spaces.\n\n   However, the example input in the problem is given as a string with '\\n' which we are reading as separate lines.\n\n   Code:\n\n        def main():\n            guest = input().strip()\n            host = input().strip()\n            pile = input().strip()\n\n            if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                # We can use collections.Counter for efficiency? But the string length is at most 100, so sorting is acceptable.\n                # Alternatively, we can use Counter from collections, but the problem doesn't require external libraries and sorting is simple.\n                if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the combined length is at most 200, and sorting 200 elements is efficient.\n\n   But note: the example input might have multiple lines with spaces? The problem says \"contain only uppercase Latin letters\", so no spaces.\n\n   We are using strip to remove any accidental newline or trailing spaces, but the problem says no spaces.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n   Example 1:\n\n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        len(guest)+len(host) = 10+8 = 18, len(pile)=18 -> YES.\n\n   Example 2:\n\n        guest = \"PAPAINOEL\"\n        host = \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n        pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        len(guest)+len(host)=9+11=20, len(pile)=? Let's count \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\": \n            J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I -> 19 letters? Actually, let me write it:\n\n            J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> 19.\n\n        So 20 != 19 -> NO.\n\n   Example 3:\n\n        guest = \"BABBONATALE\"\n        host = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n        pile = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        len(guest)=11, host=14 -> 25, pile: count the letters in \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Let me break it down:\n\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Counting manually: \n            B: appears 3 times (at the start) -> then in BONATALLE: another B? Actually, the string is:\n\n            B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R -> wait, that's not the right way.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            len(\"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\") = ?\n\n            Let me copy and count: \n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            It has 26 characters.\n\n            So 25 != 26 -> NO.\n\n        Therefore, the examples are handled.\n\n   However, wait: the example input for the third sample is:\n\n        ['BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        But note: the problem example input is given as a list of three strings. The third string is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\", which has 26 letters.\n\n        So the code will output \"NO\".\n\n   But the example output for the third sample is 'NO'.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input in the problem is provided as a list of three strings for the entire set of test cases? Actually, the problem says the input file consists of three lines. \n\n   But the example input is given as a list of three elements (each being a string) and then a list of outputs. That seems to be just an example representation.\n\n   Our code reads three lines.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the input file may contain multiple test cases? Actually, the problem statement says:\n\n        The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\n\n   So only one test case.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n        if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, there is an alternative: use a frequency counter. Since the problem is small, either is fine.\n\n   But note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the total length is at most 200, and sorting is O(n log n) which is acceptable.\n\n   Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   Example 3:\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   All correct.\n\n   However, the problem example input was given as a list of three strings, but we are reading three lines.\n\n   But note: the example input in the problem is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is just a representation. In reality, we are reading three lines.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   But wait, what if the names have different cases? The problem says uppercase, so we are safe.\n\n   Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the lengths of the combined names must match the length of the pile, and the frequency of each letter in the combined names must exactly match the frequency of each letter in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read three lines from the input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Length Check**: First, check if the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. If not, it's immediately impossible to form the names from the pile, so we output \"NO\".\n3. **Frequency Check**: If the lengths match, proceed to verify that the sorted combined string of the guest's and host's names is identical to the sorted pile. This ensures that both the presence and count of each letter match exactly between the combined names and the pile. If they match, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        combined = guest + host\n        if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three lines of input, stripping any extraneous whitespace or newline characters.\n2. **Length Check**: The combined length of the guest's and host's names is compared to the length of the pile. If they differ, the answer is \"NO\" because there are either missing or extra letters.\n3. **Frequency Check**: By sorting the combined string of the guest's and host's names and comparing it to the sorted pile, the code checks if both sequences contain exactly the same letters in the same quantities.
