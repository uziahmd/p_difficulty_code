A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total milliliters of drink: total_drink = k * l\n    Each toast requires nl milliliters. So, the number of toasts from drink = total_drink // nl\n\n 2. Calculate the total lime slices: total_lime_slices = c * d\n    Each toast requires 1 slice. So, the number of toasts from lime = total_lime_slices\n\n 3. Calculate the salt requirement: Each toast requires np grams. The available salt is p grams.\n    So, the number of toasts from salt = p // np\n\n 4. The limiting factor is the minimum of these three values.\n\n 5. However, note that each friend must have the same amount and we are making toasts per friend.\n    But the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n\n    Actually, the problem states: \"the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\n    Let T be the total number of toasts (each toast is consumed by one friend). Then each friend makes T_friend = T / n? \n    But wait: the toasts are made by the group. Actually, each toast is shared among the friends? \n\n    Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters ... for a toast\". This means that for each toast that a friend makes, they use nl ml, a lime slice, and np grams of salt.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"they all drink the same amount\", meaning that if we let x be the number of toasts per friend, then the total toasts is x * n.\n\n    Therefore, the total drink needed is x * n * nl, which must be <= k * l.\n    Similarly, total lime needed is x * n * 1 (since each toast requires one lime slice) -> but wait, each toast requires one lime slice, and each friend makes x toasts, so total lime slices needed is x * n.\n    And salt needed is x * n * np.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think: \n        Total toasts T = x * n (each of the n friends makes x toasts)\n\n        Conditions:\n          T * nl <= k * l   => x * n * nl <= k * l  => x <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n          T * 1 <= c * d    => x * n * 1 <= c * d   => x <= (c * d) / n\n          T * np <= p       => x * n * np <= p      => x <= p / (n * np)\n\n    Then x is the minimum of these three, and we take the floor (since we can't make a fraction of a toast).\n\n    But note: the example: \n        Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n        Here, n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        Condition 1: x <= (4*5) / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> floor to 2\n        Condition 2: x <= (10*8)/3 = 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> floor to 26\n        Condition 3: x <= 100/(3*1) = 100/3 ≈ 33.33 -> floor to 33\n\n        Then x = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n    However, the example output is 2.\n\n    But wait, in the example explanation they did:\n        Overall drink: 20 ml -> toasts from drink: 20 // 3 = 6 (because each toast requires 3 ml) -> but note: 6 toasts would require 18 ml, which is less than 20, so 6 is correct.\n        Then they divided by the number of friends: 6/3 = 2.\n\n    But note: the example explanation does not use the condition on the total toasts being x*n. They computed the maximum toasts from each resource independently and then took the minimum and divided by the number of friends.\n\n    Why is that the same?\n\n    Explanation of the two approaches:\n\n    Approach 1 (as per the problem's explanation):\n        Let T_total = total number of toasts (across all friends) = x * n.\n\n        Then we have three constraints:\n          T",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to find the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, and then compute the number of toasts per friend based on the most restrictive resource.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make considering three constraints: the total milliliters of drink, the number of lime slices, and the available salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of these resources, and all friends must drink the same amount.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total amount of each resource available.\n   - Determining how many toasts can be made from each resource individually.\n   - Identifying the smallest number of toasts possible (the limiting factor).\n   - Dividing this number by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves straightforward arithmetic operations to compute the total resources and then the minimum number of toasts possible. The solution efficiently checks all constraints and selects the smallest valid value.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and comparisons, which are constant time operations, making it very efficient with O(1) time complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    max_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n    \n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices\n    \n    max_toasts_salt = p // np\n    \n    min_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n    \n    result = min_toasts // n\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters needed per toast, and grams of salt needed per toast.\n2. **Calculating Total Resources**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Multiplied by the number of bottles and milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Multiplied by the number of limes and slices per lime.\n   - **Salt**: Divided by the salt required per toast.\n3. **Finding the Limiting Factor**: The smallest number of toasts possible across all resources is determined using the `min` function.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The number of toasts per friend is found by dividing the total toasts by the number of friends.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make without exceeding any resource constraint.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected and the solution is both efficient and easy to understand.",
