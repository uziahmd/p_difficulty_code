The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are only allowed to use a key j on a chest i if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys by parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chestes:\n     Even: E_chest = [x for x in a if x % 2 == 0]\n     Odd: O_chest = [x for x in a if x % 2 == 1]\n\n   Keys:\n     Even: E_key = [x for x in b if x % 2 == 0]\n     Odd: O_key = [x for x in b if x % 2 == 1]\n\n Note: \n   - An even chest requires an odd key.\n   - An odd chest requires an even key.\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite matching problems:\n\n   Problem 1: Match even chests with odd keys (if we have an even chest, we need an odd key to open it)\n   Problem 2: Match odd chests with even keys.\n\n However, note that the same key cannot be used twice and the same chest cannot be opened twice.\n\n But observe: the two sets of matches are independent because:\n   - Even chests require odd keys (so they don't use even keys)\n   - Odd chests require even keys (so they don't use odd keys)\n\n So we can solve each problem independently and then the total is the sum.\n\n However, wait: the matching for even chests and odd keys and for odd chests and even keys are independent because the keys used in one do not interfere with the other? Actually, yes. The even keys are only used for odd chests and odd keys for even chests.\n\n But note: the catch is that we have a fixed set of even keys and odd keys. We can use at most min(count_even_chests, count_odd_keys) from the first scenario and similarly min(count_odd_chests, count_even_keys) from the second.\n\n However, wait: the matching is not necessarily limited by the counts only? Actually, the condition is just about the parity. But note: the condition for opening a chest is solely by the parity. So we can match as many even chests as we have odd keys (but we cannot exceed the number of even chests or the number of odd keys). Similarly for odd chests and even keys.\n\n But there's a catch: the matching is one-to-one. However, the condition is satisfied by any even chest with any odd key and any odd chest with any even key. Therefore, the maximum matching is simply:\n\n   matching1 = min(len(E_chest), len(O_key))\n   matching2 = min(len(O_chest), len(E_key))\n\n Then total = matching1 + matching2\n\n However, let's test with the examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys=[8,4,7,20]\n\n   Separate chests:\n      Even: [14,6,2] -> 3\n      Odd: [9,11] -> 2\n\n   Separate keys:\n      Even: [8,4,20] -> 3\n      Odd: [7] -> 1\n\n   Then:\n      matching1 = min(3, 1) = 1  (even chests matched with odd keys)\n      matching2 = min(2, 3) = 2  (odd chests matched with even keys)\n\n   Total = 1+2 = 3 -> which matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=5, m=1, chests = [2,4,6,8,10] (all even), keys = [5] (odd)\n\n   Even chests: 5, Odd chests: 0\n   Odd keys: 1, Even keys: 0\n\n   matching1 = min(5,1) = 1\n   matching2 = min(0,0) = 0\n   Total = 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: n=1, m=4, chests = [10] (even), keys = [20,30,40,50] (all even)\n\n   Even chests: 1, Odd chests: 0\n   Odd keys: 0, Even keys: 4\n\n   matching1 = min(1,0)=0\n   matching2 = min(0,4)=0\n   Total = 0 -> matches.\n\n But wait, is that always correct? Consider the following:\n\n   What if we have multiple keys and chests of the same parity? The condition is independent of the actual value, only the parity matters.\n\n   Therefore, the above reasoning holds.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the matching to be done with specific keys, only the count by parity. And since the condition",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to one being even and the other being odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Chests and Keys by Parity**: \n   - **Chestes**: Divide the chests into two groups—those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n   - **Keys**: Similarly, divide the keys into two groups—those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n\n2. **Calculate Maximum Possible Openings**:\n   - **Even Chests with Odd Keys**: The number of even chests that can be opened is limited by the minimum of the count of even chests and the count of odd keys.\n   - **Odd Chests with Even Keys**: Similarly, the number of odd chests that can be opened is limited by the minimum of the count of odd chests and the count of even keys.\n\n3. **Sum the Results**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the results from the two scenarios above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    odd_chest = 0\n    for num in a_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chest += 1\n            \n    even_key = 0\n    odd_key = 0\n    for num in b_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key += 1\n            \n    matching1 = min(even_chest, odd_key)\n    matching2 = min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    \n    result = matching1 + matching2\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Categorizing Chests and Keys**: The chests are categorized into even and odd based on their numbers. Similarly, the keys are categorized into even and odd.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openings**: The maximum number of even-numbered chests that can be opened is the lesser of the count of even chests and odd keys. Similarly, the maximum number of odd-numbered chests that can be opened is the lesser of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Output Result**: The sum of the two maximum values gives the total number of chests that can be opened, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without explicitly matching each chest to a key, thus optimizing both time and space complexity. The solution handles all edge cases, including when no chests can be opened, as demonstrated in the provided examples.",
