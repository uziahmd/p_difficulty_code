In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and then one of 'm', 'p', or 's'.\n We have three tiles initially.\n\n We can draw any number of extra tiles (each draw adds one tile) and we want the minimum number of draws to form at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if she already has a mentsu (0 draws).\n    - Koutsu: three identical tiles (same digit and same suit). But note: [1m,1m,1m] is triplet, but [1m,1p,1s] is not.\n    - Shuntsu: three consecutive digits (with wrap-around not allowed? Note: example says [9m,1m,2m] is invalid) so we only consider consecutive in the natural order (1-2-3, 2-3-4, ... 7-8-9). And same suit.\n\n 2. If not, then consider drawing 1 or 2 tiles.\n\n However, note that after drawing tiles, we are allowed to have more than three tiles. But the problem states: \"she must have at least one mentsu (a koutsu or a shuntsu) in her hand\". So we are forming a mentsu from the entire hand? Actually, the examples show that even with more than three tiles, we just need at least one set.\n\n But note: the initial hand is three tiles. After drawing, we have n tiles (n>=3). We don't necessarily need to use all tiles, just at least one mentsu (three tiles that form a koutsu or shuntsu).\n\n However, the problem does not specify that we have to use the entire hand. We just need to check if there exists a set of three tiles in the hand that form a mentsu.\n\n But note: the examples do not require using all tiles. For example, in the second example, the hand has [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] (which is 7 tiles) and it contains [4s,4s,4s] (koutsu) so one mentsu is present.\n\n However, our initial hand is only three. We are going to consider the minimal draws.\n\n We can think of the following:\n\n Option 0: Already have a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu) -> 0\n\n Option 1: Draw 1 tile, then we have 4 tiles. Then we check if there is a mentsu in these 4. But note: we are allowed to choose any tile to draw. So we can choose the best tile to complete a mentsu.\n\n Option 2: Draw 2 tiles, then we have 5 tiles.\n\n But note: sometimes drawing two tiles might be necessary.\n\n However, we are to find the minimal number of draws.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let's denote:\n   tiles = list of three strings\n\n We are going to consider:\n\n Case 0: Check for existing mentsu.\n\n Case 1: Consider drawing 1 tile: We can draw any tile (any digit and any suit). We are allowed to draw duplicates? Yes, because the problem says \"including those already in her hand\".\n\n So we can try to complete a koutsu or a shuntsu by adding one tile.\n\n For koutsu: \n   We look for a tile that appears at least twice. Then we need to complete the triplet. But wait, we have three tiles. If we have two of the same tile, then we can complete by drawing one more of that tile. Similarly, if we have three of the same tile, that's already a koutsu.\n\n However, note: the hand has three tiles. There are two possibilities for koutsu:\n   - Already three same: then we have koutsu -> 0.\n   - Two same and one different: then drawing one more of the same gives koutsu.\n\n But also, we might have two different pairs? Actually, with three tiles, we can only have at most two distinct tiles (if we have two same and one different) or three distinct.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Count the frequency of each tile (by suit and digit). There are 27 possible tiles.\n\n   Let's represent a tile as (digit, suit). But note: the input is given as string of length 2.\n\n   We can also consider for shuntsu:\n\n   Conditions for shuntsu: same suit and consecutive digits (in the set {1,2,...,9} and consecutive without wrap).\n\n   We can have three consecutive numbers: (x, x+1, x+2) for x from 1 to 7.\n\n  ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her hand. The solution involves checking various scenarios based on the initial three tiles she has.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. A mentsu can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same digit and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive digits in the same suit (e.g., 1m, 2m, 3m).\n\n2. **Check for One Draw**: If no mentsu exists initially, we then check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves:\n   - **Koutsu Completion**: If there are two identical tiles, drawing one more of the same tile completes a triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu Completion**: For each tile, check if drawing a specific tile can complete a sequence (e.g., having two tiles '1m' and '2m', drawing '3m' completes the sequence).\n\n3. **Check for Two Draws**: If one draw does not suffice, we check if two draws can form a mentsu. This includes scenarios where:\n   - **Koutsu Completion**: Drawing two identical tiles to complete a triplet (if only one tile of a kind is present).\n   - **Shuntsu Completion**: Drawing two tiles to complete a sequence (e.g., having one tile '1m', drawing '2m' and '3m').\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = [tile[:2] for tile in data]\n    \n    # Case 0: Check if already have a mentsu\n    if len(set(tiles)) == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for koutsu: three same\n    freq = {}\n    for t in tiles:\n        freq[t] = freq.get(t, 0) + 1\n    for count in freq.values():\n        if count >= 3:\n            print(0)\n            return\n            \n    # Check for shuntsu: three consecutive same suit\n    suits = set()\n    for t in tiles:\n        suits.add(t[1])\n    for suit in suits:\n        suit_tiles = [t for t in tiles if t[1] == suit]\n        digits = sorted(int(t[0]) for t in suit_tiles)\n        n = len(suit_tiles)\n        if n >= 3:\n            for i in range(n - 2):\n                if digits[i+2] == digits[i] + 2 and digits[i+1] == digits[i] + 1:\n                    print(0)\n                    return\n                    \n    # Case 1: Only one draw needed?\n    # Check for koutsu: if there are two of the same tile, then one more makes triplet.\n    for t in set(tiles):\n        if freq[t] == 2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n            \n    # Check for shuntsu: \n    # We'll consider each distinct tile and see what's missing for a sequence.\n    # But note: we can draw any tile, so we need to check for each possible sequence that can be formed with one additional tile.\n    # Since we have three tiles, we can have at most three distinct tiles.

So this case (count_in_hand==2) doesn't require two draws, but we are checking two draws anyway.\n                # Actually, we are trying to see if two draws are necessary. But since one draw might have been enough, we should not rely on this alone.\n                # But note: our previous checks (one draw) did not find a way, so we are now checking if two draws are needed. So if we have two tiles of a sequence, but we couldn't complete it with one draw (maybe because the missing tile is not available or something? Actually, we can always draw the missing tile), then why didn't we catch it in the one draw check?\n                # Let me reexamine: In the one draw check, we considered only sequences that are entirely within one suit. For example, if we have two tiles of a sequence, say '1m' and '2m', then the missing tile is '3m'. We would have checked that and printed 1. So if we reach this point, then we must not have found a one draw solution, so even though we have two tiles of a sequence, the third tile might not be drawable? Actually, no, we can draw any tile. Therefore, if two tiles of a sequence are present, then one draw should have been sufficient. Hence, we should not reach the two-draw case if two tiles of a sequence are present.\n                # So the above logic in the one-draw check should have caught it. Therefore, in the two-draw check, we are only concerned with sequences that have at most one tile.\n                pass\n\n    # Another possibility for two draws: forming a triplet from a single occurrence.\n    for t in set(tiles):\n        if freq[t] == 1:\n            print(2)\n            return\n\n    # Or, we might form two different triplets? But minimal is two draws. However, with three tiles, we can't form two triplets with two draws.\n    # Also, forming a sequence by drawing two tiles in different suits? No, sequences must be same suit.\n    # So if we haven't returned yet, then we need two draws.\n\n    # But wait, there's another possibility: forming a triplet from two different suits? No, triplet must be same tile (so same suit and digit). \n\n    # Alternatively, if none of the above, then we might need two draws for a sequence in a suit we don't have? Actually, we covered all possibilities above.\n\n    # However, let's think: what if the three tiles are all different and cannot form a sequence with one draw? For example, ['1m', '1p', '1s'] (but wait, this is three same digits but different suits, which is not a koutsu because koutsu requires same tile). Then we have one of each suit. To form a koutsu, we can draw two more '1m' (for example) to make a triplet of '1m'. Similarly, we could draw two tiles of the same suit and same digit as one of the tiles.\n\n    # But note: we have three tiles, each of different suit. We can draw two more of one of them, say two '1m', then we have four '1m'? No, we started with one '1m'. Then we have two more '1m' drawn, so total three '1m' (triplet). So two draws are needed.\n\n    # However, is there a sequence we can form? For example, if we have tiles from different suits, we cannot form a sequence because sequences require same suit.\n\n    # Therefore, in the case where we have three distinct tiles (each of different suit or different digits) and no two are the same, then we need to draw two tiles to complete a triplet (by duplicating one of them twice).\n\n    # But note: we might have two tiles of the same digit but different suits? For example, ['1m', '1p', '2m']. Then we have two '1's (but different suits) and one '2m'. This doesn't form a triplet. But we can complete a triplet by drawing two more '1m' or two more '1p'? Actually, to form a triplet for '1m', we need two more '1m'. Similarly for '1p'. \n\n    # However, we already checked for koutsu in the beginning (three same tiles) and found none. Then in the one-draw check, we looked for two of the same tile. In this example, we have two '1's but different suits, so they are not the same tile. Hence, the one-draw check would not have found a koutsu completion.\n\n    # Now, in the two-draw check, we need to check if there's any tile that appears once (like '2m') and then we can draw two more of that tile to complete a triplet. But wait, '2m' is only once. So we can draw two more '2m' to complete a triplet. \n\n    # Therefore, we can simply check: if any tile appears exactly once, then two draws of that tile will complete a triplet.\n\n    # But wait, what if the tile appears once and we want to form a triplet, then yes, two draws. And we already checked for triplet in the beginning (three same) and one-draw (two same). So if no tile has two occurrences, then every tile appears once. Then two draws will complete a triplet for any tile.\n\n    # However, we must ensure that we don't miss the case where two draws can form a sequence. But as reasoned earlier, if two tiles of a sequence are present, then one draw should have sufficed. Therefore, in the two-draw case, we only need to consider completing a triplet.\n\n    # But wait, what if we have three distinct tiles and no two are the same, but we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles? For example, ['1m', '2p', '3s']? Then we cannot form a sequence because they are different suits. So we must rely on forming a triplet.\n\n    # Therefore, if we haven't returned by now, the only possibility is that we need two draws to complete a triplet (by drawing two copies of any tile that appears once).\n\n    # However, note: we might have three distinct tiles, but some of them share the same digit? For example, ['1m', '1p', '2m']: \n    #   Tiles: '1m', '1p', '2m'\n    #   Frequencies: '1m':1, '1p':1, '2m':1 -> each appears once. Then we need two draws to complete a triplet (e.g., two '1m').\n\n    # But wait, in this example, we have two tiles with digit '1' (though different suits). These are not the same tile, so they don't help in forming a triplet. \n\n    # So the condition for two draws is: if there is at least one tile that appears once, then we can draw two copies of that tile to form a triplet.\n\n    # However, what if no tile appears once? That means all tiles appear at least twice, but with three tiles, the frequencies must be: one tile appears twice and the other once, or three distinct tiles. But wait, if all three tiles are distinct, then each appears once. If two are same and one different, then we already handled the two same case (one draw) and the three distinct case (two draws).\n\n    # Actually, the frequencies in three tiles can be:\n    #   - All three same: handled (0 draws)\n    #   - Two same, one different: handled (one draw for koutsu, or if not koutsu, then maybe shuntsu)\n    #   - Three distinct: each tile appears once.\n\n    # Therefore, in the two-draw case, we are left with three distinct tiles (each appearing once). Then, we can draw two copies of any one of them to form a triplet.\n\n    # But wait, is that the minimal? Yes, because with one draw we cannot form a triplet (since no two tiles are the same) and we cannot form a sequence (because the tiles are either different suits or not consecutive). \n\n    # However, what about sequences? We have three distinct tiles. They might be in the same suit or not. But even if they are in the same suit, they are not consecutive. For example, ['1m', '2m', '4m']: \n    #   Already checked for sequence in the beginning: no. Then in the one-draw check: we check if drawing one tile can complete a sequence. \n    #   For the sequence starting at 1: [1m,2m,3m] -> missing 3m. \n    #   For the sequence starting at 2: [2m,3m,4m] -> missing 3m. \n    #   But wait, we have '1m' and '2m', so drawing 3m completes [1m,2m,3m]. Similarly, we have '2m' and '4m', so drawing 3m completes [2m,3m,4m]. \n    #   However, in the one-draw check, we do check for such possibilities. So if we have two tiles that are consecutive, we can complete the sequence with one draw.\n\n    # Therefore, the two-draw case only applies when:\n    #   - There is no mentsu initially.\n    #   - There is no way to form a mentsu by drawing one tile.\n    #   - This leaves us with three distinct tiles (each appearing once) and no two tiles are consecutive (or same suit and consecutive) such that one draw can complete a sequence.\n\n    # But note: if the three tiles are distinct and not consecutive, then one draw might still complete a triplet if we draw two copies of one tile? No, one draw can only complete a triplet if there are already two copies. \n\n    # So the only remaining scenario is three distinct tiles, no two the same, and no two consecutive in the same suit. Then, we need two draws to complete a triplet.\n\n    # However, what if the three tiles are distinct and not consecutive, but we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles? For example, ['1m', '3m', '5m']: \n    #   We can draw '2m' and '4m' to complete two sequences? But we only need one sequence. However, with two draws, we can complete one sequence? Actually, we can complete two different sequences, but we only need one. \n    #   But note: the problem requires at least one mentsu. We can choose which three tiles to use. However, we cannot use the same tile twice. \n    #   In this example, we have three tiles: ['1m', '3m', '5m']. We can draw two tiles: say '2m' and '4m'. Then we have five tiles. Now, we can form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] or [3m,4m,5m]. So two draws suffice.\n\n    # But wait, can we form a sequence with two draws without having two of the same tile?

If so, it outputs 0.\n2. **One Draw Check**: The code then checks if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This includes completing a triplet (if two identical tiles are present) or completing a sequence (if two consecutive tiles in the same suit are present).\n3. **Two Draws Check**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the code checks if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu. This typically involves completing a triplet by drawing two identical tiles or forming a sequence by drawing two specific tiles. If all else fails, the minimal number of draws required is 2, as this is the only remaining scenario where a mentsu can be formed.\n\nThis approach efficiently covers all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws needed, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",

So if we reach this point, then we must not have found a one draw solution, so even though we have two tiles of a sequence, the third tile might not be drawable? Actually, no, we can draw any tile. Therefore, if two tiles of a sequence are present, then one draw should have been sufficient. Hence, we should not reach the two-draw case if two tiles of a sequence are present.\n                # So the above logic in the one-draw check should have caught it. Therefore, in the two-draw check, we are only concerned with sequences that have at most one tile.\n                pass\n\n    # Another possibility for two draws: forming a triplet from a single occurrence.\n    for t in set(tiles):\n        if freq[t] == 1:\n            print(2)\n            return\n\n    # Or, we might form two different triplets? But minimal is two draws. However, with three tiles, we can't form two triplets with two draws.\n    # Also, forming a sequence by drawing two tiles in different suits? No, sequences must be same suit.\n    # So if we haven't returned yet, then we need two draws.\n\n    # But wait, there's another possibility: forming a triplet from two different suits? No, triplet must be same tile (so same suit and digit). \n\n    # Alternatively, if none of the above, then we might need two draws for a sequence in a suit we don't have? Actually, we covered all possibilities above.\n\n    # However, let's think: what if the three tiles are all different and cannot form a sequence with one draw? For example, ['1m', '1p', '1s'] (but wait, this is three same digits but different suits, which is not a koutsu because koutsu requires same tile). Then we have one of each suit. To form a koutsu, we can draw two more '1m' (for example) to make a triplet of '1m'. Similarly, we could draw two tiles of the same suit and same digit as one of the tiles.\n\n    # But note: we have three tiles, each of different suit. We can draw two more of one of them, say two '1m', then we have four '1m'? No, we started with one '1m'. Then we have two more '1m' drawn, so total three '1m' (triplet). So two draws are needed.\n\n    # However, is there a sequence we can form? For example, if we have tiles from different suits, we cannot form a sequence because sequences require same suit.\n\n    # Therefore, in the case where we have three distinct tiles (each of different suit or different digits) and no two are the same, then we need to draw two tiles to complete a triplet (by duplicating one of them twice).\n\n    # But note: we might have two tiles of the same digit but different suits? For example, ['1m', '1p', '2m']. Then we have two '1's (but different suits) and one '2m'. This doesn't form a triplet. But we can complete a triplet by drawing two more '1m' or two more '1p'? Actually, to form a triplet for '1m', we need two more '1m'. Similarly for '1p'. \n\n    # However, we already checked for koutsu in the beginning (three same tiles) and found none. Then in the one-draw check, we looked for two of the same tile. In this example, we have two '1's but different suits, so they are not the same tile. Hence, the one-draw check would not have found a koutsu completion.\n\n    # Now, in the two-draw check, we need to check if there's any tile that appears once (like '2m') and then we can draw two more of that tile to complete a triplet. But wait, '2m' is only once. So we can draw two more '2m' to complete a triplet. \n\n    # Therefore, we can simply check: if any tile appears exactly once, then two draws of that tile will complete a triplet.\n\n    # But wait, what if the tile appears once and we want to form a triplet, then yes, two draws. And we already checked for triplet in the beginning (three same) and one-draw (two same). So if no tile has two occurrences, then every tile appears once. Then two draws will complete a triplet for any tile.\n\n    # However, we must ensure that we don't miss the case where two draws can form a sequence. But as reasoned earlier, if two tiles of a sequence are present, then one draw should have sufficed. Therefore, in the two-draw case, we only need to consider completing a triplet.\n\n    # But wait, what if we have three distinct tiles and no two are the same, but we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles? For example, ['1m', '2p', '3s']? Then we cannot form a sequence because they are different suits. So we must rely on forming a triplet.\n\n    # Therefore, if we haven't returned by now, the only possibility is that we need two draws to complete a triplet (by drawing two copies of any tile that appears once).\n\n    # However, note: we might have three distinct tiles, but some of them share the same digit? For example, ['1m', '1p', '2m']: \n    #   Tiles: '1m', '1p', '2m'\n    #   Frequencies: '1m':1, '1p':1, '2m':1 -> each appears once. Then we need two draws to complete a triplet (e.g., two '1m').\n\n    # But wait, in this example, we have two tiles with digit '1' (though different suits). These are not the same tile, so they don't help in forming a triplet. \n\n    # So the condition for two draws is: if there is at least one tile that appears once, then we can draw two copies of that tile to form a triplet.\n\n    # However, what if no tile appears once? That means all tiles appear at least twice, but with three tiles, the frequencies must be: one tile appears twice and the other once, or three distinct tiles. But wait, if all three tiles are distinct, then each appears once. If two are same and one different, then we already handled the two same case (one draw) and the three distinct case (two draws).\n\n    # Actually, the frequencies in three tiles can be:\n    #   - All three same: handled (0 draws)\n    #   - Two same, one different: handled (one draw for koutsu, or if not koutsu, then maybe shuntsu)\n    #   - Three distinct: each tile appears once.\n\n    # Therefore, in the two-draw case, we are left with three distinct tiles (each appearing once). Then, we can draw two copies of any one of them to form a triplet.\n\n    # But wait, is that the minimal? Yes, because with one draw we cannot form a triplet (since no two tiles are the same) and we cannot form a sequence (because the tiles are either different suits or not consecutive). \n\n    # However, what about sequences? We have three distinct tiles. They might be in the same suit or not. But even if they are in the same suit, they are not consecutive. For example, ['1m', '2m', '4m']: \n    #   Already checked for sequence in the beginning: no. Then in the one-draw check: we check if drawing one tile can complete a sequence. \n    #   For the sequence starting at 1: [1m,2m,3m] -> missing 3m. \n    #   For the sequence starting at 2: [2m,3m,4m] -> missing 3m. \n    #   But wait, we have '1m' and '2m', so drawing 3m completes [1m,2m,3m]. Similarly, we have '2m' and '4m', so drawing 3m completes [2m,3m,4m]. \n    #   However, in the one-draw check, we do check for such possibilities. So if we have two tiles that are consecutive, we can complete the sequence with one draw.\n\n    # Therefore, the two-draw case only applies when:\n    #   - There is no mentsu initially.\n    #   - There is no way to form a mentsu by drawing one tile.\n    #   - This leaves us with three distinct tiles (each appearing once) and no two tiles are consecutive (or same suit and consecutive) such that one draw can complete a sequence.\n\n    # But note: if the three tiles are distinct and not consecutive, then one draw might still complete a triplet if we draw two copies of one tile? No, one draw can only complete a triplet if there are already two copies. \n\n    # So the only remaining scenario is three distinct tiles, no two the same, and no two consecutive in the same suit. Then, we need two draws to complete a triplet.\n\n    # However, what if the three tiles are distinct and not consecutive, but we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles? For example, ['1m', '3m', '5m']: \n    #   We can draw '2m' and '4m' to complete two sequences? But we only need one sequence. However, with two draws, we can complete one sequence? Actually, we can complete two different sequences, but we only need one. \n    #   But note: the problem requires at least one mentsu. We can choose which three tiles to use. However, we cannot use the same tile twice. \n    #   In this example, we have three tiles: ['1m', '3m', '5m']. We can draw two tiles: say '2m' and '4m'. Then we have five tiles. Now, we can form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] or [3m,4m,5m]. So two draws suffice.\n\n    # But wait, can we form a sequence with two draws without having two of the same tile? Yes, but note that the two drawn tiles are different. \n\n    # However, in our previous checks for one draw, we checked if drawing one tile can complete a sequence. In this example, drawing one tile cannot complete a sequence because:\n    #   - To complete [1m,2m,3m], we need '2m' (then we have 1m,2m,3m).
