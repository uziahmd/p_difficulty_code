And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers.\n We have to consider all contiguous weeks of length k (there are n-k+1 weeks).\n For each week, we compute the average (total sleep in that week divided by k) and then take the overall average over all weeks.\n\n However, note: \n   The overall average is defined as (sum of averages of each week) / (number of weeks)\n But note: the average of a week is (sum of that week) / k.\n\n So, if we let S_i be the sum of the i-th week (from day i to day i+k-1), then the average for that week is S_i / k.\n Then the overall average is (S_1/k + S_2/k + ... + S_{n-k+1}/k) / (n-k+1)\n = ( (S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) ) / (k * (n-k+1))\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n Let T = total sum of all sleep times in the entire record? But note: each week is consecutive and we have overlapping windows.\n\n Actually, the entire record has n days. Each week is k consecutive days. We can compute the total sum of all weeks (each week's sum) by using a sliding window.\n\n However, note that the same day might appear in multiple weeks. Specifically, the first day appears in (k - first week + 1) but actually we have:\n\n   Week 1: days 1 to k -> uses day1, day2, ..., dayk\n   Week 2: days 2 to k+1 -> uses day2, day3, ..., dayk+1\n   ...\n   Week i: days i to i+k-1\n\n Therefore, the total sum of all weeks (the numerator above) is not simply the sum of the entire array multiplied by something.\n\n We can use a prefix sum to quickly calculate the sum for each week and then add them up.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n, k and the list a.\n 2. Compute the prefix sum array for a: \n      prefix[0] = 0\n      prefix[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i-1]\n\n    Then the sum for the week starting at index i (0-indexed) is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i].\n\n 3. The total sum of all weeks is the sum for i from 0 to n-k: (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n    So, total_weeks_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n 4. The number of weeks is m = n - k + 1.\n\n 5. The overall average is total_weeks_sum / (k * m)   [because each week's average is divided by k and then we average over m weeks]\n\n But wait: \n   total_weeks_sum is the sum of the sleep times for each day, but note each day is counted in multiple weeks.\n\n Actually, the above total_weeks_sum is the sum of the sleep times for each day, each day being counted as many times as the number of weeks that include it.\n\n Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n   Week1: [3,4] -> sum=7\n   Week2: [4,7] -> sum=11\n   Total_weeks_sum = 7 + 11 = 18.\n\n How many times is each day counted?\n   Day1 (3): only in week1 -> 1 time.\n   Day2 (4): in week1 and week2 -> 2 times.\n   Day3 (7): only in week2 -> 1 time.\n\n So total_weeks_sum = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18.\n\n Then overall average = 18 / (2 * (3-2+1)) = 18/(2*2)=18/4=4.5.\n\n But the example output is 9.0000000000? \n\n Wait, let me read the example again: \n   \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n Actually, the example says: \n        result = ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2\n               = ( (7/2) + (11/2) ) / 2\n               = ( (3.5 + 5.5) ) / 2\n               = 9 / 2 = 4.5\n\n However, the example output is written as 9.0000000000.\n\n But wait, the example input was provided as:\n\n        Input: 3 2\n               3 4 7\n\n        Output: 9.0000000000\n\n This does not match.\n\n Let me recalcute with the example:\n\n        The problem says: \"the result is\" [then there's nothing, so maybe I misread the example]\n\n Actually, the example says: \n        \"if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n And then they give three examples in the input format.\n\n The second example: \n        Input: 1 1\n                10\n        Output: 10.0000000000\n\n        Here, n=1, k=1 -> one week: [10] -> average is 10, and then overall average is 10.\n\n Third example: \n        Input: 8 2\n                1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n        Output: 28964.2857142857\n\n        There are 7 weeks (8-2+1=7). We have to compute the average of the averages of these 7 weeks.\n\n        Each week: two consecutive numbers.\n\n        Week1: (1+2)/2 = 1.5\n        Week2: (2+4)/2 = 3\n        Week3: (4+100000)/2 = 50002\n        Week4: (100000+123)/2 = 50061.5\n        Week5: (123+456)/2 = 289.5\n        Week6: (456+789)/2 = 622.5\n        Week7: (789+1)/2 = 395\n\n        Then overall average = (1.5 + 3 + 50002 + 50061.5 + 289.5 + 622.5 + 395) / 7\n\n        Let me compute the numerator: \n          1.5 + 3 = 4.5\n          4.5 + 50002 = 50006.5\n          50006.5 + 50061.5 = 100068\n          100068 + 289.5 = 100357.5\n          100357.5 + 622.5 = 100980\n          100980 + 395 = 101375\n\n        Then 101375 / 7 = 14482.142857142857... -> but the example output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n        This does not match either.\n\n Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n \"To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration.\"\n\n Then the example: \n        Input: 3 2\n               3 4 7\n\n        They say the result is ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / (number of weeks) ?\n\n        But wait, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n        How do we get 9?\n\n        If we do: \n            ( (3+4+4+7) ) / (k * (n-k+1)) * (something)? \n\n        Alternatively, note: \n            The problem says: \"the answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6\"\n\n        But wait, perhaps the example output is incorrect? \n\n        Let me check the sample inputs and outputs provided:\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: 3 2\n                    3 4 7\n            Expected Output: 9.0000000000\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: 1 1\n                    10\n            Expected Output: 10.0000000000\n\n        Example 3:\n            Input: 8 2\n                    1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n            Expected Output: 28964.2857142857\n\n        After recalculating example 1: \n            The average of the two weeks: ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2 = (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5, which is 4.5.\n\n        But the expected output is 9.0000000000.\n\n        Now, if we don't divide by the number of weeks (which is 2) twice, but only once:\n\n        What if we do: \n            total_weeks_sum = (3+4) + (4+7) = 7+11 = 18\n            Then the average is 18 / (k*(n-k+1))? -> 18/(2*2)=4.5.\n\n        Alternatively, if we do 18 / (n-k+1) without dividing by k? That would be 18/2=9.\n\n        So maybe the problem is defined differently?\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n            \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks\"\n\n        And the example: \n            \"the result is\"\n\n        But the example calculation in the problem statement is:\n\n            \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n        Without showing the calculation. However, the example outputs provided are:\n\n            Input: 3 2\\n3 4 7 -> Output: 9.0000000000\n\n        So what is happening?\n\n        Another interpretation: \n            The overall average is defined as the average of the averages of the weeks, but note that the average of a week is (sum of week)/k.\n\n            Then the overall average is ( (sum_week1)/k + (sum_week2)/k + ... ) / (number of weeks)\n\n            = ( (sum_week1 + sum_week2 + ...) ) / (k * (number of weeks))\n\n        But wait, in example1: \n            ( (7+11) ) / (2*2) = 18/4 = 4.5\n\n        However, if we do: \n            ( (7+11) ) / (number of weeks) = 18/2 = 9\n\n        Then we are not dividing by k in the final step? \n\n        But that doesn't make sense because the average of a week is (sum/k), and then we average those.\n\n        The problem says: \"average sleeping time\", meaning the average of the averages.\n\n        But note: \n            The average of the averages is ( (a1+a2+...+ak)/k + (a2+a3+...+a_{k+1})/k + ... ) / (n-k+1)\n\n        Which is ( (a1+a2+...+ak) + (a2+a3+...+a_{k+1}) + ... ) / (k*(n-k+1))\n\n        So the example1: 18/(2*2)=4.5.\n\n        But the expected output is 9.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the average of the sleep times across the entire week set without dividing by k twice? \n\n        Or maybe they are defining the overall average as the total sleep hours in all weeks divided by the total days? \n\n        Note: There are k * (n-k+1) days in total? \n\n        In example1: 2*2 = 4 days? But we have 3 days. Actually, we are counting the same day multiple times.\n\n        But wait, the total sleep hours in all weeks is 18, and the total days is (each day counted as many times as the number of weeks that include it) -> which is 1+2+1 = 4 days.\n\n        Then the average per day (across all days counted) would be 18/4=4.5.\n\n        However, the example output is 9.\n\n        Alternatively, what if we consider the entire record? \n\n        The problem says: \"consider k consecutive days as a week\", and then we have n-k+1 weeks.\n\n        Then the overall average is the average of the sleep times of the weeks, but note: \n\n            The average of a week is (sleep time in that week) / k.\n\n            Then the overall average is the average of these averages.\n\n        But wait, the example output 9 is exactly the average of the two week sums (without dividing by k) divided by the number of weeks? \n\n            (7+11)/2 = 9.\n\n        That is: (sum_week1 + sum_week2) / (n-k+1) = (7+11)/2 = 9.\n\n        But note: the definition of average for a week is (sum_week)/k, so why are we not including the division by k?\n\n        Let me check the problem statement: \n            \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n        And the example: \n            \"the result is\"\n\n        It doesn't specify whether it is the average of the averages or the average of the total sleep per week.\n\n        But note: the average sleeping time per week is defined as (total sleep in that week) / k. Then the average over all weeks is the average of these values.\n\n        However, the example output for the first example is 9.\n\n        There's a possibility that the problem intended to ask for the average of the total sleep per week (without dividing by k) and then divide by the number of weeks? \n\n        But that would be: (7+11)/2 = 9.\n\n        Alternatively, if they meant the average of the total sleep per week (without averaging the averages) but then that is just the average of the week totals, but note the example output is 9.\n\n        But wait, the example input 1 1: \n            Week total is 10, then the average of the week totals (only one week) is 10.\n\n        So the method is: \n            total_week_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (sum of week i)\n            Then the average is total_week_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n        Why isn't there a division by k? \n\n        The problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\" for the entire period.\n\n        But note: when you consider multiple weeks, the average per week (without normalizing by the number of days) is just the average of the weekly totals.\n\n        However, the doctor asked for the average amount of hours of sleep per week. \n\n        The average per week is defined as (hours in that week) / k. But then the overall average per week is the average of these (hours/k) over the weeks.\n\n        But wait, the example output for the third example:\n\n            total_week_sleep = 18 (from example1) -> then average = 9.\n\n            For the third example: \n                We have 7 weeks, and the week totals are [3+2, 2+4, 4+100000, 100000+123, 123+456, 456+789, 789+1] = [5,6,100004,100123,579,1245,790]\n                Then the average of these week totals = (5+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790) / 7\n\n            Let's compute the numerator: \n                5+6 = 11\n                11+100004 = 100015\n                100015+100123 = 200138\n                200138+579 = 200717\n                200717+1245 = 201962\n                201962+790 = 202752\n\n            Then 202752 / 7 = 28964.2857142857... which matches the example output.\n\n        So the problem is: \n            We are to compute the average of the weekly totals (i.e., the average of the sums of the k consecutive days) over the n-k+1 weeks.\n\n        But the problem statement says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\" and then \"the average sleeping time over all weeks\".\n\n        However, note: the average per week (as defined by the doctor) is the average for that week, which is (sum of the week)/k. Then the overall average should be the average of these per-week averages.\n\n        Why then the example output is the average of the week totals (without dividing by k) divided by the number of weeks?\n\n        Actually, wait: \n            If we do: \n                overall_average = ( (week1_total/k) + (week2_total/k) + ... ) / (n-k+1)\n                                = ( (week1_total + week2_total + ...) ) / (k * (n-k+1))\n\n            But the example1: (5+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790) / (k * (n-k+1)) for the third example would be 202752/(2*7)=202752/14≈14482.2857142857, which is not the example output.\n\n        The example output for the third example is 28964.2857142857, which is 202752/7.\n\n        Therefore, the problem is not asking for the average of the weekly averages (per-day normalized) but simply the average of the weekly totals.\n\n        Let me reread the problem statement: \n            \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks\"\n\n        And the example: \n            \"the result is\"\n\n        The problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", but note that the doctor asked for the average over the weeks. \n\n        However, the example output is the average of the weekly totals (without dividing by k) over the weeks.\n\n        But wait, the average amount of hours of sleep per week should be the average of (weekly total / k). \n\n        There seems to be a discrepancy.\n\n        Clarification: \n            The problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\" (for the entire period) is the average of the per-week sleep amounts (each per-week amount is the total hours in that week, divided by k). \n\n        But then the example1: \n            Per week: week1: 3.5, week2: 5.5 -> average: (3.5+5.5)/2 = 4.5.\n\n        However, the example output is 9.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be defining the average as the average of the weekly totals (without dividing by k) and then saying that this average is the average sleep time per week? \n\n        But that would be the average weekly total, which is not the same as the average sleep per week (since each week has k days, the average sleep per day in a week is (weekly total)/k).\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", so it should be the average per week (which is the average of the weekly totals divided by k?).\n\n        But wait, the example input \"1 1\" has a week of 1 day. Then the average sleep time per week is the total sleep in that week (which is 10) divided by 1, which is 10.\n\n        In the first example, the average sleep time per week (if we consider two weeks) is the average of the two weekly averages: (3.5+5.5)/2=4.5.\n\n        But the example output for the first example is 9.\n\n        After checking the sample outputs:\n\n            Example1: Input \"3 2\" and \"3 4 7\" -> output 9.0000000000\n            Example2: Input \"1 1\" and \"10\" -> output 10.0000000000\n            Example3: Input \"8 2\" and the list -> output 28964.2857142857\n\n        Example2: \n            k=1, n=1, so one week: the weekly total is 10, and the average of the weekly totals is 10.\n\n        Example1: \n            k=2, n=3, weekly totals: 7 and 11, average = (7+11)/2=9.\n\n        Example3: \n            k=2, n=8, weekly totals: [5,6,100004,100123,579,1245,790] -> average = 202752/7 = 28964.2857142857.\n\n        So the problem is: \n            Calculate the average of the weekly totals (i.e., the sum of the sleep time in the week) for the n-k+1 weeks.\n\n        But note: the problem statement says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", which typically means (total sleep in the week) / (number of days in the week). \n\n        However, the examples are matching the average of the weekly totals (without dividing by k) over the weeks.\n\n        This is confusing. Let me compare with the example in the problem statement:\n\n            \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n        And the example output is 9.\n\n        Now, if we consider: \n            The average amount of hours of sleep per week (meaning the average per week) is defined as the average of the weekly totals (the total sleep in the week) over the weeks, then:\n\n            Result = (sum of weekly totals) / (number of weeks)\n\n        And the weekly total is the sum of the k consecutive days.\n\n        This definition is not the typical average per week (which would be the average per day times the number of days) but rather the average of the total sleep per week (without normalizing by the number of days).\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and the week has k days. \n\n        However, the examples are consistent with this: \n            Example1: (3+4+4+7) / 2 = (18) / 2 = 9.\n\n        And Example2: 10/1=10.\n\n        Example3: 202752/7=28964.2857142857.\n\n        So the problem is: \n            Given n, k and an array a of n integers,\n            Consider every contiguous subarray of length k (each is a week) and let S_i be the sum of the i-th week.\n            Then the answer is (S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) / (n-k+1)\n\n        Why is that the average amount of sleep per week? \n\n        Actually, it is the average of the total sleep per week (so if a week is 10 hours, then the average is the average of these 10, 15, etc.). \n\n        The problem might be using \"per week\" to mean the entire week's total, and then averaging those totals.\n\n        This is different from the common understanding of \"average sleep per week\" which is the average per night times the number of nights (or the total per week divided by the number of nights). \n\n        But note: the problem says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and if we break down:\n\n            In week i, he slept S_i hours.\n\n            Then the average over the weeks is (S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_m) / m.\n\n        So the problem's definition is: \n            average_sleep_per_week = (total_sleep_in_week1 + total_sleep_in_week2 + ... ) / (number_of_weeks)\n\n        This is indeed the average of the weekly totals.\n\n        But then, why is the example output 9 for the first example? \n\n            Because: (3+4) + (4+7) = 7+11=18, and 18/2=9.\n\n        Therefore, we must compute:\n\n            total_weekly_sleep = 0\n            for i from 0 to n-k:\n                total_weekly_sleep += (prefix[i+k]-prefix[i])\n\n            Then answer = total_weekly_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n        However, note: the entire array has n elements, and we are summing each week (which is k consecutive elements) and then averaging the week totals.\n\n        We can compute the total_weekly_sleep using a sliding window and prefix sums.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Build prefix sum array\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            total_weekly_sleep = 0\n            m = n - k + 1   # number of weeks\n            for i in range(0, m):\n                total_weekly_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n            average = total_weekly_sleep / m\n\n            Print the average with 10 decimal places.\n\n        But wait, the example1: \n            n=3, k=2, m=2\n            prefix = [0,3,7,14] (but wait, the array is [3,4,7] -> so prefix[0]=0, prefix[1]=3, prefix[2]=3+4=7, prefix[3]=7+7=14)\n            Then:\n                i=0: prefix[0+2] - prefix[0] = 7 - 0 = 7\n                i=1: prefix[1+2] - prefix[1] = 14 - 3 = 11\n            total_weekly_sleep = 7+11 = 18\n            average = 18/2 = 9.0\n\n        Example2: \n            n=1, k=1, m=1\n            prefix = [0,10]\n            i=0: prefix[1]-prefix[0]=10\n            average=10/1=10.0\n\n        Example3: \n            n=8, k=2, m=7\n            We have the array [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n            We'll compute the prefix sum and then the 7 weeks.\n\n            But note: the example output is 28964.2857142857, which is 202752/7.\n\n            Let me compute the total_weekly_sleep for example3:\n\n            Week1: 1+2 = 3 -> but wait, the example above I calculated the week1 total as 5? \n\n            Wait, the example input is: \n                8 2\n                1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\n            The first week: first two days: 1+2 = 3 -> but the example above I said 3+2=5? \n\n            Actually, no: the example above I wrote: \n                Week1: (1+2)/2 = 1.5 -> but that was for the average per week.

Let me recount the example3:\n\n            Week1: 1+2 -> 3\n            Week2: 2+4 -> 6\n            Week3: 4+100000 -> 100004\n            Week4: 100000+123 -> 100123\n            Week5: 123+456 -> 579\n            Week6: 456+789 -> 1245\n            Week7: 789+1 -> 790\n\n            Adding: \n              3+6=9\n              9+100004=100013\n              100013+100123=200136\n              200136+579=200715\n              200715+1245=201960\n              201960+790=202750.\n\n            So the total_weekly_sleep is 202750.\n\n            Then 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            Read n, k\n            Read list a of n integers\n\n            m = n - k + 1\n            If m <= 0: then there are no weeks? but k<=n so m>=1.\n\n            Use prefix sum to compute the total_weekly_sleep.\n\n            However, we can also use a sliding window without building the entire prefix array for such a large n (up to 200000) but building a prefix array is O(n) and acceptable.\n\n        But note: the constraints n up to 200000, so we can do:\n\n            total_weekly_sleep = 0\n            # We can compute the first window of k elements\n            # Then slide the window: subtract the element leaving and add the next.\n\n            However, the problem says to output the average of the weekly totals.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            total_weekly_sleep = sum(a[0:k])   # first window\n            Then for i from 1 to n-k:\n                total_weekly_sleep = total_weekly_sleep - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]   ??? \n\n            But wait, the window moves from [0, k-1] to [1, k] to [2, k+1] ...\n\n            Actually, the next window (starting at index1) is from index1 to index1+k-1.\n\n            So the first window: indices [0, k-1]\n            Second window: [1, k]\n\n            Then the second window sum = first window sum - a[0] + a[k]\n\n            But note: our array is 0-indexed.\n\n            Steps for the sliding window:\n\n            s = sum(a[0:k])\n            total_weekly_sleep = s\n            Then for i in range(1, n-k+1):\n                s = s - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n                total_weekly_sleep += s\n\n            However, note: the first window is i=0, then we add that. Then we update for i=1.\n\n            But we need to add the first window and then the next ones.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            total_weekly_sleep = 0\n            current_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n            total_weekly_sleep += current_sum\n\n            for i in range(1, n-k+1):\n                current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n                total_weekly_sleep += current_sum\n\n            But then we are adding the first window, then the second, etc.\n\n            However, the problem says: the average of the weekly totals.\n\n            Then average = total_weekly_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n        But note: the first window is included, then we do n-k iterations (from 1 to n-k) so we add n-k windows? \n\n        Actually, the first window is i=0, and then we go from i=1 to i=n-k (which is m-1, since m = n-k+1) so we do m-1 steps.\n\n        So we start with the first window, then do m-1 more windows -> total m windows.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, the constraints: n up to 200000, so building the prefix array is O(n) and so is the sliding window.\n\n        But note: if we use the prefix array, we do:\n\n            total_weekly_sleep = 0\n            for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n                total_weekly_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n        This is O(n) and acceptable.\n\n        However, the prefix method might be simpler and avoid handling the first window separately.\n\n        But we can also use:\n\n            total_weekly_sleep = 0\n            for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n                total_weekly_sleep += sum(a[i:i+k])\n\n        But this is O(n*k) which is too slow for n,k up to 200000.\n\n        So we use either prefix or sliding window.\n\n        Since we are already reading the entire array, we can use the sliding window to avoid building the prefix array.\n\n        However, the problem does not require which method.\n\n        Let me choose the sliding window for efficiency (same time complexity, but sliding window avoids building the prefix array).\n\n        Code with sliding window:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            if k == 0:  # but",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time per week for Polycarp over all possible weeks in his sleep records. Each week is defined as `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks in total. The average is computed by summing the total sleep time of each week and then dividing by the number of weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves processing a sequence of sleep records (each record being the sleep duration for a day) and calculating the average sleep time per week, where each week consists of `k` consecutive days. The challenge is to efficiently compute the sum of sleep durations for all overlapping windows of size `k` in the given sequence.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution requires summing the sleep durations for each window of size `k` and then averaging these sums over all such windows. A sliding window technique is optimal here because it allows us to compute each subsequent window's sum in constant time by adjusting the previous window's sum.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a sliding window approach:\n   - Initialize the sum of the first window (first `k` elements).\n   - Slide the window across the array, updating the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters.\n   - Accumulate the sum of all window sums.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element exactly once, leading to a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for large inputs (up to 200,000 elements).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    m = n - k + 1\n    if m <= 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    total_weekly_sleep = 0\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_weekly_sleep += current_sum\n    \n    for i in range(1, m):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_weekly_sleep += current_sum\n        \n    average = total_weekly_sleep / m\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (days per week), followed by `n` integers representing daily sleep durations.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: If `k` is zero or if there are no valid weeks (i.e., `n < k`), the output is set to 0.0.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum**: The initial sum of the first `k` elements is computed. For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by subtracting the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new rightmost element. This sum is accumulated into `total_weekly_sleep`.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time per week is obtained by dividing the accumulated sum by the number of weeks (`m`). The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average using a sliding window technique, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
