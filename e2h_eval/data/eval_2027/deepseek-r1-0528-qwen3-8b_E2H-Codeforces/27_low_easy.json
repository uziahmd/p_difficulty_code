On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r] (0-indexed or 1-indexed? the problem is 1-indexed but in code we use 0-indexed). After the reversal, we want the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) to be as long as possible.\n\n Note: The entire sequence only has 1's and 2's. Therefore, a non-decreasing subsequence can consist of:\n   - Only 1's.\n   - Only 2's.\n   - A mix: all 1's followed by all 2's.\n\n In fact, note that the entire sequence after reversal must be such that we can have:\n   [some 1's] then [some 2's] (but note: we might have some 1's and 2's interleaved arbitrarily, but the condition for being non-decreasing is that once we see a 2 we cannot later see a 1).\n\n However, observe that we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. So we are allowed to change the order of some consecutive elements.\n\n Let's denote:\n   original: [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}]\n\n After reversing [l, r], the new sequence is:\n   [a0, a1, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_{l}, a_{r+1}, ..., a_{n-1}]\n\n Since the array consists only of 1 and 2, the goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Observation:\n   The entire sequence is made of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in the entire sequence (if we don't reverse) is simply the total number of elements (since 1<=2) but wait: if there are both 1 and 2, then we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's? Actually, no: the entire sequence may not be sorted. But note: the entire sequence is composed of two numbers. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1's and 2's is the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing? Not necessarily. \n\n However, note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. How does that help?\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Since the array is binary (only 1 and 2), the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the entire sequence is at least the total number of 1's and 2's? Actually, no: the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing. But note: we can rearrange one contiguous part arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: the reversal operation. We are allowed to reverse exactly one contiguous segment. We want to maximize the length of the LNDS.\n\n Important: The LNDS in a sequence of 1's and 2's is just the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (i.e., all 1's then all 2's). Otherwise, we can break the sequence into parts.\n\n But note: even if we have a sequence that is not entirely non-decreasing, the LNDS can be the entire sequence if we can fix the decreasing parts by reversing an interval? Actually, sometimes we can get the entire sequence to be non-decreasing by reversing one contiguous segment.\n\n However, note: the entire sequence is of 1's and 2's. The entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if all the 1's come before the 2's.\n\n Without reversal, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n   - The total number of 1's (if we take all 1's, they form a non-decreasing subsequence)\n   - The total number of 2's (similarly)\n   - Or a combination: we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's? But note: the entire sequence might not be in order.\n\n Actually, the entire sequence might have some 2's before some 1's. Then the LNDS would be the entire sequence? No, because when we see a 2 and then a 1, that breaks the non-decreasing condition.\n\n However, we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. What is the goal? We want to arrange the sequence so that all the 1's come first and then the 2's. But note: we are only allowed one reversal. \n\n Let's consider:\n\n Option 1: Without any reversal, what is the LNDS?\n   We can always take all the 1's and then all the 2's? Actually, no: because the indices must be increasing. The entire set of 1's and 2's is available, but if we take a 1 that is after a 2, then the subsequence must jump over the 2? But wait: we are allowed to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous interval. The key observation here is that the optimal LNDS can be either the entire sequence if it becomes non-decreasing after reversal, or a combination of all 1s followed by all 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in such a sequence will be the entire sequence if all 1s come before all 2s. Otherwise, it will be the sum of the total number of 1s and 2s, which is the length of the sequence itself.\n2. **Key Insight**: Reversing a contiguous interval can help in bringing all 1s together before all 2s. The goal is to determine if reversing any part of the sequence can make the entire sequence non-decreasing (all 1s followed by all 2s). If not, the LNDS will still be the entire sequence because even if there are some 2s before 1s, the entire sequence can be considered as a valid non-decreasing subsequence since 1 ≤ 2.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking two main scenarios:\n   - **Scenario 1**: After reversing any interval, the entire sequence becomes non-decreasing (all 1s followed by all 2s). In this case, the LNDS is the length of the entire sequence.\n   - **Scenario 2**: If no such reversal makes the entire sequence non-decreasing, the LNDS is simply the length of the sequence (since all elements are either 1 or 2, forming a non-decreasing sequence when considered in their entirety).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    total_ones = sum(arr)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n\n    if total_ones >= total_twos:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[i] == 2 and arr[j] == 1:\n                print(n)\n                return\n                \n    print(n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the sequence length `n` and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the sequence length is 1, the LNDS is trivially 1.\n3. **Counting 1s and 2s**: The code counts the number of 1s (`total_ones`) and 2s (`total_twos`). If there are at least as many 1s as 2s, the entire sequence can be considered as a non-decreasing subsequence, so the answer is `n`.\n4. **Checking for Valid Reversal**: The code checks if there exists any pair of indices where a 2 precedes a 1. If such a pair exists, reversing the interval between them would make the entire sequence non-decreasing, hence the LNDS is `n`.\n5. **Default Case**: If no such pair is found, the entire sequence is already the best possible LNDS, which is `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions to determine the maximum LNDS after at most one reversal, leveraging the binary nature of the sequence to simplify the problem.",
