Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a (angle in degrees)\n\n We have a regular convex n-gon. The vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n We need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 formed by the points v1, v2, v3 is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n Note: The angle at vertex v2 is the angle between the two sides (v1, v2) and (v2, v3). In a regular convex polygon, the vertices are equally spaced on a circle.\n\n Observation:\n Since the polygon is regular and convex, we can consider the circle on which the vertices lie.\n\n The key idea is to note that the angle we are measuring is an inscribed angle. However, note that the problem does not require the angle to be inscribed in the usual sense? Actually, the angle is formed by three points on the circle.\n\n But note: the entire figure is a regular convex polygon, so the points are on a circle.\n\n There are two types of angles we can form:\n\n 1. The reflex angle (greater than 180°) is not considered because the polygon is convex and the angle at the vertex must be the internal one? Actually, the problem says \"the angle\", and in the context of the polygon, we are to consider the angle that lies inside the polygon or the one formed by the two sides?\n\n However, note: the example: \n   Input: \"4 67\" -> Output: \"2 1 3\"\n   This forms an angle of 45 degrees (since |45-67| < |90-67|) but wait: in a square, the angle we can form at a vertex by two adjacent edges is 90°, but also by skipping some edges we can form other angles.\n\n Actually, let me explain:\n\n In a square (n=4), the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 90°. \n\n The angle at vertex v2 (the vertex of the angle) can be calculated by considering the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n Since the polygon is cyclic, we can use the inscribed angle theorem. However, note: the inscribed angle for an arc is half the central angle. But here the angle we are measuring is the angle between two chords.\n\n Alternatively, we can think in terms of steps (edges) between the vertices.\n\n Let the center of the polygon be O. Then the central angle between two consecutive vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n Now, consider the two points v1 and v3. We can represent the polygon as a circle with n points. The angle at v2 is determined by the two arcs: from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n However, note that the angle at v2 can be measured in two ways: one going clockwise and one counterclockwise. The problem states that the polygon is convex, so we are only concerned with the smaller angle (unless the angle we form is reflex, but then we would take the other side? Actually, the problem says \"the angle\" and in the example they are comparing absolute differences, so we are only considering the angle as the smaller one? Or maybe we consider both possibilities? \n\n But note: the example input \"4 68\" gives 90° because 90 is closer to 68 than 45. So we are allowed to form angles that are greater than 180? Actually, no: the angle at a vertex in the polygon must be less than 180° (because it's convex). However, when we form an angle by three distinct vertices, the angle could be reflex if we take the other side? But the problem says: \"the angle (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides)\".\n\n The problem does not specify whether we are taking the internal or external angle. However, note the example: in the square, the two possibilities are 45° and 90°.\n\n How do we get 45°?\n   Consider the square: vertices 1,2,3,4 (clockwise). \n   Example: v2 = 1, then we can choose v1 and v3 such that one is two steps away and the other is one step away? Actually, no: the square has four vertices. \n\n   Another possibility: the angle can be formed by two sides that are not necessarily adjacent. In fact, the angle is formed by two chords from v2 to two other vertices.\n\n   The entire circle is 360°. The two chords from v2 divide the circle into two arcs: one containing the other vertices. The angle at v2 is the smaller angle between the two chords? Actually, the angle we are measuring is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices (the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given target angle. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently checking potential angles formed by their vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular convex polygon with `n` sides, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees. The angle formed by three vertices can be derived from the arcs between them.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle at vertex `v2` formed by vertices `v1` and `v3` depends on the number of edges between them along the polygon. The key insight is that the angle can be calculated based on the minimum steps required to traverse from `v2` to `v1` and from `v2` to `v3` in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions.\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: Given the constraints (n can be up to 10^5), we need an efficient way to check potential angles. Instead of checking all triplets, we consider angles formed by vertices separated by a certain number of edges. For each possible separation (k edges), the corresponding angle can be computed and compared to the target angle.\n4. **Binary Search for Optimal Angle**: We use binary search to find the separation (k) that minimizes the absolute difference between the computed angle and the target angle. This involves calculating angles for separations around k and k+1 (since the closest angle might lie just above or below the target).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_angle = 360.0\n    central_angle = total_angle / n\n    \n    def angle_from_separation(k):\n        if k == 0:\n            return 0.0\n        inner_angle = (360.0 * k) / n\n        if inner_angle > 180.0:\n            inner_angle = 360.0 - inner_angle\n        return inner_angle\n\n    left = 1\n    right = n // 2 + 1\n    \n    best_angle_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        angle_mid = angle_from_separation(mid)\n        diff_mid = abs(angle_mid - a)\n        \n        candidates = []\n        k1 = mid\n        k2 = mid + 1\n        \n        angle1 = angle_from_separation(k1)\n        diff1 = abs(angle1 - a)\n        \n        angle2 = angle_from_separation(k2) if k2 <= n//2 + 1 else 0.0\n        diff2 = abs(angle2 - a)\n        \n        candidates.append((diff1, k1))\n        if k2 <= n//2 + 1:\n            candidates.append((diff2, k2))\n        \n        min_diff = min(diff for diff, k in candidates)\n        if min_diff < best_angle_diff:\n            best_angle_diff = min_diff\n            best_k = [k for k, d in candidates if d == min_diff][0]\n            \n            center_vertex = 1\n            k = best_k\n            \n            if k == 0:\n                v1 = n\n                v2 = 1\n                v3 = 2\n            else:\n                v1 = center_vertex - k + 1\n                if v1 < 1:\n                    v1 += n\n                v3 = center_vertex + k + 1\n                if v3 > n:\n                    v3 -= n\n                    \n                v1 = v1 % n\n                if v1 == 0:\n                    v1 = n\n                    \n                v3 = v3 % n\n                if v3 == 0:\n                    v3 = n\n                    \n                best_vertices = (center_vertex, v1, v3)\n                \n        if diff1 < diff_mid:\n            right = mid - 1\n        elif diff1 > diff_mid:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    if best_vertices is None:\n        best_vertices = (1, n, 2)\n        \n    print(f\"{best_vertices[0]} {best_vertices[1]} {best_vertices[2]}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Central Angle Calculation**: The central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees.\n3. **Angle Function**: The function `angle_from_separation(k)` calculates the angle formed by two vertices separated by `k` edges from a central vertex. It ensures the angle is within the valid range (0 to 180 degrees).\n4. **Binary Search**: The binary search is performed over possible separations (`k`) from 1 to `n//2 + 1`. For each midpoint `mid`, the corresponding angle is checked, and the closest angles around `mid` are considered.\n5. **Vertex Selection**: Based on the optimal separation found, the vertices are selected. The central vertex is fixed (vertex 1), and the other two vertices are determined by moving `k` edges clockwise and counter-clockwise from the central vertex.\n6. **Output**: The selected vertices are printed in the format `v1 v2 v3`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large `n`. The solution leverages geometric properties to compute angles and selects vertices accordingly.",
