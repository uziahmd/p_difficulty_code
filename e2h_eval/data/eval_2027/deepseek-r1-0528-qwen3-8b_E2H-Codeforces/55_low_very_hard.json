Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. But not '0' and '2' directly.\n\n This means that the relative order of the three characters might be constrained. However, note that we can use the intermediate character to help.\n\n Observation:\n Since we can swap '0' and '1', and '1' and '2', then a '0' can effectively \"bubble\" through the string by swapping with adjacent '1's and then the '1' can be moved by swapping with '2's (and vice versa). But note: we cannot directly swap '0' and '2'.\n\n However, consider that we can move a '0' to the left through a sequence of '1's, and similarly we can move a '2' to the right through a sequence of '1's. Also, we can move a '1' in both directions (left by swapping with '0', right by swapping with '2').\n\n But note: the swaps are only adjacent. So the problem becomes similar to sorting with restricted adjacent swaps.\n\n Let's think about the relative positions:\n\n We can note that:\n - A '0' can be swapped with a '1' to its right to move left, but not with a '2' to its left? Actually, wait: the swaps are bidirectional for the pairs.\n\n Actually, the allowed swaps are:\n   \"01\" <-> \"10\"\n   \"12\" <-> \"21\"\n\n So, we can have a sequence of moves that effectively allows:\n\n  '0' can move left until it hits a '2' (because if there's a '1' to the left, we can swap with the '1' and then the '1' can move further? Actually, no: if we have \"02\", we cannot swap. Similarly, if we have \"20\", we cannot swap.\n\n Therefore, the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed? Not exactly, because we can use ones as intermediaries.\n\n Example: \"02\" -> cannot swap. But what about \"012\"? \n   We can swap the '0' and '1' to get \"102\", then swap the '0' and '2'? Wait, no: from \"102\", we can only swap the '0' and '2' if they are adjacent? But they are not adjacent. Then we can swap the '1' and '2' (if adjacent) but here the '1' is at the front and the '2' is two steps away.\n\n Alternatively, consider \"012\": \n   Step1: swap the '0' and '1' -> \"102\"\n   Now, we cannot swap the '0' and '2' because they are separated by nothing (they are adjacent now? Actually, after the first swap, we have \"102\": \n        index0: '1', index1: '0', index2: '2'\n        Then we can swap the '0' and the '2'? No, because the operation is only for adjacent pairs and the allowed pairs are \"01\" or \"12\". Here, we have \"02\" which is not allowed.\n\n So we cannot swap the '0' and '2' even if they become adjacent via moving the '1'? Actually, the allowed swaps are only for the specific pairs. So we cannot swap \"02\".\n\n But note: we can move the '1' (which was originally at position1) to the right? In \"102\", the '1' is at the leftmost and the next is '0', so we can swap '1' and '0' again to go back, or we can use the '0' as an intermediary? Actually, we can't because the '0' and '2' are stuck.\n\n However, note that the problem allows arbitrary number of swaps. The key is to figure out the independent movements.\n\n Alternate approach: consider that the relative order of zeros and twos must remain the same? Because we cannot swap zeros and twos. But wait: we can use ones to help move zeros and twos past each other?\n\n Actually, let's try to break down the problem:\n\n We have three types: '0', '1', '2'\n\n Constraints:\n   - Swap between '0' and '1' is allowed (adjacent only)\n   - Swap between '1' and '2' is allowed (adjacent only)\n\n This means that a '0' can pass through any number of '1's, and a '2' can pass through any number of '1's, but a '0' cannot pass through a '2' without a '1' in between (and similarly, a '2' cannot pass through a '0' without a '1').\n\n However, note that if we have a '",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing a series of adjacent swaps on '0's and '1's, and '1's and '2's. The key observation here is that '0's can move left through '1's, '2's can move right through '1's, and '1's can move freely in both directions when adjacent to '0's or '2's. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. This means '0's can only move left past '1's, '2's can only move right past '1's, and '1's can move freely in both directions when adjacent to '0's or '2's. The relative order of '0's and '2's remains unchanged because they cannot be swapped directly.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves determining the positions of '0's, '1's, and '2's in the final string. The minimal lexicographical string will have all '0's first, followed by '1's, and then '2's. However, the challenge is to maintain the original relative order of '0's and '2's while allowing '1's to interleave appropriately.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Step 1**: Traverse the string to collect the indices of all '0's, '1's, and '2's.\n   - **Step 2**: Generate a result string by placing all '0's first (in their original order), followed by all '1's (in their original order), and then all '2's (in their original order). This ensures the lexicographically smallest string without violating the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append(i)\n        elif char == '1':\n            ones.append(i)\n        else:\n            twos.append(i)\n            \n    result = []\n    for idx in zeros:\n        result.append('0')\n    for idx in ones:\n        result.append('1')\n    for idx in twos:\n        result.append('2')\n        \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires transforming a ternary string into its lexicographically smallest form using specific adjacent swaps. The swaps allowed are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. Direct swaps between '0' and '2' are not permitted.\n- **Insight**: The minimal lexicographical string is achieved by placing all '0's first, followed by '1's, and then '2's. The relative order of '0's and '2's must remain the same as in the original string because they cannot be swapped directly.\n- **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm collects the positions of '0's, '1's, and '2's in separate lists. It then constructs the result string by concatenating all '0's (in their original order), followed by all '1's (in their original order), and finally all '2's (in their original order). This approach ensures the smallest lexicographical string while adhering to the constraints.\n- **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage required for the indices of '0's, '1's, and '2's. This approach efficiently handles the problem constraints, even for large input sizes up to 10^5 characters.",
