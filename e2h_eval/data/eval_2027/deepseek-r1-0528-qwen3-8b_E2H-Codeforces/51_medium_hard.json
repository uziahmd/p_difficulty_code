Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is to check two things:\n 1. The combined letters of the first two names (guest and host) must be exactly the same as the letters in the pile (third line), including the frequency of each letter.\n 2. There should be no extra letters or missing letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines, stripping newlines.\n - Concatenate the first two strings (guest and host) and then compare the sorted list of characters with the sorted list of the third string (the pile).\n - However, note that the problem says: \"verify that there are no extra letters\" meaning the pile should have exactly the letters needed for both names and nothing more.\n\n Alternatively, we can:\n   a. Combine the first two strings to form a target string.\n   b. Compare the frequency of each letter in the target string with the frequency of each letter in the pile string.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   But wait, note: the example input has the third line as \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is the same as the combined string? Actually, let's break down:\n\n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> 10 letters\n   Host:  DEDMOROZ -> 8 letters\n   Combined: 18 letters\n\n   Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> Let's count: \n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 18 letters.\n\n   However, note that the example output is \"YES\".\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as:\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   So, we can simply compare the sorted version of the combined string (guest + host) and the sorted pile.\n\n   However, note: the example input in the problem statement is given as:\n\n        Input:\n          SANTACLAUS\n          DEDMOROZ\n          SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   But the example output is YES.\n\n   Let me check: \n        Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" \n        Pile:      \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Now, if we sort the combined string: \n        sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\") \n        and sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n   But wait, are these the same?\n\n   Let's do it by hand for a part:\n\n        Combined: \n            SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n        Pile:\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   They both have:\n        A: 3 times? \n            In combined: \n                SANTACLAUS -> A: 2 (from SANTA and CLAUS)\n                DEDMOROZ -> A: 0\n                Total A: 2\n\n            In pile: \n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n                S: ... (counting each letter)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use collections.Counter.\n\n   Steps using Counter:\n\n   Let s1 = guest, s2 = host, s3 = pile.\n\n   We need to check:\n        Counter(s1) + Counter(s2) == Counter(s3)\n\n   But note: the problem says \"no extra letters\", so the pile must have exactly the letters from s1+s2, and nothing else.\n\n   However, if there's an extra letter, then the Counter(s3) would have a letter not in s1+s2, or a higher frequency for some letter.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        We can see that the combined has 14 letters (count them: PAPAINOEL is 9, JOULUPUKKI is 10 -> total 19? Let me count: \n            PAPAINOEL: P(2), A(2), I(1), N(1), O(1), E(1), L(1) -> 9\n            JOULUPUKKI: J(1), O(1), U(2), L(1), P(1), U(2) [Wait, actually: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> 10] -> total 19.\n\n        Pile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI -> Let's count: \n            J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> 19 letters.\n\n        But the example output is \"NO\".\n\n        Why? Because there's an extra letter and a missing letter.\n\n        Actually, the example says: \"letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'\".\n\n        So, we have to check that the pile has exactly the same multiset of letters as the combined.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let me test with the second example:\n\n        s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\"\n        s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n        combined = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Counter for combined:\n            P: 3, A: 2, I: 2, N: 1, O: 2, E: 1, L: 1, J: 1, U: 3, K: 2\n\n        Counter for s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\":\n            Let's break down s3: \n                J:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, A:2 (already counted), O: already, I:2, L: already, E:1, L: already, U: already, P: already, U: already, K:2, K: already, I: already.\n\n            Actually, we can compute:\n\n            s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n            J:1\n            O:2\n            U:3\n            L:3   (because there are three L's: one in JOUL, and then two more: in 'LLUP'? Actually, the word is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI -> \n                    J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n                    So, L appears at index 3, then at index 10, and then at index 12? -> 3 times.\n\n            N:1\n            A:2\n            P:2\n            O: already 2\n            I:2\n            E:1\n            U:3\n            K:2\n\n            So, compared to the combined:\n\n            Combined: \n                P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:3, K:2\n\n            Pile: \n                P:2 (missing one P), L:3 (one extra L)\n\n            So indeed, the Counters are not equal.\n\n   This method will work.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so performance is not an issue.\n\n   Let me test the third sample:\n\n        Input: \n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        We are told the output is NO.\n\n        Combined: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Let's count the letters in the combined and in the pile.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the Counter.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            s1 = \"BABBONATALE\"\n            s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n            s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Combined length: len(s1) + len(s2) = 11 + 16 = 27.\n\n        Pile length: len(s3) = 27.\n\n        Now, we check the frequency.\n\n        But note: the example says there's an extra letter 'L'. So in the pile, there is an extra L and maybe one letter is missing elsewhere?\n\n        Actually, the example says: \"there's an extra letter 'L'\", meaning the pile has one extra L that shouldn't be there.\n\n        So, the combined string should have the same set of letters as the pile.\n\n        Let me count L in combined and in pile:\n\n            Combined: \n                BABBONATALE: \n                    B:2, A:3, O:1, N:1, T:1, A: (already), L:1 (at the end)\n                FATHERCHRISTMAS:\n                    F:1, A:1 (already), T:1 (already), H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H:1 (already), R:1 (already), I:1, S:1, T:1 (already), M:1, A:1 (already), S:1 (already)\n                So, in combined, total L: 1 (from BABBONATALE) and none from FATHERCHRISTMAS -> 1.\n\n            Pile: \n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n                Let's break down the pile: \n                    There's a substring \"TALLE\" -> so two L's: one in the first part and then two consecutive L's in \"TALLE\"?\n                    Actually, the pile is: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n                    We can split: \n                        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n                    Count L: \n                        First part: BABCHRISTMASBONAT -> no L until here? Then \"ALLE\": two L's.\n\n                    So, total L: 2.\n\n            Therefore, the pile has two L's, but the combined only has one. So the condition fails.\n\n        Hence, the program should output \"NO\".\n\n   Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n   Code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        def main():\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n\n            # If the total length of s1 and s2 is not equal to the length of s3, we can immediately say NO.\n            if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n            # Otherwise, check the letter frequencies.\n            if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the problem says the pile might have extra letters, so the length check is necessary but not sufficient. The frequency check is the real one.\n\n   But we can also skip the length check because if the lengths are different, the Counters won't match. However, the Counter comparison will take care of the length too (since it counts all characters). So we don't necessarily need the length check.\n\n   But the problem says the length is at most 100, so we can rely on Counter. However, if we do the length check first, we can avoid building two Counters when the lengths differ. \n\n   Alternatively, we can just do the Counter comparison and it will be efficient enough for strings of length up to 200 (since the maximum length of the combined string is 200).\n\n   Let me choose the simpler code without the explicit length check.\n\n   Revised code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n        Counter(s1+s2) = Counter('SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ')\n        Counter(s3) = Counter('SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS')\n\n        Are they equal?\n\n        We can break down the letters:\n\n        For s1+s2: \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1\n\n        Wait, let me recount for s1+s2:\n\n            SANTACLAUS: \n                S:1, A:2, N:1, T:1, A: (already), C:1, L:1, A: (already), U:1, S: (already) -> \n                S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n            DEDMOROZ:\n                D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, O: (already), Z:1\n\n            So overall: \n                S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Now for s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\":\n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        Same.\n\n   Example 2: as above, we know it's not equal.\n\n   Example 3: not equal.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input in the problem statement is given as a list of strings, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   We assume the input is provided via standard input, three lines.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   One more thing: the problem says the input consists of three lines. We are using input().strip() for each.\n\n   We'll run the code with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   Example 3:\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   We are good.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input file consists of three lines. We are reading from stdin.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        def main():\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n\n            if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        if __name__ == '__main__':\n            main()\n\n   However, note: the problem says the third line is the pile. But the example input has the third line as one string.\n\n   This code works for the sample inputs.\n\n   Let me run the provided example in the problem:\n\n        Input: \n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        But wait, the problem example input is given as a list of three elements, each being a string that contains the three lines? Actually, the example input is:\n\n            Input: ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        But note: the problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n        Our code reads three lines, so the first input() call reads the first line, etc.\n\n        However, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each containing a newline? Actually, the problem states:\n\n            The input file consists of three lines.\n\n        So if we are testing, we can pass the input via stdin.\n\n        But note: the example input is given as:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n        This is confusing. Actually, the problem says:\n\n            Input:\n                SANTACLAUS\n                DEDMOROZ\n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        So we are reading three separate lines.\n\n        The provided example in the problem statement is:\n\n            Input:\n                SANTACLAUS\n                DEDMOROZ\n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n            Output: YES\n\n        And similarly for the others.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the third line is the pile. Our code uses the third line as the pile.\n\n   Let me run the sample:\n\n        Example 1: \n            s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n            s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n            s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Example 2: \n            s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\"\n            s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n            s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Example 3:\n            s1 = \"BABBONATALE\"\n            s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n            s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n   All set.\n\n   But wait, the problem example input is given as a list of three strings, each being the entire three-line input? Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is not the way the input is given. The input is three lines, so we are reading three lines.\n\n   The example input is provided as three separate lines.\n\n   Therefore, we are good.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking the frequency of each letter in the combined names against the letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The first two lines of input represent the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line contains the letters found in the pile.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Frequency Check:** Use a counter to compare the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of each letter in the pile. If both counts match exactly, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter frequencies, ensuring no extra or missing letters are present in the pile compared to the combined names.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The program reads three lines of input: the guest's name (`s1`), the host's name (`s2`), and the pile of letters (`s3`).\n2. **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string (`s1 + s2`).\n3. **Counter Comparison:** The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile. If the counts match exactly, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n   \nThis method ensures that the solution is both efficient and straightforward, leveraging the `Counter` class to handle frequency counting, which simplifies the comparison process. The solution efficiently checks for the exact match required by the problem.",
