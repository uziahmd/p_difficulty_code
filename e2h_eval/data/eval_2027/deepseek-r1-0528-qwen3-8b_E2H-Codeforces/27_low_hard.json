On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can choose any contiguous interval [l, r] to reverse (i.e., flip the order) and then we want the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the entire sequence.\n\n Note: Since the array only contains 1 and 2, a non-decreasing subsequence is just a sequence of 1's followed by a sequence of 2's.\n\n However, after reversing an interval, the entire sequence becomes a mix of 1's and 2's. The goal is to maximize the length of the LNDS.\n\n Observation:\n Without any reversal, the entire sequence is fixed. The LNDS in a sequence of 1's and 2's is simply the total number of elements if we have all 1's or all 2's? Not exactly: \n Actually, the LNDS must be non-decreasing, so we can take as many 1's as possible and then as many 2's as possible. But note that we might have some 1's and then some 2's, but also there could be 1's after 2's which break the non-decreasing property.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. The entire sequence is composed of 1's and 2's.\n\n Let the original sequence be A.\n\n After reversal, the entire sequence will be three parts: [prefix][reversed segment][suffix].\n\n What does a non-decreasing subsequence look like?\n It can be entirely in the prefix, entirely in the reversed segment, entirely in the suffix, or spanning multiple parts.\n\n But note: the reversed segment: originally it was some sequence, say B, then reversed becomes B[::-1]. Since B consists of 1's and 2's, the reversed segment is just the reverse of B.\n\n However, note that the entire sequence after reversal is still made of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence can be:\n\n Option 1: Take all the 1's and then all the 2's? But wait: the entire sequence might not be separable into two contiguous blocks? Actually, because we are allowed to reverse one contiguous part, we can try to merge the 1's and 2's in a way that minimizes the breaks.\n\n Important: In fact, the entire sequence is still binary (only 1 and 2). Therefore, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it is the sum of the consecutive 1's and consecutive 2's? Not exactly: we can skip around, but note that since 1<=2, we can take any set of 1's and then any set of 2's that appear after the last 1 taken? Actually, no: the indices must be increasing.\n\n However, note: the entire sequence is just 1's and 2's. So the LNDS is the maximum between:\n   - The length of the entire sequence (if the entire sequence is non-decreasing) OR\n   - Otherwise, we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's, but they don't have to be contiguous in the original array, but the order must be preserved? Actually, the standard definition of non-decreasing subsequence for an array is that the values are non-decreasing and the indices are increasing.\n\n But note: we can take a 1 from an early part and then a 2 from a later part even if there are some 2's in between? Actually, yes. However, the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing, but the LNDS in a binary array with only 1 and 2 is simply the entire length of the sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can break the sequence into two parts: the 1's and the 2's, but we cannot skip the condition of increasing indices.\n\n Actually, the LNDS in a binary array (with values 1 and 2) is:\n   Let x = total number of 1's and y = total number of 2's.\n   Then the LNDS cannot exceed x+y = n.\n\n However, it is not necessarily n. For example, consider [2,1]: \n   The entire sequence is not non-decreasing. The longest non-decreasing subsequences are [2] or [1] (length 1). But wait, we can also have [2] and then if we can take a 1 that comes after a 2? Actually, no: because the condition requires increasing indices and non-decreasing values. In [2,1] we cannot take both because 2 then 1 is decreasing.\n\n Actually, the LNDS in [2,1] is 1.\n\n But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. So we can choose to reverse [2,1] to get [1,2] which",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (containing only 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous segment. The key observation here is that the LNDS in such a sequence is determined by the total number of 1s and 2s, but their arrangement must allow for a non-decreasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists of 1s and 2s. A non-decreasing subsequence can include all 1s followed by all 2s. The challenge is to reverse a contiguous segment to maximize the number of 1s followed by 2s.\n2. **Insight**: The optimal solution involves ensuring that as many 1s as possible appear before 2s. The reversal of a segment can help in moving 1s to the left and 2s to the right, thus maximizing the count of 1s followed by 2s.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Calculate the number of 1s and 2s up to each index from the start (prefix) and from the end (suffix).\n   - **Dynamic Programming or Two-pointer Technique**: For each possible segment reversal, compute the potential increase in the number of 1s followed by 2s. The solution involves checking all possible segments and determining the best reversal to maximize the LNDS.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently checks all possible segments with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is feasible given the constraint n ≤ 2000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    suffix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    prefix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i-1] == 1 else 0)\n        prefix_twos[i] = prefix_twos[i-1] + (1 if arr[i-1] == 2 else 0)\n        \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_ones[i] = suffix_ones[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0)\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n        \n    total_ones = prefix_ones[n]\n    total_twos = prefix_twos[n]\n    \n    best = max(total_ones, total_twos)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            left_ones = prefix_ones[i]\n            left_twos = prefix_twos[i]\n            \n            mid_ones = 0\n            mid_twos = 0\n            for k in range(i, j+1):\n                if arr[k] == 1:\n                    mid_ones += 1\n                else:\n                    mid_twos += 1\n                    \n            right_ones = suffix_ones[j+1]\n            right_twos = suffix_twos[j+1]\n            \n            ones_after = left_ones + mid_ones + right_ones\n            twos_after = left_twos + mid_twos + right_twos\n            \n            candidate = min(ones_after + twos_after, total_ones + total_twos)\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n                \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays store the cumulative counts of 1s and 2s from the start and end of the array, respectively. This helps in quickly accessing the number of 1s and 2s in any segment.\n2. **Initial Best Calculation**: The initial best value is set to the maximum between the total number of 1s or 2s, representing the scenario where no reversal is needed.\n3. **Segment Reversal Check**: For each possible segment [i, j], the code calculates the number of 1s and 2s outside the segment (using prefix and suffix arrays) and inside the segment (by direct iteration). The potential LNDS after reversing the segment is the sum of 1s followed by 2s, constrained by the total number of elements.\n4. **Output the Result**: After evaluating all segments, the maximum LNDS value is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments to find the optimal reversal that maximizes the LNDS, leveraging prefix and suffix sums for quick calculations.",
