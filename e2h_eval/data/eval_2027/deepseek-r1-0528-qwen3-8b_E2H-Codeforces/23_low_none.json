            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and then one of 'm', 'p', or 's'. But note: the input is given as three separate strings in one line? Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\", meaning we have one line with three space-separated strings? Or three tokens?\n\n Example input: \n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, actually the example input is shown as three separate examples. The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — but then the example shows three different inputs.\n\n Clarification from the example: There are three test cases, but the problem says the input is one line. Actually, reading the problem statement again: \"The only line contains three strings\".\n\n However, looking at the example:\n\n Input:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This seems to be showing three examples. But the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format.\n\n Actually, the problem states: \n   \"The only line contains three strings\"\n\n And the example output is:\n   ['0', '0', '1']\n\n So I think the input is one line with three tiles (each tile is represented by two characters) separated by spaces. But wait, each tile is two characters. Then three tiles would be six characters? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the input is three strings, each string being one tile? But the example input is shown as three strings that contain spaces.\n\n Let me read the example input again: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is confusing. Actually, the example input is given as three separate examples, but the problem states that the input is one line with three strings (each string being one tile?).\n\n After checking the problem statement: \n   \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n But note: the representation of a tile is two characters. So if there are three tiles, the entire line would be, for example, \"1s2s3s\" (without spaces) or \"1s 2s 3s\"?\n\n The problem says: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n And the example input is shown as three strings in a list, but actually in the problem description, the input is one line with three such strings (each two-character string). But wait, the example input has spaces separating the three tiles? \n\n Actually, the problem does not specify whether the three tiles are space separated. But the example output shows three numbers (0, 0, 1). \n\n Since the problem says \"the only line contains three strings\", and each string is a tile (which is two characters), then the input would look like:\n\n   \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n meaning three strings (tiles) separated by spaces.\n\n But wait, then how do we parse? We can split the input line by spaces, and then each token should be two characters.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the input line and split it into a list of three strings (each string is two characters).\n    Example: \"1s 2s 3s\" -> ['1s','2s','3s']\n\n 2. But wait, what if the input is given without spaces? The problem says \"three strings\", so they are separated by spaces.\n\n However, the problem also says: \"each tile is represented as 1m, 2m, etc.\" — which is two characters.\n\n But note: the example input in the problem statement is written with spaces separating the tiles: \n        ['1s 2s 3s', ...] \n\n So we can safely assume the input is three two-character strings separated by spaces.\n\n However, let's check the example: \n        Input: \"3p 9m 2p\" (from the third example) — this is three tiles.\n\n 3. We need to consider that the hand has three tiles initially.\n\n How many extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu)?\n\n Note: A mentsu requires exactly three tiles.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Case 0: Already has a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu) -> 0.\n\n Case 1: Not having any mentsu initially.\n\n We can consider:\n\n Option 1: Drawing 0 tiles: if already a mentsu -> 0.\n\n Otherwise",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit (e.g., 1m, 2m, 3m).\n   - The goal is to check if the initial three tiles form either a koutsu or a shuntsu. If not, determine the minimal number of additional tiles needed to form one.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Check for Koutsu**: If all three tiles are identical, no extra tiles are needed.\n   - **Check for Shuntsu**: If the tiles can be rearranged into a sequence (like 1m, 2m, 3m) in the same suit, then no extra tiles are needed.\n   - **Drawing Tiles**: If the initial hand doesn't form a mentsu, we consider drawing 1 or 2 tiles. Drawing one tile might complete a shuntsu (if two tiles are part of a potential sequence) or a koutsu (if two tiles are identical and we need one more). Drawing two tiles could complete a koutsu if all three are the same or a shuntsu if two tiles are part of a sequence.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Initial Check**: Verify if the hand already contains a koutsu or shuntsu.\n   - **Single Draw Check**: Determine if drawing one tile can form a mentsu by checking for sequences or triplets.\n   - **Double Draw Check**: If drawing one tile isn't sufficient, check if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu.\n   - **Result Determination**: Based on the above checks, return 0, 1, or 2 as the minimal number of draws required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = [tile[:2] for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check if there's a koutsu (three same tiles)\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for shuntsu\n    def is_shuntsu(tiles):\n        if len(set(tiles)) != 3:\n            return False\n        suits = set()\n        numbers = []\n        for tile in tiles:\n            num = int(tile[0])\n            suit = tile[1]\n            if suit not in suits:\n                suits.add(suit)\n            numbers.append(num)\n        if len(suits) != 1:\n            return False\n        numbers.sort()\n        if numbers[0] + 1 == numbers[1] and numbers[1] + 1 == numbers[2]:\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    if is_shuntsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check with one extra tile\n    suits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_by_suit = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count_by_suit[tile[1]] += 1\n    count_by_number = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count_by_number[(tile[0], tile[1])] += 1\n\n    # Check if two tiles are the same (for triplet)\n    if any(count == 2 for count in count_by_suit.values()):\n        # Need one more tile of the same type to complete triplet\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Check if there are two tiles of the same suit and their numbers can form a sequence with one missing\n    for suit in suits:\n        suit_tiles = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles if tile[1] == suit]\n        if len(suit_tiles) < 2:\n            continue\n        unique_numbers = set(suit_tiles)\n        if len(unique_numbers) < 2:\n            continue\n        possible_sequences = []\n        min_num = min(unique_numbers)\n        max_num = max(unique_numbers)\n        for i in range(min_num, max_num + 1):\n            if i not in unique_numbers:\n                possible_sequences.append(i)\n        if len(possible_sequences) == 1:\n            print(1)\n            return\n\n    # Check for two tiles forming a triplet (each appears twice) — but we already checked for two tiles being same?

If yes, it prints 0 and exits.\n2. **Shuntsu Check**: The code checks if the three tiles form a sequence (shuntsu) by verifying they are of the same suit and their numbers are consecutive.\n3. **Single Draw Check**: The code checks if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves checking for two tiles of the same suit with a missing number for a sequence or two identical tiles needing one more for a triplet.\n4. **Double Draw Check**: If no mentsu can be formed with zero or one draw, the code defaults to two draws, which is the maximum needed to form a mentsu in this scenario.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws required, ensuring optimal performance.",
