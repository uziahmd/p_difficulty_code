    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing an element might help reduce the overall instability (which is max - min) of the array.\n Observation: The instability of the array is determined by the maximum and minimum elements. Removing one element can only change the maximum or the minimum (or both).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the array.\n 2. Note that if we remove an element, the new array's min and max will be:\n    - If we remove the current global min, then the new min becomes the next smallest element.\n    - Similarly for the global max.\n\n However, note that the instability of the remaining array is max_remaining - min_remaining.\n\n We can consider two types of removals:\n   a) Removing an element that is not the min or max? Actually, we have to consider the effect on the entire range.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   Since the array is sorted, let's denote the sorted array as b[0..n-1] (so b[0] is the smallest, b[n-1] is the largest).\n\n What are the possibilities?\n   Possibility 1: Remove an element that is not the first or last. Then the min remains b[0] and max remains b[n-1], so the instability is still (b[n-1]-b[0]).\n   Possibility 2: Remove the first element. Then the new array is [b[1], b[2], ..., b[n-1]], and instability = b[n-1] - b[1].\n   Possibility 3: Remove the last element. Then the new array is [b[0], b[1], ..., b[n-2]], and instability = b[n-2] - b[0].\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is not the first or last but it is part of the current min or max? Actually, the above two possibilities (removing the first or last) are the only ones that change the min or max.\n\n However, note: There might be duplicate values. For example, if the array has duplicates, then removing one occurrence of the min might not necessarily remove the min from the entire array.\n\n Actually, we should consider that the min and max might appear multiple times. Therefore, we cannot just remove the first or last element and assume that the min and max change. \n\n Let me reframe:\n\n After sorting, the instability of the entire array is (b[-1] - b[0]).\n\n Now, when we remove an element, the new min is either:\n   - The same as the old min (if we didn't remove the first occurrence of the min) OR \n   - The next distinct value (if we removed the first occurrence and there was no duplicate, then the next value is the new min).\n\n Similarly for the max.\n\n However, note that the array is sorted. So after removing an element at index i, the new min is:\n   - If i==0, then the new min is b[1] (provided n>=2, which it is).\n   - Otherwise, the min remains b[0] (because there's still at least one element with value b[0]).\n\n Similarly, the new max is:\n   - If i==n-1, then the new max is b[n-2].\n   - Otherwise, the max remains b[n-1].\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is not the first or last, but it is the only occurrence of the min? Then the min would become the next value, but note: if we remove an element that is the only min, then the min is not at index0 anymore? Actually, the array is sorted, so all the min values are consecutive at the beginning.\n\n Actually, the array is sorted. So the min value is b[0] and all the elements from b[0] to the first distinct value are the same.\n\n How does removal affect?\n\n Case 1: Removing the first element (b[0]). Then the new min is b[1] (unless n==1, but n>=2). The max remains b[-1]. The instability is b[-1]-b[1].\n\n Case 2: Removing the last element (b[-1]). Then the new max is b[-2] and the min remains b[0]. The instability is b[-2]-b[0].\n\n Case 3: Removing an element in the middle. Then the min and max do not change, because there are still elements at the beginning (min) and end (max). So the instability remains (b[-1]-b[0]).\n\n However, wait: what if we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min (but there are duplicates)? Actually, if there are duplicates, then even if we remove one occurrence of the min, the min might still be present (if there's another min). Therefore, the above cases 1 and 2 are sufficient.\n\n But consider: what if the array has multiple min values? Then removing one min (at the beginning) doesn't change the min? Actually, if we have [1,1,3,7] and we remove the first 1, then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> min is 1. So the instability becomes 7-1=6, which is same as before.\n\n So we need to consider: the removal of an element that is the first occurrence of the min (and there is no other min) then the min increases. Similarly for the max.\n\n However, note: the array is sorted. The first occurrence of the min is the first element. But if we remove the first element and there is a duplicate of the min, then the second element is also the min. Then the new min is still the min.\n\n So the key is: the removal of the first element (which is the min) only changes the min if that element was the last occurrence of the min? Actually, no: the array is sorted, so if there are duplicates, then the min appears consecutively. Therefore, if we remove one occurrence of the min (even if it's the first), the min remains the same until we remove all occurrences.\n\n But note: we are only removing one element.\n\n Therefore, the new min after removing an element at index i is:\n   - If i == 0 and the next element is greater than b[0] (meaning we removed the last occurrence of the min), then the new min is b[1].\n   - Otherwise, the min is still b[0] (because there is at least one more min).\n\n Similarly, for the max: \n   - If i == n-1 and the previous element is less than b[-1] (i.e., the last element is the only occurrence of the max), then the new max is b[-2].\n   - Otherwise, the max is still b[-1].\n\n However, we don't know the frequency of the min and max. But note: we are only removing one element.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider candidate removals that change the min or the max. The candidate removals are those that remove the first occurrence of the min or the last occurrence of the max. But note: the array is sorted, so the min is at the beginning and max at the end.\n\n Actually, we can think of the following:\n\n The instability of the array without the element at index i is:\n   candidate_instability(i) = (b[-1] if i != n-1 else b[-2]) - (b[0] if i != 0 else b[1])\n\n But wait, that formula is only valid if the min or max changes. However, if we remove an element that is not the min, then the min remains b[0]; if we remove an element that is not the max, then the max remains b[-1]. \n\n However, note: we must account for the fact that the min and max might be repeated. But the above candidate_instability(i) does not account for the possibility that removing an element in the middle might not change the min or max, but then the instability remains the same.\n\n But actually, the instability of the entire array (with n elements) is (b[-1]-b[0]). Removing an element that is not the min or max won't change the min or max, so the instability remains (b[-1]-b[0]). However, if we remove an element that is the min (but there are duplicates) then the min remains the same, so the instability remains (b[-1]-b[0]). Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, the only removals that matter are those that remove the last occurrence of the min or the last occurrence of the max.\n\n However, note: if we remove an element that is the min, and there are duplicates, then the min doesn't change. Similarly for the max.\n\n So the candidate removals that change the min are only when we remove the very first element and there is no duplicate (so the next element is larger). Similarly for the max.\n\n But wait, what if the array has two distinct min values? Actually, the min is defined by the smallest value. So if we remove one occurrence of the min, then the min is still the same unless we remove the last occurrence.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]   # when we remove the first element (if the first element is the unique min, then the new min is b[1])\n candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0]   # when we remove the last element (if the last element is the unique max, then the new max is b[-2])\n\n But what if the first element is duplicated? Then candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0] (since the min doesn't change) and similarly for candidate2.\n\n However, note: if we remove the first element and the min is duplicated, then the min remains the same. Then the instability is (b[-1] - b[0]), which is the same as the original. Similarly, if we remove the last element and the max is duplicated, then the instability is (b[-1] - b[0]).\n\n Therefore, we must consider that the removal of the first element might not change the min if there is a duplicate, so then the instability is (b[-1] - b[0]) (same as original). Similarly for the last.\n\n But we are allowed to remove any one element. We want the minimum instability.\n\n We can consider:\n\n Option 1: Removing an element that is not the min or max -> instability = (b[-1]-b[0])\n Option 2: Removing the first element (if it leads to a lower instability) -> candidate1 = b[-1] - (b[1] if we removed the only min, otherwise b[0]) \n Option 3: Removing the last element (if it leads to a lower instability) -> candidate2 = (b[-2] if we removed the only max, otherwise b[-1]) - b[0]\n\n But how to know if the first element is the only min? We can check if the first element is equal to the second element. If yes, then removing the first element doesn't change the min. Similarly, if the last element is equal to the second last, then removing the last element doesn't change the max.\n\n Therefore, we can define:\n\n candidate1 = \n   if b[0] == b[1]: then removing the first element leaves the min unchanged -> instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n   else: removing the first element sets the min to b[1] -> instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n Similarly, candidate2 = \n   if b[-1] == b[-2]: then removing the last element leaves the max unchanged -> instability = b[-1] - b[0] (because the max is still b[-1] and min is still b[0])\n   else: removing the last element sets the max to b[-2] -> instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n However, note: what if we remove an element that is neither the first nor the last? Then the instability is (b[-1]-b[0]).\n\n But wait, is (b[-1]-b[0]) always the same as the original? Yes, because we didn't change the min or max.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the minimum among:\n   candidate1 (if we remove the first element, but note: we are allowed to remove any element, so we don't have to consider non-first and non-last separately because they yield the same result as the original)\n   candidate2 (if we remove the last element)\n   and the original instability (if we remove an element from the middle) but note: we are allowed to remove any element, so we are already covering the possibility of removing the first, last, and any other.\n\n Actually, we don't need to consider the original instability because if we remove an element that is not the first or last, the instability remains (b[-1]-b[0]). But note: we are looking for the minimum instability. So the answer is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and (b[-1]-b[0])? \n\n However, wait: candidate1 and candidate2 might be worse than (b[-1]-b[0])? Actually, no: removing an element that is the min (and it was the only min) reduces the min, which might increase the instability? Let's see:\n\n Example: [1, 3, 3, 7] \n   Original instability: 7-1 = 6.\n   candidate1 (remove first): [3,3,7] -> instability 4 (7-3=4) -> better.\n   candidate2 (remove last): [1,3,3] -> instability 2 (3-1=2) -> better.\n\n But wait, candidate2 is 2, which is less than 6.\n\n However, note: the above example shows that sometimes removing the first element gives a higher instability than removing the last, and vice versa.\n\n So we must consider all possibilities? Actually, we are allowed to remove any one element. The best candidate is the minimum of:\n\n   candidate1: if we remove the first element (which may or may not change the min) -> instability1 = (b[-1] - (b[1] if the first element was the only min else b[0]))\n   candidate2: if we remove the last element (which may or may not change the max) -> instability2 = ((b[-2] if the last element was the only max else b[-1]) - b[0])\n   candidate3: if we remove an element that is not the first or last, then the instability remains (b[-1]-b[0])\n\n But note: we are allowed to remove any element. Removing an element that is not the first or last is equivalent to leaving the min and max unchanged, so the instability is (b[-1]-b[0]).\n\n However, we are trying to minimize the instability. So we can choose the best removal.\n\n But note: we don't have to consider every removal. We can consider:\n\n   Option A: Remove an element that is the first occurrence of the min (if any) and see the effect.\n   Option B: Remove an element that is the last occurrence of the max (if any) and see the effect.\n\n However, what if we remove an element that is both the min and the max? That is, the array has only one distinct value (like [1,1,1,...,1]). Then removing any element, the min and max remain 1, so the instability is 0.\n\n Actually, the above candidate1 and candidate2 would be:\n\n   candidate1: if the first element is the only min? In this case, the first element is 1 and the second is 1, so candidate1 = 1-1 = 0? Actually, we defined candidate1 as: \n        if b[0]==b[1]: then candidate1 = b[-1]-b[0] = 1-1=0.\n\n   candidate2: if the last element is the only max? Similarly, if the last element is 1 and the second last is 1, then candidate2 = b[-2]-b[0] = 1-1=0.\n\n And the middle removal also gives 0.\n\n So the answer would be 0.\n\n But note: there are other removals (non-first and non-last) that also yield 0.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   ans = min( \n        (b[-1] - b[0]) ,   # removing an element that is not the first or last (or even if it is, but if the min/max remains the same, then this is the value)\n        (b[-1] - b[1]) if b[0] != b[1] else (b[-1]-b[0]),   # if the first element is the only min, then removing it changes the min to b[1]; else, the min remains and the instability is the same.\n        (b[-2] - b[0]) if b[-1] != b[-2] else (b[-1]-b[0])   # if the last element is the only max, then removing it changes the max to b[-2]; else, the max remains and the instability is the same.\n   )\n\n However, wait: the above candidate1 and candidate2 are computed as if we only consider removing the first or last element. But what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then we get the original instability. So we are comparing three candidates:\n\n   candidate1: remove first element (if it's the only min, then we get a new min; else, we get the same instability as the original)\n   candidate2: remove last element (if it's the only max, then we get a new max; else, same as original)\n   candidate3: remove an arbitrary element (which gives the original instability)\n\n But note: candidate1 and candidate2 might be worse than candidate3? Actually, they are computed to be at most the original (if not changed) or even smaller (if changed). \n\n However, we must consider that there might be other removals that are not the first or last that lead to a lower instability? Actually, no: because if we remove an element from the middle, the min and max don't change, so the instability remains the same as the original. So candidate3 is the original.\n\n But wait: what if we remove an element that is not the first or last, but it is part of the min or max? Actually, if we remove an element that is the min (but not the first one, because the array is sorted) then the min remains the same. Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, the above three candidates cover all possibilities.\n\n However, note: the above candidate1 and candidate2 are defined for removing the first and last element. But what if we remove an element that is the min (but not the first)? Actually, the array is sorted, so all min values are at the beginning. Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, the only way to change the min is to remove an element from the contiguous block of min values. But note: if we remove an element from the middle of the min block (not the first one) then the min remains the same. Similarly, the only way to change the max is to remove the last element (if the max appears only once) or if we remove an element from the middle of the max block (the last one) then the max remains the same.\n\n So we don't need to consider removals from the middle of the min or max blocks because they don't change the min or max.\n\n Therefore, the solution:\n\n   Sort the array.\n   Let original_instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n   candidate1 = original_instability\n        if the first element is the only min (i.e., b[0] < b[1]): then candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]\n        else: candidate1 = original_instability\n\n   candidate2 = original_instability\n        if the last element is the only max (i.e., b[-1] > b[-2]): then candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0]\n        else: candidate2 = original_instability\n\n   Then answer = min(original_instability, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n But wait: what if the array has two distinct values, for example [1,2,2,3]? \n   Original_instability = 3-1 = 2.\n   candidate1: since the first element is 1 and the next is 2 (which is greater), so candidate1 = 3-2 = 1.\n   candidate2: the last element is 3 and the previous is 2 (which is less), so candidate2 = 2-1 = 1.\n   Then answer = min(2,1,1) = 1.\n\n But what if we remove the first element? Then the array becomes [2,2,3] -> instability 3-2=1 -> correct.\n   Remove the last element: [1,2,2] -> instability 2-1=1 -> correct.\n\n However, what if the array is [1,2,3,4]?\n   Original_instability = 3.\n   candidate1: remove first -> [2,3,4] -> 4-2=2.\n   candidate2: remove last -> [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2.\n   Then answer = min(3,2,2)=2.\n\n Another example: [1,1,2,3] (min duplicated)\n   Original_instability = 3-1=2.\n   candidate1: first element is 1, and the next is 1 -> same, so candidate1 = 2.\n   candidate2: last element is 3, and the previous is 2 (different) -> candidate2 = 2-1=1.\n   Then answer = min(2,2,1)=1.\n\n But wait: if we remove the last element (3) then the array becomes [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability=1, correct.\n\n However, if we remove the first element (1) then the array becomes [1,2,3] -> instability=2, which is worse.\n\n So the above method for candidate1 and candidate2 is correct.\n\n But note: the condition for candidate1 is not just that the first element is the only min (i.e., b[0] < b[1]), but also we must ensure that we are allowed to change the min. Actually, if there are multiple min, then removing one of them (even the first) doesn't change the min. But our condition \"if b[0] < b[1]\" is exactly the condition that the first element is the only min.\n\n Similarly, for candidate2: if b[-1] > b[-2] then the last element is the only max.\n\n However, what if the array has more than two distinct values? The above conditions still hold.\n\n But note: the array might be of size 2. Example: n=2, [1,100000]\n   Original_instability = 99999.\n   candidate1: remove first -> [100000] -> instability 0? But wait, the array has one element: max=min=100000 -> 0.\n        Condition for candidate1: first element is 1, next is 100000 -> 1<100000 -> true, so candidate1 = 100000 - 100000 = 0.\n   candidate2: remove last -> [1] -> instability 0.\n        Condition for candidate2: last element 100000 > 1 (the second last) -> true, so candidate2 = 1 - 1? Wait, no: candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0] = 1 - 1? Actually, the array is [1,100000] so b[-2]=1 and b[0]=1, so candidate2 = 1-1=0.\n\n   Then answer = min(99999,0,0)=0.\n\n This matches the sample.\n\n However, note: the above candidate1 and candidate2 calculations for n=2 are correct.\n\n But wait, what if we have [1,2]?\n   Original_instability = 1.\n   candidate1: remove first -> [2] -> instability 0.\n   candidate2: remove last -> [1] -> instability 0.\n   Then answer = 0.\n\n This is correct.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read n\n   Read list a of n integers\n\n   Sort a\n\n   original_instability = a[-1] - a[0]\n\n   candidate1 = original_instability\n   if n >= 2 and a[0] < a[1]:\n        candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n   candidate2 = original_instability\n   if n >= 2 and a[-1] > a[-2]:\n        candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n   Then answer = min(original_instability, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n But wait: what if n==1? The problem states n>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n However, note: the above conditions use n>=2, which is given.\n\n But what if we have an array of two identical elements? [1,1] -> n=2\n   original_instability = 0.\n   candidate1: a[0] < a[1]? 1<1 -> false -> candidate1 = 0.\n   candidate2: a[-1] > a[-2]? 1>1 -> false -> candidate2 = 0.\n   Then answer = 0.\n\n Correct.\n\n However, what if the array is [1,1,2]?\n   original_instability = 2-1=1.\n   candidate1: a[0] < a[1] -> 1<1 -> false -> candidate1=1.\n   candidate2: a[-1] > a[-2] -> 2>1 -> true -> candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0] = 1-1=0.\n\n   Then answer = min(1,1,0)=0.\n\n Correct: because we can remove the last element (the 2) and the array becomes [1,1] with instability 0.\n\n But note: we can also remove the first or second element (both 1) and the instability remains 1.\n\n However, we are allowed to choose the removal that minimizes the instability. So we choose to remove the last element.\n\n Therefore, the code:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n   original_instability = a[-1] - a[0]\n\n   candidate1 = original_instability\n   if n >= 2 and a[0] < a[1]:\n        candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n   candidate2 = original_instability\n   if n >= 2 and a[-1] > a[-2]:\n        candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n   print(min(original_instability, candidate1, candidate2))\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: Input \"4\\n1 3 3 7\"\n   a = [1,3,3,7]\n   original_instability = 7-1=6\n   candidate1: 1<3 -> True -> candidate1 = 7-3=4\n   candidate2: 7>3 -> True -> candidate2 = 3-1=2\n   min(6,4,2)=2 -> correct.\n\n Example 2: Input \"2\\n1 100000\"\n   a = [1,100000]\n   original_instability = 99999\n   candidate1: 1<100000 -> True -> candidate1 = 100000-100000=0\n   candidate2: 100000>1 -> True -> candidate2 = 1-1=0\n   min(99999,0,0)=0 -> correct.\n\n Example 3: [1,1,2] -> 0, as above.\n\n But wait, what if we have [1,2,3,4]?\n   original_instability=3\n   candidate1: 1<2 -> True -> candidate1=4-2=2\n   candidate2: 4>3 -> True -> candidate2=3-1=2\n   min(3,2,2)=2 -> correct.\n\n However, what if we have [1,2,2,3]?\n   original_instability=3-1=2\n   candidate1: 1<2 -> True -> candidate1=3-2=1\n   candidate2: 3>2 -> True -> candidate2=2-1=1\n   min(2,1,1)=1 -> correct.\n\n But wait, consider [1,2,3,4,5] (all distinct)\n   original_instability=4\n   candidate1: remove first -> [2,3,4,5] -> 5-2=3\n   candidate2: remove last -> [1,2,3,4] -> 4-1=3\n   Then answer=3.\n\n But is that the minimum? \n   Removing the first: 5-2=3\n   Removing the last: 4-1=3\n   Removing any other: e.g., remove 3 -> [1,2,4,5] -> 5-1=4, which is worse.\n\n So 3 is the minimum.\n\n However, note: there's an alternative view: what if we remove an element that is not the first or last, but we are forced to leave the min and max? Then the instability remains 4. But 3 is less than 4.\n\n But wait, we are allowed to remove any one element. So we can remove the first or the last, and we get 3.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, consider the possibility: what if we remove an element that is not the first or last, but the min and max change because the removed element was the max or min? But in a sorted array, the min is at the beginning and max at the end. Removing an inner element that is the min? But the min is at the beginning. Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, the above reasoning holds.\n\n Code:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n   if n == 1:\n        # According to the problem, n>=2, but just in case we include.\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        original_instability = a[-1] - a[0]\n        candidate1 = original_instability\n        if a[0] < a[1]:\n            candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n        candidate2 = original_instability\n        if a[-1] > a[-2]:\n            candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n        ans = min(original_instability, candidate1, candidate2)\n        print(ans)\n\n However, wait: what if the array has more than two distinct values and we remove an element that is not the first or last, but the min and max remain the same? Then the instability is the same as the original, but we are already considering the original_instability in the min.\n\n But note: we are taking the minimum of three values, and the third value is the original_instability (which is the result of removing a non-first and non-last element, or even if we remove first or last but the min/max didn't change).\n\n Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n Let me run through the example [1,2,3,4] again: \n   a=[1,2,3,4]\n   original_instability = 3\n   candidate1: a[0]=1 < a[1]=2 -> True, so candidate1=4-2=2\n   candidate2: a[-1]=4 > a[-2]=3 -> True, so candidate2=3-1=2\n   Then min(3,2,2)=2 -> correct.\n\n One more: [1,2,3,4,5] -> \n   original_instability=4\n   candidate1: 1<2 -> True -> candidate1=5-2=3\n   candidate2: 5>4 -> True -> candidate2=4-1=3\n   Then min(4,3,3)=3 -> correct.\n\n However, wait: what if we remove an element that is not the first or last and the array has duplicate values? Example: [1,1,2,3] (already considered) -> it worked.\n\n But wait: what if we have [1,2,3,3]?\n   original_instability=3-1=2.\n   candidate1: 1<2 -> True -> candidate1=3-2=1.\n   candidate2: 3==3 -> so condition fails -> candidate2=2.\n   Then answer = min(2,1,2)=1.\n\n Explanation: \n   Removing the first element (1): [2,3,3] -> instability 3-2=1 -> correct.\n   Removing the last element (3): [1,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2 -> so candidate2 is 2.\n\n But note: we are allowed to remove any element. We found that removing the first element gives 1, which is better.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the above candidate2 condition is for the last element being the only max. In [1,2,3,3] the last element is 3 and the second last is 3, so we don't change the max. Therefore, candidate2 remains 2.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n   original_instability = a[-1] - a[0]\n   candidate1 = original_instability\n   if a[0] < a[1]:\n        candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n   candidate2 = original_instability\n   if a[-1] > a[-2]:\n        candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n   print(min(original_instability, candidate1, candidate2))\n\n But wait, what if the array has length 1? The problem says n>=2, so we don't handle n=1.\n\n We are safe.\n\n Let me submit the code.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say n>=2, so we don't need to worry about n=1.\n\n But wait, there's a catch: what if we have an array of two elements, and they are the same? [1,1] -> \n   original_instability=0.\n   candidate1: 1<1 -> False -> candidate1=0.\n   candidate2: 1>1 -> False -> candidate2=0.\n   Then answer=0.\n\n Correct.\n\n But what if the array has three elements and two are the same? [1,1,2] -> \n   candidate1: 1<1 -> False -> candidate1=2 (original_instability=2-1=1 -> wait, no: the array [1,1,2] has original_instability=1.\n   Then candidate1 = 1 (because we set candidate1 to the original_instability, which is 1) and candidate2: 2>1 -> True -> candidate2=1-1=0.\n\n   Then answer = min(1,1,0)=0.\n\n But wait, the original_instability is 1 (from 2-1). Then candidate1 is set to 1 (because the condition fails) and candidate2 is set to 0 (because the condition passes). Then min(1,1,0)=0.\n\n Correct.\n\n However, wait: the condition for candidate1 uses the original_instability, which is 1. But the condition for candidate2 uses the original_instability, which is 1.\n\n But note: the calculation for candidate1 is done by: if the condition fails, we leave candidate1 as the original_instability. So that's correct.\n\n But wait: in the example [1,1,2] the original_instability is 1. Then candidate1 is 1 (because the condition fails) and candidate2 is 0 (because the condition passes). Then we take the minimum of 1,1,0 -> 0.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n I think we are ready.\n\n However, note: the above candidate1 and candidate2 are computed by only considering the removal of the first and last element. But what if we remove an element that is the min (but not the first) or the max (but not the last)? \n\n Actually, because the array is sorted, the min is at the beginning and the max at the end. So if we remove an element that is the min (but not the first) then the min remains the same. Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, we don't need to consider removals from the middle.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n   orig = a[-1] - a[0]\n   cand1 = orig\n   if a[0] < a[1]:\n        cand1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n   cand2 = orig\n   if a[-1] > a[-2]:\n        cand2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n   print(min(orig, cand1, cand2))\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: 4\\n1 3 3 7 -> [1,3,3,7] -> orig=6, cand1=7-3=4 (because 1<3), cand2=3-1=2 (because 7>3) -> min(6,4,2)=2 -> correct.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: 2\\n1 100000 -> [1,100000] -> orig=99999, cand1=100000-100000=0 (because 1<100",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in easily identifying the current minimum and maximum elements.\n2. **Calculate Original Instability**: The initial instability is the difference between the last (maximum) and first (minimum) elements of the sorted array.\n3. **Evaluate Candidates for Minimum Instability**:\n   - **Candidate 1**: Remove the first element. If the first element is the only occurrence of the minimum value, the new minimum becomes the second element. The instability then is the difference between the last element and this new minimum.\n   - **Candidate 2**: Remove the last element. If the last element is the only occurrence of the maximum value, the new maximum becomes the second last element. The instability then is the difference between this new maximum and the first element.\n4. **Determine the Minimum Instability**: Compare the original instability with the two candidate instabilities derived from removing the first or last element (if they reduce the instability) and select the smallest value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\norig = a[-1] - a[0]\ncand1 = orig\nif n >= 2 and a[0] < a[1]:\n    cand1 = a[-1] - a[1]\ncand2 = orig\nif n >= 2 and a[-1] > a[-2]:\n    cand2 = a[-2] - a[0]\nprint(min(orig, cand1, cand2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum elements. For example, the smallest element is at index 0 and the largest at index `n-1`.\n2. **Original Instability Calculation**: The initial instability is computed as the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array.\n3. **Candidate Evaluation**:\n   - **Removing the First Element**: If the first element is unique (i.e., not repeated), removing it changes the minimum to the next element. The instability is then recalculated using the new minimum and the existing maximum.\n   - **Removing the Last Element**: Similarly, if the last element is unique, removing it changes the maximum to the previous element. The instability is recalculated using the existing minimum and the new maximum.\n4. **Result Determination**: The smallest instability among the original, and the two candidate values (from removing the first or last element) is printed as the result. This approach efficiently narrows down the solution by focusing on the most impactful removals (first or last element) while considering duplicates that might not change the instability.",
