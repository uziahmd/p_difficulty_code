    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized. If multiple k yield the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nLet d = a - b. Without loss of generality, we can assume a >= b by swapping if needed? Actually, note: we have two numbers: (a+k) and (b+k). The LCM is symmetric in the two numbers, but we can also consider the difference: let g = (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b (which is fixed). \n\nBut note: if a < b, then we can swap the roles. Alternatively, we can consider:\n\nLet x = a+k, y = b+k. Then x-y = a-b (a constant). We want to minimize LCM(x,y).\n\nNote: LCM(x,y) = |x*y| / GCD(x,y). Since x and y are positive (because k>=0 and a,b>=1), we have LCM(x,y) = (x*y)/GCD(x,y).\n\nAlternatively, note that GCD(x,y) must divide (x-y). So GCD(x,y) divides (a-b). Therefore, the divisors of the absolute value of (a-b) will be candidates for the GCD.\n\nBut note: if a==b, then x=y, so LCM(x,y)=x = a+k. We want to minimize a+k, so the smallest k is 0 (since k=0 gives x=y=a, and any k>0 would give a larger number).\n\nIf a != b, then let d = |a-b|. The idea is that the GCD of (a+k) and (b+k) must be a divisor of d. And note that as k increases, the numbers increase. However, we can try to fix the GCD, say g, which divides d. Then we require:\n   g divides (a+k) and (b+k), i.e., g divides (a+k) and (b+k). But note that (a+k) mod g = 0 and (b+k) mod g = 0. Since (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b, then g must divide (a-b). \n\nWe can set g to be a divisor of d. Then, we can set k to be the smallest non-negative integer such that:\n   (a+k) ≡ 0 (mod g)   and   (b+k) ≡ 0 (mod g)\n\nBut note: (a+k) ≡ 0 (mod g) is equivalent to k ≡ (-a) mod g, and similarly k ≡ (-b) mod g. These two conditions must hold. However, since (a-b) is divisible by g, the two congruences are actually consistent: because (-a) ≡ (-b) mod g, since g divides (a-b) => a ≡ b mod g, so -a ≡ -b mod g.\n\nTherefore, for each divisor g of d (where d = |a-b|), we can compute the smallest non-negative k0 such that k0 ≡ (-a) mod g. Then, k0 = (g - a % g) % g. However, note: if a % g == 0, then k0=0. Otherwise, k0 = g - (a % g). But wait: we require k0 to be at least 0 and less than g.\n\nBut note: we are considering divisors of d. However, note that d might be negative? No, we take absolute value.\n\nBut there is a catch: the problem does not require us to iterate over all divisors and then choose the best k? Actually, we are to minimize the LCM. \n\nHow do we relate the candidate k from divisor g to the LCM?\n\nRecall: \n   Let x = a+k, y = b+k, then GCD(x,y) = g (if we set k appropriately). Then LCM(x,y) = (x * y) / g.\n\nBut note: we don't know if setting k to satisfy the condition for g will yield the GCD exactly as g. Actually, the GCD might be a multiple of g? But wait: we are iterating over divisors of d, and the GCD must divide d. However, the actual GCD might be a multiple of g? Actually, no: the GCD must be a divisor of d, and if we set k so that g divides both numbers, then the GCD is at least g. But it could be larger? However, note: we are fixing g as one divisor, but the actual GCD might be a divisor that is a multiple of g? \n\nWait, actually, the condition we are imposing is that g divides both numbers. But the actual GCD might be any divisor of d that is greater than or equal to g? Actually, no: the GCD must divide d, and we are iterating over all divisors. However, note: if we set k to make the numbers divisible by g, then the GCD might be a multiple of g (if there is a common divisor larger than g). But note: we are iterating over divisors of d, and if we consider the divisors in increasing order, then the candidate k from a divisor g might be associated with an LCM that is not minimal if a larger divisor (with a smaller k?) yields a smaller LCM.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: the LCM is (x * y) / GCD(x,y). Since x and y are (a+k) and (b+k), and k is chosen so that the GCD is at least g (the divisor we fixed). But note: the LCM is inversely proportional to the GCD. So the larger the GCD, the smaller the LCM.\n\nHowever, we cannot simply use the divisor g arbitrarily. We must consider that the LCM is (x*y)/g0, where g0 is the actual GCD (which is the GCD of (a+k) and (b+k)).\n\nBut note: when we set k to be the smallest non-negative integer such that g divides (a+k) and (b+k), then the GCD might be greater than g? Actually, yes. For example, if we have a=6, b=10, d=4, and we consider divisor g=2, then k0 = (2 - 6%2)%2 = (2-0)%2 = 0. Then the numbers become 6 and 10, and GCD(6,10)=2. Now consider divisor g=4, then k0 = (4 - 6%4)%4 = (4-2)%4 = 2. Then the numbers become 8 and 12, and GCD(8,12)=4. \n\nBut note: the LCM for k=0: LCM(6,10)=30, and for k=2: LCM(8,12)=24. So 24<30, so k=2 is better.\n\nBut wait, how do we know the actual GCD? We cannot iterate over all divisors and then for each divisor compute k and then compute the LCM, because the actual GCD might be different from g. However, note: the actual GCD must be a divisor of d (because it divides (a+k)-(b+k)=d). And if we set k to satisfy the condition for divisor g, then the GCD will be at least g, but it might be a multiple of g (if there is a common divisor that is a multiple of g and divides d). \n\nBut here's the key: the minimal LCM might be achieved when the GCD is as large as possible. Why? Because LCM = (x*y)/GCD, and x and y are increasing with k. However, the product (x*y) is increasing, but the GCD also increases. \n\nActually, we can consider: the LCM is minimized when the two numbers are as close as possible and their GCD is as large as possible. \n\nThere is an alternative approach: note that the difference between the two numbers is fixed (d = |a-b|). The two numbers are (a+k) and (b+k). The LCM of two numbers with fixed difference d is minimized when the two numbers are as close as possible in terms of having a large GCD. \n\nBut note: the two numbers are (a+k) and (b+k) and their difference is |a-b|. The LCM is ( (a+k)*(b+k) ) / GCD(a+k, b+k). \n\nAnother known fact: for two numbers with fixed difference d, the LCM is minimized when the GCD is maximized (because the product (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing with k, but the denominator (GCD) is also increasing). However, we are free to choose k.\n\nBut note: the GCD must divide d. Therefore, the maximum possible GCD is d itself (if we can choose k such that d divides (a+k) and (b+k)). But wait: if we set k such that d divides (a+k) and (b+k), then the GCD is at least d. However, note that d might not be the GCD, but the GCD must be a divisor of d, and the largest divisor is d. \n\nSo the idea is: we should consider all divisors of d (which is |a-b|). For each divisor g (which divides d), we can set k to be the smallest non-negative integer such that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). Then, the GCD will be at least g, but the actual GCD might be a multiple of g (but still dividing d). However, if we set k so that the two numbers are multiples of g, then the GCD will be at least g, and then the LCM is ( (a+k)*(b+k) ) / (actual GCD). But we don't know the actual GCD. \n\nBut note: the problem asks for the minimal LCM and then the smallest k achieving that minimal LCM.\n\nHowever, the minimal LCM must occur for some divisor g of d (because the GCD must divide d). And the candidate k for divisor g is k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g, but wait: we must ensure that the same k0 satisfies (b+k0) mod g == 0. Since (a+k0) mod g =0 and (a-b) is divisible by g, then (b+k0) mod g = (b+a - g*floor((a+k0)/g)) mod g? Actually, we know that (a+k0) - (b+k0) = a-b, and since g divides a-b, then if g divides (a+k0), then g divides (b+k0) as well.\n\nBut note: k0 must be chosen so that (a+k0) is divisible by g, and then (b+k0) is automatically divisible by g because (a+k0) - (b+k0) is divisible by g.\n\nSo for each divisor g of d, we can compute k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g. However, note: if a % g == 0, then k0=0, else k0 = g - (a % g). But wait, what if (a % g) is zero? Then k0=0. Also, if a % g !=0, then k0 is the smallest positive integer to add so that the total becomes divisible by g.\n\nBut note: k0 must be non-negative. This formula gives k0 in [0, g-1]. \n\nThen, for each divisor g (including 1 and d) we get a candidate k0. Then we compute the LCM for (a+k0) and (b+k0). However, note: the actual GCD might be greater than g. But we don't know. However, we are going to compare the LCM for these candidate k0's. \n\nBut wait: is it possible that the minimal LCM is achieved by a k that is not generated by a divisor g? Actually, no, because the GCD must divide d, and the k we generate for a divisor g ensures that the GCD is at least g, but the actual GCD might be a divisor of d (and we are iterating over all divisors). However, note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors? \n\nBut note: we are only concerned with the minimal LCM. We can compute for each divisor g the candidate k0 and then the LCM for (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then, we choose the candidate k0 that minimizes the LCM, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest k0.\n\nHowever, note: the LCM is ( (a+k0)*(b+k0) ) / GCD(a+k0, b+k0). But we don't know the GCD(a+k0, b+k0) from just k0 and g. It could be any divisor of d that is a multiple of g. \n\nBut wait: we set k0 so that g divides both (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then the GCD is at least g. But the GCD might be a divisor of d that is greater than g? Actually, the GCD must be a divisor of d, and it must divide (a+k0) and (b+k0). However, we don't know the GCD without computing it. \n\nBut note: we are iterating over all divisors of d. However, if we set k0 for divisor g, then the GCD might be a divisor of d that is a multiple of g. But then, that same k0 might be generated by a divisor h (which is the actual GCD) and we are already considering h (because h is a divisor of d). However, note: the k0 we compute for divisor g might be the same as the k0 computed for divisor h (if g and h are divisors and the condition for k0 is the same modulo g and modulo h). \n\nBut wait: the k0 we compute is the smallest non-negative integer such that (a+k0) is divisible by g. For a divisor h (which is a divisor of d and h>=g) and if h divides g? Not necessarily. Actually, the condition for h is independent. \n\nBut note: the candidate k0 for divisor g might not be the same as the candidate k0 for divisor h. However, the minimal LCM might be achieved by a k0 that we get from a divisor h (the actual GCD) and not from g. \n\nBut here is a simpler idea: the minimal LCM must occur for the maximal GCD we can achieve. Why? Because if the GCD is larger, the LCM is smaller. However, the product (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing with k. \n\nBut note: if we set k to make the GCD as large as possible (i.e., the entire d), then we get k0 = (d - a % d) % d. Then the two numbers are multiples of d. However, the LCM might be very small. But sometimes, a slightly larger k (so that the GCD is not the entire d, but a divisor of d) might lead to a smaller LCM? \n\nWait, let me test with the example: a=6, b=10, d=4.\n\nDivisors of 4: 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: k0 = (1 - 6%1)%1 -> but note: modulo 1: any number mod 1 is 0, so k0=0. Then the numbers are 6 and 10, GCD=2, LCM=30.\nFor g=2: k0 = (2 - 6%2)%2 = (2-0)%2=0. Then the numbers are 6 and 10, GCD=2, LCM=30.\nFor g=4: k0 = (4 - 6%4)%4 = (4-2)%4=2. Then the numbers are 8 and 12, GCD=4, LCM=24.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 24, achieved by k=2.\n\nNow, if we consider a=5, b=10, d=5. Divisors: 1,5.\nFor g=1: k0=0 -> numbers 5,10 -> GCD=5, LCM=10.\nFor g=5: k0=(5-5%5)%5= (5-0)%5=0 -> same k0=0, numbers 5,10, GCD=5, LCM=10.\n\nBut note: the example input includes \"5 10\" and the expected output is 0.\n\nAnother example: a=21, b=31, d=10. Divisors: 1,2,5,10.\n\nCompute k0 for each divisor:\n\ng=1: k0=0 -> numbers 21,31 -> GCD=1, LCM=21*31=651.\ng=2: k0 = (2 - 21%2)%2 = (2-1)%2=1 -> numbers 22,32 -> GCD=2, LCM=352.\ng=5: k0 = (5 - 21%5)%5 = (5-1)%5=4 -> numbers 25,35 -> GCD=5, LCM=175.\ng=10: k0 = (10 - 21%10)%10 = (10-1)%10=9 -> numbers 30,40 -> GCD=10, LCM=120.\n\nThe minimal LCM is 120, achieved by k=9.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that k=9 is not the smallest k that gives LCM=120? Actually, no because we are generating the smallest k for divisor 10. \n\nBut note: the example output is 9.\n\nHowever, note: the above method iterates over divisors of d, and for each divisor g, we compute a candidate k0. Then we compute the LCM for (a+k0, b+k0) and record the candidate (LCM, k0). Then we choose the candidate with the smallest LCM, and if there are multiple, the smallest k0.\n\nBut wait: is it possible that the same k0 is generated by multiple divisors? Then we are repeating the same candidate. But that is okay because we can keep the first occurrence (and we are storing the minimal LCM and then the minimal k0 for that LCM). However, we must consider that the same k0 might appear for different divisors. But note: the k0 depends on g. Different divisors might yield the same k0.\n\nBut note: k0 is defined modulo g. So two divisors g1 and g2 might yield the same k0. \n\nBut the issue is: the LCM for a candidate k0 is computed as (a+k0)*(b+k0)//gcd(a+k0, b+k0). However, we don't know the gcd without computing it. \n\nBut wait: we are using the divisor g to set k0, but the actual gcd might be larger than g. However, we are iterating over every divisor, and the actual gcd (which is a divisor of d) will be considered. But note: the candidate k0 for divisor g might be the same as the candidate k0 for divisor h (the actual gcd). \n\nBut the above example: a=5, b=10, d=5. The divisor g=1 and g=5 both yield k0=0. Then we compute the LCM for k0=0 twice. But that's okay, we can avoid duplicate k0's by storing the best LCM for each distinct k0? Or we can store all candidates and then compare.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if there are multiple k0 giving the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k0. So we are allowed to consider the same k0 multiple times, but we can optimize by storing the best LCM for each k0.\n\nBut wait, the problem is: we have two numbers (a+k) and (b+k). The LCM is determined by the two numbers. However, the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors, but the two numbers are the same. So we can avoid duplicates by storing the k0 and the corresponding LCM, and then if we see the same k0 again, we can skip.\n\nBut note: the divisors are factors of d, and the k0 computed for divisor g is the smallest k0 that makes the numbers divisible by g. However, the same k0 might satisfy divisibility by multiple divisors (for example, if k0=0, then it satisfies all divisors). \n\nBut the problem: the range of d can be up to 10^9, so the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable (around 10^5 divisors worst-case). \n\nBut wait: we are iterating over divisors of d, and for each divisor we compute k0 and then the LCM. Then we compare. However, the LCM calculation: (a+k0)*(b+k0) might be very large (up to (10^9 + 10^5)^2, which is about 10^18, which is acceptable in Python with big integers? But the problem says a,b up to 10^9, and k0 is at most d (which is <= 10^9) so (a+k0) and (b+k0) can be up to 2e9, so the product is 4e18, which is within Python's integer range, but we must be cautious about performance.\n\nBut note: the number of divisors is around 10^3 to 10^4 in worst-case (for highly composite numbers). So we can iterate over all divisors.\n\nBut what if a==b? Then d=0. Then we cannot iterate over divisors (divisors of 0 are undefined). \n\nWe must handle the case when a==b separately.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. If a == b, then k0=0 is the answer.\n\n2. Otherwise, let d = abs(a-b). Then, we factorize d to get all divisors. But note: d can be 0? No, because we checked a==b.\n\nBut wait, what if a and b are very close? d is positive.\n\nHowever, note: the divisors of d include 1 and d, and all factors in between.\n\nBut there's a catch: what if d is very large? Factorizing numbers up to 10^9 is acceptable in Python if done efficiently (using trial division up to sqrt(d)).\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: a, b up to 10^9. So d up to 10^9, and the number of divisors is at most around 1344 (for the worst-case composite number with many divisors). \n\nBut note: we are only interested in positive divisors.\n\nPlan:\n\n- Read a, b.\n- If a==b: print(0)\n- Else:\n   d = abs(a-b)\n   Factorize d to get all divisors.\n   Initialize:\n      best_lcm = None\n      best_k = None\n\n   For each divisor g in the list of divisors:\n        k0 = (g - a % g) % g   [This gives the smallest non-negative k0 such that (a+k0) % g == 0]\n        Then, the two numbers are x = a+k0, y = b+k0.\n        Then, compute the actual_gcd = gcd(x, y)   # Note: but wait, we set k0 so that g divides x and y, but the actual gcd might be larger? Actually, we know that the actual gcd must divide d, and we are iterating over all divisors, so we don't need to worry about the actual_gcd for the LCM computation because we are going to compute the LCM from x and y.\n\n        But wait: we don't need the actual_gcd for the condition, we just need the LCM. However, we can compute the LCM by:\n            lcm = (x * y) // actual_gcd\n\n        However, we must compute the actual_gcd. But note: the actual_gcd is gcd(x,y). But we know that the actual_gcd divides d. But we don't know it.\n\n        But we can compute the gcd of x and y. Since x and y are up to 2e9, the gcd computation is efficient (Euclidean algorithm, which is logarithmic). \n\n        But wait: we are iterating over divisors of d (which is up to 10^9) and we have about 10^3 divisors. For each divisor we compute two numbers (x and y) and then their gcd. The gcd computation for two numbers of size ~2e9 is about O(log(2e9)) which is around 30 steps. So total operations: 10^3 * 30 = 30000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: we are doing modulus and other operations too.\n\n        Steps for each divisor g:\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n            x = a + k0\n            y = b + k0\n            g_actual = gcd(x, y)\n            lcm_val = (x * y) // g_actual\n\n            Then, compare lcm_val with best_lcm. If lcm_val < best_lcm, update best_lcm and best_k = k0. If equal, then update best_k = min(best_k, k0)\n\n        But wait: is it possible that the same k0 appears for multiple divisors? Then we are computing the same (x,y) multiple times. We can cache the results for a particular k0 to avoid redundant gcd computations? But the k0 values are different for different divisors, but possibly the same k0 may appear from different divisors. However, the set of k0's is not too large (at most the number of divisors, which is about 10^3). \n\n        Alternatively, we can store a dictionary: mapping k0 to (x,y) and then compute gcd only once per k0. But the problem: k0 is an integer, and we are iterating over divisors, and the same k0 might appear. \n\n        However, we are already storing the best_lcm and best_k. We can avoid recomputation by storing the LCM for each k0.\n\n        But note: the same k0 will produce the same x and y, so the same LCM. So if we encounter the same k0 again, we can skip.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n        Let seen = {}  # k0: True (or store the LCM and best_k)\n\n        Then for each divisor g:\n            k0 = ... \n            if k0 in seen: continue\n            else: mark seen[k0]=True, compute LCM, and update best.\n\n        But wait: what if a divisor g1 and g2 produce the same k0? Then we don't want to compute the same (x,y) twice.\n\n        But note: the k0 is defined by the divisor g. Two divisors g1 and g2 might produce the same k0. For example, when a=5, b=10, d=5, then divisors 1 and 5 both produce k0=0.\n\n        So we should avoid duplicate k0.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate over divisors and then also consider the divisors of d and the divisors from the other side (like from the factorization) but we are already getting all divisors.\n\n        However, note: the divisors we are getting are all divisors of d. The k0 is defined modulo g, so two different divisors might yield the same k0.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Option 1: iterate over divisors, and for each divisor compute k0. Then, use a set to record which k0's we've seen.\n\n        But note: the k0 might be the same for different divisors, but we are only interested in the minimal LCM and the smallest k0.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider that the minimal LCM might be achieved by k0 that is not necessarily from the divisors? Actually, the condition for the GCD is that it must divide d, and we set k0 so that the GCD is at least g (the divisor). But the actual GCD might be any divisor of d. However, the candidate k0 we are generating is the minimal k that makes the numbers divisible by g. But note: the same k0 might be the solution for multiple divisors.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require us to consider only divisors of d. The GCD must divide d, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\n        However, there is one more candidate: k0=0 is always included (from divisor 1). \n\n        But wait: what if we don't consider divisor 1? Actually, we are including divisor 1.\n\n        But note: there is a possibility that k0 is negative? Our formula (g - a % g) % g ensures k0 is in [0, g-1]. \n\n        Another thing: we are only iterating over divisors of d. But note: the GCD must divide d, so the candidate k0's we generate are sufficient.\n\n        However, note: there is a possibility that the minimal LCM is achieved by a k0 that is not generated by any divisor? Actually, no: because the GCD must divide d, and the k0 we generate for divisor g is the minimal k0 that makes the numbers divisible by g (which is a divisor). But the actual GCD might be a divisor h (which we are also iterating) and the k0 for divisor h might be the same or different. But we are iterating over all divisors.\n\n        But note: we are missing the case when the two numbers are the same? Actually, when k0 is chosen so that the two numbers are the same? That happens when k0 = (same) but wait, the two numbers are (a+k) and (b+k) and they are the same only if a=b, which we handled separately.\n\n        So algorithm:\n\n        if a == b:\n            print(0)\n            exit()\n\n        d = abs(a-b)\n        Find all divisors of d.\n\n        Then, for each divisor g in divisors:\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n            x = a + k0\n            y = b + k0\n            g_actual = gcd(x, y)   # This is the actual GCD, which might be greater than g (but still divides d)\n            lcm_val = (x * y) // g_actual\n\n            Then, compare.\n\n        But wait: is it necessary to compute the gcd for each divisor? We are already ensuring that g divides both x and y (by construction). Then, g_actual must be at least g. But we are computing the actual gcd, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the gcd(x,y) might be very large, but that's okay.\n\n        But wait: there is a problem: the above method does not consider that k0 must be non-negative, which we have, but also note: k0 is the minimal k for divisor g, but the same k0 might be used for a divisor h (a multiple of g) and we are already considering h. \n\n        But note: if we consider divisor h (which is a multiple of g) and h divides d, then the k0 for divisor h might be different from the k0 for divisor g. \n\n        Example: d=12, divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\n        Suppose a=5, then for g=2: k0 = (2-5%2)%2 = (2-1)%2=1.\n        For g=4: k0 = (4-5%4)%4 = (4-1)%4=3.\n        For g=6: k0 = (6-5%6)%6= (6-5)%6=1.\n\n        So the same k0=1 is generated by divisors 2 and 6. Then, we compute the LCM for k0=1 twice. \n\n        To avoid duplicate computation, we can use a set of k0's.\n\n        Revised:\n\n        if a==b: print(0); return\n\n        d = abs(a-b)\n        divisors = all_divisors(d)\n\n        seen = set()\n        best_lcm = None\n        best_k = None\n\n        for g in divisors:\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n            if k0 in seen:\n                continue\n            seen.add(k0)\n\n            x = a + k0\n            y = b + k0\n            g_actual = math.gcd(x, y)\n            lcm_val = (x * y) // g_actual\n\n            # Now compare lcm_val with best_lcm\n            if best_lcm is None or lcm_val < best_lcm or (lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n                # But wait: we are updating best_k only if the lcm_val is strictly less OR if equal and k0 is smaller.\n                # However, we are storing best_k as the current best k. But note: we are iterating and we might update multiple times for the same lcm_val?\n                # Actually, we want the smallest k0 that minimizes the LCM. So if we have the same LCM, we want the smallest k0. But note: we are iterating and we might get a candidate with the same LCM and a smaller k0 later? But k0 is the candidate we are testing. However, we are skipping duplicates (k0 already seen). But note: we are adding k0 to seen as soon as we compute it. So if we see the same k0 again, we skip.\n\n                # But wait: we are storing the best_lcm and best_k. We update when we find a smaller LCM, or same LCM and a smaller k0? But note: we are iterating and we don't know the future. However, we are iterating over divisors and the k0's are arbitrary. \n\n                # Actually, we are comparing the LCM.

However, we are iterating and we might first get a candidate with a larger k0 and then a candidate with a smaller k0 for the same LCM? \n\n                # Example: \n                #   First divisor: k0=10, LCM=100 -> best_lcm=100, best_k=10.\n                #   Then divisor: k0=5, LCM=100 -> update best_k=5.\n\n                # But our condition above: we update if the LCM is the same and k0 is smaller.\n\n                # However, we are storing the best_k as the smallest k0 for the current best_lcm. \n\n                # But note: we are storing the best_lcm and best_k independently. We must update best_lcm and best_k together.\n\n                # Actually, we are storing the best_lcm and the best_k that achieves that best_lcm. \n\n                # But wait: what if we have two different LCMs? We are comparing the LCMs.\n\n                # We can do:\n\n                #   if best_lcm is None or lcm_val < best_lcm or (lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n                #       best_lcm = lcm_val\n                #       best_k = k0\n\n                # However, this condition is correct: if we find a candidate with a strictly smaller LCM, we update both. If we find a candidate with the same LCM and a smaller k0, we update the k0.\n\n                # But note: we are iterating and we might update best_k multiple times. \n\n                # However, the above condition is standard.\n\n                best_lcm = lcm_val\n                best_k = k0\n\n            # But wait: the condition above does not account for the same LCM and a larger k0? Actually, the condition is: \n            #   if lcm_val < best_lcm: update.\n            #   else if lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k: update.\n\n            # But we can combine: \n            #   if best_lcm is None: update\n            #   else if lcm_val < best_lcm: update\n            #   else if lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k: update\n\n            # However, note: we are storing the best_lcm and best_k. We don't want to update if the LCM is larger.\n\n            # But the above condition in the code is written as an 'or' chain, which is incorrect. We should break it down.\n\n            # Actually, the condition in the code above is:\n\n            #   if best_lcm is None or lcm_val < best_lcm or (lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n\n            # But wait, the third part is (lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k). However, if best_lcm is None, we don't check the rest. Then we set best_lcm and best_k.\n\n            # But the condition is not correct: we are updating even if lcm",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are equal, the answer is \\( 0 \\) because the LCM of two identical numbers is the number itself, and any \\( k > 0 \\) would only increase the value.\n2. **Difference Calculation**: Compute the absolute difference \\( d = |a - b| \\). The GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of \\( d \\), as their difference is \\( d \\).\n3. **Divisor Enumeration**: Enumerate all divisors of \\( d \\). For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) is given by \\( k_0 = (g - a \\% g) \\% g \\).\n4. **LCM Calculation**: For each computed \\( k_0 \\), calculate the actual GCD of \\( a + k_0 \\) and \\( b + k_0 \\), then compute the LCM using the formula \\( \\text{LCM}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\times y}{\\text{GCD}(x, y)} \\).\n5. **Optimal Selection**: Track the minimal LCM encountered during the iteration over all divisors. If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same minimal LCM, select the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom sys import stdin\n\ndef main():\n    data = stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= d:\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n        i += 1\n        \n    seen_k0 = set()\n    best_lcm = None\n    best_k = None\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n        if k0 in seen_k0:\n            continue\n        seen_k0.add(k0)\n        \n        x = a + k0\n        y = b + k0\n        g_actual = math.gcd(x, y)\n        lcm_val = (x * y) // g_actual\n        \n        if best_lcm is None:\n            best_lcm = lcm_val\n            best_k = k0\n        else:\n            if lcm_val < best_lcm:\n                best_lcm = lcm_val\n                best_k = k0\n            elif lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k:\n                best_k = k0\n                \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the solution is trivially \\( 0 \\).\n3. **Divisor Calculation**: The absolute difference \\( d \\) between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is computed. All divisors of \\( d \\) are found by checking each integer up to \\( \\sqrt{d} \\).\n4. **Iterating Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\), the smallest \\( k \\) (denoted \\( k_0 \\)) that makes both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) divisible by \\( g \\) is calculated. This \\( k_0 \\) ensures that the GCD condition is met.\n5. **LCM Calculation**: For each \\( k_0 \\), the actual GCD of \\( a + k_0 \\) and \\( b + k_0 \\) is computed, and the corresponding LCM is derived.\n6. **Tracking Optimal Solution**: The solution keeps track of the minimal LCM encountered. If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same LCM, the smallest \\( k \\) is chosen. The result is printed after processing all divisors.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidates for \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
