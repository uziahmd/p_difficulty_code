Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to combine the first two lines (guest's name and host's name) and then check if the sorted list of letters in the combined string is the same as the sorted list of letters in the third line (the pile).\n However, note: the example input is given as a list of strings for multiple test cases? Actually, the problem states that the input file consists of three lines. But the example provided is a list of three inputs and outputs.\n\n But wait, the example input format is:\n\n Input:\n   SANTACLAUS\n   DEDMOROZ\n   SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n However, the example input provided in the problem statement is actually a list of three different examples. But the problem says:\n\n   Input: The input file consists of three lines: ... \n\n So we are to assume one test case per run? Actually, the example shows three separate examples, but the problem is stated for one set of three lines.\n\n But note: the example output is also given as a list of answers. This implies that the problem might be designed to handle multiple test cases? However, the problem description says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we are to read three lines.\n\n Let me re-read: \"The input file consists of three lines\" meaning one test case? Or multiple test cases?\n\n Actually, the example input is:\n\n ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ... ]\n\n This is confusing. But the note says: \"In the first sample ...\"\n\n So the problem is for one test case. However, the example input is provided as a list of three different inputs and outputs. \n\n But the problem says: \"You are given both inscriptions ...\" (meaning one guest name, one host name, and one pile). \n\n Therefore, we can assume that there will be exactly three lines of input.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read three lines.\n 2. Combine the first two lines (strip any extra whitespace, including newline) and count the frequency of each letter.\n 3. Count the frequency of each letter in the third line.\n 4. Check if the two frequency counts are the same.\n\n However, note: the example input has no spaces and only uppercase letters.\n\n Example 1:\n   Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But wait, the example pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is 16 characters. The combined length is 10+8=18. So that doesn't match.\n\n Wait, let me check the example again:\n\n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   The expected output is \"YES\".\n\n   However, the lengths don't match: \n        len(\"SANTACLAUS\") + len(\"DEDMOROZ\") = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        len(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\") = 17.\n\n   Actually, wait: the example pile is written as \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" which is 17 letters. But the combined names are 18.\n\n   Alternatively, let me count the letters in the example:\n\n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S(2), A(1), N(1), T(1), C(1), L(1), U(1)\n   Host: DEDMOROZ -> D(2), E(1), M(1), O(2), R(1), Z(1)\n\n   Total: \n        S:2, A:1, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Now the pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   Wait, the pile has an extra 'A'. So why is the answer YES?\n\n   Let me write down the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n   Breaking it down:\n      S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S\n\n   Actually, wait the string \"SANTAMOROZ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking the frequency of each letter in the combined names against the frequency of letters in the pile. If both frequencies match exactly, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the first two strings (guest's name and host's name) to form a single string representing all required letters.\n3. **Count Letters**: Use a dictionary or collections.Counter to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Counts**: Check if the counts of each letter in the combined names exactly match the counts in the pile. If they do, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The program reads three lines of input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string (`combined`).\n3. **Counting Letters**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined string and the pile string.\n4. **Comparison**: The program checks if the counts of letters in the combined string match those in the pile string. If they match exactly, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies whether the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names, ensuring no extra letters are present and all required letters are accounted for. The use of `Counter` simplifies the counting process and makes the comparison straightforward.",
