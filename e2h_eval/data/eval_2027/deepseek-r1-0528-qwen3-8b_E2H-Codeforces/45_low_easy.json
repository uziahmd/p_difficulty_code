There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) from 2 to 10^18.\n\n The tournament is single elimination (knockout). The winner must win all their games.\n\n However, the twist: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We are to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n\n In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner must win log2(n) games (if n is a power of two). But note: the problem allows arranging the grid arbitrarily as long as the condition holds. \n\n Let's think about the condition: the winner must play consecutive games? Actually, the condition is about the number of games each has played.\n\n Example: \n   n=2: 1 game -> answer=1.\n   n=3: 2 games (as in example: player1 beats two others) -> but wait, standard single elimination for 3 players would have two rounds, but actually with 3 players you can't have a full knockout without byes. However, the problem says \"assuming the rule above\", so we can arrange arbitrarily.\n\n How does the rule work?\n   Initially, both players have 0 games. They can play (because 0 and 0 -> difference 0 <=1).\n   Then the winner has 1 game, the loser leaves. Now, the remaining players are the winner (with 1 game) and the remaining unplayed ones (if any). But note: we have to arrange the entire tournament.\n\n Another example: n=4 -> 2 games.\n\n But wait, the example output for n=4 is 2.\n\n However, the example says for n=10, the answer is 4.\n\n What is happening?\n\n Let me re-read the examples:\n\n   Input: 2 -> Output: 1\n   Input: 3 -> Output: 2\n   Input: 4 -> Output: 2\n   Input: 10 -> Output: 4\n\n So, what is the pattern?\n\n We can model the tournament as follows: the winner must win k games. The total number of games is at least k, and also the tournament must have a structure that allows k consecutive wins.\n\n But note: the condition on the grid arrangement. The condition is that two players can play only if the difference in the number of games they've played is at most one.\n\n This condition is similar to having the tournament structured in rounds, but the rounds might be grouped in such a way that a player can move from one group to the next.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can think of building a tree (the tournament bracket) where the root is the final game and the winner is the root.\n\n However, note that the condition is about the number of games played so far (i.e., the depth in the tree from the root). The root has played k games (if we consider the winner must win k games). But wait: the condition is applied at the time of the game.\n\n Actually, the condition is: when two players are to play, the absolute difference between the number of games they have already played is at most one.\n\n So, the first round: every game is between two players with 0 games -> allowed. Then the winners have 1 game.\n\n Second round: can we have two players with 1 game and one with 0? Actually, we can't because the player with 0 games is still in the tournament (if there are byes?) but note the problem doesn't mention byes. However, the problem says \"two players can play against each other only if ...\".\n\n But the problem states: \"Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.\"\n\n So, the tournament progresses by having groups of players with similar game counts.\n\n Consider:\n\n   Round 0: All players have 0 games.\n\n   Then we can form groups of 1 or 2 players. To maximize the number of games the winner plays, we want to delay the opponent's experience as much as possible? Actually, we want the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\n How?\n\n We can arrange the tournament so that the winner goes through several rounds, and in each round, the opponents are arranged so that the condition is satisfied.\n\n We can think of the tournament as being divided into two halves: one half for the winner and one half for the rest? Or maybe we use a strategy of having the winner face increasing numbers of experienced opponents.\n\n Actually, note that the condition allows two players with the same number of games or one more/one less. This is reminiscent of the following:\n\n   Let the winner be player A. He must win his first game (against someone with 0 games). Then he must win the second game (against someone with 0 or 1 game). Then the third game: against someone with 0, 1, or 2 games? But wait, if he",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a single-elimination tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their previous games does not exceed one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that each player must win all their games to continue. The key observation is that the winner must play a sequence of games where each subsequent opponent has a game count differing by at most one from the winner's current game count. This leads us to model the problem using a mathematical approach rather than simulating each game, especially since the number of players can be as large as \\(10^{18}\\).\n\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest integer \\(k\\) such that the sum of the first \\(k\\) terms of a specific series (related to powers of 2) does not exceed \\(n\\). Specifically, the series is built by considering groups of players where each group corresponds to a level in the tournament bracket. The winner must defeat one player from each level, and the total number of players required to structure the tournament up to \\(k\\) levels is the sum of the first \\(k\\) terms of the sequence defined by \\(2^k - 1\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves iteratively calculating the maximum \\(k\\) such that the sum of the series \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{k} (2^i - 1) \\leq n \\). This sum represents the total number of players needed for the winner to play \\(k\\) games under the given constraints.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently computes \\(k\\) by leveraging logarithmic growth, ensuring it handles the upper constraint \\(n \\leq 10^{18}\\) effectively without excessive computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    k = 0\n    total_players = 0\n    while True:\n        k += 1\n        needed = (1 << k) - 1  # This is 2^k - 1\n        if total_players + needed <= n:\n            total_players += needed\n        else:\n            break\n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input \\(n\\) (number of players) is read.\n2. **Loop to Calculate Maximum Games**: The loop increments \\(k\\) (representing the number of games the winner will play) and calculates the number of players required to structure the tournament up to \\(k\\) games, which is \\(2^k - 1\\).\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until adding the next set of players would exceed the total number of players \\(n\\).\n4. **Output**: The result is \\(k - 1\\) because the loop exits when the condition fails, meaning the maximum valid \\(k\\) is one less than the current value.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum games the winner can play by leveraging mathematical properties of the tournament structure, ensuring optimal performance even for very large \\(n\\).",
