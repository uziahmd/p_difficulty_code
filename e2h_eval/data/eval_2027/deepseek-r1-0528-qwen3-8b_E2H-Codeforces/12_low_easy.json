The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are moving in a circular ring road (clockwise) with n houses.\n We start at house 1 and we have m tasks, each requiring to be at house a_i (the i-th task's house).\n Since the ringroad is circular and clockwise, we can only move clockwise. However, note that we can also consider the possibility of moving from a higher house to a lower one by going around the circle.\n\n But note: the problem says that initially Xenia is at house 1, and then she must complete tasks in order. Also, for the i-th task, she must be at house a_i and she has already completed all tasks with numbers less than i.\n\n Important: The ringroad is circular and one-way (clockwise). So from house x, the next house is x+1, unless x is n then the next is 1.\n\n Observation:\n Since the movement is only clockwise, if we are at house x and need to go to house y, then:\n   If y >= x, then the distance is y - x.\n   If y < x, then the distance is (n - x + y) [because we go from x to n, then wrap around to 1 and then to y].\n\n However, note that we start at house 1 and the tasks are given in an order. We must do the tasks in the given sequence.\n\n But note: the problem states that for the i-th task, she needs to be at house a_i and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. This means that after completing the first task, she is at house a_1, then she goes to a_2, etc.\n\n However, there is a catch: sometimes it might be beneficial to go all the way around? Actually, since we are forced to move clockwise, and we cannot jump, we just have to traverse the circle.\n\n But note: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" gives 6.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n   Start at 1, then go to 3: \n        How? 1->2->3: 2 moves? But wait, the example says: 1→2→3→4→1→2→3 -> total 6 moves.\n\n Why 6? Because the example says the sequence is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. \n\n Actually, let me recount the example:\n\n   Task1: at house 3. From 1, we go: 1->2 (1 move), 2->3 (another move) -> total 2 moves so far? \n   Then task2: at house 2. From 3, we can go: 3->4 (1 move), 4->1 (1 move), 1->2 (1 move) -> 3 moves. Total 5?\n   Then task3: at house 3. From 2: 2->3 (1 move) -> total 6.\n\n Alternatively, maybe we don't have to go from 3 to 2 by wrapping? Actually, from 3 to 2: \n        Since we are in a circle and we can only move clockwise, the direct way from 3 to 2 is 3->4->1->2 (which is 3 steps). But note: from 3, the next houses are 4, then 1, then 2.\n\n So the distance from house 3 to house 2 is: (n - 3 + 2) = (4-3+2) = 3.\n\n Similarly, from house 1 to house 3: min(3-1, ...) but wait, the circle: actually, we can compute as:\n        Option1: 3-1 = 2 (if we don't wrap) -> that is the direct way.\n        But wait, why did the example go 1->2->3->4->1->2->3? \n\n Actually, the example says: \n        \"In the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3\"\n\n That is 6 moves. But if we break down:\n\n   Start at 1 (time=0)\n   Move to 2: time=1\n   Move to 3: time=2 -> done first task (at time=2)\n   Then from 3 to 4: time=3\n   Then from 4 to 1: time=4\n   Then from 1 to 2: time=5\n   Then from 2 to 3: time=6 -> done third task.\n\n So the total time is 6.\n\n However, note that the second task is at house 2. After the first task (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks, moving only clockwise along a circular ring road. The key observation here is that Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order, moving from one house to another in a clockwise direction. The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the total distance traveled while considering the circular nature of the ring road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of houses (n) and the number of tasks (m), followed by the list of task locations.\n2. **Tracking Position**: Initialize the starting position as house 1.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each task, calculate the distance from the current position to the next task's location. Since movement is strictly clockwise, the distance between two houses can be computed by considering the circular arrangement:\n   - If the next house is greater than or equal to the current position, the distance is simply the difference between them.\n   - If the next house is smaller, the distance is calculated by wrapping around the circle: `(n - current_position + next_position)`.\n4. **Summing Distances**: Accumulate the distances for each segment of the journey to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        target = tasks[i]\n        if target >= current:\n            distance = target - current\n        else:\n            distance = n - current + target\n        \n        total_time += distance\n        current = target\n    \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints (n and m can be up to 10^5). The first two values are the number of houses (n) and tasks (m), followed by the list of task locations.\n2. **Initial Position**: Xenia starts at house 1.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, the code checks if the target house is ahead or behind the current position. If it's ahead, the distance is straightforward (target minus current position). If it's behind, the distance is calculated by moving from the current position to the end of the circle and then wrapping around to the target house.\n4. **Update Position and Time**: After each task, the current position is updated to the target house, and the distance traveled is added to the total time.\n5. **Output Result**: The accumulated total time is printed after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular movement and ensures the minimal time is calculated by always moving clockwise, leveraging simple arithmetic to compute distances in a circular arrangement. The solution is optimal with a linear time complexity, O(m), which is suitable for large inputs.",
