    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers: A, B, C, D (with A<=B<=C<=D, and each between 1 and 500000)\n\n We need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that:\n   A <= x <= B\n   B <= y <= C\n   C <= z <= D\n\n And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third.\n\n However, note the constraints: x <= y <= z (since A<=B<=C, so x from [A,B], y from [B,C], z from [C,D] and by the ranges we have x<=y<=z).\n\n The triangle inequality for non-degenerate triangles is then simplified because of ordering (x<=y<=z):\n   x + y > z\n\n So we need to count the triples (x,y,z) with:\n   A <= x <= B\n   B <= y <= C\n   C <= z <= D\n   and x+y > z.\n\n Since the ranges can be up to 500000, we cannot iterate over all possible triples (that would be too slow).\n\n Instead, we can use the following approach:\n\n For fixed x and y, the condition becomes z < x+y. But note that z is at least C and at most D.\n\n So for fixed x and y, the valid z values are in the range [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\n Then the total count is the sum over x from A to B, and for each x, sum over y from max(B, ceil((z_min+1-x)?)) but note: y must be at least B and at most C, and also we require that x+y > z, so for a fixed x and y, we are counting the z's that are less than x+y.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix x and y and then count the number of z's that satisfy C<=z<=min(D, x+y-1). But note: the condition is automatically satisfied if x+y-1 >= C, otherwise there are 0.\n\n However, the direct double loop (over x and y) would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which in worst-case (when A=1, B=500000, C=500000) is about 500000*500000 = 250e9, which is too slow.\n\n We need a more efficient method.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let's fix x (from A to B) and then consider the condition for y and z.\n\n We require: y >= B, y <= C, z >= C, z <= D, and x+y > z.\n\n Rearranged: z < x+y.\n\n So for a fixed x, we want to count the pairs (y,z) such that:\n   B <= y <= C\n   C <= z <= min(D, x+y-1)\n\n Now, we can iterate over x (which is from A to B) and for each x, we want to count the number of y in [B, C] for which there exists at least one z (i.e., when min(D, x+y-1) >= C) and then the total z for that (x,y) is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1).\n\n But note: we can also change the order: fix x and then fix y, and then compute the z range.\n\n However, we can use two pointers or precomputation to avoid the inner loop.\n\n Another idea: fix the side z (from C to D) and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z.\n\n Conditions: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C] and x+y > z.\n\n Then the total triangles is the same as the sum_{z=C}^{D} [number of (x,y) with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y>z].\n\n Now, we can precompute for each z the count of (x,y) such that x+y > z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]. Then sum these counts for z from C to D.\n\n But note: the condition for a fixed z is: x+y > z, i.e., x+y >= z+1.\n\n How to count the pairs (x,y) for fixed z?\n\n   x from A to B, y from B to C, and x+y >= z+1.\n\n We can also break the problem into two parts:\n\n   Total pairs (x,y) without condition: (B-A+1) * (C-B+1)\n\n   Then subtract the pairs (x,y) such that x+y <= z.\n\n But wait, we are iterating over z, and we need to do it efficiently.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix x and then for each x, y must be at least max(B, z+1-x) and at most C.\n\n However, we can precompute the cumulative sums for y? But note that the condition changes with x and z.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a two-pointer method for the entire set of x and y.\n\n But note: the constraints (each up to 500000) and the fact that we have two independent intervals [A,B] and [B,C] and we need to count pairs (x,y) such that x+y >= T (for varying T from ...).\n\n We can precompute an array F[T] = number of pairs (x,y) with x+y = T, then the count for x+y>=T is the suffix sum of F from T to some maximum.\n\n However, note that T (the required x+y) can be as large as B+C (which is up to 10^6) and as small as A+B (at least 2).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the minimum and maximum of x+y: \n        min_sum = A+B, max_sum = B+C.\n\n 2. Create an array F of zeros for indices from min_sum to max_sum (or from 0 to max_sum, but we only care from min_sum to max_sum).\n\n 3. For each x from A to B:\n        For each y from B to C? -> That would be too slow.\n\n Instead, we can use a difference array for the sums.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that for a fixed x, y runs from B to C, so the pairs (x,y) give the sum s = x+y, which runs from x+B to x+C.\n\n Then we can do:\n\n   Let F[s] be the frequency of the sum s from pairs (x,y). We can iterate x from A to B and then for each x, we know the y range [B, C] gives s from (x+B) to (x+C). Then we can use a difference array for s.\n\n Steps for building F:\n\n   Let F be an array of zeros from min_sum to max_sum (inclusive).\n\n   For x from A to B:\n        low_y = B\n        high_y = C\n        s_low = x + B\n        s_high = x + C\n\n        Then we add 1 to every s from s_low to s_high.\n\n   Then we can compute the prefix sum of F to get the cumulative counts for each s.\n\n   Then for each z from C to D, the condition is x+y >= z+1, so we need to count the pairs with s >= z+1.\n\n   Then the answer would be the sum_{z=C}^{D} [suffix_sum[z+1]].\n\n But note: the total pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1), and we are building an array for s from min_sum to max_sum.\n\n However, the range of s is from A+B to B+C. The size of this range is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1). Since A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, then the range of s is up to 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n But building the frequency array by iterating x from A to B and then updating a difference array for the s range [x+B, x+C] is O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) again? Actually, no: we can update the difference array in O(1) per x.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let F = [0]*(max_sum+1)  # we'll index from 0 to max_sum (max_sum = B+C)\n   We only need from min_sum = A+B to max_sum = B+C.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a difference array for the entire range [0, max_sum] (max_sum=10**6, which is acceptable).\n\n   Then, for each x from A to B:\n        L = x + B\n        R = x + C\n        Then we do:\n            diff[L] += 1\n            diff[R+1] -= 1\n\n   Then, we do a prefix sum to get the array F for s from 0 to max_sum.\n\n   Then, build an array G for the suffix sum: \n        G[i] = sum_{s=i}^{max_sum} F[s]\n\n   Then, for each z from C to D (note: z is the side, and we require x+y >= z+1, so we need G[z+1]):\n\n        count_z = G[z+1]   (if z+1 <= max_sum, else 0)\n\n   Then the answer is the sum of count_z for z from C to D.\n\n But note: the condition for the triangle is z <= D, and we are iterating z from C to D.\n\n However, wait: our F was built for all pairs (x,y) (without considering z). Then for each z, we count the pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y > z (i.e., x+y >= z+1). Then the total triangles is the sum_{z=C}^{D} (number of (x,y) with x+y>=z+1).\n\n Example: Input \"1 2 3 4\"\n\n   A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\n   min_sum = 1+2=3, max_sum=2+3=5.\n\n   Build F for s from 3 to 5.\n\n   Pairs (x,y): \n        x=1: y in [2,3] -> s=3,4.\n        x=2: y in [2,3] -> s=4,5.\n\n   So F[3]=1, F[4]=2, F[5]=1.\n\n   Then, for z from 3 to 4:\n\n        z=3: condition is x+y>=4 -> count = F[4]+F[5] = 2+1 = 3.\n        z=4: condition is x+y>=5 -> count = F[5] = 1.\n\n   Then total = 3 (for z=3) + 1 (for z=4) = 4.\n\n   The example output is 4.\n\n   But wait: the example says the triangles are (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). \n\n   However, note that the condition is A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n   In our method, we are counting for each z the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z. Then we are summing over z from C to D.\n\n   But note: the triple (x,y,z) must have z in [C, D] and (x,y) in [A,B]x[B,C] and x+y>z.\n\n   In the example, we have:\n\n      (1,3,3): x+y=4>3 -> valid for z=3.\n      (2,2,3): x+y=4>3 -> valid for z=3.\n      (2,3,3): x+y=5>3 -> valid for z=3.\n      (2,3,4): x+y=5>4 -> valid for z=4.\n\n   So indeed we have 3 triangles for z=3 and 1 for z=4.\n\n   However, note that in the example the triangle (2,3,3) is counted for z=3, but in the example the triangle (2,3,3) is listed and also (2,3,4) is listed.\n\n   But wait, the example lists (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). So that matches.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the triangle is non-degenerate, and we used x+y>z (which is the strict triangle inequality for the largest side being z). This is correct because the other conditions (x+z>y and y+z>x) are automatically satisfied when x<=y<=z and x+y>z.\n\n   Why? Because:\n        x+z >= x+y (since z>=y) and x+y>z, so x+z>z-y+z? Actually, let me check:\n\n        We know x<=y<=z and x+y>z.\n\n        Condition 1: x+y>z (already given)\n        Condition 2: x+z>y -> since x>=1 and z>=y, and x+y>z, but note: x+z>=x+y>z>=y? Not necessarily: x+z>=1+y, and we know x+y>z => but wait, we don't know the relation between x+y and y.\n\n        Actually, the standard way: the triangle inequalities for sides (x,y,z) with x<=y<=z are equivalent to x+y>z.\n\n        Proof: \n          x+y>z is given.\n          x+z>=x+y (because z>=y) and x+y>z, so x+z>y (because x+z>=x+y>z, and z>y? Not exactly: we have x+y>z, and we want x+z>y. But note: x+z >= x+y (because z>=y) and x+y>z, but we don't know if x+y>y? Actually, x+y>y is always true because x>=1. So x+z>=x+y>y. Similarly, y+z>=y+x>z, so y+z>x.\n\n        Therefore, the condition x+y>z is sufficient.\n\n   So the method is correct.\n\n   But note: the example input \"1 2 2 5\" gives 3.\n\n   Let's check: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n   Then x in [1,2], y in [2,2] (so only y=2), z in [2,5].\n\n   Condition: x+y>z -> x+2>z.\n\n   For z=2: x+2>2 -> x>=1, which is always true (x=1: 3>2, x=2: 4>2) -> 2 triangles for z=2.\n   For z=3: x+2>3 -> x>=2, so x=2 -> 1 triangle for z=3.\n   For z=4: x+2>4 -> x>=3 -> no x (since x<=2) -> 0.\n   For z=5: x+2>5 -> x>=4 -> 0.\n\n   Total = 2 (for z=2) + 1 (for z=3) = 3.\n\n   The example output is 3.\n\n   However, note the condition: the problem states that the sides must satisfy A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n   In the example: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n   The triples are:\n        (x,y,z): (1,2,2), (2,2,2), (2,2,3)\n\n   So indeed 3.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   Step 2: \n        min_sum = A+B\n        max_sum = B+C   (actually, the maximum sum is B+C, and the minimum is A+B)\n\n   Step 3: Create an array `freq` (difference array) for s from 0 to max_sum (we can set max_val = max_sum, which is B+C, but note: B+C might be up to 1000000).\n\n        Let max_val = B+C  (we need to cover from min_sum to max_val)\n\n        We'll create an array `diff` of zeros from 0 to max_val+1 (index 0 to max_val+1) so that we can do:\n\n        For each x in [A, B]:\n            s_min = x+B\n            s_max = x+C\n            if s_min <= max_val:\n                diff[s_min] += 1\n                if s_max+1 <= max_val:\n                    diff[s_max+1] -= 1\n\n        But note: s_min and s_max might be beyond our current max_val? Actually, we defined max_val = B+C, and s_max = x+C, and x<=B, so x+C <= B+C = max_val. Similarly, s_min = x+B, and x>=A, so s_min >= A+B (which is at least 2, but we are covering from 0 to max_val).\n\n        Then, build the frequency array F for s from 0 to max_val:\n\n            F[0] = 0\n            for s from 1 to max_val:\n                F[s] = F[s-1] + diff[s]\n\n        Then, build the suffix sum array G for s from 0 to max_val:\n\n            G[i] = F[i] + F[i+1] + ... + F[max_val]\n\n        But note: we only need from s=min_sum to max_val. We can compute:\n\n            G[i] = 0 if i>max_val, else the sum of F from i to max_val.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            G = [0]*(max_val+2)   # index 0 to max_val+1\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(max_val, -1, -1):\n                total += F[i]\n                G[i] = total\n\n        Then, the condition for a fixed z (from C to D) is: we require s >= z+1.\n\n        So the count for z is G[z+1] (if z+1 <= max_val, otherwise 0).\n\n        Then, the answer is the sum for z from C to D of G[z+1] (if z+1 <= max_val, else 0).\n\n   However, note: the condition on z is that z is at least C and at most D, and also note that the pairs (x,y) must exist (so the sum s must be at least A+B and at most B+C). But we have built F for s from A+B to B+C, and for s below A+B or above B+C, F[s]=0.\n\n   But wait: our `diff` array was built from s_min=x+B (which is at least A+B) to s_max=x+C (which is at most B+C). So the frequency F is nonzero only for s from A+B to B+C.\n\n   Therefore, for z+1 > B+C, then G[z+1] = 0, which is correct.\n\n   Also, for z+1 < A+B, then we are counting pairs that do not exist (but note: our z starts at C, and the smallest z is C. The smallest sum s is A+B, so if z+1 < A+B then we are counting all pairs? But wait: the condition is s>=z+1, and if z+1 < A+B, then all pairs (x,y) satisfy the condition. However, note that the minimal s is A+B, so if z+1 <= A+B, then the condition s>=z+1 is automatically satisfied by all pairs. But our F is built for s from A+B to B+C, and we are summing from z+1 to max_val.\n\n   Actually, we did not build F for s < A+B. Our `diff` array was built from s_min = x+B (which is at least A+B) to s_max = x+C (at most B+C). So for s < A+B, F[s]=0. Then, the suffix array G[i] for i < A+B is the total sum (which is the total pairs) because:\n\n        G[i] = F[i] + F[i+1] + ... + F[max_val] = 0 + ... + (total pairs) ?\n\n   But note: we built F from the pairs, so the total pairs is the same as the sum of F from min_sum=A+B to max_val=B+C.\n\n   Actually, we can compute the total pairs as (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). Then, if we set:\n\n        Let total_pairs = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)\n\n        Then, for s from 0 to A+B-1: F[s]=0, and from A+B to B+C: we have the distribution.\n\n        Then, G[i] for i <= A+B is the total_pairs (if i<=A+B) because the suffix from i to max_val includes all the pairs (since the smallest s is A+B, so for i<=A+B, we include all the pairs).\n\n        But wait: if i <= A+B, then the condition s>=i is automatically satisfied by every pair (because the smallest s is A+B, so if i<=A+B, then every s>=A+B>=i). Therefore, the count for a given z is:\n\n            If z+1 <= A+B, then count = total_pairs.\n            Else if z+1 > B+C, then count = 0.\n            Else, count = G[z+1] (which is the sum from s=z+1 to B+C).\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid building the entire array for s from 0 to max_val by using the fact that the pairs only contribute to [A+B, B+C]. We can compute the total pairs and then subtract the pairs that have s < z+1 (for z+1 in the range [A+B+1, B+C]).\n\n   However, we already have the method.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say that A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, so the maximum sum is 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we must be cautious about memory and speed.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read A, B, C, D.\n\n        Let n = B - A + 1   (number of x)\n        Let m = C - B + 1   (number of y)\n\n        total_pairs = n * m\n\n        Let S_min = A+B\n        Let S_max = B+C\n\n        We'll create an array `freq` of zeros for indices 0 to S_max (size S_max+1). But S_max can be up to 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a list of zeros of length (S_max+1) (about 10^6 elements, which is acceptable in Python if we do it once).\n\n        Then, we can use a difference array for the sums.\n\n        Steps for the difference array:\n\n            diff = [0]*(S_max+2)   # we'll index from 0 to S_max+1\n\n            For x from A to B:\n                s_low = x+B\n                s_high = x+C\n                # But note: s_low might be greater than S_max? No, because x<=B, so x+C <= B+C = S_max.\n                diff[s_low] += 1\n                if s_high+1 <= S_max:\n                    diff[s_high+1] -= 1\n\n            Then, build the frequency array for s from 0 to S_max:\n\n                freq = [0]*(S_max+1)\n                current = 0\n                for s in range(0, S_max+1):\n                    current += diff[s]\n                    freq[s] = current\n\n            Then, build the suffix array for s from 0 to S_max:\n\n                suffix = [0]*(S_max+2)   # we'll make suffix[i] = sum_{s=i}^{S_max} freq[s]\n                total_count = 0\n                # We traverse from S_max down to 0\n                for s in range(S_max, -1, -1):\n                    total_count += freq[s]\n                    suffix[s] = total_count\n\n            Then, the answer is:\n\n                ans = 0\n                # z from C to D (inclusive)\n                for z in range(C, D+1):\n                    # Condition: x+y > z  => x+y >= z+1\n                    # We need to count the pairs with s >= z+1.\n\n                    # If z+1 > S_max, then there are 0.\n                    # If z+1 < S_min, then we count all pairs (because even the smallest s (S_min) is >= z+1, but actually if z+1 < S_min, then every pair has s>=S_min>=z+1, so we count all pairs)\n                    # But wait: note that our freq array is defined for s from 0 to S_max, and we built the suffix array for s from 0 to S_max.\n\n                    # However, we can use:\n                    #   If z+1 <= S_min: then all pairs (n*m) are valid.\n                    #   Else if z+1 <= S_max: then the count is suffix[z+1]\n                    #   Else: 0.\n\n                    # But note: if z+1 is greater than S_max, then suffix[z+1] is 0 (because we didn't compute beyond S_max, and our suffix array goes from 0 to S_max).\n\n                    # However, we built the suffix array for indices 0 to S_max.

Then we use suffix[s0].\n\n                    # However, note: our suffix array is built from the entire range [0, S_max]. The pairs only contribute to [S_min, S_max]. But for s0 < S_min, we cannot simply use total_pairs because the pairs start at S_min, but if s0 < S_min, then the condition s>=s0 is automatically satisfied by every pair, so indeed total_pairs.\n\n                    # But note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, and we are counting the pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y>=z+1. And if z+1 <= S_min, then since the smallest x+y is S_min, then the condition holds for all pairs.\n\n                    # However, wait: S_min = A+B, and the smallest x+y is A+B. So if z+1 <= A+B, then the condition x+y>=z+1 is automatically satisfied by every pair (because x+y>=A+B>=z+1). But note: if z+1 is less than or equal to A+B, then we count all pairs.\n\n                    # But note: the condition is x+y>z, and we are converting to x+y>=z+1. This is correct.\n\n                    # However, there is a catch: what if z+1 is greater than S_max? Then no pair satisfies the condition.\n\n                    # But note: the condition for the triangle is independent of the z value: we are iterating z from C to D, and we require the pair (x,y) to have x+y>z.\n\n                    # So:\n\n                    s0 = z+1\n                    if s0 > S_max:\n                        count_z = 0\n                    elif s0 < S_min:\n                        count_z = total_pairs\n                    else:\n                        # s0 is between S_min and S_max (inclusive)\n                        count_z = suffix[s0]\n\n                    ans += count_z\n\n            Print ans.\n\n   However, note: we are iterating z from C to D, and D can be up to 500000, so the loop from C to D (which is at most 500000 iterations) is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: what if D is very large, say 500000, and C is 500000, then we do 1 iteration. But if C is 1 and D is 500000, then we do 500000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can optimize by breaking early: if z+1 > S_max, then all subsequent z (larger) will also have 0. So we can break when z+1 > S_max.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break the loop when z > S_max-1.\n\n   But note: the problem says D can be as large as 500000, and S_max is B+C (which is at most 1000000). So we are iterating from C to D, and D can be up to 500000, so we never break early because z goes from C (at least 1) to D (at most 500000) and S_max is 1000000, so z+1 (at most 500001) is less than S_max (1000000). Therefore, we don't break early in the example.\n\n   But wait: if D is 500000 and S_max is 1000000, then we don't break. However, if D is larger than S_max-1, then we break when z >= S_max.\n\n   Actually, the condition is: if z+1 > S_max, then count_z=0. But note: we are iterating z from C to D. Since D can be up to 500000 and S_max can be up to 1000000, we never hit the condition that z+1>S_max? Only if D >= S_max, then for z from max(C, S_max) to D, we have count_z=0.\n\n   But note: S_max = B+C, and D is at least C (since C<=D) and B+C can be up to 1000000, while D is at most 500000, so actually in our problem D is at most 500000 and S_max = B+C (with B and C up to 500000) so S_max can be up to 1000000. Therefore, we are safe because D (<=500000) is less than S_max (which is at least 500000+500000=1000000) in many cases, but note: B and C are at least A and at most 500000, so B+C can be as small as 2 (if A=B=C=1) or as large as 1000000.\n\n   However, note the input condition: A<=B<=C<=D, and each from 1 to 500000.\n\n   Example: A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000 -> S_max=1000000, and D=500000, so we are iterating from 500000 to 500000, and 500000+1=500001 <=1000000, so we use the else branch.\n\n   But wait: in this example, the condition for the triangle is very strict: x in [1,500000], y in [500000,500000] (so only y=500000), z in [500000,500000]. Then the condition is x+y>z -> x+500000>500000 -> x>=1, so every x from 1 to 500000 works. Then the total triangles is 500000.\n\n   However, the example input \"500000 500000 500000 500000\" is provided, and the expected output is 1.\n\n   Wait, let me read the example input again: ['500000 500000 500000 500000'] -> output '1'\n\n   Why? \n\n        A=500000, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.\n\n        Then x in [500000,500000], y in [500000,500000], z in [500000,500000].\n\n        Then the triple is (500000,500000,500000). Check: 500000+500000>500000 -> yes, so it is a triangle.\n\n        But why the example output is 1? It should be 1.\n\n        However, according to our method:\n\n            total_pairs = (500000-500000+1) * (500000-500000+1) = 1*1 = 1.\n\n            S_min = 500000+500000 = 1000000\n            S_max = 500000+500000 = 1000000\n\n            Then, for z=500000 (the only z):\n\n                s0 = 500000+1 = 500001.\n\n                Since 500001 < S_min (1000000) -> then we use total_pairs = 1.\n\n            So we add 1.\n\n        So that matches.\n\n        But wait, in the example input \"1 2 3 4\", we had:\n\n            total_pairs = (2-1+1)*(3-2+1)=2*2=4.\n\n            Then, for z=3: s0=4, which is >=S_min=3 and <=S_max=5, so we use suffix[4] = F[4]+F[5] = 2+1 = 3.\n            for z=4: s0=5, suffix[5]=1.\n\n            Then total=3+1=4.\n\n        But wait: the example input \"1 2 3 4\" has total_pairs=4, but then we break down the pairs:\n\n            (1,2): s=3 -> valid for z<=2 (but z starts at 3, so for z=3: condition s>=4, so (1,2) is not valid for z=3) -> wait, I think I made a mistake here.\n\n        Let me reexamine the example \"1 2 3 4\":\n\n            x in [1,2], y in [2,3] -> pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)\n\n            Then the sums: \n                (1,2): 3\n                (1,3): 4\n                (2,2): 4\n                (2,3): 5\n\n            Then, for z=3 (the first z in the range [3,4]): condition is x+y>3 -> x+y>=4.\n\n            Which pairs: (1,3):4, (2,2):4, (2,3):5 -> 3 pairs.\n\n            Then for z=4: condition x+y>4 -> x+y>=5: only (2,3):5 -> 1 pair.\n\n            Total=4.\n\n            But wait, the pairs are 4, so total_pairs=4, and we are counting 3+1=4.\n\n            However, note: the condition for the triangle is that the sides must satisfy A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n            In the example, the triple (1,2,3) is not allowed because y=2 and z=3, but the condition is B<=y<=C<=z -> B=2, y=2, C=3, so 2<=2<=3<=3 -> that's okay. But wait, the condition is: \n                A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n            So (1,2,3): \n                x=1 (in [1,2]), y=2 (in [2,3]), z=3 (in [3,4]) -> valid.\n\n            But then why did I say (1,2) is not valid for z=3? \n\n            The condition is x+y>z -> 1+2>3 -> 3>3 is false. So (1,2,3) is degenerate (collinear) and not allowed.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for the triangle is strict: x+y>z.\n\n            So the triple (1,2,3) is invalid.\n\n            Then, the valid triples",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is strictly greater than the third side. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we use a mathematical and frequency-based method to efficiently compute the answer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a triangle with sides \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the triangle inequality simplifies to \\(x + y > z\\). This allows us to focus on counting valid triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), while ensuring \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Frequency Array Construction**: We first compute the frequency of each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\) for all valid pairs \\((x, y)\\). This involves iterating over all \\(x\\) in \\([A, B]\\) and all \\(y\\) in \\([B, C]\\), and recording the counts of each sum \\(s\\).\n\n3. **Suffix Sum Calculation**: Using the frequency array, we compute a suffix sum array where each entry at index \\(i\\) holds the total number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) whose sum is at least \\(i\\). This helps in quickly determining how many pairs satisfy \\(x + y > z\\) for any given \\(z\\).\n\n4. **Counting Valid Triples**: For each \\(z\\) in \\([C, D]\\), we use the suffix sum array to count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). The result is the sum of these counts over all \\(z\\) in the range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = B - A + 1\n    m = C - B + 1\n    total_pairs = n * m\n    \n    S_min = A + B\n    S_max = B + C\n    \n    if S_min > S_max:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    size = S_max + 1\n    diff = [0] * (size + 2)\n    \n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        s_low = x + B\n        s_high = x + C\n        if s_low > S_max:\n            continue\n        diff[s_low] += 1\n        if s_high + 1 <= S_max:\n            diff[s_high + 1] -= 1\n            \n    freq = [0] * (size + 1)\n    current = 0\n    for s in range(size + 1):\n        current += diff[s]\n        freq[s] = current\n        \n    suffix = [0] * (size + 2)\n    total_count = 0\n    for s in range(size, -1, -1):\n        total_count += freq[s]\n        suffix[s] = total_count\n        \n    ans = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        s0 = z + 1\n        if s0 > S_max:\n            count_z = 0\n        elif s0 < S_min:\n            count_z = total_pairs\n        else:\n            count_z = suffix[s0]\n        ans += count_z\n        \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Calculate the total number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) as \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1)\\).
