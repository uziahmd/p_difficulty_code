    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n Conditions: \n   The plate is w x h.\n   We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), the second 2 cells away, etc.\n   Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n How to compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n   The i-th ring is defined on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n   However, note that the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n   But note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (so the outermost ring) and the second one 2 cells away.\n\n   The ring is the border of the inner rectangle. So if we consider the inner rectangle as having:\n        width_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        height_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   Then the border (ring) of this rectangle would consist of:\n        top row: from (0,0) to (width_i-1,0) -> but wait, we are indexing the entire plate? Actually, the problem states:\n\n   However, note: the example input \"3 3 1\" gives 8, which is the entire perimeter of a 3x3 grid. For a 3x3 grid, the outer ring is all the bordering cells. The formula for the border of a rectangle is 2*(width_i + height_i) - 4, because the corners are counted twice.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the ring as the outer layer of the inner rectangle. But note: the entire inner rectangle is of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)), so the border (without the inner part) is the same as the outer ring.\n\n   Steps for the i-th ring (with i starting at 1):\n      Let n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n      Let m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n      But note: the ring must be valid. The ring requires that the inner rectangle has at least 1 cell in each dimension? Actually, the problem states that the first ring is the edge, and then the next ones go inward. Also, the condition on k: k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). This ensures that we don't get negative dimensions.\n\n   The number of cells in the i-th ring is the perimeter of the rectangle of size n_i x m_i, but since the ring has width 1, we take the outer border. The formula for the border (if we consider the entire rectangle) is:\n        If the rectangle has dimensions n_i x m_i, then the border is:\n            top and bottom: 2 * m_i (but wait, actually the top and bottom rows each have n_i cells? No, wait: the rectangle has n_i columns and m_i rows? Actually, the problem says the plate is w x h (rows x columns). \n\n   Let's clarify the dimensions: \n        In the problem, the plate has 'w' rows and 'h' columns? Or vice versa?\n\n   Looking at examples:\n        Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8. \n          A 3x3 grid: \n            Row-major: 3 rows and 3 columns.\n            The border: \n                Top row: 3 cells\n                Bottom row: 3 cells\n                Middle row: two sides (excluding the already counted top and bottom) -> 2 cells (left and right)\n            Total: 3+3+2+2 = 10? That's not 8.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the problem says: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\". \n\n   Actually, the example picture for the third example (which is not provided in the input examples) is described. But from the example input \"7 9 2\" -> output 40.\n\n   Let me recast: \n        The problem states: the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. \n\n   For the first ring (k=1) on a 7x9 plate:\n        The inner rectangle for the first ring is the entire plate (since i=1: subtract 4*(0)=0). But wait, no: the first ring is the edge. Actually, the description says: the first ring goes along the edge of the plate. \n\n   How do we compute the border for a rectangle of size a x b?\n        The border (with width 1) has:\n            top and bottom: each has b cells (if we consider the rectangle has b columns and a rows) but wait: the problem uses w rows and h columns.\n\n   Let me define:\n        Let the plate have w rows and h columns.\n\n        The first ring (i=1) is the outer border. The outer border of a w x h grid (w rows, h columns) has:\n            top row: h cells\n            bottom row: h cells\n            the two sides (excluding the corners): (w-2) * 2 cells (because we have w-2 rows in between, and each side has one cell per row)\n\n        Total: h + h + (w-2)*2 = 2*h + 2*(w-2) = 2*w + 2*h - 4.\n\n        Check with example 3x3: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n        Now, what about the second ring (i=2) for a 7x9 plate?\n        The second ring is defined by the inner rectangle of size (7-4*(2-1)) x (9-4*(2-1)) = (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n        Then the border of a 3x5 rectangle is: 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n\n        Then total for k=2: first ring (8) and second ring (12) -> 20, but the example output for \"7 9 2\" is 40.\n\n   Wait, that doesn't match. Why 40?\n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: \"Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Formally, the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n   Note: the example input \"7 9 2\" -> output 40.\n\n   Another example: \"7 9 1\" -> output 28.\n\n   So first ring (k=1) for 7x9: \n        Using the formula above: 2*w + 2*h - 4 = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 32, but expected is 28.\n\n   There's a discrepancy. \n\n   Let me reexamine the example: \n        Input: \"7 9 1\" -> Output: 28.\n\n   How do we compute the first ring for 7x9?\n        The outer border of a 7x9 grid (7 rows, 9 columns) should be:\n            Top row: 9 cells\n            Bottom row: 9 cells\n            The sides (excluding the top and bottom): there are 7-2 = 5 rows (from row index 1 to 5) and each side has 1 cell per row -> 5 * 2 = 10.\n            Total: 9+9+10 = 28.\n\n   So the formula for the outer border of a rectangle with r rows and c columns is: 2*r + 2*c - 4? \n        For 7x9: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4=32, but we computed 28.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the border by:\n        Top: c\n        Bottom: c\n        Left side (without top and bottom): (r-2)\n        Right side (without top and bottom): (r-2)\n        Total: c + c + (r-2) + (r-2) = 2*c + 2*(r-2) = 2*c + 2*r - 4.\n\n   So 2*9 + 2*7 - 4 = 18+14-4=28. \n\n   Therefore, the general formula for the i-th ring (with the inner rectangle having r = w - 4*(i-1) rows and c = h - 4*(i-1) columns) is:\n        If the inner rectangle has r rows and c columns, then the border (the ring) is: 2*r + 2*c - 4.\n\n   But wait, in the example for the second ring (k=2) for 7x9:\n        First, the inner rectangle for the second ring: \n            r = 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4 = 3 rows\n            c = 9 - 4*(2-1) = 9-4 = 5 columns\n\n        Then the second ring: 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n\n        Then total for k=2: first ring (28) + second ring (12) = 40.\n\n   So the example \"7 9 2\" outputs 40, which matches.\n\n   However, note that the problem says the first ring is the edge (so i=1) and the second ring is 2 cells away (so i=2). \n\n   Therefore, the plan:\n        Read w, h, k from stdin.\n\n        total_cells = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            r = w - 4*(i-1)\n            c = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n            # If the inner rectangle has non-positive dimensions, then we break? But the problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so we don't need to worry.\n\n            # Compute the border for the inner rectangle: 2*r + 2*c - 4\n            ring_cells = 2*r + 2*c - 4\n            total_cells += ring_cells\n\n        Print total_cells.\n\n   Let's test with the first example: \"3 3 1\"\n        w=3, h=3, k=1\n        i=1: r=3, c=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n   Second example: \"7 9 1\"\n        i=1: r=7, c=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=28 -> correct.\n\n   Third example: \"7 9 2\"\n        i=1: 28\n        i=2: 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12 -> total 40 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the inner rectangle becomes too small? The condition on k: k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n        For example, if w=3, h=3, then min(w,h)=3, then floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> so k=1 is allowed, k=2 is not.\n\n   Therefore, we don't have to worry about negative dimensions or invalid rings.\n\n   Code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem states that the plate is split into w x h cells, and the rings are defined by reducing the dimensions by 4*(i-1). So the inner rectangle must have at least 1 cell in each dimension to form a ring? Actually, the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. The inner rectangle must have at least 1 row and 1 column to have a border? \n\n   But observe: if the inner rectangle has 1 row and 1 column, then the border would be: \n        r=1, c=1: 2*1+2*1-4 = 4-4 = 0. That makes sense because a 1x1 grid has no border (the border is the entire cell, but wait, no: the border is the outer edge. However, the definition of the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. In a 1x1 grid, the border is the single cell? But our formula gives 0.\n\n   Let me check the definition: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1))x(h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n   In a 1x1 grid, the entire grid is the inner rectangle. The border of a 1x1 grid is the single cell? Actually, no: the border is the set of cells that are on the edge. But the problem says the ring has width 1. \n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\", meaning that the outermost ring is the entire border. \n\n   Our formula for the ring is the perimeter, which for a rectangle is the outer edges. But note: the way we count the border is by the outer edges. \n\n   For a 1x1 grid, we don't have any border (edge) because there's only one cell and it is the entire grid? Actually, the problem might define the border as the set of cells that are adjacent to the outside. But in a 1x1 grid, there is no outside? \n\n   However, the problem constraints say that w, h >= 3 and k is at most floor((min(n,m)+1)/4). So we don't have to handle 1x1.\n\n   But let's consider the minimal case: w=3, h=3, k=1: we got 8.\n\n   Another minimal case: w=4, h=4, k=1: \n        The inner rectangle is 4x4, so the border: 2*4+2*4-4=8+8-4=12.\n        Now, how many cells? \n            Top: 4\n            Bottom: 4\n            Left and right (excluding the top and bottom): (4-2)*2 = 2*2=4 -> total 12.\n\n   But wait, the entire grid is 4x4, so the border is the outer layer. However, the problem says the first ring is the edge. \n\n   However, note that the second ring for w=4, h=4 would require: \n        i=2: w-4*(2-1)=4-4=0, so we stop at k=1.\n\n   The constraint: k is at most floor((min(4,4)+1)/4) = floor(5/4)=1. So k=1 is the maximum.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Read the input, split and convert to integers.\n\n   Then loop for i from 1 to k.\n\n   For each i, compute:\n        r = w - 4*(i-1)\n        c = h - 4*(i-1)\n        ring_cells = 2*r + 2*c - 4\n\n   Sum them up and print.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> 8\n   Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> 28\n   Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> 40\n\n   Another test: \"4 4 1\" -> 12, and k must be 1 (because floor((4+1)/4)=1).\n\n   But wait, the problem says: k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So for 4x4, k=1 is the only option.\n\n   One more: \"5 5 1\": \n        r=5, c=5 -> 2*5+2*5-4=10+10-4=16.\n\n   How many cells for a 5x5 outer ring?\n        Top:5, Bottom:5, Left:5-2=3 (middle rows) -> but wait, the sides are two columns (left and right) and for the middle rows we take one cell per row? Actually, the entire border: \n        Top:5\n        Bottom:5\n        Middle rows (3 rows): each has 3 cells (the leftmost and the rightmost) -> 3*2=6\n        Total: 5+5+6=16. Correct.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   w = int(data[0])\n   h = int(data[1])\n   k = int(data[2])\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        r = w - 4*(i-1)\n        c = h - 4*(i-1)\n        # Since the problem ensures that we don't go below the minimum, we can use the formula.\n        total += 2*r + 2*c - 4\n\n   print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the problem states that the first ring is the edge, and then the next ones are 2 cells away. Our calculation uses the entire inner rectangle's border. But note: the inner rectangle is defined by reducing the original dimensions by 4*(i-1). \n\n   This is correct because the first ring is the outer edge (which is the border of the entire w x h). The second ring is the border of the rectangle that is 4 units smaller in both dimensions (because we move 2 cells in from each side, so we remove 2 from the left and 2 from the right, and similarly for top and bottom). \n\n   Therefore, the above code is correct.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n   Example: \"3 3 1\" -> 8 (correct)\n   Example: \"7 9 1\" -> 28 (correct)\n   Example: \"7 9 2\" -> 40 (correct)\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as three separate lines? Actually, the example input is:\n\n        ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n   So we are reading one line.\n\n   The problem says: the only line contains three integers.\n\n   Therefore, we read one line.\n\n   However, the example input format in the problem statement is shown as:\n\n        Input:\n        ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n   But note: the problem says \"The only line\", so we assume one line.\n\n   But wait, the example input is shown as an array of strings. Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Input\n        The only line contains three integers w, h and k ...\n\n   So we are to read one line.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n   This is just to show multiple examples. We are to read one line.\n\n   So we write the code accordingly.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if w_i <= 0 or h_i <= 0: \n            # According to the problem, k is bounded so this should not happen, but being safe.\n            break\n        total += 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n\n   print(total)\n\n   But note: the problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), so we don't need the break, but it's good practice.\n\n   However, the condition in the problem ensures that we don't get negative dimensions, so we can skip the break. But including it doesn't harm.\n\n   Alternatively, we can rely on the fact that the formula will be computed correctly for non-positive dimensions (but then the perimeter formula 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 might be negative or zero, which we don't want). But the problem ensures we don't have such cases.\n\n   Since the problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), then the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has:\n        w_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - 4*(floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)-1) \n        But note: the bound is chosen so that the inner rectangle remains positive. \n\n   However, to be safe, we can break if either w_i or h_i becomes less than 2? Actually, the ring requires at least 1x1 to have a border? But we saw that 1x1 gives 0, and the problem doesn't require negative rings. \n\n   But the problem says k is bounded, so we don't need to handle beyond the bound.\n\n   Let me compute the bound: \n        k_max = floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\n\n        Then for i = k_max, we have:\n            w_i = w - 4*(k_max-1) >= w - 4*((min(w,h)+1)//4 - 1)\n\n        Since the bound is chosen such that the inner rectangle for the last ring is still at least 1x1? Actually, the condition is that the inner rectangle must be at least 1x1 to form a ring? But the problem does not specify that. \n\n   However, the problem says: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1))x(h - 4(i-1))\".\n\n   And the example input k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n   We can leave the code as is.\n\n   But note: the example \"3 3 1\" -> k_max = floor((3+1)/4)=1, so we don't try k=2.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. Is w the number of rows and h the number of columns? Our formula uses w for rows and h for columns. \n\n   The example: \"7 9 1\" -> 28, which we computed as 2*7+2*9-4. Here, 7 is the number of rows and 9 is the number of columns.\n\n   But what if the input is given as columns first? The problem says: the plate is a rectangle that we split into w x h cells. It doesn't specify which is rows and which is columns. \n\n   However, the example input: \n        \"3 3 1\" -> 8, and the grid is 3x3, so the border is 8.\n\n   The formula 2*w + 2*h - 4: \n        If w=3, h=3: 2*3+2*3-4=8.\n\n   But if the input was given as columns first (so h=3, w=3) then it would be the same.\n\n   Actually, the formula is symmetric in w and h? Yes, because 2*w+2*h-4 is the same regardless of which is rows and which is columns.\n\n   Therefore, we don't need to know which is rows and which is columns. The formula works for any w and h.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n   w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        nw = w - 4*(i-1)\n        nh = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if nw <= 0 or nh <= 0:\n            break\n        total += 2*nw + 2*nh - 4\n\n   print(total)\n\n   Let me run the example: \"3 3 1\" -> 8, \"7 9 1\" -> 28, \"7 9 2\" -> 40.\n\n   But wait, the example input \"7 9 1\" is given as 7 and 9. What if we swap? \"9 7 1\" -> 2*9+2*7-4=18+14-4=28. Same.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the first ring is the edge. The edge is the outer border. Our formula uses the entire outer rectangle (which is w x h). Then the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle (which is (w-4) x (h-4)). \n\n   This matches the problem statement.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is defined by its position relative to the edge of the plate, and each ring has a width of 1 cell. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the total number of cells covered by `k` concentric rings. Each ring is the border of an inner rectangle formed by reducing the original plate dimensions by `4*(i-1)` cells in both width and height for the i-th ring.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring, the number of cells in its border can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted for the corners (since they are counted twice). The formula used is `2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4`, where `w_i` and `h_i` are the width and height of the inner rectangle for the i-th ring.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring, apply the perimeter formula, and sum the results to get the total number of cells.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, which is efficient since `k` is bounded by the given constraints (up to floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        nw = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        nh = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if nw <= 0 or nh <= 0:\n            break\n        total += 2 * nw + 2 * nh - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`:\n   - **Compute Inner Dimensions**: Adjust the original dimensions by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both width and height to get the dimensions of the inner rectangle for the current ring.\n   - **Check Validity**: If either dimension becomes non-positive, break the loop as further rings would not be valid.\n   - **Calculate Cells**: Use the perimeter formula `2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4` to compute the number of cells in the current ring's border and add it to the total.\n3. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of cells to be gilded.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the geometric properties of concentric rectangles and ensures correctness within the problem constraints.",
