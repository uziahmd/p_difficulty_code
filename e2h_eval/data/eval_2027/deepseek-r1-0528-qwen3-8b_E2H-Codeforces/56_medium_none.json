Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (each between 1 and 10) so the total points are at most 20.\n Then, R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n Conditions:\n - We need a perfect matching: each base gets one rebel and vice versa.\n - The straight paths from base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect (except at endpoints).\n\n Note: The problem says \"any two (straight) paths ... do not intersect in the galaxy plane\", meaning that the segments (from base to its assigned rebel) should not cross.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning if we draw a set of non-intersecting segments from bases to rebels, then we can assign without crossings.\n\n Important: The problem does not require the entire drawing to be planar? Actually, we are only drawing R+B points and connecting each base to one rebel. But note: the condition is that the paths (the segments) do not intersect.\n\n Observation:\n Since the assignment is a perfect matching (R = B) and we have exactly R bases and R rebels, we are going to draw R segments. We require that these segments do not cross.\n\n How can we check for a perfect matching with non-crossing segments?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if there is a perfect matching (i.e., the bipartite graph of bases and rebels has a matching of size R). But wait: the problem says that the rebels and bases are distinct points, and no three points are collinear.\n\n 2. However, note: the example input has R and B as separate counts, but the example input first gives R, then B. And the matching is from bases to rebels (or vice versa). Actually, the problem says: assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases, and every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one base. So R must equal B? Actually, the input says: first line contains two integers R, B. Then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases. And the matching is a bijection. So we require R == B? But the problem says \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" and \"each base has exactly one guardian\", so yes, R must equal B. But wait, the input says \"1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10\", and the example inputs have R=B.\n\n However, the problem does not explicitly say R==B? Let me read: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\". This implies that the number of bases must be at least R? Actually, no: because each spaceship must be assigned a base, and each base can be assigned at most one spaceship. So we require R <= B? But the example input has R and B given separately. And the second example input is '2 1', which has R=2, B=1 -> then it's impossible because we cannot assign two spaceships to one base (and also the matching requires each base gets one, so we need R==B). \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". Therefore, the number of bases must equal the number of spaceships. So we can assume R == B.\n\n But wait, the input example 1: R=3, B=3 -> 3 rebels and 3 bases. Example 2: R=2, B=1 -> so R != B, and the output is No.\n\n So the problem requires R == B? Actually, no: the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and then says \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", and \"each base has exactly one guardian\". This is a perfect matching between the two sets. Therefore, we must have R == B.\n\n However, the problem input does not necessarily guarantee R==B? The constraints say 1<=R,B<=10. So we might get R != B? Then we can immediately output \"No\".\n\n But let's see the examples: \n   Example 1: R=3, B=3 -> Yes.\n   Example 2: R=2, B=1 -> No.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        exit(0)\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input format includes two integers R, B. Then, we are told that the rebels and bases are given. So the matching condition requires R == B.\n\n But note: the problem says \"output Yes\" if it is possible to assign R Rebels to guard B bases with the conditions. The conditions include that each base has one and each rebel has one. So if R != B, then by the pigeonhole principle, we cannot have a bijection. So indeed we require R == B.\n\n However, the problem statement says: \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" and \"each base has exactly one guardian\". This is a bijection, so R must equal B.\n\n Therefore, we can assume that the input will have R and B, and we require R == B for a matching to exist.\n\n But wait, what if R != B? Then we output No.\n\n However, the problem says: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and then the conditions. So if R != B, then even without considering the non-intersection, we don't have a matching. So we can return No.\n\n But note: the problem says \"output Yes, otherwise output No\". So if R != B, we output No.\n\n Now, if R == B, we need to check if there exists a perfect matching (which is trivial: the complete bipartite graph? But wait, the points are in general position (no three collinear). However, the matching condition here is about non-intersecting segments.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the matching to be any particular one. We just need one matching (a bijection) such that the segments (from base to rebel) do not intersect.\n\n How to check?\n\n We can use the following idea:\n\n 1. Consider the set of all points (rebels and bases). We have 2*R points.\n\n 2. The non-crossing condition for segments: two segments (A-B) and (C-D) do not intersect if the points are arranged appropriately. \n\n However, note: we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily. So we are looking for a permutation p (matching) such that for all i, the segment from base i to rebel p(i) does not cross any other segment.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the entire set of segments must be non-crossing. \n\n Observation: In the plane, a set of segments connecting two sets (with no three collinear) can be drawn without crossings if and only if the two sets are interleaved in a particular order. \n\n Another idea: draw all the points and consider the convex hull? Or use a sweeping line.\n\n However, note that the problem is small (R, B up to 10, so at most 20 points). We can try to use brute-force: generate all permutations (factorial of 10 is about 3.6 million, which is acceptable in Python? Actually, we have R! possibilities, and R<=10 -> 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we need to be careful.\n\n But wait: we are matching the R bases to the R rebels. So we have R! matchings to check.\n\n However, we can use a recursive backtracking or use dynamic programming with bitmask. But 2^10 states is 1024, and then we have to check the condition for the entire matching. But the condition is global: the entire set of segments must be non-intersecting.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a known fact: the non-crossing matching condition for two sets of points (if they are interleaved appropriately) can be checked by an ordering.\n\n Steps for checking a fixed matching:\n\n   For a fixed matching (a bijection from bases to rebels), we draw R segments. We need to check that no two segments cross.\n\n   Two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) cross if and only if the points are in cyclic order: p1, p2, q1, q2 (or one of the other two orders) around the circle? But we are in 2D.\n\n   Actually, the standard way to check if two segments (A-B) and (C-D) intersect is:\n\n        orientation(A, C, B) * orientation(A, D, B) < 0 and \n        orientation(C, A, D) * orientation(C, B, D) < 0\n\n   But wait, we are drawing straight line segments. However, note: the problem says the segments are from base to rebel. The condition is that they do not intersect. But note: the endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about degenerate cases.\n\n   However, the above method checks if the two segments intersect. But note: the entire matching must have no two segments crossing. So we have to check all pairs of segments.\n\n   But wait: the matching is a set of disjoint segments. We require that no two segments cross.\n\n   However, if we fix a matching, then we have to check every pair of segments (there are R*(R-1)/2 pairs). \n\n   Algorithm for a fixed matching:\n\n        Let M be the matching: a list of R tuples (base_i, rebel_j) for i from 0 to R-1.\n\n        For k from 0 to R-1:\n            For l from k+1 to R-1:\n                Check if the segment from base_k to rebel_M[k] and the segment from base_l to rebel_M[l] intersect.\n\n        If any pair intersects, then this matching is invalid.\n\n   But note: the matching is a bijection, so we are assigning each base to one rebel. We have to consider that the rebels are fixed and the bases are fixed.\n\n   However, we are iterating over all permutations of rebels for bases.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read R, B. If R != B, output \"No\".\n\n        Then, read the next R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n        Then, if R==B, we generate all permutations of range(R) (matching: base i is matched to rebel permutation[i]).\n\n        Then, for each permutation, we form the matching: for each base index i, connect base[i] to rebel[permutation[i]].\n\n        Then, check that none of the segments cross.\n\n        If we find one matching that has no crossing, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, after checking all, output \"No\".\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify which base is which. Actually, the bases are given in some order, and the rebels are given in some order. We are free to assign any base to any rebel arbitrarily.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify an order for the bases and rebels. We are given:\n\n        First R lines: rebels (let's call them list R_list)\n        Next B lines: bases (list B_list)\n\n   Then, we are matching the B bases (which are given in an order) to the R rebels (given in an order). But the condition is independent of the labeling? Actually, the problem says \"the i-th Rebel spaceship\" and \"the j-th base\". So the input order matters.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require the matching to respect the input order. We can assign base j to any rebel i.\n\n   So we have to consider all bijections between the set of bases (size R) and the set of rebels (size R).\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Read R, B.\n        Step 2: If R != B: print \"No\" and exit.\n        Step 3: Read the next R lines for rebels, store in list rebels = [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...]\n        Step 4: Read the next B lines for bases, store in list bases = [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...]\n\n        Step 5: Generate all permutations of [0,1,...,R-1] (since we have R rebels and R bases, we will assign base i to rebel perm[i])\n\n        Step 6: For each permutation p:\n            Create a list of segments: for i in range(R): segment from bases[i] to rebels[p[i]]\n\n            Then, check for every pair of segments (i, j) with i < j: \n                if the two segments (bases[i] to rebels[p[i]]) and (bases[j] to rebels[p[j]]) intersect, then break.\n\n            If no intersection, then output \"Yes\" and break out.\n\n        Step 7: If no permutation works, output \"No\".\n\n   Now, how to check if two segments (A-B) and (C-D) intersect?\n\n        We can use the orientation method.\n\n        Define a function for orientation: \n            Given three points A, B, C, returns:\n                0 if A, B, C are collinear\n                1 if clockwise\n                -1 if counterclockwise\n\n        Then, two segments AB and CD intersect if the orientations are different:\n\n            o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n            o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n            o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n            o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n        Actually, the standard method is:\n\n            The segments AB and CD intersect if:\n                (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) have different orientations, and\n                (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) have different orientations.\n\n        However, we can also use:\n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                # Check if segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect\n                def orientation(o, p, q):\n                    # Returns the orientation of the triplet o, p, q.\n                    # 0 -> collinear, 1 -> clockwise, -1 -> counterclockwise\n                    val = (p[0]-o[0]) * (q[1]-o[1]) - (p[1]-o[1]) * (q[0]-o[0])\n                    if val == 0:\n                        return 0\n                    elif val > 0:\n                        return 1\n                    else:\n                        return -1\n\n                o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n                o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n                o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n                o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n                # General case: the two segments straddle each other.\n                if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n                    return True\n\n                # Special cases: if one of the points lies on the other segment?\n                # But the problem states: no three points are collinear. So we don't have to worry about collinear? Actually, the condition says \"no three points are on the same line\", so no three points are collinear. Therefore, we don't have any point lying on the segment unless it is an endpoint.\n\n                # But note: our segments are defined by endpoints. The endpoints are distinct and no three points collinear. So the only way a point can lie on a segment is if it is an endpoint.\n\n                # However, the condition of the problem: the bases and rebels are distinct, and no three points are collinear. So if a point is not an endpoint, then it cannot lie on the segment.\n\n                # Therefore, we can ignore the special cases? Actually, the standard method for checking segment intersection (with the orientation) does not handle the case when one endpoint lies on the other segment. But wait, our condition says no three points are collinear, so an endpoint lying on the other segment would imply three points (the two endpoints and that point) are collinear? Not necessarily: the segment from a to b and the point c: if c is on the segment ab, then the three points a, b, c are collinear. But the condition says no three points are collinear. Therefore, we don't have to worry about endpoints lying on the other segment (unless they are the same point, but the points are distinct).\n\n                # So the above condition (o1 != o2 and o3 != o4) is sufficient.\n\n                return False\n\n        However, wait: the standard condition is:\n\n            The segments AB and CD intersect if and only if one of the following two cases holds:\n                Case 1: \n                    orientation(A, B, C) != orientation(A, B, D) and \n                    orientation(C, D, A) != orientation(C, D, B)\n                Case 2: \n                    All four points are collinear? -> but we have no three collinear, so Case 2 doesn't happen.\n\n        So we can use the above.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths do not intersect\", meaning that the entire set of segments must be non-crossing. However, the above condition for two segments is necessary and sufficient for two segments to intersect.\n\n   However, note: two segments might share an endpoint? But wait, in our matching, each base is connected to one rebel and each rebel to one base. The endpoints are distinct: the bases and rebels are distinct sets? The problem does not say that the bases and rebels are disjoint. But wait, the input says: \"no two points coincide\", so all points are distinct. Therefore, the bases and rebels are disjoint sets. So no shared endpoints.\n\n   Therefore, we don't have to worry about endpoint sharing.\n\n   However, wait: the problem does not say the bases and rebels are disjoint. But the input says \"no two points coincide\", meaning that all the given points (both bases and rebels) are distinct. So yes, disjoint.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   But wait: what if the two segments share an endpoint? They don't, because the endpoints are from two disjoint sets.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the above function.\n\n   However, there is a caveat: the standard orientation method for segment intersection does not consider the case when the segments are collinear? But we have no three collinear, so we are safe.\n\n   But wait: the above function returns True only when the orientations are different. However, if the two segments are collinear and overlapping? But we have no three collinear, so they cannot be collinear. Therefore, we don't have to worry.\n\n   Let me test the function with two segments that cross.\n\n   Example: \n        A = (0,0), B = (1,1), C = (0,1), D = (1,0)\n        Then, segment AB is from (0,0) to (1,1) and CD from (0,1) to (1,0). They cross.\n\n        orientation(A, B, C) = orientation((0,0),(1,1),(0,1)) \n            = (1-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) = 1*1 - 1*0 = 1 -> positive -> 1\n        orientation(A, B, D) = orientation((0,0),(1,1),(1,0))\n            = (1-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(1-0) = 1*0 - 1*1 = -1 -> negative -> -1\n        So o1=1, o2=-1 -> different.\n\n        orientation(C, D, A) = orientation((0,1),(1,0),(0,0))\n            = (1-0)*(0-1) - (0-1)*(0-0) = 1*(-1) - (-1)*0 = -1 -> negative -> -1\n        orientation(C, D, B) = orientation((0,1),(1,0),(1,1))\n            = (1-0)*(1-1) - (0-1)*(1-0) = 1*0 - (-1)*1 = 1 -> positive -> 1\n        So o3=-1, o4=1 -> different.\n\n        Therefore, the function returns True.\n\n   Another test: two segments that don't cross.\n\n        A=(0,0), B=(2,2), C=(1,0), D=(1,2)\n        These two segments: AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), CD is from (1,0) to (1,2). They don't cross.\n\n        orientation(A, B, C): (0,0),(2,2),(1,0) -> (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(1-0) = 2*0 - 2*1 = -2 -> negative -> -1\n        orientation(A, B, D): (0,0),(2,2),(1,2) -> (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(1-0) = 2*2 - 2*1 = 4-2=2 -> positive -> 1\n        So o1=-1, o2=1 -> different.\n\n        orientation(C, D, A): (1,0),(1,2),(0,0) -> (1-1)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(0-1) = 0 - 2*(-1)=2 -> positive -> 1\n        orientation(C, D, B): (1,0),(1,2),(2,2) -> (1-1)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(2-1) = 0 - 2*1 = -2 -> negative -> -1\n        So o3=1, o4=-1 -> different.\n\n        Then the function returns True, but they don't cross.\n\n        Wait, that's a problem.\n\n   What's the issue? The standard condition is that the two segments intersect if the orientations are different AND the two points (C and D) are on opposite sides of AB, and A and B are on opposite sides of CD. But note: the condition I wrote is:\n\n        if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n\n   This condition is actually for checking if the two segments are \"crossing\" in the sense of having endpoints on opposite sides. However, the standard condition for segment intersection is:\n\n        if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4 and the min(max(A.x, B.x), min(max(C.x, D.x)) ... but wait, no.\n\n   Actually, the standard condition is:\n\n        def on_segment(a, b, c):\n            # Check if c is between a and b in the x-projection or y-projection?\n            # But we don't need that because of the no three collinear condition.\n\n        The common method is:\n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                def orientation(o, p, q):\n                    # ... same as above\n\n                o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n                o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n                o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n                o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n                # General case: if the orientations are not the same for both endpoints of one segment with respect to the other segment, then the segments intersect.\n                if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n                    return True\n\n                # Also, if any three points are collinear, then we have to check if the fourth point is between the other two? But we don't have three collinear, so we skip.\n\n                return False\n\n        But wait, the example above (the vertical line and the diagonal) didn't cross, but the condition returned True.\n\n        Why? Because the standard condition is that the two segments intersect if the two endpoints of one segment lie on opposite sides of the other segment, and vice versa. \n\n        However, in the example:\n\n            Segment AB: (0,0)-(2,2) and CD: (1,0)-(1,2)\n\n            The point C (1,0) is on one side of AB, and D (1,2) is on the same side? Actually, we need to check the side of the line AB for points C and D.\n\n            The line AB: from (0,0) to (2,2). The equation: y = x.\n\n            Point C (1,0): y-x = -1 -> negative.\n            Point D (1,2): y-x = 1 -> positive.\n\n            So they are on opposite sides. Similarly, for CD (which is the line x=1) and points A(0,0): x-1 = -1 (negative) and B(2,2): x-1=1 (positive) -> opposite sides.\n\n            Therefore, the condition should return True, but wait, the segments do not cross. \n\n        What's the difference? The condition for segment intersection requires that the endpoints lie on opposite sides and also that the segments are not collinear. But wait, the segments are not collinear. However, the standard condition is:\n\n            The segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n                (a) (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) have different orientations, and\n                (b) (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) have different orientations.\n\n        And in the example, we have both (a) and (b). But the segments do not intersect. \n\n        Actually, the standard condition is for proper crossing (when the segments are not collinear and the endpoints are on opposite sides). But note: the condition above (using orientations) is actually for checking that the two segments are \"crossing\" in the combinatorial sense, but the segments might not actually cross if they are not in the interior. \n\n        Wait, the standard method for checking segment intersection (with the orientation) is designed for the case where the segments are not collinear. However, the condition is:\n\n            The segments AB and CD intersect if and only if one of the following two cases holds:\n\n            Case 1: \n                orientation(A, B, C) != orientation(A, B, D) and \n                orientation(C, D, A) != orientation(C, D, B)\n\n            Case 2: \n                All four points are collinear and the projections on the line overlap.\n\n        But we don't have Case 2 because no three are collinear.\n\n        However, the example above: the two segments AB and CD do not intersect, but the condition is satisfied. \n\n        Why? Because the condition using orientation does not check for the actual crossing in the geometric sense. It only checks that the endpoints are on opposite sides. But the segments might not cross if they are separated by the line? \n\n        Actually, the condition (with the orientations) is necessary and sufficient for the segments to intersect if the four points are in general position (no three collinear). \n\n        But wait, in the example, the two segments do not intersect, but the condition returns True. \n\n        Let me recalc the orientations:\n\n            A=(0,0), B=(2,2), C=(1,0), D=(1,2)\n\n            o1 = orientation(A, B, C) = (B-A)x(C-A) = (2,2) x (1,0) = 2*0 - 2*1 = -2 -> negative -> -1\n            o2 = orientation(A, B, D) = (2,2) x (1,2) = 2*2 - 2*1 = 4-2=2 -> positive -> 1\n\n            o1 != o2 -> True.\n\n            o3 = orientation(C, D, A) = (D-C) x (A-C) = (0,2) x (-1,0) = 0*0 - 2*(-1) = 2 -> positive -> 1\n            o4 = orientation(C, D, B) = (0,2) x (1,0) = 0*0 - 2*1 = -2 -> negative -> -1\n\n            o3 != o4 -> True.\n\n        So the condition returns True, but the segments do not intersect.\n\n        What is the correct condition?\n\n        Actually, the standard condition for two segments (AB and CD) to intersect (properly) is:\n\n            (orientation(A, B, C) != orientation(A, B, D)) && (orientation(C, D, A) != orientation(C, D, B))\n\n        This condition is used to check that the two segments are not separated by the lines. However, it does not guarantee that the intersection is inside the segments? \n\n        But wait, if the two segments are not collinear and the endpoints are on opposite sides, then the two segments must cross? \n\n        Actually, no: the segments might not cross because one segment might be entirely on one side of the infinite line of the other segment, but wait: the condition of opposite sides for both pairs means that the two segments must cross.\n\n        However, in the example, the two segments do not cross. \n\n        Let me plot:\n\n            AB: from (0,0) to (2,2) (a diagonal)\n            CD: from (1,0) to (1,2) (a vertical line)\n\n            The vertical line is entirely to the right of the diagonal? Actually, the diagonal goes through (1,1). The vertical line goes from (1,0) to (1,2). The diagonal passes through (1,1) which is on the vertical line. But wait, the problem says no three points are collinear. The points (0,0), (2,2), (1,0) are not collinear, but (0,0), (2,2), (1,1) would be. However, (1,1) is not given. But the segment AB passes through (1,1) (the midpoint). The segment CD is the line x=1. The point (1,1) is an endpoint? No, it is not one of the given points. But the segment AB goes through (1,1) and the segment CD goes from (1,0) to (1,2). So they meet at (1,1). \n\n        However, the problem says: the bases and rebels are distinct and no three points are collinear. But (1,1) is not given. The condition does not forbid the segments from meeting at a point that is not one of the given points? \n\n        The problem says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D)\"\n\n        So if they meet at (1,1) (which is not an endpoint) then that counts as an intersection.\n\n        But wait, the example: the vertical segment and the diagonal segment cross at (1,1). So they do intersect.\n\n        But wait, the example I thought they did not cross is actually crossing at (1,1). \n\n        However, the problem says: the bases and rebels are distinct and no three points are collinear. But the segment AB (from base (0,0) to rebel (2,2)) and the segment CD (from base (1,0) to rebel (1,2)) do not share any endpoint. And the point (1,1) is not one of the given points, but the two segments still cross.\n\n        So the condition should consider that.\n\n        But then why did the orientation condition return True? Because the condition is designed for that: the two segments cross if the orientations are different.\n\n        However, wait: the point (1,1) is not one of the endpoints, but the condition using orientation is independent of the endpoints. \n\n        But wait, the standard condition using orientation does not require the intersection to be an endpoint. It just checks if the segments cross anywhere.\n\n        Actually, the condition is:\n\n            Two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect if and only if one of the points p2, q2 is inside the segment (p1,q1) and vice versa, OR the orientations are different.\n\n        But wait, the standard condition is the one we used.\n\n        However, let me check with the definition:\n\n            The segments AB and CD intersect if and only if the points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\n        This is exactly what we checked.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n        But wait, the example: the segments AB and CD do cross at (1,1). So the condition is correct.\n\n        Now, let me take two segments that do not share an endpoint and do not cross.\n\n        Example: A=(0,0), B=(2,0), C=(1,1), D=(3,1)\n\n        Check: \n            AB is from (0,0) to (2,0) (the x-axis), CD is from (1,1) to (3,1) (a horizontal line above).\n\n            They do not cross.\n\n            o1 = orientation(A, B, C) = (B-A) x (C-A) = (2,0) x (1,1) = 2*1 - 0*1 = 2 -> positive -> 1\n            o2 = orientation(A, B, D) = (2,0) x (3,1) = 2*1 - 0*3 = 2 -> positive -> 1\n            o1 == o2 -> so the first condition fails.\n\n            Similarly, for CD: \n                o3 = orientation(C, D, A) = (D-C) x (A-C) = (2,0) x (-1,-1) = 2*(-1) - 0*(-1) = -2 -> negative -> -1\n                o4 = orientation(C, D, B) = (2,0) x (2,-1) = 2*(-1) - 0*2 = -2 -> negative -> -1\n            o3 == o4 -> second condition fails.\n\n            So the function returns False, which is correct.\n\n        Another example: two segments that don't cross but one endpoint lies on the other segment? But we have no three collinear, so that situation doesn't occur.\n\n        So the function is correct.\n\n   However, wait: the example I initially thought was not crossing (the vertical and the diagonal) is actually crossing, so the condition is correct.\n\n   But note: the example I gave initially was:\n\n        Input: \n            ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2']\n\n        We must output \"Yes\".\n\n        Let me check the example: \n            Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n            Bases: [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\n        One possible matching: \n            base0 (-2,1) -> rebel0 (0,0)\n            base1 (0,3) -> rebel1 (2,0)\n            base2 (2,2) -> rebel2 (3,1)\n\n        Check the segments:\n\n            Segment1: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n            Segment2: (0,3) to (2,0)\n            Segment3: (2,2) to (3,1)\n\n        Check if segment1 and segment2 cross.\n\n            A=(-2,1), B=(0,0), C=(0,3), D=(2,0)\n\n            o1 = orientation(A, B, C) = (B-A) x (C-A) = (2,-1) x (2,2) = 2*2 - (-1)*2 = 4 +2 =6 -> positive -> 1\n            o2 = orientation(A, B, D) = (2,-1) x (4,1) = 2*1 - (-1)*4 = 2+4=6 -> positive -> 1 -> same -> so condition for AB fails.\n\n            So they don't cross? Actually, we have to check the other condition too.\n\n            o3 = orientation(C, D, A) = (D-C) x (A-C) = (2,-3) x (-2,-2) = 2*(-2) - (-3)*(-2) = -4 -6 = -10 -> negative -> -1\n            o4 = orientation(C, D, B) = (2,-3) x (2,-3) ??? Wait, let me recalc:\n\n            Actually, for segment CD: from (0,3) to (2,0). The vector is (2, -3). Then for point A (-2,1): \n                (2, -3) x (-2-0, 1-3) = (2,-3) x (-2,-2) = 2*(-2) - (-3)*(-2) = -4 -6 = -10 -> negative -> -1\n            For point B (0,0): \n                (2,-3) x (0-0,0-3) = (2,-3) x (0,-3) = 2*(-3) - (-3)*0 = -6 -> negative -> -1\n\n            So the second condition: o3 and o4 are both -1 -> same.\n\n            Therefore, the two segments do not cross.\n\n        Now, check segment1 and segment3:\n\n            Segment1: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n            Segment3: (2,2) to (3,1)\n\n            o1 = orientation(A, B, E) for E=(2,2): \n                (0-(-2), 0-1) = (2,-1) x (4,1) = 2*1 - (-1)*4 = 2+4=6 -> positive -> 1\n            o2 = orientation(A, B, F) for F=(3,1): \n                (2,-1) x (5,0) = 2*0 - (-1)*5 = 5 -> positive -> 1 -> same.\n\n            o3 = orientation(E, F, A) = (3-2,1-2) x (-2-2,1-2) = (1,-1)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and a set of bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the bases and the spaceships to find one where no two segments cross.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching (bijection) between the bases and the spaceships such that the segments connecting them do not intersect. Given the constraints (R and B are up to 10), a brute-force approach is feasible by generating all possible permutations of assignments.\n2. **Key Insight**: For any two segments to not intersect, their endpoints must be arranged such that they do not cross each other. This can be checked using the orientation method, which determines if the points lie on opposite sides of each other's lines.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Check R == B**: If the number of bases and spaceships are not equal, output \"No\" immediately since a perfect matching is impossible.\n   - **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of spaceship assignments to bases, check if all segments formed by these assignments are non-intersecting.\n   - **Segment Intersection Check**: For each pair of segments in the current permutation, use the orientation method to determine if they intersect. If any segment pair intersects, the permutation is invalid.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks all permutations of size R (up to 10!), which is computationally feasible given the constraints (10! = 3,628,800). Each permutation requires checking all pairs of segments, leading to a total complexity of O(R! * R^2), which is acceptable for R ≤ 10.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    R = int(next(it))\n    B = int(next(it))\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(next(it))\n        y = int(next(it))\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(next(it))\n        y = int(next(it))\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    def orientation(a, b, c):\n        val = (b[0] - a[0]) * (c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1]) * (c[0] - a[0])\n        if val == 0:\n            return 0\n        elif val > 0:\n            return 1\n        else:\n            return -1\n            \n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n        o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n        o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n        o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n        \n        if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n            return True\n            \n        return False\n        \n    found = False\n    for perm in permutations(range(R)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                seg1 = (bases[i], rebels[perm[i]])\n                seg2 = (bases[j], rebels[perm[j]])\n                if segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of Rebels (R) and Bases (B), followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Immediate Check**: If R and B are not equal, the answer is \"No\" because a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Permutation Generation**: All possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases are generated.
