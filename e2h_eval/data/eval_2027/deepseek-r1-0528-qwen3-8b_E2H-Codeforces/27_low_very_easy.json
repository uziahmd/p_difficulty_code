On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous subarray once.\n\n Observation: Since the only numbers are 1 and 2, the entire sequence is made of two types.\n\n After reversal, the sequence will still consist of only 1's and 2's.\n\n The longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in such a sequence can be broken down as:\n\n - Any subsequence that uses only 1's is non-decreasing.\n - Any subsequence that uses only 2's is non-decreasing.\n - Also, we can have a mix: [1, 2] is allowed, but [2, 1] is not.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to reverse one contiguous part.\n\n Let's think about what happens when we reverse a segment.\n\n Without reversal, the original sequence has some LNDS.\n\n But note: we can choose to reverse any contiguous segment. So we are allowed to change the arrangement of 1's and 2's arbitrarily in that segment? Actually, no: reversing the segment flips the order.\n\n However, note: the reversal operation is just flipping the segment. We can also consider doing nothing (reverse an empty segment? but the problem says interval [l, r] with 1<=l<=r<=n, so we can also reverse a single element which doesn't change anything).\n\n But note: the goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n What is the LNDS in a sequence of 1's and 2's?\n\n It is simply the total number of elements if we can form a non-decreasing sequence. However, note that we can only use each element once.\n\n Actually, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if all the 1's come first and then the 2's.\n\n But wait: we can have a non-decreasing subsequence that is not contiguous. However, in a sequence of 1's and 2's, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing, otherwise it might be less.\n\n Actually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1's and 2's is:\n\n   count_1 + count_2   (if there is at least one 1 and one 2, then we can take all 1's and then all 2's, but note: we can skip some 2's if they appear before 1's? Actually, no: because we require the indices to be increasing. However, we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that appear after the last 1? Not necessarily.\n\n But wait: the entire sequence is not necessarily rearranged to [all 1's][all 2's]. We are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n How can we maximize the LNDS?\n\n Note: The LNDS cannot exceed n, obviously.\n\n Without reversal, what is the LNDS? \n   We can take all the 1's and then from the remaining 2's we can take all that come after the last 1? Actually, we can take every element that is 1 or 2, but if we have a 2 then a 1 then a 2, then the subsequence must be increasing, so we can take the first 2 and the last 2, but not the middle 1 if it breaks the chain? \n\n Alternatively, note that in a sequence of 1's and 2's, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the same as the longest contiguous block of non-decreasing elements? Actually, no: because we can skip elements.\n\n Example: [1, 1, 2, 2] -> entire sequence is non-decreasing, so LNDS = 4.\n\n But what if we have [2, 1, 2]? \n   Then we can take the first 2 and then the last 2? But wait: the indices must be increasing. The subsequence would be [2 (at index0), 2 (at index2)] -> length 2. Alternatively, we can take the two 2's and the 1 is skipped. Or we can take the 1 and then the last 2? But 1<=2, so we can do [1,2] (from index1 and index2) -> length 2. But actually, the entire sequence is not non-decreasing, but the LNDS is 2.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. So in [2,1,2] we can reverse the entire segment [0,2] to get [2,1,2] again (same). Or we can reverse [0,1] to get [1,2,2] -> then the LNDS is 3. Or reverse [1,2] to get [2,2,1] -> then the LNDS is ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (comprising only 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous subarray. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the LNDS in a sequence of 1s and 2s is determined by the arrangement of these digits. The optimal scenario is when all 1s come before all 2s, making the entire sequence non-decreasing. However, if the original sequence does not meet this condition, reversing a part of the sequence can help achieve this optimal arrangement.\n\n2. **Insight**: The problem reduces to finding the longest segment where all 1s precede all 2s. This segment, when reversed, will form a part of the sequence where 1s are followed by 2s, thus maximizing the LNDS. The solution involves checking all possible segments of the original sequence to determine if reversing them results in a longer LNDS.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to compute the lengths of the longest segments where 1s are followed by 2s. Specifically, we calculate:\n   - `dp1[i]`: The length of the segment starting at index `i` where all elements are 1s until a 2 appears.\n   - `dp2[i]`: The length of the segment starting at index `i` where all elements are 2s until a 1 appears.\n   Using these, we can determine the best possible segment to reverse by considering combinations of `dp1` and `dp2` values.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element in the array once for `dp1` and `dp2`, resulting in O(n) time complexity for these steps. The main loop runs in O(n^2) time due to nested loops checking all possible segments. Given the constraint `n ≤ 2000`, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    dp1 = [0] * n\n    dp2 = [0] * n\n    \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if arr[i] == 1:\n            dp1[i] = 1 + (dp1[i+1] if i < n-1 else 0)\n        else:\n            dp1[i] = 1\n            \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if arr[i] == 2:\n            dp2[i] = 1 + (dp2[i+1] if i < n-1 else 0)\n        else:\n            dp2[i] = 1\n\n    best = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            total_ones = dp1[i]\n            total_twos = dp2[j]\n            seg_length = j - i + 1\n            if total_ones + total_twos >= seg_length:\n                candidate = total_ones + total_twos\n                if candidate > best:\n                    best = candidate\n                    \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (length of the sequence) followed by the sequence itself.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Arrays**: \n   - `dp1[i]` stores the number of consecutive 1s starting from index `i` (including any subsequent 1s until a 2 is encountered).\n   - `dp2[i]` stores the number of consecutive 2s starting from index `i` (including any subsequent 2s until a 1 is encountered).\n3. **Finding Optimal Segment**: For each possible segment from index `i` to `j`, the code checks if reversing this segment would allow all 1s to precede all 2s. The length of such a segment is the sum of 1s and 2s in it, which is compared to find the maximum possible LNDS.\n4. **Output**: The maximum length found is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all potential segments that could maximize the LNDS by leveraging dynamic programming to precompute necessary segment lengths, ensuring optimal performance.",
