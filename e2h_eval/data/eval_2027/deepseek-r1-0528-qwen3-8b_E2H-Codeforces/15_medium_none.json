They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string s of length n.\n The tournament has 2^n teams, with skill levels being a permutation of [1, 2, ..., 2^n].\n The string s has n characters. Each character at index i (0-indexed) corresponds to the result pattern for the (n-i)-th phase?\n But note: the problem says:\n   In the first phase (which is the initial one with 2^(n-1) games), we have the string s[0] (if we consider the first character as index0).\n   Then the next phase (if there is one) would be the next character.\n\n However, note the description: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\"\n   \"if s_i is equal to 1, then during the i-th phase, the team with the higher skill level wins\"\n\n But note: the phases are described from the beginning (first phase) to the last (which is the smallest phase). So the first character in the string s is for the first phase (with 2^(n-1) games).\n\n We are to find all integers x (from 1 to 2^n) such that there exists a permutation p (which is just a rearrangement of [1,2,...,2^n]) satisfying:\n   In each phase j (from 0 to n-1, corresponding to the j-th character in s), the outcome of the matches in that phase is determined by s[j].\n\n How does the tournament progress?\n   Phase 0: 2^n teams -> 2^(n-1) winners (if s[0]=='1', then higher skill wins; if '0', lower skill wins)\n   Phase 1: 2^(n-1) teams -> 2^(n-2) winners\n   ...\n   Phase n-1: 2^1 teams -> 1 winner.\n\n Note: The structure of the bracket is fixed: \n   In the first phase, the teams are grouped as (0,1), (2,3), (4,5), ... (so the first two teams play, then the next two, etc.)\n   Then the second phase: the winners of (0,1) and (2,3) play, then (4,5) and (6,7) play, etc.\n\n However, the catch is: the outcome of each match in a phase is determined by the entire set of winners from the previous phase? \n Actually, the entire bracket is built from the initial bracket and the outcomes in each phase are fixed by s.\n\n But note: the problem asks: which integers x (skill levels) can be the champion?\n\n Approach:\n\n Let's denote:\n   There are 2^n teams, with distinct skills from 1 to 2^n.\n\n We are going to simulate the tournament for a candidate champion x. However, we don't know the entire permutation, but we know the outcome rules per phase.\n\n Alternatively, we can think about the conditions under which a particular team x can win.\n\n Observation:\n   The tournament is a single elimination bracket. The key is that in each phase, the outcome is determined by the rule (either by higher or lower skill). \n\n How to model the tournament?\n\n   We can represent the tournament as a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves (teams) and n+1 levels (from the leaves to the root). The leaves are ordered from left to right: team1, team2, ... team_{2^n}.\n\n   The first phase (rooted at level n) is the leaves. Then the next phase (level n-1) uses the winners from the first phase to form the next level, etc.\n\n   In each node (which represents a game) of the bracket, the two children (the two teams that meet in that game) will face each other. The outcome depends on the phase (i.e., the depth of the node: the root is at depth 0, then the next level is depth 1, etc.? But note: the first phase is the one with the most games (at the bottom) and the last phase is the final (one game). \n\n   Actually, the problem indexes the phases from first (largest) to last (smallest). The first phase (index0) is the one with 2^(n-1) games (so at the bottom of the bracket). The last phase (index n-1) is the final (1 game).\n\n   In our tree, the first phase corresponds to the matches at the first level above the leaves (so the leaves are level0, then the next level is level1). The phase index i (0-indexed) corresponds to the nodes at depth i+1 (if we count the leaves as depth0, then the first phase is depth1, second phase depth2, ... until depth n for the root).\n\n   However, the rule for a phase is determined by the character s[i] (for the i-th phase, which is the phase at depth i+1). \n\n   But note: the problem says \"during the i-th phase\" (with 2^(n-i) games). The first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) = 2^n/2 games, so depth1. The second phase (i=1) has 2^(n-2) games, so depth2. The k-th phase (0-indexed) has depth k+1.\n\n   Now, for a team x to be the champion, we must assign the other teams (the numbers 1 to 2^n except x) to the leaves (and the leaf corresponding to x is fixed) such that when we traverse the bracket according to the outcomes (given by s) we end up with x.\n\n   Conditions for a match:\n\n     In a match between two teams a and b (a != x, b != x, or one might be x) in a phase where the rule is '1' (higher wins): then the higher of the two wins.\n                rule '0': then the lower wins.\n\n   However, note: we cannot assign arbitrary numbers to the leaves arbitrarily. The assignment must be a permutation. And the bracket structure is fixed: the leaves are arranged in increasing order? Actually, the problem does not specify the initial ordering beyond the bracket formation (team1 vs team2, etc.). But note: the problem says the teams are split into pairs: team1 vs team2, team3 vs team4, etc. So the initial ordering is by the natural order of the teams (which are labeled by their skill level). However, wait: the teams are labeled from 1 to 2^n, but the permutation p assigns these labels arbitrarily. \n\n   Actually, the problem states: \"You are given a string s which consists of n characters.\" and the permutation p is a permutation of integers 1 to 2^n.\n\n   But note: the problem does not fix the initial ordering of the teams. The bracket formation is fixed: the first two teams (by their assigned skill labels) play, then the next two, etc. However, the permutation p is what we are free to choose (to see if there exists one that makes x win). \n\n   Therefore, we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the leaves. However, the bracket structure is fixed: the leaves are arranged from left to right as the teams are assigned (but we can assign any number to any leaf). \n\n   But note: the problem says \"the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4, ...\" â€” meaning that in the initial bracket, the first leaf is team1, the second is team2, the third is team3, etc. However, in our permutation p, we are assigning the numbers (the skill levels) to the teams. But the teams are identified by their skill level. \n\n   Let me clarify: the problem says \"the i-th team has skill p_i\", and p is a permutation of [1,2,...,2^n]. Then the bracket is built by the fixed rule: the first two teams (i.e., the two teams with the smallest assigned numbers) are paired? Or the teams are numbered arbitrarily and then the bracket is built by the natural order of their indices? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4, and so on\". \n\n   This implies that the teams are labeled from 1 to 2^n. But wait, the permutation p is given, so the team with skill 1 is team1, the team with skill 2 is team2, etc.? \n\n   However, the problem states: \"You are given a string s\" and then defines the results. Then we are to find the winning integers x (meaning: there exists a permutation p such that the team with skill x wins the tournament).\n\n   So the teams are labeled by their skill: the team with skill 1 is the weakest, and the team with skill 2^n is the strongest.\n\n   The bracket formation is fixed by the natural order of the team labels (i.e., the team labeled 1, then 2, then 3, etc.)? \n\n   But note: the problem says \"the i-th team\" â€” so the teams are labeled from 1 to 2^n. And the bracket is formed by pairing consecutive teams: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), etc.\n\n   However, the permutation p is the assignment: we can assign the skill levels arbitrarily to the team labels? \n\n   Actually, let me read the problem again: \"the skill level of the i-th team is p_i, where p is a permutation of integers 1,2,...,2^n\".\n\n   This means that the team originally labeled i has a skill level p_i. Then the bracket is formed by the original labels: so the first match is between team1 and team2, then team3 and team4, etc.\n\n   But then, we are free to choose p (any permutation). So we can assign the skill levels arbitrarily to the teams. However, the bracket structure (the pairings) is fixed by the team labels (i.e., the natural order of the team indices: 1,2,...,2^n). \n\n   Therefore, the problem becomes:\n\n      We have 2^n teams, initially labeled 1 to 2^n (from left to right). We assign a permutation p (which is a bijection from {1,...,2^n} to {1,...,2^n}) to these teams. Then, in each phase, the outcome is determined by the rule (s[i] for the i-th phase) and the current set of teams (which are the winners from the previous round) and their assigned skill levels.\n\n   The goal: for a given x (which is a skill level, i.e., a number between 1 and 2^n), can we assign the numbers 1 to 2^n (via p) to the teams (so that the team that ends up with skill x wins the tournament)?\n\n   Since we can assign arbitrarily, we can choose which leaf (which initial team) gets the value x. But note: the bracket structure is fixed: the first match is between the first leaf and the second leaf, the next between the third and the fourth, etc.\n\n   So we can choose which leaf gets x. However, the assignment must be a permutation, so the other leaves get the remaining numbers.\n\n   How to determine if x can be the champion?\n\n   We can use a recursive (or iterative) approach that simulates the tournament. But note: n can be up to 18, so the total number of teams is 2^18 = 262144, which is too many for naive simulation.\n\n   Alternative approach: \n\n   We can use a segment tree or a bracket representation and consider the necessary conditions for x to win.\n\n   Conditions:\n\n   In each match, the outcome is determined by the two numbers in the match and the rule for that phase.\n\n   However, note: the bracket is fixed (the same for every permutation). The only thing we can control is the assignment of the numbers to the leaves.\n\n   We can think of the tournament as having a set of matches that must happen. For x to win, we must ensure that:\n\n   - In every match that x participates in (until the final), the rule must allow x to win, and also we must be able to assign the other numbers appropriately so that x reaches the final.\n\n   But note: the rule for a phase is fixed for the entire phase. So if x is in a match in a phase with rule '0' (lower wins), then x must be the lower number than the opponent. Similarly, for rule '1', x must be the higher.\n\n   However, the opponents in the subsequent rounds are determined by the outcomes of the earlier rounds. \n\n   Another idea: \n\n   We can consider that the entire tournament can be represented as a binary tree with 2^n leaves. Each node (match) is associated with a rule (from s). \n\n   Then, for x to win, we must have:\n\n     - In every match that x is involved in (from the first round until the final), the rule must be favorable (if the rule is 1, then x must be the highest in that match; if 0, then x must be the lowest).\n\n   But wait, that is necessary but not sufficient. Because the opponents are chosen from the entire set of numbers (except x) and we can assign arbitrarily. However, the assignment must be consistent: the same set of numbers must appear in the entire bracket.\n\n   We can break down the bracket into segments. The bracket is divided into two halves (each half being a subtree of the entire tree). \n\n   Let's define:\n\n     Let T be the entire tournament (a full binary tree of height n). The root is the final.\n\n     Each node has two children. The rule for a node at depth d (where d=1 is the first round) is given by s[n-d] (because the first phase is the first round, which is the deepest, and the last phase is the final, which is the root). But note: the string s is given for the first phase (index0) to the last (index n-1). The root (final) is the last phase, so the rule for the root is s[n-1]. \n\n   However, wait: the problem says the i-th phase (with 2^(n-i) games) â€” the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games (so the largest set) and the last phase (i=n-1) has 2^(0)=1 game. So the root (last phase) is the last character of s.\n\n   Therefore, the rule for the node at depth d (counting from the top: depth0 for the root, depth1 for the second last, etc.) would be: \n        d = 0: rule index = n-1\n        d = 1: rule index = n-2\n        ...\n\n   Alternatively, we can index the rounds from 0 (first round) to n-1 (last round). Then the rule for the round k (0-indexed from 0 to n-1) is s[k]. \n\n   Now, the bracket is built such that the first round (round0) is the one with 2^(n-1) games, then round1 with 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n   So the rule for the round k is s[k].\n\n   Now, for a candidate x, we can try to assign the entire set of numbers to the leaves. However, we don't know which leaf gets x. But note: the bracket structure (the parent-child relationships) is fixed. \n\n   We can consider the following: \n\n   In the entire tournament, the path that x takes must be such that in each match (each node above the leaf) the rule for that round (the round corresponding to the node's depth) must be favorable for x. Moreover, the numbers that are assigned to the leaves must be such that:\n\n     - In the first round, the leaf containing x must be matched with some other number. The rule for the first round is s[0]. Then, for x to win the first match, if s[0]=='1', then x must be greater than the opponent; if '0', then x must be less than the opponent.\n\n     - Then, in the next rounds, the opponent is determined by the winner of the adjacent segment.\n\n   But note: we can assign the other numbers arbitrarily to the other leaves. So we can choose the opponents arbitrarily from the set excluding x.\n\n   However, the same set of numbers must be used in the entire bracket. \n\n   We can think of the tournament as having a set of conditions for the entire set of numbers. \n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n   We can use a divide and conquer strategy. We note that the entire tournament can be broken down into segments (subtrees). \n\n   Let f(segment, rule) be the set of numbers that can win from that segment (given the rule for the entire subtree, which is actually the rules from the current round to the final). However, the rule for each round is fixed and known.\n\n   But the rounds are interleaved: the first round (with rule s[0]) is the first one, then s[1], etc.\n\n   We can process the tournament from the final (root) backwards.\n\n   However, note the bracket structure is fixed (like a standard single elimination bracket). \n\n   We can define a recursive function that, given a contiguous block of leaves (say from L to R, inclusive) and the rules from the current round (depth) to the final (which are the rules from index k to n-1, for a depth k meaning we are at the k-th round from the bottom, or the (n-k)-th character of s?) â€” but note: the rounds go from the first (bottom) to the last (top). \n\n   Actually, the entire tournament has n rounds (from round0 to round n-1). The rounds are independent: each round has a rule. \n\n   The bracket is fixed: the leaves are numbered 0 to 2^n-1 (for convenience). The first match is between leaf0 and leaf1, then leaf2 and leaf3, etc.\n\n   We can define a function that, for a given contiguous segment [l, r] of leaves (which forms a complete sub-bracket) and the set of rules from the current round (which is the round that produces the winners for this segment) to the final, returns the set of numbers that can be the winner from this segment.\n\n   However, we are given the entire set of numbers (from 1 to 2^n) and we are to assign them arbitrarily to the leaves. But note: the assignment must be consistent for the entire bracket.\n\n   Actually, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so the condition for a segment [l, r] is:\n\n     - The entire segment has (r-l+1) leaves, which must be assigned (r-l+1) distinct numbers from the set {1,2,...,2^n}.\n\n     - The winner of the segment must satisfy the rules in the rounds that occur within the segment.\n\n   But note: the rules are fixed per round (and the rounds are global). \n\n   Steps:\n\n     We have n rounds (from round0 to round n-1). The entire bracket is broken into 2^k segments for the k-th round (from the bottom). \n\n   Actually, we can break the problem by rounds:\n\n     Round0 (first round, bottom): the entire bracket is broken into 2^(n-1) matches (each with two consecutive leaves). The rule for round0 is s[0].\n\n     Then, the winners of these matches (which are 2^(n-1) numbers) are then arranged in the next round (round1) as consecutive groups: the winner of the first match (leaves0-1) becomes the first leaf of the next round, the winner of the second match (leaves2-3) becomes the second leaf, etc.\n\n     Then round1 (second phase) uses the rule s[1] for the matches between these consecutive winners.\n\n   We can simulate the tournament by starting from the leaves and moving upward, but we need to know the set of numbers that can be present in each segment.\n\n   However, we are only interested in whether x can be the champion.\n\n   Let F(round, segment) be the condition for the segment at the given round to be able to produce a winner. But we want to know the entire path for x.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a greedy assignment:\n\n     We know that in the final (round n-1) the rule is s[n-1]. For x to win the final, the opponent must be such that:\n\n        if s[n-1]=='1', then x > opponent, and opponent must be the winner of the other half of the bracket.\n        if s[n-1]=='0', then x < opponent, and opponent must be the winner of the other half.\n\n     Then, we can require that the entire set of numbers is partitioned into two halves (each of size 2^(n-1)) such that the winner of the left half is y and the winner of the right half is z, and then the condition above holds.\n\n   But note: the bracket is fixed: the left half of the entire bracket is the first 2^(n-1) teams (leaves0 to 2^(n-1)-1) and the right half is the rest.\n\n   However, we can assign arbitrarily. So we can assign x to any leaf. \n\n   Therefore, we can choose which half (left or right) x is in. Then, the condition for the final is:\n\n        If x is in the left half, then the rule for the final (s[n-1]) must be such that x is the winner of the left half and the winner of the right half must be a number that satisfies the condition (if rule is '1', then x > winner_right; if '0', then x < winner_right). But note: we can assign arbitrarily, so we can choose the entire left half and right half as long as the numbers are distinct and cover all.\n\n   However, the condition for the entire tournament is that the bracket must be consistent. \n\n   We can use a dynamic programming or a state machine that goes from the leaves to the root, and for each node (segment) we keep the range of numbers that can be present in that segment (or the minimal and maximal numbers that must be excluded to satisfy the conditions) but that might be too heavy.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n   Consider that the tournament is a complete binary tree. Each match (node) has two children (the two teams that meet). The outcome of the match is determined by the rule of the node's round.\n\n   For x to win, we require that:\n\n     - In every node (match) along the path from the leaf containing x to the root, the rule must be favorable for x (i.e., if the rule is '1', then x must be greater than the opponent; if '0', then x must be less).\n\n     - Moreover, the opponents in the matches must be chosen from the available numbers (excluding x) and must satisfy the conditions of their own matches.\n\n   But note: the same set of numbers must be used in the entire bracket, and the assignment must be consistent (each number appears exactly once).\n\n   We can consider the following:\n\n     Let the entire set of numbers be S = {1, 2, ..., 2^n}. We remove x, so we have S' = S \\ {x}.\n\n     Then, the tournament must assign the numbers in S' to the leaves (except the leaf for x). \n\n     However, we can choose which leaf gets x.\n\n   Conditions for the leaf containing x:\n\n     Let the leaf containing x be at position i (0-indexed from 0 to 2^n-1). Then, the first match (round0) is between the two adjacent leaves. The rule for round0 is s[0]. \n\n        - If s[0]=='1', then x must be greater than the other number in the same first match.\n        - If s[0]=='0', then x must be less than the other number.\n\n   Then, the next match (if any) that x participates in (if x wins the first match) is in round1, and the rule is s[1]. But note: the next match is not necessarily against the immediate neighbor from the next leaf, but against the winner of the adjacent match from the next segment.\n\n   This seems complex.\n\n   Instead, we can consider the necessary conditions for x to win:\n\n     1. The entire tournament requires that x must be able to beat all the opponents it faces in each round.\n\n     2. Moreover, the opponents in the later rounds must be numbers that are either forced to be in a particular part of the bracket.\n\n   However, note: we can assign arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose the opponents arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and from S').\n\n   But the catch is: the entire set of numbers must be used. \n\n   Another idea: \n\n   Let's consider the entire bracket and the rounds. We can compute the minimal set of numbers that must be excluded from the entire bracket for x to be able to win. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a two-step condition:\n\n     Step 1: In the first round (round0) that x participates in (which is the round that the leaf containing x belongs to), the condition must hold: \n          if s[0]=='1', then x must be greater than the opponent in the first match (which is the number assigned to the adjacent leaf).\n          if s[0]=='0', then x must be less than the opponent.\n\n     Step 2: Then, in the next round (if any), the opponent is determined by the winner of the adjacent match (which is from the next leaf). But note: the adjacent match is the next leaf, and we can assign arbitrarily. \n\n   However, the assignment must be consistent for the entire bracket.\n\n   We can use a method similar to \"bracket problems\" in programming competitions: \n\n        We can define for each segment (contiguous block of leaves) the minimal and maximal numbers that must be present in that segment for the segment to be able to produce a winner. Then, for x to win, we require that:\n\n          - The entire set of numbers is partitioned into the segments, and the conditions in each segment are satisfied.\n\n        But note: the rules change per round.\n\n   After reading some similar problems (like CodeForces problems on bracket simulations), I recall that sometimes we can use a recursive function that, for a segment (with a given set of rules for the rounds that occur in the segment) and the entire set of numbers, returns the minimal and maximal values that must be included in the segment for the segment to be able to produce a winner. Then, we can check if x can be the champion by ensuring that x is in the overall set and that the entire set of numbers can be partitioned accordingly.\n\n   However, here the rules are fixed and known, and we are free to assign the numbers arbitrarily (so we are not constrained by the initial ordering of the leaves, because the leaves are labeled arbitrarily and we can assign any number to any leaf).\n\n   Therefore, the condition for a segment [l, r] (which has m = (r-l+1) leaves) is:\n\n        The segment must have m distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n.\n\n        The segment is divided into two halves: [l, mid] and [mid+1, r] (if we are in a round that breaks the segment into two halves). \n\n        The rule for the round that the segment is in (which is the round that produces the winner from the segment) is given by s[k] (where k is the round index, and the segment is at depth n - log2(m) ???)\n\n   Actually, the rounds are fixed: the first round (round0) is the one that breaks the entire bracket (size 2^n) into 2^(n-1) matches. Then the next round (round1) breaks the remaining 2^(n-1) teams into 2^(n-2) matches, etc.\n\n   The entire tournament has n rounds. The segment [l, r] has size m = 2^(n - d) for some d (the depth of the segment). Then the round index for the segment is d (from the bottom: d=0 is the first round, d=1 is the second round, etc.).\n\n   But note: the rule for the round d is s[d] (the d-th character of the string, where d from 0 to n-1).\n\n   However, the segment [l, r] is at a specific depth. The entire bracket is built as:\n\n        Round0 (d=0): segments of size 2 (each match is two leaves)\n        Round1 (d=1): segments of size 4 (each match produces a winner that then plays in a match of size 4)\n        ...\n        Round d: segments of size 2^(n-d)\n\n   Actually, the entire bracket has 2^n leaves. Then, after d rounds, the segment has 2^n / (2^d) = 2^(n-d) leaves.\n\n   Therefore, for a segment of leaves from l to r (inclusive), the size is m = r-l+1 = 2^(n-d). Then the round index d = n - log2(m). And the rule for that segment is s[d] = s[n - log2(m)].\n\n   But note: the rounds are indexed from 0 to n-1 (the first round is d=0, then d=1, etc.). \n\n   Now, for a segment [l, r] (with size m = 2^(n-d)), the winner of the segment is determined by the following:\n\n        If d == n-1, then the segment has 2 leaves (m=2) and the rule is s[n-1]. The winner is the maximum if s[n-1]=='1', else the minimum.\n\n        Otherwise, the segment is broken into two halves: [l, mid] and [mid+1, r] (mid = (l+r)//2). The two halves are processed recursively. Then, the winner of the entire segment is determined by the rule s[d] and the two winners of the halves.\n\n        Specifically:\n\n          Let A = winner of [l, mid]\n          Let B = winner of [mid+1, r]\n\n          Then, if s[d]=='1', the winner is max(A, B); if '0', then min(A, B).\n\n   Now, we want to know: what numbers must be present in the segment [l, r] for the segment to be able to produce a winner? \n\n   But note: we are free to assign the numbers arbitrarily to the leaves, so the condition for the segment is not on the actual numbers but on the possibility to have a set of m distinct numbers (from the entire set) that can be arranged in the leaves of the segment such that the winner is determined by the rules.\n\n   However, the entire set of numbers must be distinct and cover 1 to 2^n.\n\n   We can use a different approach: \n\n        Let F(d, low, high) be the condition for a segment of size 2^d (so at round index d, and the rule is s[d]) to be able to be filled with numbers in the interval [low, high] (but note: the entire set is fixed, so we are not really using an interval but the relative ordering).\n\n   But wait, we are free to assign arbitrarily, so the actual numbers don't matter, only their relative order and the requirement to have distinct numbers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n        In a segment of size 2^d (d from 0 to n), the tournament requires a set of 2^d distinct numbers. The winner is determined by the rules from round0 to round d-1 (if d>0) and then the rule for round d (the last round for this segment) is s[d] (if d<n).\n\n        However, we are building from the bottom up.\n\n   We can define a function that, given a segment (with a fixed rule for the rounds that occur in the segment) and the entire set of numbers (we don't know the entire set yet, but we know the set is {1,...,2^n}), returns the set of numbers that can be the winner of that segment.\n\n   But note: the assignment must be consistent across the entire bracket.\n\n   We can use a recursive function that, for a segment (with a given set of rules for the rounds in this segment) and the entire set of numbers, returns the set of numbers that can win that segment. But the entire set is fixed (all numbers) and we are free to assign arbitrarily.\n\n   However, the assignment is global, so we cannot independently assign numbers to disjoint segments.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n        We can consider the entire tournament and the necessary conditions for x to win:\n\n        Let the rounds be from 0 to n-1. The entire set of numbers is {1,2,...,2^n}. \n\n        In the final (round n-1), x must be compared to the winner of the other half. The condition is:\n\n            if s[n-1]=='1', then x must be greater than the other half's winner.\n            if s[n-1]=='0', then x must be less than the other half's winner.\n\n        But we can choose the entire assignment arbitrarily, so the other half's winner can be any number except x, provided that the conditions in the other half are satisfied.\n\n        However, the other half must be able to produce a winner. The other half is a segment of size 2^(n-1). \n\n        Similarly, the same applies for the half that contains x.\n\n   We can use a meet-in-the-middle approach:\n\n        Let A = the set of numbers that can be the winner of the left half of the entire bracket (which is the first 2^(n-1) teams).\n        Let B = the set of numbers that can be the winner of the right half.\n\n        Then, for the final (rule s[n-1]), the condition is:\n\n            if s[n-1]=='1', then we need a number a in A and a number b in B such that a is the champion and a > b, and also we must have that the entire assignment is possible (which it is if A and B are non-empty and the condition holds). But note: the champion is a, so the final match is between a and b, and a wins.\n\n            Similarly, if s[n-1]=='0', then a < b.\n\n        But note: the champion must be the winner of its own half. So the champion x must be in A (if we assign x to the left half) and then we require the existence of a number b in B such that:\n\n            if s[n-1]=='1', then x > b, and if '0', then x < b.\n\n        Or, we could also assign x to the right half, then x must be in B and then we require:\n\n            if s[n-1]=='1', then x > (winner of left half), and if '0', then x < (winner of left half).\n\n   Therefore, we can compute A and B recursively.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let T(n, rule_list) be the set of numbers that can be the winner of a tournament of 2^n teams, with the given list of rules (from the current round to the final).\n\n        However, the entire tournament has a fixed set of rules (the string s) and the rounds are from 0 to n-1.\n\n        But our recursion will break the tournament into two halves, and the rule for the final round of the entire tournament is the last character of s.\n\n        However, the rule for the rounds in the halves are the first n-1 characters of s.\n\n        Actually, the entire tournament has n rounds. When we split the tournament into two halves, each half has n-1 rounds (because the final round is the last one). But note: the first round of the entire tournament is the first round of the halves as well.\n\n        The rule for the first round of the entire tournament is s[0], and this rule is also the rule for the first round of the halves.\n\n        So the two halves have the same rule list: the rules from s[0] to s[n-2] (if we are at the first split) and then the final rule for the entire tournament is s[n-1].\n\n        More precisely:\n\n          Entire tournament: \n             Round0 (rule s[0]): first round\n             Round1 (rule s[1]): second round\n             ...\n             Round n-1 (rule s[n-1]): final\n\n          Now, for the left half (first 2^(n-1) teams), the tournament within the left half has:\n\n             Round0 (rule s[0]): matches within the left half (which is the first 2^(n-1) teams) â€” the first 2^(n-2) winners.\n             Round1 (rule s[1]): next round\n             ...\n             Round n-2 (rule s[n-2]): the final of the left half.\n\n          Then, the winner of the left half plays the winner of the right half in the final (rule s[n-1]).\n\n        Therefore, the set A (winners of the left half) is computed using the rules s[0] to s[n-2] (n-1 rounds) and similarly for B (using the same rules s[0] to s[n-2]).\n\n        Then, the condition for the final is based on s[n-1].\n\n   Algorithm to compute the set of winners for a half-tournament (with n' = n-1 rounds and rule_list = s[0:n'] ):\n\n        Let F(n', rule_list) = set of winners for a tournament of 2^n' teams.\n\n        Base case: \n            n' = 0: then there is 1 team, so the winner is the only number. But wait, our input is the entire set of 2^n' numbers? \n\n        Actually, we are not given a fixed set of numbers for the half, but we know that the entire set is {1,...,2^n}. And we are free to assign arbitrarily. \n\n        However,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers \\( x \\) (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) that can win a tournament given a specific sequence of game outcomes. The tournament involves \\( 2^n \\) teams arranged in a single-elimination bracket, with each phase's outcome determined by a character in the input string \\( s \\). The solution involves recursively checking the feasibility of each number \\( x \\) winning the tournament by ensuring it meets the conditions set by each phase's rule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured as a single-elimination bracket with \\( n \\) rounds. Each round's outcome is governed by a character in the string \\( s \\): '1' means the higher-skilled team wins, and '0' means the lower-skilled team wins. The goal is to find all numbers \\( x \\) such that there exists a permutation of skills (a valid assignment of distinct skill levels from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) where \\( x \\) emerges as the champion.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For \\( x \\) to win, it must navigate through each round's conditions. In each round, depending on the rule ('0' or '1'), \\( x \\) must be either the smallest or largest in its match. The solution involves recursively partitioning the problem into smaller subproblems (each half of the current segment) and verifying that \\( x \\) can win both segments under the given rules.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: A divide-and-conquer approach is used. For each segment of the bracket, we check if \\( x \\) can be the winner by ensuring:\n   - In the current round, \\( x \\) meets the condition (being the max or min based on the rule).\n   - The remaining numbers can form valid winners for the other segments (sub-brackets).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each segment recursively, splitting the problem into two halves at each step. The depth of recursion is \\( n \\), and each step involves checking conditions for \\( x \\) and its position within the segment. Given \\( n \\) can be up to 18, the total number of operations is manageable due to the logarithmic nature of the recursion.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    s_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    \n    def can_win(x, low, high, seg_start, seg_end, rules):\n        if seg_start == seg_end:\n            return True\n            \n        seg_size = seg_end - seg_start + 1\n        half_size = seg_size // 2\n        mid = (seg_start + seg_end) // 2\n        \n        rule_char = rules[0]\n        rules_rest = rules[1:]\n        \n        if rule_char == '1':\n            required_opponent = \"max\"\n        else:\n            required_opponent = \"min\"\n            \n        left_winner = None\n        right_winner = None\n        \n        if half_size == 1:\n            left_winner = seg_start\n            right_winner = seg_end\n        else:\n            left_winner = can_win(x, low, high, seg_start, mid, rules_rest)\n            right_winner = can_win(x, low, high, mid+1, seg_end, rules_rest)\n        \n        if required_opponent == \"min\":\n            if x > left_winner:\n                return False\n            if x > right_winner:\n                return False\n            return True\n        else:\n            if x < left_winner:\n                return False\n            if x < right_winner:\n                return False\n            return True\n\n    def find_winners(low, high, seg_start, seg_end, rules):\n        if seg_start == seg_end:\n            return [low] if low == high else []\n            \n        seg_size = seg_end - seg_start + 1\n        half_size = seg_size // 2\n        mid = (seg_start + seg_end) // 2\n        \n        rule_char = rules[0]\n        rules_rest = rules[1:]\n        \n        left_winners = find_winners(low, high, seg_start, mid, rules_rest)\n        right_winners = find_winners(low, high, mid+1, seg_end, rules_rest)\n        \n        if rule_char == '1':\n            combined = left_winners + right_winners\n            if not combined:\n                return []\n            min_val = min(combined)\n            return [min_val]\n        else:\n            combined = left_winners + right_winners\n            if not combined:\n                return []\n            max_val = max(combined)\n            return [max_val]\n    \n    left_segment = list(range(1, total_teams + 1))\n    right_segment = list(range(1, total_teams + 1))\n    \n    if n > 0:\n        left_winners = find_winners(left_segment, right_segment, 0, total_teams-1, s_str)\n    else:\n        left_winners = [1]\n    \n    result_set = set()\n    \n    for candidate in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        if n == 0:\n            result_set.add(candidate)\n        else:\n            if can_win(candidate, 1, total_teams, 0, total_teams-1, s_str):\n                result_set.add(candidate)\n    \n    print(\" \".join(map(str, sorted(result_set))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of an integer \\( n \\) (number of rounds) and a string \\( s \\) (rules for each round).
