Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements (from 0 to n-1)\n   an array a of n integers (a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1})\n   a string s (without spaces) of length n, which is the binary representation of m (with no leading zeros, but note: the problem says m is represented as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}, so the string has exactly n digits)\n\n However, note: the example input format is given as two separate test cases in an array. But in reality, the input is:\n\n Example Input 1:\n     2\n     3 8\n     10\n\n Example Input 2:\n     5\n     17 0 10 2 1\n     11010\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as two separate strings in an array? Actually, the problem says:\n\n Input:\n     The first line contains integer n.\n     The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}.\n     The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces.\n\n So the example input for the second sample is:\n\n     5\n     17 0 10 2 1\n     11010\n\n However, the example output is 27.\n\n Important: the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x. The array a has indices from 0 to n-1, and the bit representation of x must have at most n bits (from bit0 to bit_{n-1}).\n\n Steps:\n\n We are to consider all x such that 0 <= x <= m, and compute f(x) = sum_{i: the i-th bit of x is set} a_i.\n\n Note: the bits are numbered from least significant to most significant? Actually, the problem says \"binary representation of number x\", and the example: n=4, x=11 (which is 1011) then f(11)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n In the example, the bits are considered from the least significant (rightmost) to the most significant (leftmost). However, note that the string provided for m is given as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. \n\n Let's clarify the indexing:\n\n Example: \n   Input: n=5, array a = [17, 0, 10, 2, 1], and string '11010'\n\n Here, the binary representation of m is '11010'. This means:\n\n   m = 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0)\n\n But note: the function f(x) uses the bits of x. The i-th bit: does i correspond to the exponent or to the position in the string?\n\n The problem says: \"bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n And the example: n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> which is 8+2+1, so they are using the bits from the least significant (rightmost) as the 0th bit? Actually, 11 in binary is written as 1011, which is:\n\n   bit0 (LSB): 1 -> index0 corresponds to the 0th power (2^0) -> a0\n   bit1: 1 -> 2^1 -> a1\n   bit2: 0 -> not set\n   bit3: 1 -> 2^3 -> a3\n\n So the indexing in the array a is by the bit position (starting from 0 for the least significant). \n\n Therefore, the string provided for m is the binary representation of m with n digits, and the first character of the string (the leftmost) is the most significant bit (corresponds to 2^(n-1)) and the last character (the rightmost) is the least significant bit (2^0)? \n\n Actually, wait: the example input for m is given as a string of n digits. In the second example: n=5, m is given as '11010'. \n\n But note: the example says m = 2^4 + 2^3 + 0*2^2 + 2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26. However, the example states m=11 (for the first example) and for the second sample: \"m = 20 + 21 + 23 = ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements in array \\( a \\) at positions where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the function \\( f(x) \\) depends on which bits are set in \\( x \\). To maximize \\( f(x) \\), we should consider setting bits in \\( x \\) that correspond to the largest values in array \\( a \\). However, \\( x \\) must not exceed \\( m \\), which imposes constraints on which bits can be set.\n\n2. **Binary Representation Handling**: The binary string provided represents \\( m \\) with exactly \\( n \\) digits. The leftmost digit corresponds to the most significant bit (MSB), and the rightmost to the least significant bit (LSB). \n\n3. **Greedy Strategy**: We process each bit from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit position, if setting it does not make \\( x \\) exceed \\( m \\), we consider adding the corresponding \\( a_i \\) to the result. However, if setting a bit might allow more beneficial bits to be set in subsequent positions, we need to adjust our approach.\n\n4. **Bitmasking and Comparison**: We use a bitmask to represent \\( x \\) and compare it with \\( m \\) at each step. If setting a particular bit in \\( x \\) would make \\( x \\) exceed \\( m \\), we skip that bit. Otherwise, we proceed to consider lower bits, but note that once a bit is set, all lower bits can be set freely (since they contribute less to the overall value).\n\n5. **Optimization**: To handle large \\( n \\) efficiently (up to \\( 10^5 \\)), we avoid brute-force checking all possible \\( x \\) values. Instead, we use a greedy approach combined with bitmask operations to determine the optimal bits to set.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total_length = len(s)\n    while len(a) < total_length:\n        a.insert(0, 0)\n    \n    arr = [0] * total_length\n    for i in range(total_length):\n        if i < len(a):\n            arr[i] = a[i]\n        else:\n            arr[i] = 0\n    \n    arr.reverse()\n    \n    max_val = -10**18\n    current = 0\n    limit = int(s, 2)\n    if limit == 0:\n        print(max(arr))\n        return\n\n    for i in range(total_length):\n        if i >= len(arr):\n            break\n        \n        if arr[i] > 0:\n            if current + (1 << i) <= limit:\n                current += (1 << i)\n                max_val = max(max_val, arr[i])\n            else:\n                pass\n\n    if max_val == -10**18:\n        max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(total_length):\n        if i >= len(arr):\n            break\n        \n        if arr[i] > 0:\n            if (current & (1 << i)) != 0:\n                continue\n            \n            temp = current\n            for j in range(i+1, total_length):\n                temp += (1 << j)\n            \n            if temp <= limit:\n                temp_val = arr[i]\n                for j in range(i+1, total_length):\n                    if j < len(arr) and arr[j] > 0:\n                        temp_val += arr[j]\n                max_val = max(max_val, temp_val)\n\n    print(max_val)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the integer \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If \\( m \\) is zero, the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is simply the maximum value in \\( a \\).\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: The binary string is processed to align with the array \\( a \\) such that the least significant bit corresponds to the first element of \\( a \\).\n\n4. **Greedy Selection**: For each bit position, if setting the bit does not exceed \\( m \\), we consider adding the corresponding \\( a_i \\) to the result. This is done by checking the current value of \\( x \\) against \\( m \\).\n\n5. **Optimal Bit Setting**: After processing each bit, we ensure that all lower bits can be set without exceeding \\( m \\). This involves temporarily setting all bits below the current one and checking if the resulting \\( x \\) is within bounds.\n\n6. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value encountered during the bit processing is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the optimal bits to set by leveraging bitmask operations and a greedy strategy, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
