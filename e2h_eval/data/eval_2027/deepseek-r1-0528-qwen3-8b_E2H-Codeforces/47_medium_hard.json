    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized. If multiple k give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nLet d = a - b. Without loss of generality, assume a <= b, so we can set d = b - a (but note: if a > b, then we can swap and adjust accordingly). However, let's consider:\n\nWe have two numbers: x = a+k and y = b+k, and we know that:\n  LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y)\n\nNote that the GCD of x and y must divide (x-y) = (a-b). So, let g be a divisor of |a-b| (or more precisely, a divisor of the absolute difference). Then, we can set:\n  x = g * m, y = g * n, with GCD(m, n)=1, and then the LCM is g*m*n.\n\nBut note: x - y = (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b, so (g*m - g*n) = g*(m-n) = a-b (if a>=b) or g*(n-m)=a-b (if a<b). Actually, we can define d = |a-b|, and then the condition is that g divides d.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: for a fixed divisor g of d = |a-b|, we can set k such that:\n  (a+k) % g == 0 and (b+k) % g == 0.\n\nBut note: the condition for k is that k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g. Since (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b, then (a+k) ≡ (b+k) mod g implies that g divides (a-b). So k must satisfy:\n  k ≡ (-a) mod g   and   k ≡ (-b) mod g, which is consistent because (-a) ≡ (-b) mod g (since g divides a-b).\n\nSo for each divisor g of d (where d = |a-b|), we can set k to be the smallest non-negative integer such that k >= max(ceil((-a)/g), ceil((-b)/g)) and k ≡ (-a) mod g (and also ≡ (-b) mod g). But note: since g divides (a-b), then (-a) mod g = (-b) mod g? Actually, we have:\n  (-a) mod g = (-b + (b-a)) mod g = (-b) mod g + (-(a-b)) mod g. But note that (a-b) is divisible by g, so (a-b) mod g=0, hence (-a) mod g = (-b) mod g? Not exactly: because (-a) mod g = (-b + (b-a)) mod g = [(-b) mod g + (b-a) mod g] mod g. But (b-a) is divisible by g? Actually, d = |a-b|, and g divides d, so yes, (a-b) is divisible by g (if we take the absolute value, then the sign might matter). Actually, we can write:\n\nLet d = |a-b|. Then for each divisor g of d, we can set k as follows:\n\nWe require:\n  k ≡ (-a) mod g   and   k ≡ (-b) mod g.\n\nBut note that (-a) mod g and (-b) mod g must be the same. Indeed, because (a-b) is divisible by g, so (a mod g) = (b mod g). Therefore, (-a) mod g = (-b) mod g.\n\nThen k must be at least the smallest non-negative integer satisfying k ≡ (-a) mod g and k >= 0.\n\nBut note: if a and b are positive, then k must be chosen so that a+k and b+k are positive. However, k can be zero.\n\nHow do we compute k for a divisor g?\n  Let r = (-a) % g. Then k0 = (r if r != 0 else 0) but wait: if (-a) is negative, then we can use:\n  k_min = (g - (-a) % g) % g   ? \n\nActually, we want the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) is divisible by g. That is equivalent to k ≡ (-a) mod g, and the smallest non-negative k is:\n  k = (g - a % g) % g   ??? \n\nBut note: we have k ≡ (-a) mod g. The smallest non-negative solution is:\n  k = (g - (a % g)) % g   if a % g != 0, but if a % g == 0, then k=0.\n\nWait, let me check: \n  Condition: (a+k) % g == 0.\n  => k ≡ (-a) mod g.\n\nThe standard way to compute the smallest non-negative k is:\n  k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\nBut note: if a % g == 0, then (g - 0) % g = 0, which is correct.\n\nHowever, we also have to consider that k must be non-negative and we are looking for the smallest k for each divisor g.\n\nBut note: there might be multiple divisors g (all divisors of |a-b|). For each divisor g, we get a candidate k_g.\n\nHowever, note that the LCM for (a+k, b+k) is ( (a+k)*(b+k) ) / g, because the GCD is g (actually, the GCD must be a divisor of |a-b|, but we are considering all divisors). However, wait: the GCD of (a+k, b+k) is not necessarily g? \n\nLet me clarify: We set k such that (a+k) and (b+k) are both divisible by g, but the GCD might be larger than g? Actually, no: because we are considering g as a divisor of the difference, but the GCD must divide the difference, and we are only requiring divisibility by g. However, the actual GCD could be a multiple of g? \n\nWait, no: the GCD is the greatest common divisor, so it must be at least g (if g divides both) but also, we are iterating over all divisors. Actually, we are not. \n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet d = |a-b|. Then the GCD of (a+k, b+k) must divide d. So we can iterate over all divisors g of d. Then, for each divisor g, we can set k to be the smallest non-negative integer such that:\n  (a+k) % g == 0 and (b+k) % g == 0.\n\nBut note: the GCD might be greater than g, so we are not forced to consider only divisors of d? Actually, the GCD must divide d, so we must consider all divisors of d. However, for a fixed divisor g, the LCM is ( (a+k)*(b+k) ) / (gcd(a+k,b+k)), and we don't know the GCD exactly.\n\nBut note: if we set k such that g divides both (a+k) and (b+k), then the GCD will be at least g. However, the minimal LCM might occur when the GCD is as large as possible? Because LCM = (product)/GCD, so larger GCD leads to smaller LCM.\n\nActually, we can consider: the problem is symmetric in the sense that the GCD of (a+k, b+k) is a divisor of d. And we want to minimize the LCM.\n\nBut note: the LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y) / GCD(x,y). Since x*y = (a+k)*(b+k) = (a+k)*(a+k+d) [if d = b-a] and the GCD is at least g, then we are effectively minimizing (x*y)/g (with g being the GCD). However, we don't know the exact GCD, but we know it must be a divisor of d.\n\nSo here's an alternate solution:\n\nStep 1: Let d = abs(a-b). If d==0, then a==b, then the answer is k=0 because LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k, and we want to minimize that, so k=0 gives the smallest (because increasing k increases the value).\n\nStep 2: Factorize d? But d can be up to 10^9, so we can factorize it in O(sqrt(d)).\n\nStep 3: Iterate over all divisors g of d. For each divisor g, we can compute k as the smallest non-negative integer such that (a+k) % g == 0. But note: k must also satisfy (b+k) % g == 0, but that is automatically satisfied because (a-b) is divisible by g.\n\nThen, for each divisor g, we get a candidate k_g.\n\nBut wait: the GCD of (a+k_g, b+k_g) might be larger than g. However, we are going to consider all divisors, including the ones that are multiples. Actually, the set of divisors includes all divisors of d, and the GCD must be one of these divisors. So we can consider that the minimal LCM might be achieved by a divisor g that is the actual GCD.\n\nBut note: if we use a divisor g, then the LCM becomes ( (a+k_g)*(b+k_g) ) / (actual GCD). The actual GCD is the gcd(a+k_g, b+k_g) which is a divisor of d, and it is at least g. But we cannot assume it is g.\n\nHowever, we are iterating over every divisor g of d, so we will also consider the actual GCD (which is a divisor) and then we can compute the LCM for that candidate.\n\nBut how do we relate the candidate k_g to the GCD? \n\nActually, the candidate k_g is defined by the condition that g divides both (a+k_g) and (b+k_g). The actual GCD, say g0, must be a multiple of g and a divisor of d. But note: the k_g we found is the smallest k for which g divides both. However, for the same k_g, the GCD might be larger than g.\n\nBut then, we have to consider: for a fixed k, the GCD is fixed. We cannot assume that the LCM for k_g is ( (a+k_g)*(b+k_g) ) / g.\n\nSo we need to compute the GCD for (a+k_g, b+k_g) and then compute the LCM from that.\n\nBut note: we are iterating over divisors of d, and the GCD must be a divisor of d. However, the candidate k_g might be the same for multiple divisors? \n\nBut note: the problem says we must choose the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. We are generating a candidate k for each divisor g. Then, we can compute the LCM for that candidate k (with the actual GCD) and then compare.\n\nHowever, the number of divisors of d is about O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable for d up to 10^9 (about 10^4 divisors in worst-case). \n\nSteps:\n\n1. If a == b: print 0 and exit.\n\n2. Let d = abs(a-b). Then factorize d to get all divisors.\n\n3. For each divisor g (positive divisor) of d, do:\n   a. Compute k0 = the smallest non-negative integer such that (a+k0) % g == 0.\n      How? \n        k0 = (g - a % g) % g   [if a % g !=0, then k0 = g - (a % g); if a%g==0, then k0=0]\n   b. Then, let x = a + k0, y = b + k0.\n   c. Compute g0 = gcd(x, y). Note: g0 must be a divisor of d, but we already have d, and we are iterating on divisors of d. However, note: the GCD might be any divisor of d, but we are using k0 which was computed for divisor g. Actually, the GCD must be at least g, but we don't know. We have to compute it.\n\n   d. Then, LCM_candidate = (x * y) // g0\n\n   e. Compare this candidate with the current best.\n\n4. Also, we must consider k=0 as a candidate? Actually, note that when g runs through all divisors, we will get k0=0 for the divisor g that divides (a % g) = 0? Actually, if we take g = any divisor that divides a, then k0=0. But note: the divisor g must divide d. So if a divisor g divides both d and a, then k0=0.\n\nBut wait, what if a divisor g does not divide a? Then k0>0.\n\n5. However, note that we are iterating over divisors of d, and d = |a-b|. The divisor g must divide d, and then we compute k0. But note: k0 must be such that (a+k0) is divisible by g. This k0 is independent of the actual GCD.\n\nBut note: the same k0 might be produced by multiple divisors. We don't care, we just record the candidate k0 and the corresponding LCM.\n\n6. But wait: is it possible that the minimal LCM is achieved by a k that is not generated by any divisor of d? \n\nRecall: the GCD of (a+k, b+k) must divide (a+k - (b+k)) = a-b. So the GCD must divide d. Therefore, the condition is necessary. Hence, the minimal LCM must be achieved by a k that makes (a+k, b+k) divisible by some divisor of d. \n\nBut note: we are iterating over every divisor g of d, and we are taking the smallest k for which g divides (a+k) and (b+k). This k might not be the minimal k for which the GCD is g, but it is the minimal k for which the GCD is at least g.\n\nBut note: the same k might be used for multiple divisors. However, we are going to consider every divisor and then compute the LCM for that k (with the actual GCD). So we are covering all possibilities.\n\n7. However, note: we are iterating over divisors, but the same k might appear multiple times (for different divisors). We can avoid duplicate k by storing the best candidate and then updating. But we still need to compute the LCM for the same k only once? Actually, we are storing k0 for each divisor, and then we compute the LCM for that k0. But if two divisors lead to the same k0, then we compute the same LCM twice. We can avoid this by storing the candidate k and the corresponding LCM, and then we update the best candidate.\n\n8. But note: we must also consider that k can be 0 even if 0 is not generated by a divisor? Actually, k=0 is generated by the divisor g that divides both a and b. Because then (a+0)%g==0 and (b+0)%g==0. And g must divide d and also divide a and b. But note: if g divides a and b, then g divides d (since d = |a-b|). So k=0 is considered.\n\nBut what about k that are not generated by any divisor of d? \n\nExample: Let a=6, b=10. Then d=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: k0 = (1 - 6%1) %1 -> 0 (since 6%1 is 0, so k0=0). Then x=6, y=10, GCD=2, LCM= (6*10)//2 = 30.\n\nFor g=2: k0 = (2-6%2)%2 = (2-0)%2=0. Then x=6, y=10, GCD=2, LCM=30.\n\nFor g=4: k0 = (4-6%4)%4 = (4-2)%4=2. Then x=8, y=12, GCD=4, LCM=(8*12)//4=24.\n\nSo we found k=0 and k=2. The minimal LCM is 24, so we output k=2.\n\nBut what if we try k=1? \n  x=7, y=11, GCD=1, LCM=77 -> worse.\n\nk=3: \n  x=9, y=13, GCD=1, LCM=117.\n\nk=4: \n  x=10, y=14, GCD=2, LCM=70.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is indeed at k=2.\n\nBut note: k=0 is generated by divisors 1 and 2, and k=2 is generated by divisor 4.\n\nNow, why didn't we get k=0 from divisor 4? Because for divisor 4, the smallest k is 2.\n\nBut note: we must also consider that k might be negative? No, k>=0.\n\nBut wait: what if we consider divisors that are not necessarily positive? The divisors of d are positive, so we only consider positive divisors.\n\nBut note: the divisors we consider are the positive divisors.\n\nHowever, there is a catch: the divisor g must be positive, and we are only iterating over positive divisors.\n\nBut note: the GCD is always positive, and the divisors we consider are positive.\n\nBut what about divisors that are not divisors of d? We don't consider them.\n\nBut note: the above reasoning is correct because the GCD must divide d, so the divisors we consider are the positive divisors of d.\n\nHowever, there is another issue: the divisor g we use must be a divisor of d, but note that the equation for k0 is defined modulo g. However, what if g is greater than d? Then g would not be a divisor of d. So we only consider divisors of d.\n\nBut wait: we are iterating over divisors of d, so we only consider divisors that divide d.\n\nBut note: the divisor g must divide d, so g<=d. Then k0 = (g - a % g) % g. This is safe.\n\nHowever, note: the divisor g must be positive. And d>=0, so if d=0 we skip (handled at step1). \n\nBut note: we must consider all divisors, including the divisors that are factors of d. But note: the divisors of d include 1 and d itself.\n\nBut wait: what if d is very large? The number of divisors is about O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable for d up to 10^9 (sqrt(10^9) is about 31622, but the number of divisors is actually the number of divisors, which for a number with prime factorization p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... is (e1+1)*(e2+1)*... . Worst-case is when d is highly composite, but even then, the maximum number of divisors for numbers up to 10^9 is around 1344 (like 735134400 has 1344 divisors). So we can factorize d and get all divisors.\n\nBut note: what if a and b are very close, so d is small? Then we have few divisors.\n\nBut wait: there is a catch. What if we consider divisors that are negative? We don't, because divisors are positive.\n\nBut note: the divisor g must be positive, and we are only considering positive divisors.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative solution that uses the fact that the GCD of (a+k, b+k) divides d, so we can let g be any divisor of d, and then set k to be the smallest non-negative integer such that (a+k) mod g == 0. Then we compute the LCM for that k.\n\nBut note: the GCD of (a+k, b+k) might be a multiple of g? Actually, no: the GCD must divide d, and we are using g as a divisor of d. But the GCD might be larger than g, but we don't know. However, we are computing the actual GCD from the numbers (a+k, b+k) and then the LCM.\n\nBut note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors, and we are storing the candidate k and the LCM for that k. We want the minimal LCM and then the smallest k.\n\nBut note: the candidate k we are generating is the smallest k for which the numbers (a+k) and (b+k) are divisible by g. However, it is possible that for a divisor g, the k0 we compute is not the minimal k overall, but we are generating the minimal k for each divisor. And then we consider the LCM for that k (with the actual GCD). \n\nBut note: we must also consider k=0 separately? Actually, no, because if we take g=1 (which always divides d), then k0=0.\n\nBut wait: what if d=0? Then we skip. Otherwise, we consider all divisors.\n\nHowever, there is an important observation: the minimal k might not be generated by a divisor of d? \n\nBut note: the GCD must divide d, so the minimal k must be such that the GCD is a divisor of d. Therefore, for the minimal k, there exists a divisor g (the GCD) that divides d and then k is the smallest k for which g divides both (a+k) and (b+k). Therefore, our iteration over divisors covers all possibilities.\n\nBut wait: consider the example where d=4, a=6, b=10. We got k=2 from divisor 4. But is k=2 the minimal k that achieves the minimal LCM? Yes.\n\nBut note: the minimal LCM might be achieved by a k that is not the minimal k for the divisor that is the GCD? \n\nWait, no: because if we fix the GCD (say g0), then the minimal k for which g0 divides both (a+k) and (b+k) is the k0 we computed for g0. But note: the GCD might be larger than g0? Actually, we don't know. \n\nBut note: the LCM is (x*y)/g0, and we want to minimize that. However, if we use a divisor g that is a multiple of the actual GCD, then the minimal k for g might be smaller than the minimal k for the actual GCD? \n\nLet me clarify: \n\nSuppose the actual GCD is g0 (a divisor of d). Then the condition is that (a+k) and (b+k) are divisible by g0. But if we consider a divisor g = g0 * t (which must divide d), then the minimal k for g might be the same or different? \n\nActually, the minimal k for g must satisfy: k ≡ (-a) mod g. But note: (-a) mod g is defined modulo g. However, the condition for g0 is k ≡ (-a) mod g0. \n\nBut note: if g is a multiple of g0, then the condition for g is stronger. The minimal k for g must be at least as large as the minimal k for g0. \n\nBut wait: consider g0=2 and g=4 (from the example). The minimal k for g0=2 is 0 (because 6 and 10 are divisible by 2). The minimal k for g=4 is 2. So the k for g=4 is larger.\n\nTherefore, the minimal k for a divisor g is at least the minimal k for the divisors that divide g.\n\nBut note: we are iterating over all divisors, so we will consider the candidate k=0 (from divisors 1 and 2) and k=2 (from divisor 4). Then we compute the LCM for k=0 and k=2 and choose the one with minimal LCM. Then, if two k have the same LCM, we choose the smallest k.\n\nBut note: we must consider that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors, and we are storing the candidate k and the corresponding LCM. However, we are storing the LCM for each candidate k.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if there are multiple k with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nBut note: we are iterating over divisors and generating candidate k. We must record the candidate k and the LCM, and then choose the candidate k that minimizes LCM and then the smallest k.\n\nBut note: the candidate k we generate for divisor g is the minimal k for which g divides (a+k) and (b+k). It is possible that a divisor h (larger than g) gives a candidate k_h that is even larger, but the LCM might be lower because the GCD is larger.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n1. If a == b: print 0.\n\n2. Let d = abs(a-b)\n\n3. Factorize d and get all divisors.\n\n4. Initialize:\n   best_k = None\n   best_lcm = None\n\n5. For each divisor g in divisors (including 1 and d):\n   a. k0 = (g - a % g) % g   [This gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k0) % g == 0]\n   b. x = a + k0\n   c. y = b + k0\n   d. g0 = gcd(x, y)\n   e. lcm_val = (x * y) // g0\n\n   f. Now, compare lcm_val with best_lcm:\n        If best_lcm is None, set best_lcm = lcm_val, best_k = k0.\n        Else, if lcm_val < best_lcm, then update best_lcm and best_k.\n        Else if lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k, then update best_k.\n\n6. Print best_k.\n\nBut wait: is the divisor g being iterated over redundant? Because we are computing the actual GCD (g0) from x and y. Then, the LCM is (x*y)/g0. \n\nBut note: the divisor g we used to compute k0 is not necessarily the GCD (g0). In fact, the GCD (g0) must divide d, but it might be a divisor that is not g (unless g is the GCD). \n\nBut note: the candidate k0 was chosen for divisor g, but the actual GCD might be any divisor of d (including g or a multiple of g, but actually, the GCD must divide d and also divide (a+k0) and (b+k0). \n\nBut note: the GCD (g0) is the greatest common divisor of x and y, so it might be larger than g. However, we are computing the LCM correctly by dividing by the actual GCD.\n\nBut note: we are iterating over divisors of d, but the LCM we compute depends on the actual GCD (which is the GCD of x and y). \n\nIs this efficient? The number of divisors is about O(sqrt(d)), and for each divisor we do a gcd computation (which is O(log(max(x,y))) and x and y can be up to 10^9 + divisor (so about 10^9). The gcd computation is efficient.\n\nBut note: what if d is 0? Then we skip. \n\nBut wait: d = |a-b|, and if a==b, we handled separately.\n\nBut note: there is a special case: if d=0, then we skip. \n\nBut note: what if a and b are negative? The input says a,b>=1.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut wait: the divisor g must be a divisor of d, and we are iterating over all divisors. However, note that the divisor g must be positive, and d is positive (since a,b>=1, and d=0 handled separately).\n\nBut note: we must consider that the divisor g might be negative? No, divisors are positive.\n\nBut wait: the divisor g must be positive, but in mathematics, divisors are usually considered positive.\n\nHowever, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n   (-a) % g: if a is positive, then (-a) % g = g - (a % g) if a % g !=0, else 0.\n\nBut wait, we defined k0 = (g - a % g) % g. \n\nBut note: if a % g ==0, then (g-0)%g=0. \nIf a % g !=0, then k0 = g - (a % g). \n\nBut note: (a+k0) % g = (a + (g - a%g)) % g = (a - a%g + g) % g. \nBut a = (a//g)*g + a%g, so a - a%g is divisible by g. Then adding g (which is divisible by g) and then modulo g gives 0.\n\nBut note: k0 might be 0 if a is divisible by g.\n\nBut what if a is negative? The problem states a>=1, so no.\n\nBut note: the above formula for k0: (g - a % g) % g.\n\nHowever, the modulus operation in Python for positive numbers is straightforward.\n\nBut wait: what if g is 1? Then a%1 is 0, so k0= (1-0)%1=0. Correct.\n\nBut note: the above method works for positive a and positive g.\n\nBut note: the divisor g must be positive, and a is positive, so no issue.\n\nBut wait: the example with a=6, b=10, d=4, divisor g=4: \n   k0 = (4 - 6%4) %4 = (4-2)%4=2. Correct.\n\nBut note: we are iterating over all divisors, including 1,2,4. \n\nBut note: the divisor list for d=4 is [1,2,4]. \n\nBut wait: what about the divisor d itself? We are including all divisors.\n\nBut note: the divisor set must include all divisors, including the negative ones? No, we only consider positive.\n\nBut note: the divisor set for d is all positive divisors.\n\nHowever, there is one more thing: the divisor g must be a divisor of d, but note that the equation (a+k0) % g ==0 requires that g divides (a+k0). But note: the divisor g must divide d, and d = |a-b|, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\nBut wait: what if the minimal k is not generated by any divisor? \n\nBut note: the minimal k must be such that the GCD (g0) divides d, so g0 is a divisor of d. Then, the minimal k for which g0 divides both (a+k) and (b+k) is the candidate we generate for g0. Therefore, we are covering all possibilities.\n\nBut note: we must also consider k=0 separately? Actually, no, because g=1 is always a divisor (if d>=1) and then k0=0.\n\nBut note: what if d=1? Then divisors=[1]. Then k0=0. Then x=a, y=b, and GCD=gcd(a,b). Then LCM = (a*b)//gcd(a,b). \n\nBut note: if d=1, then a and b are consecutive integers? Not necessarily, but |a-b|=1. Then the GCD of a and b must be 1 (because consecutive integers). Then LCM = a*b.\n\nBut wait: if a and b are consecutive, then yes. But what if a=2, b=3, then d=1, k0=0, then LCM=6. But is there a k>0 that reduces the LCM? \n\nk=1: (3,4): GCD=1, LCM=12 -> worse.\nk=2: (4,5): GCD=1, LCM=20 -> worse.\n\nSo k=0 is best.\n\nBut note: what if a=1, b=2? Then d=1. k0=0: LCM= (1*2)//1=2.\nk=1: (2,3): LCM=6 -> worse.\n\nSo correct.\n\nBut note: what if a=1, b=1? Then d=0, handled separately.\n\nBut note: the problem says a,b>=1.\n\nBut wait: what if a=2, b=4? Then d=2. Divisors: [1,2].\nFor g=1: k0=0 -> x=2, y=4, GCD=2, LCM=(2*4)//2=4.\nFor g=2: k0=(2-2%2)%2= (2-0)%2=0 -> same as above.\n\nBut wait: the LCM for k=0 is 4. Is there a k that gives a lower LCM?\n\nk=1: x=3, y=5, GCD=1, LCM=15.\nk=2: x=4, y=6, GCD=2, LCM=12.\nk=3: x=5, y=7, GCD=1, LCM=35.\nk=4: x=6, y=8, GCD=2, LCM=24.\n\nBut wait, why did we not get k=0 from g=1 and g=2? Then we computed LCM=4 for k=0. Then the minimal LCM is 4, so k=0 is the answer.\n\nBut note: the example input \"5 10\" -> output 0. Wait, the example input ['5 10'] -> output '0'. \n\nBut wait, the example input is:\n  Input: ['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n  Output: ['2','9','0']\n\nSo for input \"5 10\", output is 0.\n\nBut wait, 5 and 10: d=5. Divisors: [1,5].\n\nFor g=1: k0=0 -> x=5, y=10, GCD=5, LCM= (5*10)//5=10.\nFor g=5: k0=(5-5%5)%5=0 -> same.\n\nBut note: the example input \"5 10\" is provided, and the expected output is 0.\n\nBut wait, let me check with k=0: LCM(5,10)=10.\n\nBut is there a k that gives a lower LCM?\n\nk=1: 6,11 -> LCM=66.\nk=2: 7,12 -> LCM=84.\nk=3: 8,13 -> LCM=104.\nk=4: 9,14 -> LCM=126.\nk=5: 10,15 -> LCM=30.\nk=6: 11,16 -> LCM=176.\n...\n\nWait, so k=0 gives LCM=10, which is the minimum? Actually, the example output is 0.\n\nBut wait, the example input \"5 10\" is given as output '0'. \n\nBut wait, the example input \"5 10\" is the third example. \n\nBut wait, the example input \"5 10\" is provided as the third test. The example output is '0'. \n\nBut note: the example input \"5 10\" has a=5, b=10. Then d=5. Divisors: [1,5]. Then k0=0 for both. Then we compute the LCM= (5*10)//5=10.\n\nBut wait, is there a k that yields a lower LCM? \n\nk=5: LCM= (10,15)= (10*15)//5=30, which is higher.\n\nBut wait, what about k=-5? Not allowed (k>=0).\n\nBut wait, let me check: \n  k=0: LCM(5,10)=10.\n\nBut note: the problem says: the least common multiple of (a+k) and (b+k). \n\nLCM(5,10)=10.\n\nBut note: the LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both. \n\nBut wait, is there a k that makes the LCM less than 10? \n\nNo, because (a+k) and (b+k) are positive and at least 5 and 10 (if k>=0, then the numbers are at least 5 and 10). The LCM of two numbers that are at least 5 and 10 cannot be less than 10.\n\nBut wait: what if k=5? Then (10,15): LCM=30 -> not less.\n\nBut wait: what if k=0 is the minimal k that gives the minimal LCM. \n\nBut note: the example input \"5 10\" is provided and the expected output is 0.\n\nBut wait, the example input \"5 10\" is provided as the third example and the output is ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of the absolute difference \\( |a - b| \\). This insight allows us to consider all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) to determine potential values of \\( k \\) that could minimize the LCM.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( |a - b| \\), we compute the smallest \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) is derived from the equation \\( k \\equiv (-a) \\mod g \\). Once \\( k \\) is determined, we compute the actual GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) and then the LCM using the formula \\( \\text{LCM}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\times y}{\\text{GCD}(x, y)} \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Factorization**: We first factorize \\( |a - b| \\) to obtain all its divisors.\n   - **Iterate Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the minimal \\( k \\) that makes both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) divisible by \\( g \\).\n   - **Compute LCM**: For each computed \\( k \\), calculate the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n   - **Select Optimal \\( k \\)**: Track the \\( k \\) that yields the smallest LCM. If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same LCM, choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The factorization step has a complexity of \\( O(\\sqrt{d}) \\), where \\( d = |a - b| \\). For each divisor, we perform constant-time operations (modulo, GCD calculation, etc.), leading to an overall complexity of \\( O(\\sqrt{d} \\times \\log(\\max(a, b))) \\), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n        i += 1\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors_list = get_divisors(d)\n    \n    best_k = None\n    best_lcm = None\n    \n    for g in divisors_list:\n        remainder = a % g\n        if remainder == 0:\n            k0 = 0\n        else:\n            k0 = g - remainder\n            \n        x = a + k0\n        y = b + k0\n        g0 = math.gcd(x, y)\n        lcm_val = (x * y) // g0\n        \n        if best_lcm is None:\n            best_lcm = lcm_val\n            best_k = k0\n        else:\n            if lcm_val < best_lcm:\n                best_lcm = lcm_val\n                best_k = k0\n            elif lcm_val == best_lcm:\n                if k0 < best_k:\n                    best_k = k0\n                    \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). If they are equal, it immediately returns \\( k = 0 \\) since the LCM of any number with itself is the number itself, and minimizing it requires the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Divisor Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all positive divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) by checking each integer up to the square root of \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n3. **Finding Minimal \\( k \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\), the code calculates the smallest \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( g \\). This is done using the modulo operation.\n\n4. **LCM Calculation**: For each candidate \\( k \\), the code computes the actual GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) and then derives the LCM. The minimal LCM encountered during the iteration determines the optimal \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Output**: The smallest \\( k \\) that results in the minimal LCM is printed. If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same LCM, the smallest \\( k \\) is chosen.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidates for \\( k \\) by leveraging mathematical properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
