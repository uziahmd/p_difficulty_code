For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Since the musical scale is cyclic, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute the distances in semitones.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map the note names to numbers (0 to 11). Let's define a list of notes in order.\n    Note: The problem states that the notes are repeated cyclically and the sequence starts with C and goes up to H (which is the last).\n    The list of notes: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n 2. However, note that the example input includes \"C# B F\", and the example ordering is \"B C# F\". This means we have to consider that the chord is an unordered set.\n\n 3. We are to check for two patterns (for major and minor) in the cyclic order. Since the circle is cyclic, we can try all rotations.\n\n But note: The problem says the chord is an unordered set. So we can consider the three notes as a set and then check if there exists an ordering (a cyclic shift) such that:\n   For major: the pattern is [4, 3] (i.e., 4 semitones then 3 semitones, total 7)\n   For minor: the pattern is [3, 4] (total 7 semitones)\n\n 4. How to compute the distance between two notes? Since the circle has 12 notes, the distance from note i to note j (in the forward direction) is (j - i) mod 12, but we want the smallest nonnegative distance and also the forward direction from the lower to the higher, but note: the problem says the distance from a lower tone to an upper one, but when going from E to C, it's 8 semitones (which is 12-4=8). Actually, the problem defines the distance from the lowest to the highest, so in the chord we must arrange the three notes in increasing order (with the cycle). However, the example says: the distance between E and C is 8. But wait, in the example the chord \"C E G\" is major: \n        C -> E: 4 semitones (because C(0) -> C#(1), D(2), D#(3), E(4): 4 steps)\n        Then E->G: 3 semitones (E(4) -> F(5), F#(6), G(7): 3 steps)\n\n But note: the example also says the distance between E and C is 8. That is because if we go from E to the next C (which is after H) we have to go E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C: that's 8 semitones. However, in the chord, we are only concerned with the three notes. \n\n Important: In the definition, the chord is considered as an unordered set, but we must be able to order them so that the distances are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). This ordering is along the musical scale (so we are effectively breaking the circle and laying out the notes in increasing order, but since it's a circle, we might need to wrap around).\n\n 5. Approach:\n    - Map the three input notes to numbers (0 to 11).\n    - We have three numbers: a, b, c.\n\n    We can generate all cyclic shifts and also consider wrapping? Actually, we can do:\n\n    Since we are dealing with a circle, we can fix one note and then consider the other two in the circle. But note: the problem does not specify which note is which. We can consider the three notes and check for the two patterns.\n\n    Steps for checking:\n\n    Option 1: Generate all permutations of the three notes and then check if the distances (from first to second, second to third, and third to first) form the pattern [4,3] or [3,4] (but note: we are only considering two consecutive intervals in the ordered triplet). However, the chord is defined by two consecutive intervals that add up to 7, and then the third interval (from the third back to the first) would be 5 semitones (because 12-7=5). But wait, the definition does not require the entire circle to be traversed. The chord is just three notes. The condition is: there exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        dist(X, Y) = 4 and dist(Y, Z)=3   --> then it's major.\n        or dist(X, Y)=3 and dist(Y, Z)=4   --> then it's minor.\n\n    However, note: the example \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's map:\n        B -> 10, C# -> 1, F -> 5.\n        Now, we need to order them. The example orders as \"B C# F\": \n            From B to C#: (1 - 10) mod 12? Actually, we have to think about the circle.\n\n    How to compute the distance from note i to note j in the forward direction (without wrapping)? The problem says: the distance from the lowest to the highest. But when we have a circle, we can break at the lowest note.\n\n    Alternatively, we can break the circle by duplicating the list of notes (to handle the wrap-around). But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set.\n\n    Another idea: since the circle is 12, we can compute the clockwise distance from i to j as (j - i) % 12, but if negative we adjust. Actually, we can do:\n\n        def distance(i, j):\n            # returns the smallest distance on the circle? Actually, we don't want the smallest, we want the forward distance from i to j (without going backwards) for the purpose of ordering the chord?\n            # But wait, the example says the distance from E to C is 8, so they are going forward (clockwise) from E to the next C.\n\n            However, the problem does not say the distance is the minimal one. It says: from the lowest tone to the highest one. But when we have three notes, we can arrange them in the circle so that the distances are measured in the direction of the circle.\n\n    Let me re-read: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n    But then they say: \"between E and C is 8 semitones\". This implies that they are measuring in the direction that goes through the higher tones (so from E, going through F, G, A, B, H, C). \n\n    So we have two ways to measure the distance between two notes: the minimal distance (which is min(|i-j|, 12-|i-j|)) and the directed distance (which is (j-i) % 12, but if negative, then (j-i+12) % 12). But the problem uses the directed distance (the one that goes from the lower to the higher in the circle, without necessarily being minimal).\n\n    However, note: the chord definition requires two consecutive intervals (each of which is either 3 or 4 semitones) and the entire chord spans 7 semitones (which is the sum). The two intervals must be consecutive in the ordering of the chord (the ordering is along the musical scale, meaning we are going from the lowest to the highest, but the circle might wrap).\n\n    But wait, the example \"C E G\": \n        Notes: C, E, G -> 0, 4, 7.\n        Without wrapping: \n            From C to E: 4, from E to G: 3 -> that matches major.\n\n    Example \"C# B F\": \n        Notes: C# (1), B (10), F (5). \n        We order them as B, C#, F: \n            From B to C#: (1 - 10) mod 12? But we want the forward direction from B to C#. \n            How do we get from B to C#? We can go: B -> C (if we break the circle at B, then the next note is C) but wait, the circle is cyclic. The note after B is C (which is 0, but wait our list: \n                ... , H (11), then C (0) ...\n\n            The mapping: \n                C:0, C#:1, D:2, D#:3, E:4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11.\n\n            Then from B (10) to C# (1): \n                The forward direction: from 10 to 1: we can go from 10 to 11 (H) and then 0 (C) and then 1 (C#) -> that's 2 semitones? But wait, the example says the distance is 3 semitones.\n\n            Actually, let's count from B to C#: \n                B -> H: 1 semitone (from B to H: note that B is 10, H is 11) -> that's one step.\n                Then from H to C: that's one step (from 11 to 0) and then from C to C#: one step (0 to 1). So total 3 steps.\n\n            Alternatively, we can compute: (1 - 10) mod 12 = (1 - 10) % 12 = (-9) % 12 = 3. So the directed distance (forward) from B to C# is 3.\n\n            Similarly, from C# (1) to F (5): (5 - 1) % 12 = 4.\n\n            So the pattern is [3,4] -> minor.\n\n    Therefore, we can define the directed distance from note i to note j (in the forward direction, i.e., the circle going from C to H and then back to C) as:\n        d = (j - i) % 12\n        But if negative, we adjust by adding 12 until positive? Actually, modulo 12, we can do: (j - i) % 12, but if negative, we do (j - i + 12) % 12, but modulo operation in Python for negative: \n        We can use: (j - i) % 12, but note: \n            (1 - 10) % 12 = ( -9 ) % 12 = 3 (since -9 + 12 = 3). So that works.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. In the chord, we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. So we are looking for an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the directed distances (from X to Y and from Y to Z) are as specified.\n\n    But wait: the entire chord is three notes. The ordering (X, Y, Z) must be such that when we traverse from X to Y to Z, we are moving in the forward direction (and then from Z back to X we don't care because the chord is just three notes). However, the condition requires that the two consecutive intervals (from X to Y and Y to Z) add up to 7, and the entire span from X to Z is 7 semitones. \n\n    But note: the entire circle is 12. The three notes divide the circle into three arcs. The two arcs that are part of the chord (the ones between X-Y and Y-Z) must be 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). The remaining arc (from Z to X) is 12 - (4+3) = 5, which is not used.\n\n    However, the problem does not require that the entire chord is contained in an arc of 7 semitones? Actually, the condition is defined by the consecutive intervals. We are allowed to break the circle arbitrarily to form the chord.\n\n    How to check for a given set of three notes?\n\n    Steps:\n\n    Let the three notes be mapped to [a, b, c] (each in 0..11).\n\n    We have three possibilities to start the chord (each note as the first). Then we can arrange the remaining two in the two possible orders (increasing in the circle). But note: the circle is cyclic, so we can also consider the circular shifts.\n\n    Actually, we can do:\n\n        Let the three distinct numbers (since they are three distinct notes) be x, y, z.\n\n        We can consider the circle and break it at the starting point. But note: we are allowed to choose any starting point and then the next two in the forward direction.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the sorted order of the three notes in the linear representation (but then we have to account for wrap-around). However, the problem says the chord is defined by the two consecutive intervals (each being 3 or 4 semitones). \n\n        We can also consider: we are going to check all six permutations? But wait, the chord is unordered, but the condition is about consecutive intervals. So we need to check for an ordering that satisfies the condition.\n\n        Since there are only three notes, we can try the 6 permutations and check for each permutation (x,y,z) whether:\n            (y-x) % 12 == 4 and (z-y) % 12 == 3   -> major\n            OR\n            (y-x) % 12 == 3 and (z-y) % 12 == 4   -> minor\n\n        But wait, what if the chord wraps? For example, the notes [10, 0, 1] (which is B, C, C#). \n            Consider permutation (0,1,10): \n                (1-0)%12 = 1, (10-1)%12 = 9 -> not matching.\n            Consider permutation (0,10,1): \n                (10-0)%12 = 10, (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3 -> doesn't match either.\n\n        We must consider the circular ordering. The above method (using linear modulo) does not account for the fact that the chord might wrap.\n\n        Alternative approach: \n            Since we are allowed to break the circle arbitrarily, we can consider the three notes and sort them in the circular way.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Map the notes to numbers and sort the list. But then we have to consider that the circle wraps. So we can duplicate the sorted list (each note and note+12) and then take the three consecutive notes that include the three original ones.\n\n        However, note: we have three distinct notes. We can consider the gaps. But there is a simpler way.\n\n        We can consider the following: the three notes are fixed. The chord must contain two intervals of 3 and 4 (or 4 and 3) and the third interval (closing the circle) is 5. But the condition is defined by two consecutive intervals (the ones that are part of the chord). \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the chord is an unordered set. The definition requires that there exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3 (for major) OR 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n        The ordering (X,Y,Z) must be such that the entire chord is contained in the arc from X to Z (which is 7 semitones). And then the note X and Z are separated by 7 semitones, and the note Y is the one that is 4 semitones from X (for major) or 3 from X (for minor).\n\n        But note: the circle is 12, so the chord is contained in an arc of 7 semitones. There are two arcs of 7 semitones that contain the three notes? Actually, the three notes must lie within an arc of 7 semitones (because the two intervals are 4 and 3, so total 7). \n\n        How to check for an arc of 7 semitones containing the three notes?\n\n        We can try to find an ordering of the three notes (in the circle) such that the entire chord fits in 7 semitones. \n\n        Steps for one chord:\n\n        Let the three notes (as numbers) be a, b, c.\n\n        We can consider the circle and break it at a particular note. But we can do:\n\n            Create a list of the three numbers, and also their equivalents plus 12 (to simulate the wrap). Then sort and take the three consecutive ones that cover the three original notes? \n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n            Sort the three notes: [x, y, z] (in increasing order, but we are in a circle so we can also consider [x, y, z+12]). Then we can check the intervals:\n\n            Without wrap: \n                Interval1 = y - x\n                Interval2 = z - y\n                Interval3 = (x+12) - z   [if we break at x, then from z to x we have to go through the end of the circle]\n\n            But we are interested in consecutive intervals that are either [4,3] or [3,4]. \n\n        Actually, the standard way to check for a chord is:\n\n            Step 1: Map the three notes to numbers (0-11).\n            Step 2: Sort the numbers: let the sorted list be [a, b, c] (so a<=b<=c). Then we consider two cases:\n\n            Case 1: The chord does not wrap (i.e., the entire chord is in a 12-semitone circle without crossing the boundary from H to C). Then the three notes are in [0, 12) and we can break the circle at the beginning. Then the intervals are:\n                    interval1 = b - a\n                    interval2 = c - b\n                    interval3 = (a+12) - c   [this is the gap from the last note to the first note going forward]\n\n            But wait, the condition requires two consecutive intervals (not the entire circle). The two consecutive intervals in the chord must be adjacent. In the sorted list without wrap, the consecutive intervals are interval1 and interval2. But note: the chord might be arranged as (a, b, c) and then the intervals are from a to b and b to c. However, we can also consider the chord arranged as (a, c, b) if we break the circle differently? \n\n        Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n            We have three notes: a, b, c. The circle has 12 notes. We can break the circle at any note. The chord must have two consecutive intervals (in the forward direction) of 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n        Another idea: consider all cyclic shifts and all rotations. We can generate the six permutations and for each permutation, check the two consecutive intervals (the first two and the last two) but also the entire circle? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let the three notes be represented as a list L = [n1, n2, n3] (the numbers). Then we can consider:\n\n            For each starting index i (0,1,2) and then the next two in the circular order:\n\n                Let the ordered triplet be: \n                    p0 = L[i], p1 = L[(i+1)%3], p2 = L[(i+2)%3]\n\n                Then compute:\n                    d1 = (p1 - p0) % 12   [if negative, modulo will adjust]\n                    d2 = (p2 - p1) % 12\n                    d3 = (p0 + 12 - p2) % 12   [but actually, we don't need d3 for the condition, but note: the condition only requires the two consecutive intervals]\n\n                Then check if (d1, d2) is (4,3) -> major, or (3,4) -> minor.\n\n            But wait, the condition does not require the entire chord to be consecutive in the circle? Actually, the definition says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". \n\n            However, the ordering must be such that we are moving from X to Y to Z without skipping any note that is part of the chord? Actually, no: the chord is defined by the three notes, and we are allowed to break the circle arbitrarily. The condition is just about the distances between consecutive notes in that ordering.\n\n            But note: the example \"C# B F\": we broke the circle and got the ordering [B, C#, F] and the distances were 3 and 4.\n\n            So we are effectively breaking the circle and laying out the three notes in a linear fashion (from the starting note, then the next note in the forward direction, then the next). \n\n            However, the condition does not require that the three notes are consecutive in the entire circle, only that the two intervals (from X to Y and Y to Z) are 4 and 3 (or vice versa). And the entire chord is contained in the arc from X to Z (which is 7 semitones). \n\n            But wait, the circle has 12 semitones, and the arc from X to Z is 7, so the arc from Z back to X is 5. The condition does not require the three notes to be consecutive in the entire circle, just that the two consecutive intervals (within the chord) are 4 and 3.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                For each of the 6 permutations (we don't need all 6, because the chord is cyclic and we can break at any point, but we have three distinct notes so we can consider the three starting points and two directions? Actually, the condition is directional: we are going forward. So we break the circle and consider the three notes in the forward direction.\n\n            However, note: the problem says the chord is unordered. So we can consider any starting point and then the next two in the forward direction (without wrapping) or with wrapping? \n\n            But the definition of distance: the directed distance is computed as (next - current) mod 12. \n\n            Example: [10, 0, 1] (B, C, C#). We break the circle at B (10) and then the next two are C (0) and then C# (1). Then the distances are:\n                from 10 to 0: (0-10) % 12 = (-10)%12 = 2 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n            But wait, the example \"C# B F\" was [1,10,5] and we broke the circle at B (10) and then the next two are C# (1) and then F (5). The distance from 10 to 1 is 3 (as we computed). \n\n            Why the difference? Because in \"C# B F\", we started at B (10) and then went to C# (1) and then to F (5). But note: the circle is cyclic, so the next note after B (10) is C (0), then C# (1). But wait, the note C (0) is not in the chord. The chord only has three notes: B, C#, F. So we cannot jump over C? \n\n            The problem does not say we must use the immediate next note. It says: the distance from B to C# is 3 semitones. This is the direct distance from B to C# (which is 3 semitones) even though there is a note (C) in between in the full chromatic scale? \n\n            But wait, the chord is an unordered set. The definition does not require that the notes are consecutive in the entire chromatic scale, but the distance is defined as the number of semitones between them (which is the minimal steps? Actually, no: the problem says \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone\", and then the distance from B to C# is 3 because you skip two notes (C, C#) -> no, wait: from B to C is one, from C to C# is one, so from B to C# is two semitones? \n\n            Let me recount the semitones:\n\n            The note B is the 11th note? Wait, our mapping:\n\n                C:0, C#:1, D:2, D#:3, E:4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11.\n\n            Then from B (10) to C (0): 10 to 0: the semitones are: \n                B (10) -> H (11) -> then C (0). So that's two semitones? But wait, the example says the distance from B to C# is 3.\n\n            Let me list the notes from B (10) to C# (1):\n\n                B (10), H (11), C (0), C# (1)\n\n            So from B to C#: we have passed H and then C. That's 3 steps (each step is one semitone). So the distance is 3.\n\n            But the minimal distance between B and C# is 3 (since going the other way: from B down to A, G, etc. is longer). \n\n            The problem does not say minimal, it says \"the distance from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning the direction we are going (which is the forward direction, the circle increasing). \n\n            So the distance from B to C# is 3 (because we are going forward from B to C# and that's 3 semitones). \n\n            Therefore, we must use the directed distance (forward) and not the minimal distance.\n\n            Now, why did the example [10,0,1] (B, C, C#) not work? Because we broke the circle at B and then the next note in the chord is C, but the directed distance from B to C is 2 (because (0-10)%12=2). However, we are allowed to break the circle arbitrarily. We are not forced to take the next note in the chord immediately after the previous one in the circle. \n\n            Actually, the definition says: we can order the notes arbitrarily. So the ordering of the chord is independent of the circle's immediate neighbors. We just assign the labels X, Y, Z arbitrarily to the three notes. Then we require that the directed distance from X to Y (computed as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12) is 4 or 3, and from Y to Z is 3 or 4.\n\n            But note: the directed distance is defined on the circle. So we can do:\n\n                For a given assignment (X, Y, Z) of the three notes (each being one of the three), we compute:\n                    d1 = (Y - X) % 12   [if negative, we adjust by adding 12 until positive? Actually, modulo gives a positive result in [0,11]. But wait, 4 and 3 are in [0,11]. \n\n            However, the condition requires d1 to be 4 or 3, and d2 to be 3 or 4. \n\n            But note: the entire circle is 12, so the directed distance from X to Y can be more than 6? Actually, the condition does not require minimal distance, so it can be any value from 0 to 11. However, the two intervals (d1 and d2) must be 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) and then the remaining distance from Z back to X is (X + 12 - Z) mod 12, but we don't care.\n\n            So we can simply:\n\n                Let the three notes be [x, y, z] (the numbers). Then we consider all 6 permutations (which are the 3! = 6 ways to assign the three notes to X, Y, Z). For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\n                    d1 = (Y - X) % 12   [this is the forward distance from X to Y]\n                    d2 = (Z - Y) % 12   [forward from Y to Z]\n\n                    Then if (d1, d2) == (4,3): print \"major\"\n                    else if (d1, d2) == (3,4): print \"minor\"\n\n                If none of the permutations yield (4,3) or (3,4), then print \"strange\".\n\n            But wait: what if the same chord is represented by two different permutations? The problem says the answer is unambiguous.\n\n            Example: \"C E G\": \n                Permutations: \n                    [0,4,7]: d1=(4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major.\n                    [0,7,4]: d1=7, d2=(4-7)%12=9 -> not.\n                    [4,0,7]: d1=(0-4)%12=8, d2= (7-0)%12=7 -> not.\n                    [4,7,0]: d1=3, d2=(0-7)%12=5 -> not.\n                    [7,0,4]: d1=(0-7)%12=5, d2= (4-0)%12=4 -> not.\n                    [7,4,0]: d1=(4-7)%12=9, d2=(0-4)%12=8 -> not.\n\n            Only one permutation works.\n\n            Example: \"C# B F\": \n                Notes: [1,10,5]\n                Permutations:\n\n                (1,10,5): d1=(10-1)%12=9 -> not 3 or 4.\n                (1,5,10): d1=(5-1)%12=4, d2=(10-5)%12=5 -> not.\n                (10,1,5): d1=(1-10)%12= (1-10+12)%12=3, d2=(5-1)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n                So we found one.\n\n            Example: \"A B H\": \n                A:9, B:10, H:11.\n                Permutations:\n\n                (9,10,11): d1=1, d2=1 -> no.\n                (9,11,10): d1= (11-9)=2, d2=(10-11)%12=11 -> no.\n                (10,9,11): d1=(9-10)%12=11, d2=2 -> no.\n                (10,11,9): d1=1, d2=(9-11)%12= (9-11+12)%12=10 -> no.\n                (11,9,10): d1=(9-11)%12= (9-11+12)%12=10, d2=1 -> no.\n                (11,10,9): d1=(10-11)%12=11, d2=(9-10)%12=11 -> no.\n\n                So we output \"strange\".\n\n            But wait, the example input: \n                Input: \"A B H\" -> Output: \"strange\"\n\n            However, let me double-check: the example output is \"strange\", so that matches.\n\n            But wait, is this method correct? Consider a major chord: the condition is that there exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the distances are 4 and 3. The example \"C E G\" is major. \n\n            What about a minor chord: the condition is 3 and 4.\n\n            However, note: the directed distance from X to Y is the entire circle if we go from X to Y and then from Y to Z? Actually, the condition does not require that the entire chord is contained in one octave. But the problem states that the notes are repeated cyclically, and we are using modulo 12, so we are effectively working in one octave.\n\n            But what if the chord spans more than one octave? Actually, the problem says: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\" So we are working modulo 12.\n\n            However, the input notes are given in the 12-note system. So we map them to 0-11.\n\n            Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            1. Create a mapping from note name to number.\n\n            Note: the input format: three space-separated notes.\n\n            Example input: \"C E G\"\n\n            We split the input string by space.\n\n            2. Map each note to a number.\n\n            3. Generate all permutations of the three numbers.\n\n            4. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n                d1 = (Y - X) % 12   [This gives a number between 0 and 11]\n                d2 = (Z - Y) % 12\n\n                Check if (d1, d2) == (4,3) -> major\n                Check if (d1, d2) == (3,4) -> minor\n\n            5. If we find one, output accordingly. If we find both? The problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we won't find both.\n\n            However, wait: could a chord be both? The problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\"\n\n            So we can break once we find one.\n\n            But note: we must check all permutations? Actually, we can break as soon as we find one. However, the problem says the chord is unambiguous, so we can stop at the first match.\n\n            However, the same chord might be represented by multiple permutations. We can break at the first occurrence.\n\n            But wait: we are generating all permutations. We can do:\n\n            for perm in permutations([a,b,c]):\n                d1 = (perm[1] - perm[0]) % 12\n                d2 = (perm[2] - perm[1]) % 12\n                if (d1, d2) == (4,3):\n                    print(\"major\")\n                    exit(0)   # or break and then after the loop check for minor?\n                elif (d1, d2) == (3,4):\n                    print(\"minor\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            Then if we don't find any, print \"strange\".\n\n            But wait, we must check for major first? Actually, the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we can check for major and then minor.\n\n            However, what if a chord satisfies both? The problem says there are no chords that are both. So we can check for major, then minor, and if none then strange.\n\n            But note: the example input \"C E G\" is major. We found it. \n\n            Example input \"C# B F\" is minor.\n\n            Example input \"A B H\" is strange.\n\n            But wait, let me test a different chord: is there a chord that is both? According to the problem, no.\n\n            However, let me think: the condition for major is (4,3) and minor is (3,4). These are different. So unless we have a permutation that gives (4,3) and another that gives (3,4) for the same chord, but the problem says the answer is unambiguous.\n\n            But note: the chord is defined by the set. The condition is: there exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the distances are (4,3). There might be two different orderings that satisfy the condition? \n\n            Example: consider a set {X,Y,Z} that can be arranged in two different ways to get (4,3) and (3,4). But wait, (4,3) and (3,4) are different patterns.\n\n            Actually, the chord is defined by two consecutive intervals (the two intervals must be 4 and 3, or 3 and 4). But the entire chord is three notes. The pattern (4,3) and (3,4) are distinct.\n\n            However, what if the chord has two different ways to break the circle that give different patterns? \n\n            Example: consider the notes [0, 4, 7] (C, E, G) is major. But is there a way to break the circle to get (3,4)? \n                Ordering: [0,4,7]: (4,3) -> major.\n                Ordering: [4,7,0]: ( (7-4)=3, (0-7)=5) -> no.\n                Ordering",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number (0 to 11) based on its position in the chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: For the three input notes, generate all permutations (orderings) to consider every possible sequence.\n3. **Checking Distance Criteria**: For each permutation, compute the directed distances between consecutive notes. A major chord requires the distances to be 4 and 3 semitones, while a minor chord requires 3 and 4 semitones. If either condition is met, output the corresponding result.\n4. **Handling Unambiguous Results**: According to the problem, no chord will satisfy both conditions simultaneously, so once a match is found, the result can be determined immediately. If no match is found after checking all permutations, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    notes_mapping = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    nums = [notes_mapping[note] for note in data]\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(nums):\n        d1 = (perm[1] - perm[0]) % 12\n        d2 = (perm[2] - perm[1]) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n            break\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            break\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `notes_mapping` dictionary translates each note name to its corresponding numerical value (0-11) based on its position in the chromatic scale.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their numerical representations using the mapping dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The code generates all possible permutations of the three note numbers. For each permutation, it calculates the directed distances between consecutive notes using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Condition Check**: The code checks if the computed distances match the criteria for a major chord (4 and 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 and 4 semitones). If a match is found, it prints the corresponding result and exits. If no match is found after all permutations are checked, it prints \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of musical notes. The solution is both concise and effective, ensuring correct classification based on the given criteria.",
