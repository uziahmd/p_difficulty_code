There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) from 2 to 10^18.\n\n The tournament is single elimination (knockout). The winner must win all their games.\n\n However, the twist: two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one.\n\n We need to find the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n Observation:\n\n In a standard single elimination tournament with n players, the winner plays in log2(n) games (if n is a power of two). But note that the problem allows the grid to be arranged arbitrarily as long as the rule is satisfied.\n\n How can we think?\n\n Let's denote the winner. The winner must win k games. So, we need to have at least k rounds.\n\n But the rule says: when two players play, their previous game counts must differ by at most one.\n\n This condition is similar to having two groups (with sizes differing by at most one) in each round.\n\n Actually, we can model the tournament as building a complete binary tree (but not necessarily balanced in the usual way because of the rule) where the winner's path must be constructed in such a way that the rule holds.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the tournament as having two halves: the winner must come from one half and then meet the winner of the other half. But the rule is more general.\n\n Another idea: the maximum number of games the winner can play is limited by the fact that after the first game, the winner has 1 game. Then for the second game, the next opponent must have 0 or 1 game (but the winner has 1, so the opponent must have 0 or 1). However, note that the entire tournament must have a fixed structure.\n\n Let me try with small n:\n\n n = 2: \n   Only one game. Winner plays 1 game.\n\n n = 3:\n   We can arrange: \n     First, let player1 and player2 play (player1 wins). Now, we have two players: player1 (with 1 win) and player3 (with 0 wins). They cannot play because the rule says: |1-0| <= 1 -> yes, so they can play. Therefore, the winner (player1) plays 2 games.\n\n   But wait, the example input says for n=3 output is 2.\n\n   However, the example input also says for n=4 output is 2? Actually, the example says:\n\n        Input: ['2', '3', '4', '10']\n        Output: ['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n   For n=4: \n        Standard tournament: two semifinals and one final. The winner would play 2 semifinal games and 1 final? Actually no: in a standard 4-player single elimination, the winner plays 2 games (semifinal and final). But wait, the example output is 2.\n\n   Why for n=10 the answer is 4?\n\n   Let me try to understand the pattern:\n\n   We want to maximize the number of games for the winner.\n\n   Consider: the tournament is structured such that the winner must go through several rounds. But the condition on the opponents' game counts might force the tournament to be built in a way that the winner doesn't play immediately against too many strong players.\n\n   Alternate approach: \n\n   Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required to have a tournament where the winner plays k games, under the given constraint.\n\n   How to build a tournament for k games?\n\n   In the first game, the winner plays one game. Then for the second game, the winner must face a player who has either 0 or 1 game. But note: the entire tournament must be arranged such that the winner can continue.\n\n   Actually, we can break down the tournament into two parts: the winner's part and the rest.\n\n   However, note that the rule applies to every match. We can consider that the tournament is built in rounds, but the rounds are not fixed. The condition allows that two players with a difference of one can play.\n\n   We can use recursion:\n\n   To have the winner play k games, we need:\n\n   - In the last game (the k-th game) the winner plays against the runner-up (who has played k-1 games, because they have been winning all their matches too).\n\n   - But how do we get the two players for the k-th game? They must have played k-1 games each (because they won all their previous matches) and then they play.\n\n   However, the condition says: the two players can play if the difference is at most one. So in the k-th game, both must have played k-1 games (so same) or one has k-1 and the other k-2? Actually, the winner has played k-1 games (from the previous k-1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a single-elimination tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the constraint that opponents in any match must have played a similar number of games prior to their encounter. \n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the total number of players \\( n \\) is at least the sum of a specific series derived from \\( k \\). This series is built by considering the maximum number of players that can be accommodated in a tournament where the winner plays exactly \\( k \\) games.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The approach involves iteratively checking for the largest \\( k \\) where the sum of the series \\( 2^k + 2^{k-1} + \\ldots + 2^1 \\) (adjusted for the constraint) does not exceed \\( n \\). The series is constructed by doubling the previous term and adding it to a cumulative sum until the sum exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    total_games = 0\n    k = 0\n    current_players = 1\n    required_players = 2\n    \n    while required_players <= n:\n        k += 1\n        total_games = k\n        current_players *= 2\n        required_players = (current_players * 3) // 2\n        \n    print(total_games)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input value \\( n \\), which represents the number of players.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: If \\( n \\) is 2, the output is trivially 1 since the winner plays only one game.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: The loop calculates the maximum number of games \\( k \\) the winner can play. For each iteration, it updates \\( k \\) and checks if the required number of players (based on the current tournament structure) is within the given \\( n \\).\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until the required number of players exceeds \\( n \\). The last valid \\( k \\) is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games by leveraging a mathematical series that accounts for the tournament's constraints, ensuring optimal performance even for very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)).",
