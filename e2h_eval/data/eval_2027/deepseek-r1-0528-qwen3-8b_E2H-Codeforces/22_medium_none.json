After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given: first line has two integers n and m, then n lines each with m characters (without spaces)\n We need to count the number of successful students. A student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best.\n A student is the best at a subject if no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input.\n 2. We have a grid of n rows and m columns. Each row is a string of m digits.\n\n Approach:\n For each subject j (column j), we can find the maximum mark. Then, for that subject, every student who has that maximum mark is the best in that subject.\n\n However, note: multiple students can be best in a subject (if they all have the same highest mark).\n\n Now, a student is successful if he is the best in at least one subject.\n\n We can do:\n   For each subject j, let max_j = maximum mark in column j.\n   Then, for each student i, check in subject j: if grid[i][j] == max_j, then student i is best in subject j.\n\n But we don't want to do this for each subject separately for each student? Alternatively, we can mark for each student if they are best in any subject.\n\n Alternative plan:\n   Create an array `success` of booleans for each student, initially all False.\n\n   For each subject j from 0 to m-1:\n        max_mark = max( grid[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n        For each student i from 0 to n-1:\n            if grid[i][j] == max_mark:\n                mark success[i] = True\n\n   Then count the number of True in `success`.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n   grid = [ ['2','2','3'], ['2','3','2'], ['1','1','2'] ]\n\n   For subject0 (j=0): marks are ['2','2','1'] -> max_mark='2'. So student0 and student1 are best in subject0.\n   For subject1 (j=1): marks are ['2','3','1'] -> max_mark='3'. So only student1 is best in subject1.\n   For subject2 (j=2): marks are ['3','2','2'] -> max_mark='3'. So only student0 is best in subject2.\n\n   Then:\n     student0: best in subject0 and subject2 -> True\n     student1: best in subject0 and subject1 -> True\n     student2: not best in any -> False\n\n   Count = 2.\n\n Let's test with the second example: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n   grid = [ ['9','1','7','2','8'], ['1','1','8','2','8'], ['1','1','1','1','1'] ]\n\n   We'll break it down by subject:\n\n   Subject0: ['9','1','1'] -> max is '9' -> only student0 is best.\n   Subject1: ['1','1','1'] -> max is '1' -> all three are best.\n   Subject2: ['7','8','1'] -> max is '8' -> only student1 is best.\n   Subject3: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2' -> student0 and student1 are best.\n   Subject4: ['8','8','1'] -> max is '8' -> student0 and student1 are best.\n\n   Then:\n     student0: best in subject0 -> True\n     student1: best in subject1, subject3, subject4 -> True\n     student2: best in none -> False\n\n   Count = 2? But the sample output is 3.\n\n Wait, the sample output says 3. Let me recheck:\n\n   The sample input: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n   The example says: \"each student is the best at at least one subject\", so expected output is 3.\n\n   What's wrong?\n\n   Let me recalc for student2 (third row):\n\n   In subject1: mark is '1', and the max is '1' -> so yes, student2 is best in subject1.\n\n   Actually, in subject1: all three have '1', so all are best. Therefore, student2 is best in subject1.\n\n   Then:\n     student0: subject0 and subject3 and subject4 -> True\n     student1: subject1, subject2, subject3, subject4 -> True\n     student2: subject1 -> True\n\n   So indeed, all three are successful.\n\n   Correction: The mistake was in my initial breakdown: in subject1, all students are best.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm must mark a student as successful if in at least one subject they are best.\n\n   With the above code, we would set:\n     For subject0: mark student0 as True.\n     For subject1: mark student0, student1, student2 as True.\n     For subject2: mark student1 as True.\n     For subject3: mark student0 and student1 as True.\n     For subject4: mark student0 and student1 as True.\n\n   Then, after processing all subjects, we have:\n     student0: True (from subject0, subject3, subject4) -> True\n     student1: True (from subject1, subject2, subject3, subject4) -> True\n     student2: True (from subject1) -> True\n\n   Count = 3.\n\n   So the algorithm is correct.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read first line to get n and m.\n   Then read next n lines.\n\n   Since the input is given as a single string for each row, we can split by newline and take the first two numbers from the first line.\n\n   Steps in code:\n\n   1. Read the entire input.\n   2. Split the first line to get n and m.\n   3. Read the next n lines.\n\n   Example input format: \n        \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   We can do:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not data: \n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        first_line = data[0].split()\n        n = int(first_line[0])\n        m = int(first_line[1])\n\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(1, 1+n):\n            grid.append(data[i].strip())\n\n   Then proceed.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the first input line contains two integers, then n lines. So we can rely on that.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a string that includes the whole thing, but in actual stdin we get line by line.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Important: We assume the input is as described.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Steps:\n      Read n and m.\n      Read n lines.\n\n      Initialize a list `is_successful` of n booleans, all False.\n\n      For j in range(m): # for each subject (column)\n          col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n          max_mark = max(col)   # because the characters are from '1' to '9'\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              if grid[i][j] == max_mark:\n                  is_successful[i] = True\n\n      Then, count = sum(is_successful)\n\n   Print(count)\n\n   Let's test with the examples.\n\n   Example1: \n        n=3, m=3\n        grid = [\"223\", \"232\", \"112\"]\n\n        j=0: col = ['2','2','1'] -> max_mark='2'\n             i=0: '2'=='2' -> True\n             i=1: '2'=='2' -> True\n             i=2: '1' != '2' -> remains False.\n\n        j=1: col = ['2','3','1'] -> max_mark='3'\n             i=0: '2' != '3' -> no change.\n             i=1: '3'=='3' -> True (already True for i=1, but set again doesn't matter).\n             i=2: '1' != '3'\n\n        j=2: col = ['3','2','2'] -> max_mark='3'\n             i=0: '3'=='3' -> True (so student0 becomes True, already was True from j=0)\n             i=1: '2' != '3'\n             i=2: '2' != '3'\n\n        Then is_successful = [True, True, False] -> count=2.\n\n   Example2: \n        n=3, m=5\n        grid = [\"91728\", \"11828\", \"11111\"]\n\n        j0: col = ['9','1','1'] -> max='9'; mark index0 True.\n        j1: col = ['1','1','1'] -> max='1'; mark all indices True -> [True, True, True]\n        j2: col = ['7','8','1'] -> max='8'; mark index1 True (already True).\n        j3: col = ['2','2','1'] -> max='2'; mark index0 and index1 True (already True).\n        j4: col = ['8','8','1'] -> max='8'; mark index0 and index1 True (already True).\n\n        Then count = 3.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Edge case: n=1, m=1, grid = [\"1\"]\n        Only one student, one subject. Mark is '1'. \n        Then for subject0: max_mark='1', so student0 becomes True -> count=1.\n\n   Another edge: n=2, m=1, grid = [\"1\",\"1\"] -> both are best, so both successful -> count=2.\n\n   Another: n=2, m=1, grid = [\"1\",\"2\"] -> max_mark='2', so only the second student is best -> count=1.\n\n   It works.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves analyzing a grid where each row represents a student and each column represents a subject. Each cell contains a mark (from 1 to 9) for the corresponding student and subject. The goal is to identify students who are the best in any subject (i.e., have the highest mark in that subject) and count them.\n2. **Intuition**: For each subject, find the highest mark. Then, check all students' marks in that subject. If a student's mark matches the highest mark, they are marked as successful for that subject. After processing all subjects, count how many students have been marked successful at least once.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each subject (column) to find the maximum mark. For each student, if their mark in the current subject equals the maximum, they are flagged as successful. This process repeats for all subjects, and the total number of successful students is counted.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each subject and each student within that subject, resulting in a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of students and m is the number of subjects. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m are up to 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    is_successful = [False] * n\n    \n    for j in range(m):\n        col_marks = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_mark = max(col_marks)\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_mark:\n                is_successful[i] = True\n                \n    count = sum(is_successful)\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first line contains the number of students (n) and subjects (m). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student in each subject.\n2. **Initialization**: A boolean list `is_successful` is initialized to keep track of which students are successful.\n3. **Processing Subjects**: For each subject (column), the maximum mark is determined. All students who achieved this maximum mark in the subject are marked as successful.\n4. **Counting Successful Students**: After processing all subjects, the number of students marked as successful is counted and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons to achieve the desired result.",
