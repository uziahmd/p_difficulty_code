He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and then 2n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1) which are the prefixes and suffixes (each length appears exactly two times, one prefix and one suffix).\n\n However, note: the input order is arbitrary. We have to assign each string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that:\n   - There are exactly n-1 strings of type P and n-1 of type S (so total 2n-2).\n   - The set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with some string s of length n.\n\n But note: It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Observation:\n   The problem guarantees that there is at least one string that is consistent. Also, for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let L = [1, 2, ..., n-1] (the lengths)\n\n For a fixed length k (from 1 to n-1), we have two strings. One of them must be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\n However, we cannot assign arbitrarily: the entire string s of length n must be consistent.\n\n Consider: \n   Let s[0:k] be the prefix of length k, and s[n-k:n] be the suffix of length k.\n\n What constraints do we have?\n   For example, for k=1: we have two strings (say a and b). Then the first character must be one of them and the last must be the other.\n\n   For k=2: we have two strings (say c and d). Then the first two characters must be c (if we assign c as prefix) and the last two must be d (if we assign d as suffix) OR vice versa? Actually, note: the two strings for length 2 are the two possibilities: one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\n But wait: the problem says that the two strings of length k are one prefix and one suffix.\n\n How to use this?\n\n We know that the entire string s has length n. Then, for each position i (from 0 to n-1) and for each j (from 1 to n-1) we don't know, but we can consider the following:\n\n   Let A be the list of all given strings (with their original input order preserved? but the output must be in the same order as input).\n\n   We have to assign to each string either P or S, such that for each length k, one string is P and the other is S.\n\n   Additionally, the assignment must be consistent: meaning if we have a prefix of length k and a prefix of length l, then the first k characters of the prefix of length l must equal the prefix of length k.\n\n   Similarly, for suffixes: the suffix of length l must be contained in the string at the end.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"there is at least one string consistent\", so we don't need to find all, just one.\n\n Alternate idea:\n\n   Since the string of length n must have the property that the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must satisfy that the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k+1 must align appropriately.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require us to reconstruct the string, only to assign each given string as either P or S.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Group the strings by their length. For each length k, we have two strings: let's call them x and y.\n\n   2. Now, we have to decide which one is the prefix and which one is the suffix.\n\n   How to decide? We can try to use the fact that the entire string must be consistent.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to output any valid assignment.\n\n   Another observation: the entire string s must have the property that for every k from 1 to n-1, the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k are fixed. Moreover, the overlapping parts must match.\n\n   Example: \n      In the first example: n=5, strings: ['ba','a','abab','a','aba','baba','ab','aba'] -> actually, wait, the example input is given as a string that contains the input. But the example output is 'SPPSPSPS'\n\n   Let me parse the example:\n\n      Input:\n        5\n        ba\n        a\n        abab\n        a\n        aba\n        baba\n        ab\n        aba\n\n      But wait, the example input is provided as a string that looks like multiple lines. Actually, the example input format is:\n\n          First line: 5\n          Then 8 lines: \n              ba\n              a\n              abab\n              a\n              aba\n              baba\n              ab\n              aba",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string of length `n`. The input consists of `2n-2` strings, with exactly two strings of each length from 1 to `n-1`. The solution involves grouping these strings by their lengths and then determining the correct assignment (prefix or suffix) for each string based on consistency checks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: First, we group all input strings by their lengths. Since there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, we can process each group separately.\n2. **Determine Prefix/Suffix Assignment**: For each length group, we need to decide which string is the prefix and which is the suffix. This decision is based on checking the consistency of overlapping parts between adjacent lengths. Specifically:\n   - For a given length `k`, the prefix must start with the first `k` characters of the longer prefix (if it exists) and the suffix must end with the last `k` characters of the longer suffix.\n3. **Check Consistency**: For each length `k`, we compare the two candidate strings (one potential prefix and one potential suffix) with the strings of length `k+1`. If the longer prefix starts with the shorter prefix and the longer suffix ends with the shorter suffix, then the shorter strings are correctly identified as prefix and suffix, respectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    strings = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n        strings.append(data[index].strip())\n        index += 1\n        \n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        k = len(s)\n        if k not in groups:\n            groups[k] = []\n        groups[k].append(s)\n            \n    result = []\n    \n    for k in sorted(groups.keys()):\n        group = groups[k]\n        if len(group) != 2:\n            continue\n            \n        cand1, cand2 = group\n        \n        found = False\n        assign1 = None\n        assign2 = None\n        \n        if k + 1 in groups:\n            next_group = groups[k+1]\n            if len(next_group) == 2:\n                next_cand1, next_cand2 = next_group\n                if cand1.startswith(next_cand1[:k]) and cand2.endswith(next_cand2[-k:]):\n                    assign1 = 'P'\n                    assign2 = 'S'\n                    found = True\n                elif cand1.startswith(next_cand2[:k]) and cand2.endswith(next_cand1[-k:]):\n                    assign1 = 'P'\n                    assign2 = 'S'\n                    found = True\n                    \n        if not found:\n            if k > 1:\n                prev_group = groups[k-1]\n                prev_cand1, prev_cand2 = prev_group\n                if cand1.endswith(prev_cand1[-(k-1):]) and cand2.startswith(prev_cand1[:k-1]):\n                    assign1 = 'S'\n                    assign2 = 'P'\n                    found = True\n                elif cand1.endswith(prev_cand2[-(k-1):]) and cand2.startswith(prev_cand2[:k-1]):\n                    assign1 = 'S'\n                    assign2 = 'P'\n                    found = True\n                    \n        if not found:\n            if k == 1:\n                if cand1 < cand2:\n                    assign1 = 'S'\n                    assign2 = 'P'\n                else:\n                    assign1 = 'P'\n                    assign2 = 'S'\n            else:\n                if cand1 < cand2:\n                    assign1 = 'S'\n                    assign2 = 'P'\n                else:\n                    assign1 = 'P'\n                    assign2 = 'S'\n                    \n        result.append(assign1)\n        result.append(assign2)\n        \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line is the length `n` of the unknown string, followed by `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where keys are lengths and values are lists of strings of that length.\n3. **Assigning Prefix/Suffix**: For each length `k`, the two strings are checked against strings of length `k+1` (if available) to see if they can be part of a longer prefix or suffix. If not, they are checked against strings of length `k-1` for consistency. If no checks pass, the strings are assigned based on lexicographical order.\n4. **Output**: The results for each string are concatenated into a single string of 'P's and 'S's, which is printed as the output.\n\nThis approach ensures that the assignment of prefixes and suffixes is consistent with the structure of the unknown string, leveraging checks with adjacent lengths to determine the correct labels.",
