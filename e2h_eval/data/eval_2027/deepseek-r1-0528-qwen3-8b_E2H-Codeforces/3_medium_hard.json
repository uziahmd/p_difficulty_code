Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n The idea is to find the minimum d such that the entire street [0, l] is covered by the lanterns' light.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. We note that the street must be from 0 to l. So we need to cover from the start (0) to the end (l).\n\n Observation:\n  - The leftmost point is 0. The first lantern (at sorted[0]) can cover up to sorted[0] + d. To cover from 0 to sorted[0], \n    we require d >= sorted[0] (so that the left part from 0 to sorted[0] is covered by the first lantern).\n  - Similarly, the last lantern must cover from its position to l, so d >= (l - sorted[-1]).\n  - For the gaps between lanterns: consider two consecutive lanterns at positions a and b. The gap between them is from a to b.\n    The entire gap must be covered. The left lantern covers up to a+d, and the right lantern covers from b-d. \n    To cover the gap, we require that a+d >= b-d (or more precisely, the coverage must meet: so the required d for the gap is (b - a)/2? \n    Actually, the condition is that the midpoint of the gap must be within d from both sides. But note, the minimal d to cover the gap is (b - a) / 2, because if we set d = (b - a)/2, then the left lantern would cover up to a + (b-a)/2 = (a+b)/2, and the right lantern would start at b - (b-a)/2 = (a+b)/2. However, note that the lanterns might extend beyond the gap.\n\n However, let's break it down:\n\n We need to ensure that the entire interval [0, l] is covered. We can think of it as:\n\n  - The first segment: from 0 to the first lantern. We require d >= first_lantern (because the first lantern must reach from 0 to first_lantern). \n  - The gaps between lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at positions x and y, the gap is from x to y. The left lantern must cover up to at least y, so the required d for the gap is (y - x) / 2. But wait, actually the left lantern must cover from x to at least somewhere beyond the middle, and the right lantern must cover from the middle to y. The minimal d that covers the gap is (y - x) / 2, but note that the lanterns are already covering from their own positions. The condition is that the coverage from the left lantern must meet the coverage from the right lantern. The meeting point is (x+y)/2. Therefore, the left lantern needs to extend at least (y - x)/2, and the right lantern also needs to extend at least (y - x)/2. So the required d for the gap is (y - x) / 2.\n\n  - The last segment: from the last lantern to l, which requires d >= (l - last_lantern).\n\n Then, the overall d must be at least the maximum of:\n   - first_lantern (to cover from 0 to the first lantern)\n   - (gaps between consecutive lanterns) -> for each gap (x_i, x_{i+1}): (x_{i+1} - x_i) / 2\n   - (l - last_lantern)\n\n But wait: consider the gaps. Actually, the gap condition is not exactly (x_{i+1} - x_i)/2, because the left lantern must cover from x_i to x_{i+1}. The left lantern covers up to x_i + d, and the next lantern starts at x_{i+1} and covers from x_{i+1} - d to x_{i+1} + d. We require that x_i + d >= x_{i+1} - d. This gives: 2*d >= x_{i+1} - x_i => d >= (x_{i+1} - x_i)/2.\n\n However, note that the entire gap is from x_i to x_{i+1}. The left lantern must cover up to x_i + d, and we require that x_i + d >= x_{i+1} (if we only have two lanterns and no other) then d>= x_{i+1}-x_i. But wait, if we have multiple lanterns, the gap condition is that the left lantern doesn't necessarily have to cover the entire gap, but the combined coverage must. Actually, the condition is that the coverage from the left lantern (which goes to x_i + d) must meet the coverage from the right lantern (which starts at x_{i+1} - d). Therefore, we require x_i + d >= x_{i+1} - d. \n\n Example: two consecutive lanterns at 5 and 7. Then we require 5+d >= 7-d -> 2d >= 2 -> d>=1. But note, with d=1, the left lantern covers [4,6] and the right lantern covers [6,8]. They meet at 6. So the entire gap from 5 to 7 is covered.\n\n But what if the gap is from 0 to 5? Then we require d>=5 (to cover from 0 to 5). Then the gap from 5 to 7 requires d>=1. Then the gap from 7 to 10? Then we require d>=3 (if we have a lantern at 7 and the next at 10, then the gap from 7 to 10 requires d>= (10-7)/2 = 1.5? Actually, no: the condition for the gap between 7 and 10 is: 7+d >= 10-d -> 2d>=3 -> d>=1.5.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require that we only use adjacent lanterns. The entire street must be covered. We are allowed to have overlapping.\n\n So the algorithm:\n\n 1. Read n and l.\n 2. Read the list of lantern positions and sort it.\n\n 3. Consider the gaps:\n    - Gap at the beginning: from 0 to the first lantern. The required d1 = first_lantern (if we set d=d1, then the first lantern will cover [0, first_lantern+d1] which is [0, 2*first_lantern]? Actually, no: the first lantern at position a0, with radius d, covers [a0-d, a0+d]. But note: we require to cover from 0. So we require a0-d <= 0, meaning d>=a0. However, wait: the problem says the street is from 0 to l, and the lantern is at a0. The condition for 0 is: a0 - d <= 0 <= a0 + d. Since a0>=0, the left side is automatically satisfied if d>=a0. But note: the lantern might be at 0, then d>=0. But the problem says positive d, so we don't worry about 0.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think of the entire coverage:\n\n    Let the current d be sufficient. Then the street is covered if:\n\n      - The leftmost point 0 is covered: there exists a lantern at a_i such that a_i - d <= 0 <= a_i + d. Since the lanterns are at nonnegative positions, the closest lantern to 0 is the first one. So we require a_0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a_0? Actually, the condition is that the leftmost lantern must extend to the left at least to 0: so d >= a_0 (because from a_0 to 0 is a distance a_0). Similarly, the rightmost lantern must extend to the right to l: d >= l - a_last.\n\n    - Now for gaps between lanterns: the entire street must be covered. The gap between two consecutive lanterns a_i and a_{i+1} must be covered. The left lantern at a_i covers up to a_i + d, and the next lantern at a_{i+1} covers from a_{i+1} - d. We require that a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d, because if there is a gap in the middle, then the point a_{i+1} - d must be <= a_i + d. Rearranged: 2*d >= a_{i+1} - a_i.\n\n    However, note: the above conditions are necessary and sufficient. Why?\n\n    Condition 1: d >= a_0 (to cover from 0 to the first lantern)\n    Condition 2: d >= l - a_last (to cover from the last lantern to l)\n    Condition 3: for every consecutive pair (a_i, a_{i+1}), d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2\n\n    Then the minimal d is the maximum of these three values.\n\n    Let's test with the example: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n        n=2, l=5, lanterns = [2,5]\n\n        Condition 1: d >= 2 (to cover from 0 to 2)\n        Condition 2: d >= 5-5 = 0 (not binding)\n        Condition 3: (5-2)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\n        Then the answer would be max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0 -> matches.\n\n    Another example: ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0']\n\n        Sort the lanterns: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n\n        Condition 1: d >= 0 -> not binding (but we take the max so 0 is negligible)\n        Condition 2: d >= 15-15 = 0 -> negligible\n        Condition 3: \n          3-0 = 3 -> d>= 1.5\n          5-3 = 2 -> d>=1.0\n          7-5 = 2 -> d>=1.0\n          9-7 = 2 -> d>=1.0\n          14-9 = 5 -> d>=2.5\n          15-14 = 1 -> d>=0.5\n\n        Then the maximum is 2.5.\n\n        Output: 2.5 -> matches.\n\n    However, wait: the example input is \"7 15\" and the lanterns are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. The expected output is 2.5.\n\n    But note: the condition for the beginning: we require d>=0, but actually we have a lantern at 0. The condition for the beginning is automatically satisfied by the lantern at 0? Actually, the lantern at 0 covers from -d to d. Since the street starts at 0, we require that the left side of the first lantern (at 0) must cover 0, which is satisfied by any d>=0. Similarly, the last lantern at 15 must cover l=15, so d>=0.\n\n    However, what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then we require d>=a0. In this example, the first lantern is at 0, so condition1 is 0. But if we had a first lantern at 2, then condition1 is 2.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # Condition 1: from the left (beginning of the street to the first lantern)\n        cond1 = a[0]  # because the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]: so d >= a[0]\n\n        # Condition 2: from the last lantern to the end of the street\n        cond2 = l - a[-1]\n\n        # Condition 3: for the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        cond3 = 0.0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap/2, but we want the maximum over all gaps\n            if gap > cond3 * 2:  # or simply update cond3 to the maximum of gap/2\n                cond3 = gap / 2.0\n\n        # However, note: it's possible that the gaps are larger than the beginning or end conditions.\n\n        ans = max(cond1, cond2, cond3)\n\n        But wait: is that correct for the gaps? Actually, we must consider that the gaps condition is the maximum over (gap/2) for all gaps.\n\n        However, let me reexamine: the gap condition is that for a gap of length 'gap', the minimal d needed to cover that gap is gap/2. But note: we are not forced to use only two lanterns for the gap? Actually, the entire street must be covered. The gaps are independent. So the minimal d must be at least the maximum of:\n          - the left gap (cond1)\n          - the right gap (cond2)\n          - the maximum gap/2 from the middle gaps (cond3)\n\n        However, wait: what if the first lantern is at 0, and then we have a gap of 10 between 0 and 10? Then the condition for the gap is (10-0)/2 = 5. But also, the left gap condition is 0 (since first lantern is at 0). The right gap condition would be for the next lantern after 10? Actually, the gap condition is for consecutive lanterns. We are considering consecutive lanterns. The gap from 0 to 10 is the first gap (between the first and second lantern). Then the condition for that gap is 5. Also, if there's a lantern at 10, then we don't have a gap from 0 to 10 because the next lantern is at 10. Then the condition for the gap between 0 and 10 is 5, and then the next lantern at 10 must cover the rest.\n\n        But what if the lanterns are [0, 10] and l=15?\n          Condition1: 0\n          Condition2: 15-10 = 5\n          Condition3: (10-0)/2 = 5\n          Then ans = max(0,5,5)=5.\n\n        Now, with d=5, does it cover the entire street?\n          - First lantern (0): covers [-5,5] -> so from 0 to 5 is covered, but from 5 to 10: the second lantern at 10 must cover from 10-5=5 to 10+5=15. So indeed, the entire street [0,15] is covered.\n\n        Another example: [0, 10] and l=15: the entire street is [0,15]. The first lantern covers [0-5,0+5] = [-5,5] and the second lantern covers [5,15]. So they meet at 5.\n\n        But note: the condition for the gap was (10-0)/2 = 5, which is the same as the condition for the right side (15-10=5). So the maximum is 5.\n\n        However, what if the street is [0, 10] and l=12? Then:\n          Condition1: 0\n          Condition2: 12-10=2\n          Condition3: (10-0)/2=5\n          Then answer=5.\n\n        With d=5, the first lantern covers [0,5] and the second lantern covers [5,15] which covers [5,12]. So yes.\n\n        But what if we set d=2? Then the first lantern covers [-3,2] and the second lantern covers [8,12]. The gap from 2 to 8 is not covered. So d must be at least 5.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          # If there are no lanterns, then n==0, but the problem says n>=1 so we skip.\n\n          # Condition 1: left gap\n          left_gap = a[0]  # d must be at least this to cover from 0 to a[0]\n\n          # Condition 2: right gap\n          right_gap = l - a[-1]\n\n          # Condition 3: gaps between consecutive lanterns\n          mid_gap = 0.0\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n              # The required d for this gap is gap/2, but we are looking for the maximum required d for any gap\n              if gap > 2 * mid_gap:  # mid_gap is the current maximum required d for a gap (which is half the gap)\n                  mid_gap = gap / 2.0\n\n          # But note: mid_gap might be zero initially, so we take the maximum of the three.\n\n          ans = max(left_gap, right_gap, mid_gap)\n\n        However, wait: what if there is only one lantern? Then the loop for mid_gap does nothing, so mid_gap remains 0.0.\n\n        Example: n=1, l=10, a=[5]\n          left_gap = 5\n          right_gap = 10-5 = 5\n          mid_gap = 0.0\n          ans = 5.0\n\n        Correct: the lantern must cover from 0 to 10. The distance from 5 to 0 is 5, and from 5 to 10 is 5. So d must be at least 5.\n\n        But wait: the lantern at 5 with d=5 covers [0,10] exactly. So yes.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the gap between consecutive lanterns is not applied when there's only one lantern, and that's okay because we have the left and right conditions.\n\n        But wait: the condition for the gap between consecutive lanterns is not just the maximum of the gaps/2, but we must also consider that the lanterns are placed arbitrarily. The above conditions (left_gap, right_gap, and the maximum gap/2) are independent and together they form the necessary conditions.\n\n        However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: Input \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n          Sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n          left_gap = 0\n          right_gap = 15-15 = 0\n          mid_gap = max( (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2 )\n                   = max(1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 0.5) = 2.5\n\n          ans = 2.5 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: Input \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n          Sorted: [2,5]\n          left_gap = 2\n          right_gap = 5-5=0\n          mid_gap = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n          ans = max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example input is provided as two separate examples. But note the sample input format:\n\n          The example input is given as:\n          ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n        But in code, we read one line for n and l, and the next line for the list.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the ends. Our conditions account for that.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the above conditions for the gaps between consecutive lanterns are based on the requirement that the two adjacent lanterns must cover the entire gap. But note that if two lanterns are very far apart, the condition is gap/2. However, if the gap is negative? No, because we sort.\n\n        But wait: what if the street has length l, and the lanterns are not sorted? We sort them.\n\n        One more edge: what if the first lantern is at 0 and the last at l? Then left_gap=0, right_gap=0, and the gaps in the middle might be large. That's handled.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the left_gap is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. Similarly, the condition for the right_gap is the distance from the last lantern to l.\n\n        But what if the first lantern is beyond 0? Actually, the problem states: the street is from 0 to l, and the lanterns are at ai (0<=ai<=l). So the first lantern is at least 0.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Steps:\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          a.sort()\n          if n == 1:\n              # Then we have one lantern. Conditions: left_gap = a[0], right_gap = l - a[0], mid_gap=0.\n              # Actually, we can do the same: left_gap = a[0], right_gap = l - a[0], and no mid_gap (so mid_gap=0).\n              # Then ans = max(a[0], l - a[0])\n              # But note: the above general code already handles n>=1. For n=1, the loop for mid_gap runs from 1 to 0 (range(1,1) -> no iteration) so mid_gap remains 0.0.\n              # So we don't need a special case.\n              pass\n\n        Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        left_gap = a[0]\n        right_gap = l - a[-1]\n\n        mid_gap = 0.0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # We can also compute the required d for this gap as gap/2.0, and we take the maximum.\n            if gap / 2.0 > mid_gap:\n                mid_gap = gap / 2.0\n\n        ans = max(left_gap, right_gap, mid_gap)\n\n        But wait: what if there are duplicate lanterns? For example, two lanterns at the same point. Then gap = 0, so mid_gap won't be updated for that gap, which is correct because 0/2=0 and we are taking max.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the gaps is that the entire street is covered. Duplicate lanterns don't change the coverage (unless they help in covering the gaps, but if they are at the same point, then the gap between two consecutive duplicates is 0, so no problem).\n\n        But wait: what if the street is [0, 10] and we have two lanterns at 5? Then the gaps are [0,5] and [5,10]. \n          left_gap = 5, right_gap=5, mid_gap = (5-0)/2 = 2.5, and (10-5)/2=2.5 -> then ans=5.\n\n        However, with two lanterns at 5, the coverage is from 5-d to 5+d. We require to cover [0,10]. So we need 5-d<=0 and 5+d>=10 -> d>=5. So the answer is 5.\n\n        Our code gives 5. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: the gap between the two lanterns at 5 is 0, so that doesn't affect the mid_gap.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\"\n\n        We are using floating point numbers. We must output with 10 decimal places.\n\n        Format the answer as: \"{:.10f}\".format(ans)\n\n        However, there is a possibility that the maximum of the three conditions is an integer, but we output as float.\n\n        Example: n=2, l=5, [2,5] -> 2.0 -> formatted as \"2.0000000000\"\n\n        Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: Input \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\" -> 2.5\n        Example 2: Input \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> 2.0\n\n        But note: the example input is given as two separate lines, but the problem says the first line contains n and l, the next line contains the n integers.\n\n        However, the sample input is provided as two strings in a list? Actually, the problem says:\n\n          Input\n          The first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n        And the example input is:\n\n          ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n        But note: the problem says the next line (the second line) contains n integers. So we must read the entire next line.\n\n        However, the sample input has two test cases? Actually, the problem is competitive programming and the input is standard. The example input is shown as two separate examples, but the actual input is one test case at a time.\n\n        But the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the example input. So we assume one test case per run.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the input is from stdin. We read the first line, then the second line.\n\n        Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        But wait: what if the input has more than one test case? The problem says: \"The first line contains ...\" and then the next line. It doesn't specify multiple test cases.\n\n        According to the problem, it's a single test case.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        Then process.\n\n        But note: the constraints say n>=1, so we don't need to worry about empty list.\n\n        Let me run the code on the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n          Input: \"7 15\" and then \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n          After sorting: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n          left_gap = 0\n          right_gap = 0\n          mid_gap = max( (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2 ) = 2.5\n          ans = 2.5\n\n        Example 2:\n          Input: \"2 5\" and then \"2 5\"\n          [2,5] -> sorted is [2,5]\n          left_gap = 2\n          right_gap = 0\n          mid_gap = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n          ans = 2.0\n\n        However, wait: why in example2 the mid_gap is 1.5, but then the answer is 2.0? Because the left_gap is 2, which is greater than 1.5.\n\n        But wait: the condition for the left_gap is 2, and the gap condition is 1.5, so the maximum is 2.\n\n        But is d=2 sufficient for example2?\n\n          The street is from 0 to 5.\n          Lantern at 2: covers [0,4] (because 2-2=0, 2+2=4)\n          Lantern at 5: covers [3,7] (but the street ends at 5, so [3,5] is enough)\n\n          The entire street: [0,5] must be covered. From 0 to 4 is covered by the first, and from 4 to 5: the first lantern doesn't cover beyond 4, but the second lantern starts at 3 and goes to 7, so it covers [3,5]. The point 4.5 is covered by the second lantern? Actually, the second lantern at 5 with d=2 covers from 3 to 7. So the entire street is [0,5] and we have [0,4] and [3,5] which together cover [0,5] (because 4>=3, so the gap from 3 to 4 is covered by both).\n\n        However, wait: the condition for the gap between 2 and 5 is that the two lanterns must cover the entire gap. The gap is from 2 to 5. The first lantern extends to 4, and the second lantern starts at 3. So the gap is covered. But note: the condition we used was (5-2)/2 = 1.5. However, the minimal d for the gap is 1.5, but then the entire street requires 2 because the left part (from 0 to 2) requires d>=2. \n\n        Therefore, the conditions are independent: we must satisfy all three. The answer is the maximum of the three.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a gap in the middle that requires 1.5, but the left part requires 2. Then we set d=2, which is more than 1.5, so the gap is covered (because 2>1.5). Similarly, if we set d=1.5, the left part (from 0 to 2) is only covered up to 2-1.5=0.5 (so [0.5, 3.5] for the first lantern) and then the gap from 0 to 0.5 is not covered? Actually, no: the first lantern at 2 with d=1.5 covers [0.5, 3.5]. Then the point 0 is not covered. Therefore, the condition for the left part is independent.\n\n        So the three conditions must hold simultaneously, and the minimal d that satisfies all is the maximum of the three.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        left_gap = a[0]\n        right_gap = l - a[-1]\n\n        mid_gap = 0.0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            if gap > 2 * mid_gap:   # This is equivalent to (gap/2) > mid_gap, but avoids floating point in the condition?\n                mid_gap = gap / 2.0\n\n        ans = max(left_gap, right_gap, mid_gap)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n        However, wait: the condition in the for-loop can be written without floating point until the end. We can use:\n\n        mid_gap = max(mid_gap, (a[i]-a[i-1])/2.0)\n\n        But the above is also fine.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid floating point until the max, but that's not necessary.\n\n        Let me test with integer inputs and see if there is precision issue.\n\n        Example: gap=1 -> mid_gap=0.5, then we compare with next gap=2 -> mid_gap=1.0, then gap=3 -> mid_gap=1.5, etc.\n\n        But the problem says the answer must have an absolute or relative error <= 1e-9.\n\n        Using floating point division is acceptable because the numbers are integers and the operations are exact until the representation limit (which for numbers up to 10^9 and 1000 elements is safe).\n\n        However, there is an alternative: we can use rational numbers, but Python floats are double precision and should be enough.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints: l up to 10^9, and n up to 1000. The gaps are differences of integers, so they are integers. Then (gap/2) is either integer or half-integer, which is representable exactly in binary floating point? \n\n        However, note: 10^9 is within the range of exact representation for integers and halves. But even if we have very large gaps, the floating point should handle the division by 2.\n\n        Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n        Let me test with the example that has a gap of 1: \n          n=2, l=3, a=[1,2]\n          left_gap=1, right_gap=1, mid_gap=(2-1)/2=0.5\n          ans = 1.0\n\n        Is that correct?\n          The street is [0,3].\n          First lantern at 1: with d=1, covers [0,2]\n          Second lantern at 2: with d=1, covers [1,3]\n          Together, [0,2] ∪ [1,3] = [0,3] -> correct.\n\n        Another example: n=2, l=4, a=[1,3]\n          left_gap=1, right_gap=1, mid_gap=(3-1)/2=1.0\n          ans=1.0\n\n        Check: \n          First lantern at 1: [0,2]\n          Second lantern at 3: [2,4]\n          Together [0,4] -> correct.\n\n        But wait: the condition for the gap is (3-1)/2=1.0, and the left_gap is 1, so the maximum is 1.0.\n\n        Now, what if we set d=0.9? Then:\n          First lantern: [0.1, 1.9] -> does not cover 0 (since 0<0.1) -> fails.\n\n        So the condition for the left_gap is 1.0, so d must be at least 1.0.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: there is an alternative solution that considers the entire coverage by simulating the coverage. But the above method is simpler and efficient.\n\n        I'll submit the code.\n\n        But wait: what if the street is not symmetric? For example, the lanterns are all at the beginning. Then the condition is dominated by the right_gap.\n\n        Example: n=1, l=100, a=[0]\n          left_gap=0, right_gap=100, mid_gap=0 -> ans=100.0\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Another example: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]\n          left_gap=0, right_gap=0, mid_gap = max((5-0)/2, (10-5)/2) = max(2.5, 2.5)=2.5\n          ans=2.5\n\n        Check: \n          d=2.5\n          First lantern at 0: [-2.5,2.5] -> covers [0,2.5] (since the street starts at 0)\n          Second lantern at 5: [2.5,7.5] -> meets the first at 2.5\n          Third lantern at 10: [7.5,12.5] -> meets the second at 7.5\n          Entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        However, wait: the second lantern at 5 covers from 5-2.5=2.5 to 5+2.5=7.5. The third lantern at 10 covers from 10-2.5=7.5 to 12.5. So the entire street is [0,10] and we have [0,2.5] ∪ [2.5,7.5] ∪ [7.5,10] -> covered.\n\n        But note: the condition for the gap between 0 and 5 is (5-0)/2=2.5, and for the gap between 5 and 10 is (10-5)/2=2.5. So the maximum is 2.5.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        left_gap = a[0]\n        right_gap = l - a[-1]\n\n        mid",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are placed at specific positions along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to cover the entire street from point 0 to point `l` using the minimal `d`. The solution involves checking three main conditions:\n   - **Left Gap**: The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The lantern must extend far enough to cover this gap, so `d` must be at least the position of the first lantern.\n   - **Right Gap**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`). Similarly, `d` must be at least this distance to ensure coverage up to `l`.\n   - **Middle Gaps**: For any two consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined illumination. The minimal `d` required here is half the distance between the two lanterns.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to easily compute gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - **Gap Calculation**: Compute the left gap, right gap, and the maximum middle gap (half the largest distance between consecutive lanterns).\n   - **Result Determination**: The answer is the maximum value among the left gap, right gap, and the largest middle gap. This ensures all parts of the street are covered.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the list of lantern positions takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of lanterns. Calculating the gaps is O(n) since we iterate through the sorted list once. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n log n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    left_gap = a[0]\n    right_gap = l - a[-1]\n    \n    mid_gap = 0.0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        required = gap / 2.0\n        if required > mid_gap:\n            mid_gap = required\n            \n    ans = max(left_gap, right_gap, mid_gap)\n    \n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in order from left to right.\n3. **Left and Right Gaps**: The left gap is the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The right gap is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`).\n4. **Middle Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The required `d` to cover this gap is half the gap distance. The largest such value across all gaps is stored.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal `d` needed to cover the entire street is the maximum value among the left gap, right gap, and the largest middle gap.\n6. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all segments of the street are covered by the lanterns' illumination with the minimal required radius `d`.",
