He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string only contains 'a', 'b', 'c'\n Steps:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends 'c' so there might be no 'c'? Actually, the problem says C appends some number of 'c'. But note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. So if there are no 'c', then it's not possible? However, note that the original string from A and B has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends at least one 'c'? Actually, the problem says \"some number\", which can be zero? But wait, the condition says \"equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\", and if C appends zero, then we require 0 = count('a') or 0 = count('b'). But the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B). So zero 'c' would fail because 0 != count('a') (which is at least 1) and 0 != count('b') (which is at least 1). Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: 'aabc' -> Output: 'YES'\n\n Let's break down the example 'aabc':\n   It has: \n      a: 2, b: 1, c: 1\n\n Condition: the number of 'c' (which is 1) must be equal to the number of 'a' (2) OR the number of 'b' (1). \n   Here, 1 == 1 (so equal to the number of 'b') -> condition holds.\n\n But what about the order?\n According to the problem:\n   - A gives a string of some number of 'a's.\n   - B appends some number of 'b's to the end.\n   - C appends some number of 'c's to the end.\n\n So the string must be in the form: [some 'a's] [some 'b's] [some 'c's]\n\n However, note that the example 'bbacc' is \"NO\". Why?\n   The string is 'bbacc': \n        Count: a:1, b:2, c:2.\n        Condition: the number of 'c' (2) is equal to either the number of 'a' (1) or the number of 'b' (2) -> yes, it equals the number of 'b'.\n        But the order: \n            The first part is supposed to be only 'a's (but here we see two 'b's at the beginning) -> invalid.\n\n Therefore, the conditions are:\n   Condition 1: The string must be non-decreasing in the sense that:\n        All the 'a's (if any) must come first, then all the 'b's (if any), then all the 'c's (if any).\n\n   Condition 2: There must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' (so the string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n   Condition 3: The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's.\n\n However, note: the problem does not explicitly say that the entire string must be divided into three contiguous parts (only that A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's). So the string should not have any 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', and similarly no 'b' after a 'c'.\n\n Steps for solution:\n   Step 1: Check if the string is composed of a contiguous block of 'a's (possibly empty? but note condition: at least one 'a' from A) then contiguous block of 'b's (at least one from B) and then contiguous block of 'c's (from C). Also, note that the problem states that the initial string (from A) has at least one 'a' and B appends at least one 'b'. So we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\n   Step 2: Count the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\n   Step 3: Check the order: \n        Traverse the string and make sure that we don't see an 'a' after a non-'a', or a 'b' after a non-'b' (non-'b' meaning either 'a' or 'c')? Actually, we want the string to be in the form: [a...a][b...b][c...c].\n\n   Alternatively, we can check:\n        The string should not contain the substring \"ba\", \"bc\", or \"cb\" (because if we have a 'b' followed by an 'a', that breaks the contiguous a's then b's). Similarly, we should not have a 'c' followed by an 'a' or 'b'. \n\n   However, note: the string must be split into three segments. So we can also check:\n\n        Let i = 0\n        While i < len(S) and S[i]=='a': i++\n        Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='b': i++\n        Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='c': i++\n\n        And if we traverse the whole string, then the order is correct.\n\n   But note: there might be no 'b' or no 'c'? Actually, we know from the problem that there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then the process by C appends 'c's (which could be zero, but we saw that zero is not allowed because the count condition fails). However, the problem states that the string we have is the result after C appended. So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and then the 'c's are appended so they are at the end.\n\n   But wait: the problem says that the string is given to C and he appends some number of 'c's. So the original string (without C's appending) must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends. So the final string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and the appended 'c's (which could be zero, but then condition fails). However, note: the problem states that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. So if the original string (without C) is, say, \"ab\", then the number of 'a' is 1 and 'b' is 1. Then C appends either 1 or 1 'c's. So the string becomes \"abc\" (if he appends 1) or \"ab\" (if he appends 0). But appending 0 is not allowed by the condition (unless the condition is satisfied by 0 being equal to one of them, but 0 != 1 and 0 != 1). So actually, the string without C's appending must have at least one 'a' and one 'b', and then C appends at least one 'c'? Not necessarily: the condition is on the entire string (after C appends). So when C appends, the entire string is considered for the counts.\n\n   Clarification: When C appends, the string already has the 'a's and 'b's (from A and B). Then C appends k 'c's (k is either the total number of 'a's in the entire new string or the total number of 'b's). But note: the entire new string includes the 'c's. So the condition is: \n        Let n = total length, and let \n        count_a = number of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as the original from A, because C only appends 'c')\n        count_b = number of 'b' in the entire string (same as B's appended, because C doesn't remove any)\n        count_c = number of 'c' (which is k)\n\n        Then k must be equal to count_a OR k must be equal to count_b.\n\n   But note: the entire string includes the 'c's. So if C appends k 'c's, then the total count of 'c' is k, and the total count of 'a' is the original a's (say x) and the total count of 'b' is the original b's (say y). Then the condition is: k = x OR k = y.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify whether the counts are taken from the entire string (including the 'c's). Since the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\", and the string now includes the 'c's, so yes, the entire string's count for 'a' and 'b' is fixed (because C only adds 'c's, so the 'a' and 'b' counts remain the same as in the string before C's appending). \n\n   But wait: the problem says \"in the string\" (meaning the entire string) when referring to the number of 'a' and 'b'. So the entire string's 'a' count is the same as the original (from A) because B and C don't add 'a' or change existing ones. Similarly for 'b': only B added and they were appended, and C didn't add any. So the condition is: \n        Let total_a = count of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as the original from A)\n        Let total_b = count of 'b' in the entire string (which is the same as the original from B, plus possibly none if B appended zero? But the problem says B appends some number, and since they made sure there is at least one 'b', then total_b>=1)\n        Let total_c = count of 'c' in the entire string (which is the number C appended)\n\n        Then we require: total_c == total_a OR total_c == total_b.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"B appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string\" (from A). So the original from A is just a's. Then B appends b's. Then C appends c's. So the entire string's a's are only from A, and the entire string's b's are from B, and the entire string's c's are from C.\n\n   But the condition says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string\". The entire string's 'a' is the same as the original from A (because no change) and the entire string's 'b' is the same as the original from B (because no change). So we can compute:\n\n        total_a = count of 'a' in S\n        total_b = count of 'b' in S\n        total_c = count of 'c' in S\n\n        Condition: total_c == total_a or total_c == total_b\n\n   However, we must also check the order.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: 'aaabccc'\n        total_a = 3, total_b = 1, total_c = 3 -> condition: 3==3 (total_a) -> YES.\n\n        Input: 'bbacc'\n        total_a = 1, total_b = 2, total_c = 2 -> condition: 2==2 (total_b) -> satisfies condition, but the order is wrong (we have 'b' then 'a' then 'c') -> NO.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Check the order: \n                Let s = given string.\n                If the string has a 'b' and then a 'a' (i.e., substring \"ba\") or a 'c' and then a 'b' (substring \"cb\") or a 'c' and then a 'a' (substring \"ca\"), then it's invalid.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            found_b = False\n            found_c = False\n            for char in s:\n                if char == 'a':\n                    # if we have already seen a 'b' or 'c', then it's invalid because 'a' should not appear after non-'a'\n                    if found_b or found_c:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n                elif char == 'b':\n                    if found_c:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n                    found_b = True\n                else: # char == 'c'\n                    found_c = True\n\n            But wait: what if we have only a's and then b's? Then we set found_b to True, and then when we see a 'c', we set found_c to True. Then if we see an 'a' later, that would trigger the condition. But note: we break the string into three contiguous parts.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            index_a_end = s.find('b')   # the point where the a's end and b's begin? Actually, we want to know if there's a non-'a' then we switch to b's.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n            We traverse and mark:\n                state = 0   # expecting 'a'\n                state = 1   # expecting 'b'\n                state = 2   # expecting 'c'\n\n            We start at state0, then when we see an 'a', stay in state0 until we see a 'b' then move to state1, then when we see a 'c', move to state2.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                state = 0\n                for char in s:\n                    if state == 0:\n                        if char == 'a':\n                            continue\n                        elif char == 'b':\n                            state = 1\n                        else: # 'c'\n                            # In state0, we shouldn't have a 'c' because we haven't seen any 'b' yet and the 'c's are at the end.\n                            # So if we see a 'c' in state0, then it's invalid because we haven't finished the 'a's and 'b's.\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            exit(0)\n\n                    elif state == 1:\n                        if char == 'b':\n                            continue\n                        elif char == 'a':\n                            # This is invalid because we are in state1 (after having seen a 'b') and now we see an 'a'\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            exit(0)\n                        else: # 'c'\n                            state = 2\n\n                    else: # state == 2\n                        if char != 'c':\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            exit(0)\n\n            After traversing, we must have seen at least one 'a' and one 'b'. However, note the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B). So if we never see a 'b' (state1) then we didn't have any B part? Actually, the problem states that B appends some number (so at least one) of 'b's. Therefore, we must have encountered at least one 'b' (so state1 must have been entered). Similarly, we must have at least one 'a' (so state0 must have been entered and we saw at least one 'a').\n\n        However, note: what if the string ends with a transition from 'b' to 'c'? That is handled.\n\n        But note: the above state machine does not account for the possibility that there might be no 'b' at all? Then we never enter state1 and we see a 'c' in state0. Similarly, what if the string has no 'c'? Then state2 is never entered, but that's okay.\n\n        But the problem condition says: C appends some number of 'c's. The problem says \"some number\", which could be zero? However, the condition then requires that the number of 'c' (which is zero) equals the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. And we know the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So zero is not equal to (at least 1) for both. So zero is invalid. However, our state machine allows no 'c' (state remains 0 or 1). But then the condition on counts will fail. So we don't need to enforce the presence of 'c' in the state machine? Actually, the condition on counts requires that the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. So if the string has no 'c', then the condition is not satisfied (unless the number of 'a' is 0 or the number of 'b' is 0, but we know the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Check the order with the state machine above.\n\n            Step 2: Count the total number of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\n            Step 3: Check that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b' (if not, then NO). Actually, the problem requires that the original string from A and B has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends. So the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So if there's no 'a' or no 'b', then NO.\n\n            Step 4: Check that the count of 'c' is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n        However, note: the state machine already ensures that the string is in the form [a...][b...][c...] (if the order is correct). But the problem does not require the entire string to be divided into these three parts if there are no 'b' or no 'c'? \n\n        Actually, the problem says:\n            A: string of some number (at least one) of 'a'\n            B: appends some number (at least one) of 'b'\n            C: appends some number (which is either the total 'a' or total 'b') of 'c'\n\n        So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and then the 'c' part (which is at least 0, but condition forces at least min(count_a, count_b) ? Not necessarily, but the condition is that the count of 'c' must be one of the two counts.\n\n        But note: the entire string's count of 'a' is the same as the original from A (since B and C don't change 'a'), and similarly for 'b'. \n\n        However, the state machine we built above does not allow the string to have an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c', etc. So if the order is broken, we output NO.\n\n        Example: \n            Input: 'aabc' -> \n                state0: \n                    'a' -> ok\n                    'a' -> ok\n                    'b' -> state1\n                    'c' -> state2 -> then we finish.\n                Counts: a=2, b=1, c=1 -> condition: 1==2 (no) or 1==1 (yes) -> YES.\n\n            Input: 'bbacc' -> \n                state0: \n                    first char 'b' -> in state0, we don't allow 'b' or 'c', so we break and say NO.\n\n        Another example: 'abc' -> \n            state0: 'a' -> ok, then 'b' -> state1, then 'c' -> state2 -> valid.\n            Counts: a=1, b=1, c=1 -> condition: 1==1 or 1==1 -> YES.\n\n        Example: 'abbccc' -> \n            state0: 'a' -> ok, then 'b' -> state1, then two 'b's, then three 'c's -> valid.\n            Counts: a=1, b=2, c=3 -> condition: 3==1 (no) or 3==2 (no) -> NO.\n\n        Example: 'aabbcc' -> \n            state0: two 'a's -> then two 'b's -> then two 'c's -> valid.\n            Counts: a=2, b=2, c=2 -> condition: 2==2 (for a) -> YES.\n\n        Example: 'aabbc' -> \n            state0: two 'a's, then two 'b's, then one 'c' -> valid.\n            Counts: a=2, b=2, c=1 -> condition: 1==2 (no) or 1==2 (no) -> NO.\n\n        Example: 'aabbcc' is YES.\n\n        But wait, the example input provided: \n            Input: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n            Expected: ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n        Our method:\n            'aaabccc': \n                state0: three 'a's -> ok\n                then one 'b' -> state1\n                then three 'c's -> state2 -> valid.\n                Counts: a=3, b=1, c=3 -> 3==3 (for a) -> YES.\n\n            'bbacc': \n                First char is 'b' in state0 -> invalid -> NO.\n\n            'aabc': \n                state0: two 'a's -> then one 'b' -> state1, then one 'c' -> state2 -> valid.\n                Counts: a=2, b=1, c=1 -> 1==1 (for b) -> YES.\n\n        However, note: the example input 'aabc' has a=2, b=1, c=1 -> condition is satisfied.\n\n        But what about a string like 'acb'? \n            state0: first char 'a' -> ok, then 'c' in state0 -> invalid -> NO.\n\n        Another example: 'abb' -> \n            state0: first char 'a' -> ok, then two 'b's -> state1 -> then no more. Valid.\n            Counts: a=1, b=2, c=0 -> condition: 0==1 (no) or 0==2 (no) -> NO.\n\n        But note: the problem says C appends some number of 'c's. The condition is that the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. Since the string 'abb' has no 'c', the condition is not satisfied. So NO is correct.\n\n        However, what if the string is 'ab'? \n            state0: 'a' -> ok, then 'b' -> state1 -> valid.\n            Counts: a=1, b=1, c=0 -> condition fails -> NO.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the string must be obtained by:\n            A gives a string of 'a's (at least one) -> so 'a'\n            B appends some number of 'b's (at least one) -> so 'a' + 'b' -> \"ab\"\n            Then C appends some number of 'c's (which must be equal to the number of 'a' (1) or the number of 'b' (1)). But if C appends 0, then the string is \"ab\", and 0 is not equal to 1. So the condition is not satisfied.\n\n        Therefore, we must check the condition on counts.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string\". The problem does not say that the string must have the 'c's, but the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. In the case of \"ab\", the number of 'c' is 0, which is not equal to 1 (the number of 'a') nor 1 (the number of 'b'). So \"ab\" is not valid.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.\" So the condition is satisfied if at least one of them holds.\n\n        However, the problem does not require that C appends a positive number of 'c's? The problem says \"appends some number\", and \"some number\" can be zero. But then the condition requires that zero equals the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. Since the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b', the condition fails. So no string without 'c' is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the steps:\n\n            Read the string S.\n\n            Step 1: Check the order using the state machine (or by ensuring the string is of the form: all 'a's (if any) then all 'b's (if any) then all 'c's (if any)).\n\n            Step 2: Count the frequency of 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n            Step 3: Check that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. (But note: the problem says A and B each contribute at least one, so the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.)\n\n            Step 4: Check that the count of 'c' is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n            However, note: the state machine already requires that if there's a 'b', then we must have at least one 'a' (because we start with 'a' and then see a 'b')? Actually, the state machine doesn't require that we have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. For example, if the string is \"bbb\", then:\n\n                state0: first char is 'b' -> invalid.\n\n            So the state machine will catch that we don't have the 'a' part. Similarly, if the string is \"aaa\", then:\n\n                state0: three 'a's -> then no further. Then we never see a 'b'. But the problem requires that B appends at least one 'b'. So we must have at least one 'b'. \n\n            Therefore, we must also check that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n            But note: the problem says that the string is obtained by A (at least one 'a'), then B (at least one 'b'), then C (any number of 'c's). So the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n            However, the state machine might not catch if we have no 'b' because we break at the first non-'a'. So we must ensure that after the state machine we have encountered at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n            Actually, the state machine:\n\n                We start at state0, and we require that if we see a 'b' we switch to state1, and then we require that if we see a 'c' we switch to state2.\n\n                Conditions for the entire string to be valid:\n\n                    - The string must be non-empty and the first character must be 'a' (if there is at least one 'a')? Actually, no: the string might not have any 'a'? But the problem says A gives a string of some number of 'a's (at least one). So the entire string must have at least one 'a'.\n\n                Therefore, we can break the problem into:\n\n                    Condition 1: The string must be in the form [a...][b...][c...] (with the three parts being contiguous and in that order). Additionally, the first part (a's) must exist (at least one) and the second part (b's) must exist (at least one). The third part (c's) may be absent.\n\n                    Condition 2: The count of 'c' (if present) is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n            However, note: the problem does not require that the entire string must have the three parts (if there are no 'c's, then the third part is absent). But the condition on counts requires that the number of 'c' is one of the two. So if there are no 'c's, then the condition fails (unless the number of 'a' is 0 or the number of 'b' is 0, but we know there's at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            Step 1: Check the order and that we have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (we can do this during the state machine or separately).\n\n            We can do:\n\n                a_exists = False\n                b_exists = False\n                c_exists = False\n\n                state = 0\n\n                for char in S:\n                    if state == 0:\n                        if char == 'a':\n                            a_exists = True\n                        elif char == 'b':\n                            if not a_exists:\n                                # We are seeing a 'b' without having seen an 'a'. But the problem says A gives at least one 'a'. So this is invalid.\n                                print(\"NO\")\n                                return\n                            state = 1\n                            b_exists = True\n                        elif char == 'c':\n                            # In state0, we haven't seen any 'b' yet, so we shouldn't see a 'c'\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            return\n\n                    elif state == 1:\n                        if char == 'b':\n                            continue\n                        elif char == 'a':\n                            # We are in the 'b' part and we see an 'a' -> invalid\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            return\n                        else: # 'c'\n                            state = 2\n                            c_exists = True\n\n                    else: # state == 2\n                        if char != 'c':\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            return\n\n                # After processing, we must have a_exists and b_exists (at least one 'a' and one 'b')\n                if not a_exists or not b_exists:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n                # Now, count the number of 'a', 'b', 'c'\n                count_a = S.count('a')\n                count_b = S.count('b')\n                count_c = S.count('c')\n\n                if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"a\"? \n            Then: \n                state0: 'a' -> a_exists becomes True.\n                Then loop ends. Then we check: a_exists is True, b_exists is False -> so we print \"NO\".\n\n        Similarly, string \"b\": \n            state0: first char is 'b' -> we check: if char=='b', then we require that a_exists is True (which is not) -> so we print \"NO\".\n\n        String \"c\":\n            state0: 'c' -> invalid -> \"NO\"\n\n        String \"ac\": \n            state0: 'a' -> ok, then next char 'c' -> in state0, we don't allow 'c' -> \"NO\"\n\n        String \"ba\": \n            state0: first char 'b' -> requires a_exists is True -> but a_exists is still False -> \"NO\"\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: the state machine above does not reset the counts. We are counting the entire string's a, b, c separately. That's okay.\n\n        But note: the condition for the state machine in state0 for 'b' requires that we have seen at least one 'a'. We set a_exists to True only when we see an 'a'. So if the first character is 'b', we break because a_exists is False. Similarly, if the first character is 'c', we break.\n\n        One more example: \"aaabbbccc\" -> \n            a_exists becomes True at first 'a'\n            Then we see three 'a's -> state remains 0.\n            Then we see three 'b's -> state becomes 1, and b_exists becomes True.\n            Then three 'c's -> state becomes 2, and c_exists becomes True.\n\n            Then we check: a_exists and b_exists are True -> then we check counts: \n                count_a = 3, count_b=3, count_c=3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaabccc\" (from the example) -> \n            a_exists: True\n            Then three 'a's, then one 'b' -> state1, b_exists=True\n            Then three 'c's -> state2, c_exists=True.\n\n            Counts: a=3, b=1, c=3 -> condition: 3==3 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aabc\" (example) -> \n            a_exists: True\n            Then two 'a's, then one 'b' -> state1, b_exists=True\n            Then one 'c' -> state2, c_exists=True.\n            Counts: a=2, b=1, c=1 -> condition: 1==2 (no) or 1==1 (yes) -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"abbccc\" (a=1, b=2, c=3) -> \n            state0: 'a' -> a_exists=True\n            then two 'b's -> state1, b_exists=True\n            then three 'c's -> state2, c_exists=True.\n            Counts: a=1, b=2, c=3 -> 3==1 (no) or 3==2 (no) -> NO.\n\n        But wait: the example input did not include this, but according to the problem, this should be NO.\n\n        However, the example input was ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'].\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        We'll code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require that the entire string must be processed by the state machine and then we check the counts.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: A provides a string of 'a's (at least one), B appends some 'b's (at least one) to the end, and C appends some 'c's (the number of which must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the entire string). The solution involves checking two main conditions: the string must follow the correct order of characters (all 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's), and the count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Character Order**: The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and then one or more 'c's (or no 'c's at all). Any deviation from this order (like an 'a' after a 'b' or 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Validation**: After verifying the order, count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string. Additionally, the string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nif s == \"\":\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\na_exists = False\nb_exists = False\nstate = 0   # 0: waiting for 'a', 1: waiting for 'b', 2: waiting for 'c'\n\nfor char in s:\n    if state == 0:\n        if char == 'a':\n            a_exists = True\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if not a_exists:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n            state = 1\n            b_exists = True\n        elif char == 'c':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n    elif state == 1:\n        if char == 'b':\n            continue\n        elif char == 'a':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n        else:  # char == 'c'\n            state = 2\n    else:  # state == 2\n        if char != 'c':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\nif not a_exists or not b_exists:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The code first checks if the input string is empty, in which case it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n2. **Character Order Verification**: The code processes each character in the string, ensuring they follow the sequence 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. If any character violates this sequence (like a 'b' before an 'a' or a 'c' before a 'b'), the code outputs \"NO\" and exits.\n3. **Presence of 'a' and 'b'**: After processing all characters, the code checks if at least one 'a' and one 'b' were found. If not, it outputs \"NO\".\n4. **Count Validation**: The code counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.
