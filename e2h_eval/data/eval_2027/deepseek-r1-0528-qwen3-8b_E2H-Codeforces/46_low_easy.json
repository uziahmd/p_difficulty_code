The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. So we can have a subsegment that is almost strictly increasing.\n\n Approach:\n We note that the entire sequence might be already strictly increasing, then we can change nothing and the answer is n.\n Otherwise, we are allowed to change one element. This means that in the subsegment, there can be at most one \"break\" (i.e., a violation of strictly increasing) and by changing one element we can fix that break.\n\n However, note: sometimes we don't need to fix a break because the element we change might not be adjacent to the break? Actually, we can change one element arbitrarily, so if there is exactly one index i such that a[i] >= a[i+1], then we can fix that by changing either a[i] or a[i+1] (or even an element elsewhere? But note: the problem requires that the entire subsegment becomes strictly increasing). However, note that we are only allowed one change.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute two arrays:\n    - left[i]: the length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending at i (without any change).\n    - right[j]: the length of the strictly increasing subsegment starting at j (without any change).\n\n 2. Then, we can consider three cases for the entire array:\n\n    Case 1: The entire array is strictly increasing -> answer = n.\n\n    Case 2: Consider the possibility that we change one element. We can try to merge two increasing sequences by removing one element in the middle.\n\n    Specifically, we can look for indices where the condition breaks (a[i] >= a[i+1]). Then, for each break at index i (meaning between i and i+1), we can consider:\n\n        candidate = left[i-1] + right[i+1]   (if we change the element at position i, then the segment from [start of right[i+1] to i-1] and [i+1 to end] would be connected)\n\n        But wait: actually, the break is between i and i+1, so the two segments are [left part ending at i] and [right part starting at i+1]. However, note that the element at i is included in the left part and the element at i+1 is included in the right part. If we change the element at i+1 (or the element at i) we might be able to connect the two.\n\n    Actually, we can change the element at i (the left element of the break) OR the element at i+1 (the right element). But note: we are allowed to change at most one number. So we must choose one element to change.\n\n    How about:\n\n        Option 1: Change the element at i (the one causing the break). Then the left part goes up to i (but note: the condition at i-1 and i must hold, and also the condition at i and i+1 must hold after change). However, we can set a new value for a[i] such that:\n            a[i-1] < a[i] (if i>0) and a[i] < a[i+1] (if i+1 exists). But note: we are considering the entire subsegment from the beginning of the left part to the end of the right part.\n\n        Similarly, Option 2: Change the element at i+1. Then we require a[i] < a[i+1] (with the changed value) and a[i+1] < a[i+2] (if it exists).\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require that the entire original subsegment is used without modification. We are allowed to choose any contiguous subsegment and change one number arbitrarily.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n    We can consider:\n\n        Let L[i] = length of longest increasing subsegment ending at i (without any change)\n        Let R[i] = length of longest increasing subsegment starting at i (without any change)\n\n    Then, we can consider:\n\n        For each index i (from 1 to n-2), if we want to consider a break between i and i+1, then we can form a segment that covers:\n\n            left_side = the increasing segment ending at i (so the last element is a[i])\n            right_side = the increasing segment starting at i+1 (so the first element is a[i+1])\n\n        Now, if we change the element at i+1, then we require that a[i] < x (where x is the new value) and also x must be less than the next element (if any) to keep the increasing property. However, we are free to choose x arbitrarily. But note: we want the entire segment from the start of the left_side to the end of the right_side to be strictly increasing.\n\n        Actually, the condition to merge the two parts is:\n\n            Condition for merging: \n                The left_side ends with a[i] and the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsegment of a sequence where, by changing at most one element, the subsegment becomes strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible subsegments and determining the optimal changes required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Increasing Segments**: \n   - **Left Array (L)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at each index `i`.\n   - **Right Array (R)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at each index `i`.\n\n2. **Check Entire Sequence**: \n   - If the entire sequence is already strictly increasing, the answer is simply the length of the sequence.\n\n3. **Identify Break Points**:\n   - Traverse the sequence to find indices where the sequence breaks the strictly increasing condition (i.e., `a[i] >= a[i+1]`).\n\n4. **Merge Segments Around Breaks**:\n   - For each break point, consider merging the left increasing segment ending before the break with the right increasing segment starting after the break. The merged segment's length is the sum of the lengths of these two segments plus one (accounting for the changed element).\n   - Ensure that the merged segment can be strictly increasing by verifying the necessary conditions around the break point.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Handle cases where the break is at the start or end of the sequence separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    L = [1] * n\n    R = [1] * n\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            L[i] = L[i-1] + 1\n            \n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i+1] > a[i]:\n            R[i] = R[i+1] + 1\n            \n    ans = max(L) if n > 1 else 1\n    \n    breaks = []\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        if a[i] >= a[i+1]:\n            breaks.append(i)\n            \n    for i in breaks:\n        total_length = L[i] + R[i+1]\n        candidate = total_length + 1\n        if i-1 >= 0 and i+2 < n:\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1] and a[i] < a[i+1]:\n                candidate = total_length + 1\n            elif a[i-1] < a[i+1] and a[i+1] < a[i+2]:\n                candidate = total_length + 1\n            elif a[i] < a[i+1] and a[i+1] < a[i+2]:\n                candidate = total_length + 1\n        elif i-1 >= 0:\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                candidate = total_length + 1\n        elif i+2 < n:\n            if a[i+1] < a[i+2]:\n                candidate = total_length + 1\n                \n        if candidate > ans:\n            ans = candidate\n            \n    for i in range(n):\n        if L[i] + 1 > ans:\n            ans = L[i] + 1\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the sequence has only one element, the answer is trivially 1.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: \n   - The `L` array is filled such that `L[i]` holds the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at index `i`.\n   - The `R` array is filled such that `R[i]` holds the length of the longest increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n4. **Initial Answer Check**: The initial answer is set to the maximum value in the `L` array, representing the longest increasing subsegment without any modifications.\n5. **Break Identification**: Identify indices where the sequence fails to be strictly increasing.\n6. **Merging Segments**: For each break point, calculate the potential length of the merged segment by considering the left and right increasing segments around the break. Adjust the candidate length based on the conditions that ensure the merged segment can be strictly increasing.\n7. **Final Answer**: The answer is updated if a longer valid segment is found during the break analysis. The solution also checks for segments that can be extended by modifying their endpoints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments that can be made strictly increasing with at most one modification, ensuring optimal performance even for large sequences.",
