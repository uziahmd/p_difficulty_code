Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements (which is also the length of the binary string for m)\n   an array a of n integers (a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1})\n   a string s of length n (without spaces) which is the binary representation of m (with no leading zeros, but note: the string might be given in big-endian? Actually, the problem says: \"the third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1 — the binary representation of number m\"\n\n However, note: the example input:\n      Input: \n        2\n        3 8\n        10\n\n      Here, n=2, array = [3,8], and the binary representation is \"10\", so m = 2 (since 1*2^1 + 0*2^0).\n\n But note the example: \n        In the first test case: m=2, then x can be 0 or 1. \n        f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 (because the 0-th bit is set, so we take a0).\n\n However, the example output is 3.\n\n But wait, the second example:\n\n        Input:\n          5\n          17 0 10 2 1\n          11010\n\n        Here, n=5, array = [17,0,10,2,1] and m is represented by \"11010\" (which is 16+8+0+2+0? Actually, let's convert: \n          \"11010\" has 5 bits: \n            bit0 (least significant) is the last digit: '0'\n            bit1: '1'\n            bit2: '0'\n            bit3: '1'\n            bit4: '1'\n\n        So m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n        Then the maximum value is 27, which is achieved at x=5 (binary 101) because:\n          x=5: bits set are the 0th and 2nd? But wait, the array indices correspond to the bit positions.\n\n        According to the problem, the function f(x) is defined as:\n          f(x) = sum_{i} [if the i-th bit of x is set then a_i else 0]\n\n        However, note that the array a is given as [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}], and the i-th element corresponds to the i-th bit.\n\n        But the binary representation of m is given as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. The problem states: \n          \"bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n        How is the i-th position defined? Typically, the least significant bit is the 0-th bit. However, the example input:\n\n          n=5, and the string is \"11010\"\n\n        This means the binary representation of m is 11010, which is 26. But note: the problem does not specify the order.\n\n        Let's read the problem again: \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n        And the example: \n          Input: \n             5\n             17 0 10 2 1\n             11010\n\n        In this example, the array a has 5 elements: a0 to a4.\n\n        The binary representation string has 5 characters: s0, s1, s2, s3, s4.\n\n        The problem does not explicitly say whether the string is given in big-endian (most significant bit first) or little-endian (least significant bit first). \n\n        However, note the example calculation: \n          m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0.\n\n        This implies that the first character (s0) is the most significant bit (2^(n-1))? Or wait: the string is of length n, and the example has n=5, then the exponents go from 4 down to 0.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Number m equals .\"\n\n        And the example: n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011) is written as having bits at positions 0,1,3.\n\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function \\( f(x) \\) sums elements of array \\( a \\) based on the bits set in \\( x \\). The challenge is to efficiently compute the maximum \\( f(x) \\) without checking every possible \\( x \\) up to \\( m \\), especially since \\( m \\) can be very large (up to \\( 2^{10^5} - 1 \\)).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal solution involves comparing each bit position from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). For each bit position, we decide whether setting it in \\( x \\) will contribute positively to \\( f(x) \\) while ensuring \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy approach:\n   - Convert the binary string of \\( m \\) into a list of bits for easier manipulation.\n   - Traverse the bits from the MSB to LSB. For each bit:\n     - If the current bit of \\( m \\) is 1, we can consider setting this bit in \\( x \\). However, we must check if setting this bit allows us to set all lower bits to maximize the sum. If yes, set the bit and add the corresponding \\( a_i \\) to the result; otherwise, skip it.\n     - If the current bit of \\( m \\) is 0, we cannot set this bit, so we simply move to the next bit without adding \\( a_i \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit of \\( m \\) exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of bits in \\( m \\). This is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    bin_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total_bits = len(bin_str)\n    if total_bits != n:\n        bin_str = bin_str.zfill(n)\n    \n    bits = list(map(int, bin_str))\n    res = 0\n    a_index = 0\n    \n    for i in range(total_bits - 1, -1, -1):\n        if bits[i] == 0:\n            continue\n        else:\n            rest_sum = sum(a_list[a_index:])\n            if rest_sum > 0:\n                res += a_list[a_index]\n                a_index += 1\n            else:\n                break\n    \n    print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n- **Handling Binary String**: The binary string is padded with leading zeros if necessary to ensure it has exactly \\( n \\) bits.\n- **Greedy Processing**: The algorithm processes each bit from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit set in \\( m \\), it checks if setting this bit in \\( x \\) allows maximizing the sum by considering all subsequent bits. If the sum of remaining elements is positive, it includes the current element; otherwise, it stops further processing.\n- **Output**: The maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the optimal \\( x \\) by leveraging bit manipulation and a greedy strategy, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
