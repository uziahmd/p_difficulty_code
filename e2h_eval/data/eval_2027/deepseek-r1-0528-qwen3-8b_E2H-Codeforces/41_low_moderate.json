There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: n, h, m and then m lines of [l, r, x]\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use dynamic programming or iterate over possibilities, but note that the restrictions might overlap.\n\n Idea:\n We have to assign a height for each spot from 0 to h (but note: we cannot exceed any restriction that covers that spot).\n\n However, note that the restrictions are given as: for a range [l_i, r_i] the maximum height must be <= x_i.\n\n We can think of it as: for each spot j, we must have height[j] <= min{ x_i | [l_i, r_i] contains j }.\n\n But note: multiple restrictions may apply to the same spot. So we can precompute for each spot j the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover j? However, wait: if there are two restrictions, one saying at most 5 and another saying at most 3, then the house must be <=3. So yes, we can define:\n\n   Let R[j] = min{ x_i : restriction i applies to spot j }\n\n But note: what if there's no restriction covering spot j? Then we can use up to h.\n\n However, caution: the problem says \"the tallest house in the range must be at most x_i\", so if no restriction, then the house can be up to h.\n\n But also note: the restrictions might not necessarily set an independent limit per house. The entire street has restrictions that might overlap arbitrarily.\n\n Alternate idea: since n, m are small (<=50), we can use DP with state as the current spot and remember which restrictions are still active? But that might be too heavy.\n\n Another idea: use the restrictions to form intervals and then combine them. However, note that the restrictions are independent and we are maximizing the sum of squares.\n\n Observation: the profit is the sum of squares. And we have constraints on contiguous intervals. This is similar to a constrained optimization.\n\n Since the constraints are given by intervals, we can use a segment tree or a sweep line to determine the effective maximum for each house? But note: the constraints are not necessarily giving a single value per house: they say that in an interval the maximum must be <= x_i. Therefore, for a house at position j, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_i such that j is in [l_i, r_i]. If no restriction, then h.\n\n However, wait: is that correct? Consider two restrictions: \n   Restriction1: [1,3] -> max <= 5\n   Restriction2: [2,4] -> max <= 3\n\n Then for house 1: only Restriction1 applies -> max 5.\n House 2: both -> max(5,3) -> 3? Actually, the condition is that the entire [1,3] must have max <=5 and [2,4] must have max<=3. So house2 must be <=3 because of the second restriction.\n\n But note: the first restriction requires that the entire [1,3] (which includes house2) is <=5, but the second restriction is more restrictive (<=3). So the effective limit for house2 is 3.\n\n Similarly, house3 is in both -> 3, house4 is only in Restriction2 -> 3, and house1 is only 5.\n\n So we can precompute for each spot j: \n   effective_max[j] = min{ h, (minimum x_i such that j is in [l_i, r_i]) }   [if there's no restriction, then we take h]\n\n However, wait: is that always safe? What if one restriction says [1,3] <=5 and another says [1,3] <=3? Then the effective_max for house1,2,3 is 3.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   effective_max = [h] * (n+1)   # index from 1 to n\n\n   For each restriction (l, r, x):\n        for j in range(l-1, r):   # because our spots are 1-indexed, so we adjust to 0-indexed\n            if x < effective_max[j]:\n                effective_max[j] = x\n\n But wait, this sets the effective_max for spot j to the minimum x_i that covers it, but note: the condition is that the entire interval must be <= x_i, so we are correctly setting the upper bound for each house.\n\n However, note: the condition is that the entire interval must have maximum <= x_i. This does not require that each house individually is <= x_i? Actually, if a house is above x_i, then the maximum of the interval would be above x_i, so yes, we require each house in the interval to be <= x_i.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the tallest house from spots l_i to r_i (inclusive) must be",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with specific zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. Each house's height must comply with all zoning restrictions that apply to its spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the optimal height for each house such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied, and the total profit (sum of squares of heights) is maximized. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a given height. \n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each spot, the maximum allowable height is constrained by the most restrictive restriction that includes it. This means we need to find, for each spot, the minimum upper bound from all overlapping restrictions. If no restrictions apply, the maximum height allowed is the global maximum height `h`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Preprocessing Restrictions**: For each spot, determine the tightest constraint by checking all restrictions that include the spot. The tightest constraint is the smallest upper bound among all relevant restrictions.\n   - **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Selection**: Once the effective maximum height for each spot is known, the problem reduces to selecting heights (from 0 up to the effective maximum) for each spot to maximize the sum of squares. Since the sum of squares is a convex function, the optimal choice for each spot is simply the effective maximum height itself. \n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction and updates the effective maximum for each spot within the restriction's range. Given that both `n` and `m` are up to 50, the nested loops (over spots and restrictions) result in a manageable complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    restrictions = []\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n    \n    eff_max = [h] * n\n    \n    for l, r, x in restrictions:\n        for j in range(l-1, r):\n            if x < eff_max[j]:\n                eff_max[j] = x\n                \n    total_profit = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        total_profit += eff_max[i] * eff_max[i]\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the small constraints. The first three values are `n` (number of spots), `h` (global maximum height), and `m` (number of restrictions).\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code checks all spots covered by the restriction and updates their effective maximum height to the minimum of their current effective maximum and the restriction's height.\n3. **Calculating Profit**: After determining the effective maximum height for each spot, the profit is computed by summing the squares of these heights.\n4. **Output**: The total profit is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages preprocessing to handle all constraints and then directly computes the optimal solution by maximizing each individual contribution under the given constraints.",
