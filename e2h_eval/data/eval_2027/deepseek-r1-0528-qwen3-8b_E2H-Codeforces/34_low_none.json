And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers.\n We have to consider all contiguous weeks of length k (there are n-k+1 weeks).\n For each week, we compute the average (sum of the k days divided by k) and then take the overall average over all weeks.\n\n However, note: The overall average is the sum of sleep times in all weeks divided by the number of weeks (which is n-k+1).\n\n But note: There is a simpler way. The total sum of sleep times for all weeks is the sum of all elements in the array? \n Actually, no. Each element in the array is included in multiple weeks. Specifically, an element at index i (0-indexed) is included in \n (min(i+1, n-i, k, ...)) Actually, more straightforward: \n   The first element is included in k, k-1, ... until 1? Actually, let's think:\n\n Another approach: Instead of computing the average for each week and then averaging those averages, we can do:\n\n Total sleep time over all weeks = (each element multiplied by the number of weeks it appears)\n\n How many weeks does an element at index i appear?\n   The element at index i will appear in a week if the week starts from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n-k). \n   Actually, the week must start from 0 to n-k (inclusive) and the week starting at j uses indices j to j+k-1.\n\n   Condition: j <= i <= j+k-1  => j >= i - k + 1 and j <= i, and also j>=0 and j<=n-k.\n\n   So the number of weeks that include a[i] is: \n        start_min = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        start_max = min(i, n - k)   # because j cannot be greater than n-k (last week starts at n-k)\n        Then the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1\n\n But wait, we can also think: the element at position i is included in the first (i+1) weeks? Not exactly.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a sliding window to calculate the total sum of all weeks.\n\n Let S = total sum of the array.\n Then, the total sum for all weeks is: \n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        But note: the first k elements are included once in the first week, then the next week shifts one, so the element at index 0 is included only in the first week? Actually:\n\n        Week 0: [a0, a1, ..., a_{k-1}]\n        Week 1: [a1, a2, ..., a_k]\n        ...\n        Week i: [a_i, a_{i+1}, ... , a_{i+k-1}]\n\n        So element a0 is only in week0, a1 is in week0 and week1, ..., a_{k-1} is in week0, week1, ... up to week (n-k) but wait, actually:\n\n        The element at index i is included in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). \n\n        Actually, the condition is: the week starting at j must satisfy j <= i and j+k-1 >= i, which is equivalent to j <= i and j >= i-k+1 (and j from 0 to n-k).\n\n        So the number of weeks including a[i] is: \n            num_weeks[i] = min(i+1, n-i, k)   ??? \n\n        Let me check with example: n=3, k=2, array [3,4,7]\n\n        i=0: \n            j must be <=0 and >= 0-2+1 = -1 -> so j from 0 to 0 (since n-k=1, so j in [0,1] but also j<=0) -> j=0 only. Count=1.\n            min(0+1, 3-0, 2) -> min(1,3,2)=1 -> correct.\n\n        i=1:\n            j must be <=1 and >= 1-2+1=0 -> j from 0 to 1 (but j<=n-k=1) -> j=0 and j=1. Count=2.\n            min(1+1, 3-1, 2)=min(2,2,2)=2 -> correct.\n\n        i=2:\n            j must be <=2 and >=2-2+1=1 -> j from 1 to min(2,1) -> j=1. Count=1.\n            min(2+1, 3-2, 2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as any contiguous block of `k` days from the sequence of `n` days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for all such weeks and then determining the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all windows of size `k` in a sequence of `n` days. Each window (week) contributes its average sleep time, but instead of averaging these averages, we sum all sleep times across all windows and divide by the total number of windows.\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of processing each window individually (which would be inefficient for large `n` and `k`), we recognize that each day's sleep time is included in multiple windows. Specifically, the number of windows a day appears in depends on its position in the sequence.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each day at position `i`, the number of windows it appears in is determined by the minimum of three values: \n   - The distance from the start of the sequence (`i + 1`).\n   - The distance from the end of the sequence (`n - i`).\n   - The window size `k`.\n   Multiplying each day's sleep time by the number of windows it appears in gives the total contribution of that day to the overall sum. Summing these contributions across all days gives the total sleep time across all windows.\n4. **Complexity**: This approach runs in O(n) time, which is optimal for the given constraints (n up to 2*10^5). The space complexity is O(1) additional space, using only a few variables for computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    if total_weeks <= 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n\n    total_sum = 0.0\n    for i in range(n):\n        count = min(i + 1, n - i, k)\n        total_sum += a[i] * count\n\n    avg = total_sum / (total_weeks * k)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are `n` (number of days) and `k` (window size). The subsequent values are the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If there are no valid windows (i.e., `n < k`), the output is `0.0000000000`.\n3. **Total Sum Calculation**: For each day, compute how many windows include it (count) and multiply the sleep time by this count. Summing these products gives the total sleep time across all windows.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average is obtained by dividing the total sleep time by the product of the number of windows and the window size (since each window's sum is counted once per day in the total). The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet precision requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the observation about the inclusion of each day in multiple windows, avoiding the need for nested loops and thus optimizing both time and space complexity.",
