The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given a number of test cases. For each test case, an integer `n` (from 1 to 10^18) is provided.\n\n We need to determine if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that a snowflake with `n` vertices can be constructed.\n\n According to the model:\n\n   - Initially, we have 1 vertex.\n   - Then, the initial vertex is connected to `k` new vertices (so now we have 1 + k vertices).\n   - Then, each vertex that has degree 1 (i.e., the leaves from the previous step) is connected to `k` new vertices, but note: this step must be done at least once.\n\n However, note that the process is not necessarily done only once. The problem states that after the first expansion (which gives 1 + k vertices), then each leaf (which now are the ones that were just added) will be expanded again, and so on. But wait, the description says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is connected by edges to `k` more new vertices. And this step should be done at least once.\n\n Actually, the example for k=4 is the smallest. Let me reconstruct:\n\n Step 0: 1 vertex (center)\n\n Step 1: add k=4 -> total 5 vertices. The center has 4 edges, so it has 4 leaves. Now, the leaves have degree 1, so they are candidates for the next step.\n\n But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning that we must do the initial expansion (step 1) and then we can choose to do additional expansions or stop? Actually, the problem does not specify how many times we do the expansion. It only says that the initial expansion (step 1) is mandatory, and then the rule for adding new vertices applies to any vertex with degree 1, and we must do at least the first expansion.\n\n However, note the example: the smallest for k=4 is shown. The smallest must be the one after the first expansion? Or maybe we do the first expansion and then stop? The problem says \"Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" \n\n Actually, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\" meaning that after the initial expansion (which is the first step) we must do the second step (on the leaves) at least one time? Or is the entire construction described as:\n\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: connect the center to k new vertices. (Now we have 1+k)\n   Then, we do step 2: each leaf (the k new ones) is connected to k new vertices. Then we have 1 + k + k*k? But wait, the center already has k edges, so when we expand a leaf, we are adding k new edges from that leaf, so the leaf becomes having two edges (one to the center and k to new ones). But then the new leaves are the k*k new ones.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the stopping condition. But note: we are allowed to do the expansion arbitrarily many times (at least the first expansion and then the step of expanding leaves must be done at least once, meaning we do the expansion at least twice? Actually, the problem says \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n This is ambiguous. Let me read again: The initial step (connecting the center to k new vertices) is the first. Then, the rule for expanding leaves is applied at least once. So the entire process is:\n\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: add k new vertices (now n0 = 1+k)\n   Then, we do at least one expansion of the leaves (so we must do step 2).\n\n Therefore, the minimal snowflake for k (with at least one expansion of leaves) has:\n   Level 0: 1 node.\n   Level 1: k nodes (connected to the center).\n   Level 2: k*k nodes (each node in level 1 produces k new nodes).\n\n So the total number of nodes is: 1 + k + k^2.\n\n But wait, what if we do more than two levels? Then we could have:\n\n   Level 0: 1\n   Level 1: k\n   Level 2: k^2\n   Level 3: k^3\n\n And the total would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^t (for t>=1, but note the minimal requires at least two levels? Actually, the problem says:\n\n   - First: connect center to k new (level 1)\n   - Then, each leaf (from level 1) is connected to k new (so level 2) and this step (expanding the leaves) is done at least once.\n\n So we must have at least two levels. But note: the problem says \"this step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of leaves (the step that adds k new nodes for each leaf) is done at least one time. So we must have at least two levels (center, then level1, then level2). \n\n However, wait: the problem also says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" — initially, after step1, we have k leaves. Then we expand each of them. But note: when we expand a leaf, we are connecting it to k new nodes. Then that leaf now has degree (1 + k) — so it is no longer a leaf. Then we move to the next set of leaves (the new k*k nodes). \n\n The entire process is a multi-level expansion. We can stop at any level (but we must do at least one expansion of leaves). So the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k * (1 + k * (1 + ... ))   [but we can break early?]\n\n Actually, the problem does not specify that we must complete a fixed number of steps. It says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is expanded. But we are free to stop after any expansion. However, the problem does not say we have to expand all leaves at the same time. But note: the example says \"the smallest possible snowflake for k=4\", which is 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1+4+16 = 21? But wait, the example figure is not provided.\n\n Alternatively, let me think: the example output for n=6 is \"NO\", and n=13 is \"YES\".\n\n What if we consider the process as:\n\n   Let f(t) = the total number of vertices after t expansions (including the center and the first expansion as the first expansion, and then each subsequent expansion is one more step).\n\n   t=0: 1\n   t=1: 1 + k\n   t=2: 1 + k + k^2\n   t=3: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3\n\n But note: the problem says the initial expansion (step1) is mandatory, and then the expansion of leaves (step2) is mandatory (at least once). So we must have at least two levels (t>=2). Therefore, the minimal n for a given k is 1+k+k^2.\n\n However, wait: the example input includes n=6 and n=13.\n\n For n=6: \n   We need to check if there exists k>1 such that 1+k+k^2 = 6 OR 1+k+k^2+k^3 = 6 OR ...?\n\n   Equation for two levels: 1+k+k^2 = 6 -> k^2+k-5=0 -> discriminant=21, not integer -> no solution for two levels.\n\n   Three levels: 1+k+k^2+k^3 = 6 -> k^3+k^2+k-5=0. For k=1: 1+1+1-5=-2; k=2: 8+4+2-5=9 -> too big. No solution.\n\n   Alternatively, note: the problem does not require that we do the same k for every expansion? Actually, the problem defines the snowflake with a fixed k. So k is fixed for the entire snowflake.\n\n   Another possibility: the expansion is done in layers, but note that the process does not necessarily require that we expand all leaves at the same time? The problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices\". So we might expand leaves in different layers independently? But then the graph would be built in layers.\n\n   Actually, the standard way to model this is as a rooted tree where the root has k children, and each leaf (node with no children) has k children. But note: the center is not a leaf initially? After the first expansion, the center has k children and then each leaf (the k children) will be expanded. However, when we expand a leaf, we give it k children, so then that leaf becomes an internal node and the new k nodes become leaves.\n\n   The entire structure is a complete k-ary tree of height h (with h>=2). But note: the center is the root and has k children. Then each non-leaf node (in the first layer) has k children, and so on. However, the root is not a leaf because it has k children. The leaves are the nodes at the last level.\n\n   The total number of nodes in a complete k-ary tree of height h (with the root at level0, and leaves at level h-1) is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(h-1)\n\n   But note: our process must have at least two levels (so h>=2). \n\n   However, wait: the example says the smallest for k=4 is the one with two levels (root, then 4, then 16). So n=1+4+16=21.\n\n   But then why is n=13 YES?\n\n   Let's check: 13 = 1 + k + k^2 + ... ?\n\n   If we consider two levels: 1+k+k^2=13 -> k^2+k+1=13 -> k^2+k-12=0 -> solutions: k=( -1±sqrt(1+48))/2 = ( -1±7 )/2 -> k=3 (since k>1). So for k=3, two levels: 1+3+9=13 -> valid.\n\n   Now, what about three levels? 1+k+k^2+k^3=13. For k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 -> too big. k=1: not allowed. So only two levels.\n\n   Therefore, the idea is: n must be expressible as:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^h   for some integers k>1 and h>=2.\n\n   But note: the series is a geometric progression. The sum of a geometric series is:\n\n        n = (k^(h+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   However, note: our series starts at k^0 (which is 1) and goes up to k^h. But wait, we have:\n\n        Level0: 1 (root) -> k^0\n        Level1: k^1\n        Level2: k^2\n        ...\n        Levelh: k^h\n\n   So the total is (k^(h+1)-1)/(k-1) but note: the exponent h+1 because we have h+1 terms (from exponent0 to exponent h).\n\n   But note: the problem requires at least two levels (h>=2) so the minimal h is 2 (meaning we have three terms: k^0, k^1, k^2). Then:\n\n        n = (k^3 - 1) / (k-1) = k^2 + k + 1.\n\n   However, we can have more than two levels? Then h>=2, so the minimal is two levels (h=2) and then we can have h=3,4,... \n\n   Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n        n = (k^(h+1) - 1) / (k-1)   for some k>1 and integer h>=2.\n\n   But note: the example n=6: we need to check if there exists k>1 and h>=2 such that (k^(h+1)-1)/(k-1)=6.\n\n        h=2: (k^3-1)/(k-1)=k^2+k+1=6 -> k^2+k-5=0 -> no integer k.\n        h=3: (k^4-1)/(k-1)=k^3+k^2+k+1=6 -> k=1: 4, k=2: 15 -> too big. k=1 not allowed. So no.\n\n   Thus n=6 is NO.\n\n   Now, n=15: \n        Two levels: (k^3-1)/(k-1)=k^2+k+1=15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(57) )/2 -> not integer.\n        Three levels: (k^4-1)/(k-1)=k^3+k^2+k+1=15 -> k=2: 8+4+2+1=15 -> yes. So k=2, h=3 (so four levels? Wait, let me recount:\n\n        In the formula, h is the maximum level (root is level0, then level1, level2, ... up to level h). Then the sum is from exponent0 to exponent h, which is h+1 terms.\n\n        For h=3: the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\n        So for k=2, h=3: 1+2+4+8=15. That matches.\n\n        But note: the problem requires at least two levels (h>=2). Here h=3 (which means we have three expansions: level0, level1, level2, level3) — actually, wait: the first expansion is level1, and then we do the expansion of leaves (which is level2) and then we do the expansion of the leaves at level2 (which is level3). So the process is done three times (initial expansion and two more expansions). But the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of leaves (after the initial) is done at least once. Here we did two expansions of leaves (after the initial). That is allowed.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: n must be representable as the sum of a geometric series with ratio k (integer k>=2) and at least three terms (so h>=2, i.e., the series has at least three terms: the root, level1, and level2).\n\n   However, note: the series always has at least three terms (because h>=2) so the minimal representation is 1+k+k^2.\n\n   But wait, the problem does not require the entire snowflake to be complete? Or is it complete? The definition says:\n\n      Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\n   This suggests that we do the initial expansion (k new) and then we do the expansion of the leaves (the k new ones) at least once. Then, we might continue expanding the leaves (the k*k new ones) arbitrarily. So the entire graph is a complete k-ary tree of arbitrary height (at least 2).\n\n   Therefore, the total number of vertices is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^h   for some h>=2.\n\n   And note: the series is finite and we can stop at any h>=2.\n\n   Now, how to check for a given n (which can be up to 10^18) whether there exists an integer k>=2 and an integer h>=2 such that:\n\n        n = (k^(h+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   We can rewrite:\n\n        n*(k-1) = k^(h+1) - 1\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^h\n\n   Since k>=2 and h>=2, we have:\n\n        k^2 <= n <= k^(h+1)/(k-1)\n\n   But note: n can be very large (up to 10^18). We cannot iterate over k from 2 to ... because k can be as large as n (if h=2 then k^2 ~ n, so k ~ sqrt(n)).\n\n   Steps:\n\n   We note that the minimal representation is for h=2: n = 1+k+k^2.\n\n   Then we can consider h=3: n = 1+k+k^2+k^3.\n\n   But note: the same n might be represented in two different ways (for different k and h). However, we only need to know if there exists one.\n\n   How to approach?\n\n   Observation:\n\n     For a fixed k (>=2) and varying h (>=2), the sequence of n is strictly increasing. Also, for a fixed h, as k increases, n increases.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n     Case 1: h=2 -> n = k^2 + k + 1.\n\n        We can solve for k: k^2 + k + 1 - n = 0 -> k = [-1 ± sqrt(4*n-3)]/2. Then we check if the discriminant is a perfect square and the positive root is an integer >=2.\n\n     Case 2: h>=3.\n\n        Then n = (k^(h+1)-1)/(k-1) for some h>=3 and k>=2.\n\n        But note: h can be large. However, note that k^h grows very fast. For k>=2, the minimal n for a given h is:\n\n            h=3: n_min = 1+2+4+8 = 15 (for k=2) and for k=3: 1+3+9+27=40, etc.\n\n        Also, note that the height h must be at least 3 (so h+1=4) but wait: h is the maximum level (so we have h+1 terms). Actually, the exponent is h+1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can fix the base k and then determine the minimal h such that the sum is at least n. But n can be up to 10^18.\n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n     Note: the entire snowflake graph is a rooted tree with branching factor k and depth h (with root at depth0, and leaves at depth h). The total number of nodes is:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^h = (k^(h+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n     Rearranged:\n\n            k^(h+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n     We are looking for integers k>=2 and integers h>=2 (so h+1>=3) such that the above holds.\n\n     Since k>=2, we can try to bound h and k.\n\n     Notice that h+1 is the exponent. For a fixed k, the left side grows exponentially with h. We can iterate over possible exponents? But note: h+1 can be as large as about log_k(n*(k-1)+1). However, k can be from 2 up to ...? \n\n     But note: the minimal representation (h=2) gives n = k^2+k+1. The next representation (h=3) gives n = k^3+k^2+k+1, and so on.\n\n     However, we can also consider that the representation is unique for a given k? Not necessarily. But we don't care.\n\n     But note: we are given n up to 10^18. We cannot iterate over k from 2 to sqrt(n) (which is 10^9) for the h=2 case, but even sqrt(10^18) is 10^9 which is acceptable for a single test? However, we have up to 10^4 test cases. So we cannot iterate over k from 2 to 10^9 for each test.\n\n   We need a better approach.\n\n   Let me think:\n\n   We have two possibilities:\n\n     1. The snowflake has exactly two levels (h=2): then n = k^2+k+1 for some integer k>=2.\n\n        Then we can check: \n          Let d = 4*n - 3.\n          Check if d is a perfect square and the root is odd (because k = (-1+sqrt(d))/2 must be integer) and k>=2.\n\n        Example: n=13 -> d=4*13-3=52-3=49, sqrt(49)=7, then k=(-1+7)/2=3 -> integer and >=2 -> YES.\n\n     2. The snowflake has more than two levels (h>=3). Then we have:\n\n          n = (k^(h+1)-1)/(k-1)   for some k>=2 and h>=3.\n\n        Note: h>=3 => h+1>=4.\n\n        We can fix the exponent e = h+1 (so e>=4). Then:\n\n          n*(k-1) + 1 = k^e\n\n        We need to find an integer k>=2 and an integer e>=4 such that the equation holds.\n\n        For a fixed exponent e, we can write:\n\n          k^e = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        But note: we don't know e. However, note that k^e must be approximately n*k (if k is large and e fixed, then k^e grows faster than k). Actually, we can rearrange:\n\n          k^e - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        But that doesn't help.\n\n        Alternatively, note that for a fixed e, we can take the e-th root of (n*(k-1)+1) and see if it's an integer. But k is unknown.\n\n        However, note that k must be at least 2 and the equation is:\n\n          k^e = n*k - n + 1   => k^e - n*k + (n-1) = 0.\n\n        We can also note that for a fixed e, the value of k must be roughly the e-th root of n*k (but k is variable). This seems messy.\n\n   Another idea: since the total n is the sum of a geometric series, we can consider that the entire graph must have at least three levels (so h>=2) and the number of nodes is at least 1+2+4=7 for k=2 (if we do two levels: 1+2+4=7) but wait, for k=2, two levels: 1+2+4=7. However, we have seen n=15 (which is 1+2+4+8) for k=2 and three levels (h=3). \n\n   But wait: the two levels (h=2) for k=2 gives 7, so n=7 would be YES? Let me check the example: n=7.\n\n        Input: 7 -> should output YES.\n\n        However, our example input does not include 7.\n\n   But the problem statement example: \n        Input: 1,2,3,6,13,15,255,10101,1000000000000000000\n        Output: NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO\n\n   So n=7 is not in the example. But according to our reasoning, n=7 should be YES.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of leaves (after the initial) is done at least once. The initial expansion gives 1+k (for k=2: 3 nodes). Then we do the expansion of leaves (at least once) so we get 1+k+k^2 = 1+2+4=7. So n=7 is valid.\n\n   But why is n=6 NO? 6 is less than 7, so no k>=2 and h>=2 can represent 6.\n\n   Now, how to handle the general case?\n\n   We can consider that the snowflake graph must have at least two levels (h>=2) and the total number of nodes is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^h\n\n   This is equivalent to:\n\n        n = (k^(h+1)-1)/(k-1)   and k>=2, h>=2.\n\n   We can iterate over the possible exponents (h+1) from 3 up to a limit. Since k>=2, the minimal n for exponent e (which is h+1) is 2^(e-1)+2^(e-2)+...+1 = 2^e-1. But wait, the minimal k is 2, so the minimal n for exponent e is (2^e-1)/(2-1)=2^e-1.\n\n   We require n>=2^e-1.\n\n   However, n is given and we are trying to find if there exists k and e (with e>=3) such that:\n\n        k^e = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   And note: k must be an integer>=2.\n\n   We can also note that the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n        k^e - n*k + (n-1) = 0.\n\n   But solving this for k is difficult.\n\n   Alternate approach: \n\n   We can consider that the entire snowflake is built by layers. The total number of vertices is:\n\n        n = 1 + k * (1 + k * (1 + ... ))\n\n   We can also think: the center is 1, then we have k branches, and each branch is a snowflake? But wait, the problem says we do the expansion of leaves arbitrarily (but at least the first expansion and then at least one expansion of the leaves). \n\n   However, note that the expansion is done uniformly: every leaf is expanded. So the entire graph is a complete k-ary tree of height h (with h>=2).\n\n   Now, we can iterate over the possible heights h (exponent e = h+1) but note that e can be at most about 60 because 2^60 is around 1e18.\n\n   Steps for a given n:\n\n     1. Check if n is representable by two levels (h=2): \n            Solve k^2 + k + 1 = n for integer k>=2.\n\n        We can compute d = 4*n - 3. If d is a perfect square, then let r = isqrt(d). Then k = (-1+r)/2 must be integer and >=2.\n\n        Example: n=13 -> d=52-3=49, r=7, k=(7-1)/2=3 -> integer.\n\n     2. If not, then we consider more than two levels (h>=3). Then the total n is at least 15 (for k=2, h=3). \n\n        We can iterate over exponents e from 4 to about 60 (because 2^60 is about 1e18, so k>=2 and e>=4, then k^e <= n*(k-1)+1, and k is at least 2, so the maximum exponent e is about floor(log2(n))+1, but n can be up to 10^18, so log2(10^18) is about 60).\n\n        For a fixed exponent e (which is h+1, so h=e-1, and we require h>=3 so e>=4):\n\n            We need to find an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n                k^e = n*(k-1)+1\n\n            Rearranged:\n\n                k^e - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n            But note: we can also express:\n\n                n = (k^e - 1) / (k-1)\n\n            And note that (k^e-1) is divisible by (k-1). However, we don't know k.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that k must be at least 2 and at most n (but n is huge). But note: the equation:\n\n                k^e = n*(k-1)+1\n\n            => k^e < n*k   (if n*(k-1)+1 < n*k, which is true for n>=1 and k>=2, since n*(k-1)+1 = n*k - n +1, and we require n*k - n +1 <= n*k, which is true) but we have equality when n*k - n +1 = n*k? No, but we have:\n\n                k^e = n*k - n + 1\n\n            So for a fixed e, k must satisfy:\n\n                k^e <= n*k   (approximately)\n\n            => k^(e-1) <= n   (if we divide both sides by k, assuming k>0)\n\n        So k <= n^(1/(e-1))\n\n        But note: we have to consider that the equation is k^e = n*k - n + 1.\n\n        We can iterate over k from 2 up to ceil(n^(1/(e-1))) but that is too slow.\n\n   Another idea: for fixed e, we can solve for k by:\n\n        k^e - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        We can use binary search for k? But note: the function f(k)=k^e - n*k + (n-1) is strictly increasing for k>=2 (because derivative is e*k^(e-1) - n, and for k>=2 and e>=4, the derivative is positive for sufficiently large k). However, we don't know the range.\n\n        But note: k must be at least 2 and at most about n^(1/(e-1)) (from k^(e-1) <= n). Since e>=4, then e-1>=3, so k <= n^(1/3) for e=4, which is acceptable because n<=10^18, so n^(1/3) is about 1e6, but wait: we are iterating over e from 4 to 60, and for each e we would iterate k from 2 to n^(1/(e-1))? That is too expensive.\n\n   We need a smarter way.\n\n   Let me reframe: for a fixed e, we want to know if there exists an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n        k^e = n*k - n + 1\n\n        => k^e - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        => k^e + (n-1) = n*k\n\n        => k^e + (n-1) is divisible by k? Actually, we can write:\n\n        We require that k divides (k^e + (n-1))? But k^e is divisible by k, so we require k divides (n-1). \n\n        But wait, the equation is:\n\n            k^e = n*k - (n-1)\n\n        => n*k - k^e = n-1\n\n        => n*(k-1) = k^e - 1\n\n        So n = (k^e - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        This is the original geometric series formula.\n\n        So we are looking for k>=2 and e>=4 such that (k^e-1) is divisible by (k-1) (which it always is, because k ≡ 1 mod (k-1), so k^e ≡ 1^e mod (k-1)) and then n = (k^e-1)/(k-1) equals the given n.\n\n        Therefore, we can iterate over k from 2 to a limit (what limit? the minimal k is 2, and the maximal k is when k^e <= n*(k-1)+1, but note that k^e grows fast). \n\n        However, note that k^e must be at least (k-1)*n + 1, but wait, n = (k^e-1)/(k-1) so:\n\n            n = (k^e-1)/(k-1)   => k^e = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        We are given n, so we can write:\n\n            k^e = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        Now, we can fix e (from 4 to about 60) and then solve for k. But note: k must be at least 2 and the equation is exponential. \n\n        We can rearrange:\n\n            k^e - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        We can use binary search for k for a fixed e? The left side is a polynomial in k of degree e, which is high, but e is at most 60, and k is at most about n^(1/(e-1)) which for e=4 is about 1e6 for n=1e18, which is acceptable for a binary search? But wait, the domain for k is [2, ceil(n^(1/(e-1)))] and for e=4, n^(1/3) is about 1e6, which is acceptable. But for e=3, we already handled h=2 (which corresponds to e=3) separately. Our e starts at 4 (h>=3).\n\n        However, note: the equation for e=4: k^4 = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          low = 2\n          high = ceil(n**(1/(e-1))) + 1   # because k^(e-1) <= n (from k^e <= n*k, but actually from k^e = n*k - n + 1, we have k^e <= n*k, so k^(e-1) <= n, so k <= n**(1/(e-1))). \n\n        Then we do binary search for k in [2, high] such that k^e = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        But note: we are dealing with integers and n up to 10^18. The exponentiation k^e for e=60 and k=2 is 2^60 which is about 1e18, which is acceptable in Python if we do it for a few k values (using pow with big integers). But we are doing binary search over k from 2 to n**(1/(e-1)), which for e=4 is about 1e6, and for e=5 is about 1e4.5, so the binary search for each e would take O(log(n**(1/(e-1)))) iterations, and each iteration does one exponentiation (which is O(e) multiplications, but e is fixed and small) and one multiplication (n*(k-1)).\n\n        However, we have to do this for e from 4 to about 60 (which is 57 exponents) and for each test case (up to 10^4 test cases). That would be 10^4 * 57 * (log2(1e6)) ~ 10^4 * 57 * 20 = 11.4e6 iterations, and each iteration does one exponentiation (with exponent e, which is up to 60) and one multiplication. \n\n        But note: the exponentiation for k^e: k is at most 1e6 for e=4, and then k^e for e=4 and k=1e6 is (1e6)^4 = 1e24, which is too big for n (n<=10^18). Actually, we break the binary search when k is too high: the condition k^(e-1) <= n. But wait, we set high = ceil(n**(1/(e-1))) + 1, so k is at most about n**(1/(e-1)), and then k^e might be very big (like 1e24 for e=4 and n=1e18). But we are comparing with n*(k-1)+1, which is about 1e18 * 1e6 = 1e24, so it's acceptable to compute k^e? However, we are using Python integers, which can handle 1e24, but we have to do this for each candidate k in the binary search.\n\n        But note: the binary search for a fixed e is over the range [2, high], and the number of iterations is about log2(high). For e=4, high is about 1e6, so log2(1e6) is about 20. So for each e we do about 20 exponentiations (each with exponent e, which is 4,5,...,60). Then for 57 exponents, we do 57 *",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a single vertex (the center). Each subsequent layer expands by connecting each leaf node (nodes with only one edge) to \\( k \\) new nodes, where \\( k > 1 \\). This expansion must be done at least once after the initial layer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph's total number of vertices \\( n \\) must be expressible as the sum of a geometric series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^h \\), where \\( k \\geq 2 \\) and \\( h \\geq 2 \\). This sum can be rewritten using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: \\( n = \\frac{k^{h+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For \\( n \\) to be valid, there must exist integers \\( k \\geq 2 \\) and \\( h \\geq 2 \\) such that the equation \\( n = \\frac{k^{h+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\) holds.

This involves checking possible values of \\( k \\) and exponents \\( h \\) such that the equation holds.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Case 1**: Compute the discriminant \\( d = 4n - 3 \\). If \\( d \\) is a perfect square and the resulting \\( k \\) is an integer \\( \\geq 2 \\), then \\( n \\) is valid.\n   - **Case 2**: For exponents \\( e \\) (where \\( e = h + 1 \\geq 4 \\)), iterate over possible base values \\( k \\) from 2 up to \\( \\lfloor n^{1/(e-1)} \\rfloor \\). For each \\( k \\), compute \\( k^e \\) and check if it equals \\( n(k - 1) + 1 \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution efficiently checks all possible \\( k \\) and \\( e \\) combinations without excessive computation.
