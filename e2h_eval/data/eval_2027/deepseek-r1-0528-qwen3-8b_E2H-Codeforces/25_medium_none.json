При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` (the received message) and we need to determine if it could be the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message `s` with an error that causes overlapping.\n\n Conditions for the error:\n - The two messages are the same: so we have two copies of `s` being transmitted.\n - The error happens only when two identical messages are sent one after the other.\n - The overlap must be positive and less than the length of `s`. \n - The entire string `t` must be the result of having two copies of `s` with an overlap (which is a suffix of the first `s` matching a prefix of the second `s`).\n\n However, note from the problem statement:\n   - If the entire message is just two copies without any overlap, then that is not considered an error? Actually, the example says:\n        Input: \"abcabc\" -> Output: \"NO\"\n        But wait, in the example output: \n            ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        For the third input: 'abcabc' -> 'NO'\n\n        Why? Because if we consider two copies of \"abc\", then there is no overlap (the entire first copy is used and then the next starts). But note the condition: the error requires that the two messages are the same and that the overlap is positive and less than the length. So sending two \"abc\" without overlap is not an error.\n\n        However, note that the example also says:\n            \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друг на друга двух сообщений.\" \n        But wait, the example says: \"if the entire message is obtained by two copies without any overlap, then there is no error\". And if there is an overlap (but not necessarily full) then it is an error.\n\n        Also note: the problem says \"the length of the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the text\". So if the entire message is two copies without any overlap, then there's no error. But if there is an overlap (at least one character and less than the whole length) then it is an error.\n\n        However, what if the string is formed by two copies with an overlap that is the entire length? That would mean the two copies are identical and the entire second copy is overlapped. But note: the problem states that the overlap must be positive and less than the length. So the entire second copy cannot be overlapped (because that would be the whole length, which is not allowed). Therefore, the entire second copy being overlapped is not allowed. \n\n        But note: the example says \"if you get the message by two copies without any error\", then output NO. This includes two cases:\n          1. No overlap (concatenation without merging) -> NO.\n          2. Overlap that is the entire second copy? Actually, the condition says the overlap must be less than the length, so even if the entire second copy is the same as the first, that's not allowed because the overlap must be less than the length (so strictly less). Therefore, if the entire second copy is overlapped, that's not allowed either? \n\n        However, let me clarify: the problem says \"the length of the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the text\" (here \"text\" meaning the message s). So the overlap length L must satisfy 0 < L < len(s). \n\n        Then, how can we form the string t?\n        We have: t = s + s, but with an overlap of L, so the total length of t is len(s) + len(s) - L = 2*len(s) - L.\n\n        Conditions for t to be produced by an error:\n          There exists a string s and an integer L (with 0 < L < len(s)) such that:\n            t = s[0: len(s)-L] + s[L:]   ??? \n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n          Let n = len(s). Then t should be of the form: \n            t = s[0: n-L] + s[L:]\n\n        But note: the entire string t is built by having two copies of s, and the last L characters of the first s are merged with the first L characters of the second s. Therefore, the entire string t must be:\n\n          t = s + s[L:]   [but wait, the first part is the first s without the last L characters?]\n\n        Actually, the process: \n          Original two copies: s and s.\n          They are merged: the last L characters of the first s are merged with the first L of the second s. So the resulting string is:\n            t = s[0: n - L] + s[L: n+L?]   but note we are only sending two s's.\n\n        Actually, the two copies are exactly two s's. So the second copy is s, and we merge the last L characters of the first s with the first L of the second s. Then the second copy's first L characters are effectively skipped because they are merged. So the entire string is:\n\n            t = s + s[L:]   but wait, that would be the same as s[0: n] + s[L: n] (because the second s has length n, so s[L:] is the substring from index L to the end of the second s, which is n - L long). Then the total length is n + (n - L) = 2*n - L.\n\n        But note: the example \"abrakadabra\" (n=11) with an overlap of 1 gives:\n          t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\"[1:] -> that doesn't look right.\n\n        Let me break down the example \"abrakadabra\":\n          First copy: \"abrakadabra\"\n          Second copy: \"abrakadabra\"\n\n          With an overlap of 1: the last 1 character of the first copy is \"a\", and the first 1 character of the second copy is \"a\", so they merge. Then the resulting string is:\n\n            \"abrakadabra\" (without the last character) + \"brakadabra\" (the rest of the second copy) -> \"abrakadabrakadabra\"\n\n        But wait, that's not the same as \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\"[1:] because \"abrakadabra\" without the last character is \"abrakadabr\", and then adding \"brakadabra\" (from the second copy) we get \"abrakadabr\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is indeed the example.\n\n        How to express this? \n          We can say: t = s[0: n - L] + s[L:]\n\n        But note: the second copy is s, so s[L:] is the substring starting at index L of the original s. \n\n        Alternatively, we can write: t = s + s[L: n]   but wait, that would be s plus the second copy without its first L characters. However, the example above uses the entire second copy? Actually, no: the entire second copy is present except that the first L characters were already provided by the overlap. But note: the first copy provides the entire s, and then the second copy provides only from index L to the end. \n\n        So the entire string t is built as:\n          t = s[0:n] + s[L:n]\n\n        Then the total length is n + (n - L) = 2*n - L.\n\n        Now, note that the entire string t must be built this way. Moreover, the problem says: if t can be represented in such a way, then output \"YES\" and the string s (which is the original message). \n\n        Also note: the problem allows multiple possibilities? We can output any.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let n = len(t). We know that t must be composed of two copies of s, with an overlap L (0 < L < len(s)), so the length of t must be between (2 * len(s)) - (len(s)-1) = len(s)+1 and 2 * len(s) - 1. But note: we don't know s, so we can iterate over possible splits.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider: \n          Since t is the result of two copies of s with an overlap of L, then the string t must have the property that it ends with a string that is a prefix of the beginning of t (or more precisely, the entire string t is periodic with period |s| and with an overlap). \n\n        Another idea: \n          We are told that the entire string t is the result of two copies of s with an overlap. Therefore, the entire string t must be equal to s + s[L:], but note that s must be a substring of t? Actually, the first part of t is s, and then the second part is s[L:]. But wait, the entire string t is built from two copies of s. \n\n        Let me denote: \n          Let s be a string, and t = s + s[L:] (with 0 < L < len(s)).\n\n        Then, note that the total length of t is 2*len(s) - L, so len(s) = (len(t) + L) / 2. But L is variable.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n          t must be such that the first part (without the overlap) is s, and the second part (after the overlap) is the rest of s. But note, the entire t is built by two copies of s, so the entire t must be a prefix of two copies of s? \n\n        Observation:\n          The string t must be a substring of two copies of s, but we don't know s.\n\n        Another observation: \n          The entire string t must start with s and then continue with the tail of s (starting at index L). Therefore, the entire string t must be built by overlapping two copies of s.\n\n        How can we check?\n\n        Let n = len(t). We can try to find a split point i (which would be the boundary between the two copies, but note the overlap) such that:\n\n          Let k = len(s). Then the length of t is 2*k - L, so k must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1 (since L>=1, so k <= n-1). Actually, n = 2*k - L, so k = (n+L)/2. But we don't know L.\n\n        Alternatively, note that the string t must satisfy: \n          t = A + B, where A is the first copy of s without the last L characters, and B is the second copy without the first L characters.\n\n        Then, the entire string t must be equal to s[0:k-L] + s[L:k] (but wait, the second copy is s, so we are taking from index L to the end of the second copy, which is k characters, so s[L:k] is of length k - L). \n\n        But note: the entire string t is of length (k - L) + (k - L)? No, wait: the first part is k - L, the second part is k - L? Actually, no: the first part is the first copy without the last L, so length k - L, and the second part is the second copy from L to the end, which is k - L, so total length is 2*(k - L) = 2*k - 2*L. But wait, that doesn't match our previous expression. \n\n        Let me correct: \n          We have two copies of s, each of length k. The first copy is s[0:k], the second copy is s[0:k]. The overlapping part is L, so we remove the last L of the first copy and the first L of the second copy. Then the resulting string is:\n            t = s[0:k-L] + s[L:k]   (this is correct, because the first copy gives s[0:k-L] and then the second copy gives s[L:k])\n\n        Then the total length is (k-L) + (k-L) = 2*k - 2*L? Wait, no: the first copy contributes k-L characters, and the second copy contributes k - L characters (from index L to the end, which is k-L). So total length is 2*(k-L). But note: originally, two copies without overlap would be 2*k. With an overlap of L, we remove L from the first and L from the second, so we remove 2*L? Actually, we are overlapping L characters, so we are saving L characters (because the overlapping part is counted once). Therefore, the total length is 2*k - L.\n\n        But wait, our representation above: \n          t = s[0:k-L] + s[L:k] \n        The length of s[0:k-L] is k-L, and the length of s[L:k] is k - L. So total length is 2*(k-L). This equals 2*k - 2*L.\n\n        This contradicts the previous reasoning. \n\n        Let me reexamine with an example: \n          Example: s = \"abrakadabra\", k = 11, L = 1.\n          Then the resulting string should be: \n            Without the last L (1) of the first copy: \"abrakadabr\" (length 10)\n            Then the second copy without the first L (1): \"brakadabra\" (length 10)\n            Then t = \"abrakadabrbrakadabra\" (length 20) but the example says \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (length 21).\n\n        Wait, actually the example says: \n          Input: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (which is 21 characters)\n\n        How did they get that?\n          First copy: \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters)\n          Second copy: \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters)\n\n          Overlap of 1: so the last 1 letter of the first copy is \"a\", and the first 1 letter of the second copy is \"a\", so they merge. Then the entire string is:\n            First copy without the last 1: \"abrakadabr\" (10 letters) and then the second copy without the first 1: \"brakadabra\" (10 letters) -> total 20.\n\n        But wait, the example says the result is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 21 characters.\n\n        Let me count: \n          \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> \n          a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a -> 21.\n\n        What's happening?\n\n        Actually, the example says: \n          \"abrakadabra\" (first copy) and then the second copy is \"abrakadabra\", and the overlap is 1. Then the merged string should be:\n          First copy: \"abrakadabra\" (11 chars) and then the second copy: we only write from the second character of the second copy? \n\n        But note: the problem says: \"the end of the first message is merged with the beginning of the second\". So the entire first copy is written, and then the second copy is written, but the overlapping part is omitted? Actually, the example shows:\n\n          \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\": \n          - The first part is \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters) and then the second part is \"brakadabra\" (10 letters) but wait, that is 21. \n\n        Actually, the example does not omit the entire overlapping part. The problem says: \"merge\", meaning that the overlapping part is still present? Or is it that the overlapping part is duplicated?\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n          \"the end of the first message is merged with the beginning of the second\". And the example: \n            \"abrakadabra\" and \"abrakadabra\" with overlap 1 gives \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\".\n\n        In the example, the first copy is \"abrakadabra\", and the second copy is \"abrakadabra\", but when merging, the last character of the first copy (the last 'a') and the first character of the second copy (the first 'a') are merged. How does that produce the result?\n\n        Actually, the result is: \n          [First copy] + [Second copy without the overlapping part] \n        But wait, if we do that, we get:\n          \"abrakadabra\" (first copy) + \"brakadabra\" (second copy without the first character) -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n        So the representation is: \n          t = s + s[L:]   [but note: the entire first copy is kept, and then the second copy without the first L characters]\n\n        Then the length is: len(s) + (len(s) - L) = 2*len(s) - L.\n\n        But wait, in the example: \n          s = \"abrakadabra\", L=1 -> length = 11 + 10 = 21.\n\n        So the formula is: t = s + s[L:]\n\n        Now, note: the problem states that the two messages are the same. So the entire string t is built from two copies of s, but the second copy is truncated by the overlap.\n\n        Conditions for t to be produced by an error:\n          There exists a string s and an integer L (with 0 < L < len(s)) such that:\n            t = s + s[L:]\n\n        But note: the entire string t must be exactly that.\n\n        Also, note that the problem says: \"if the entire message is obtained by two copies without any error\", then output NO. The case without any error is when L = 0 (no overlap) or when the entire second copy is not present (i.e., the two copies are concatenated without merging). However, the error condition requires an overlap (so L>0). But note: the problem also says that the overlap must be positive and less than the length of s.\n\n        However, the problem also says: \"if the entire message is obtained by two copies without any overlap\" then that is not an error. But note: the representation above (t = s + s[L:]) for L=0 would give t = s+s, which is two copies without overlap. But we require L>0, so we are not considering L=0.\n\n        How do we find s?\n\n        We know: \n          t = s + s[L:]\n          and 0 < L < len(s)\n\n        Then, the length of t is: n = len(s) + (len(s) - L) = 2*len(s) - L.\n\n        We can express len(s) in terms of n and L: \n          len(s) = (n + L) / 2.\n\n        But note: n and L are integers, and L must be in the range [1, len(s)-1]. \n\n        Alternatively, we can consider that the entire string t must be built by a base string s and an overlap L. \n\n        How to approach?\n\n        Since the length of t is at most 100, we can try to consider:\n\n          Let n = len(t). Then the length of s must be at least ceil(n/2) + 1? Actually, the minimal length of s is (n+1)//2 + 1? Not exactly.\n\n        Actually, the length of s must satisfy: \n          Let k = len(s). Then n = k + (k - L) = 2*k - L, so k = (n + L) / 2. Since k must be an integer, (n+L) must be even.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate over the possible lengths of s.\n\n        Note: the entire string t must be built from two copies of s. Therefore, t must be a substring of two copies of s. But note, we don't know s.\n\n        Another idea: \n          Since t = s + s[L:], then the first part of t (of length k) is s. Then the next part (of length n-k) is s[L:].\n\n        But note: the entire t is of length n, and the second part is of length n-k = (2*k - L) - k = k - L.\n\n        Therefore, the second part (from index k to the end) must be equal to s[L:].\n\n        But s is the first k characters of t. Then, the second part (from index k to the end) is t[k:], and it must equal s[L:].\n\n        Also, we require that 0 < L < k (where k = len(s) = k0).\n\n        Then, we have two conditions:\n          1. t[k:] == s[L:]   [and s = t[0:k]]\n          2. 0 < L < k\n\n        But note: the length of t is n = k + (k - L) = 2*k - L, so L = 2*k - n.\n\n        Then, condition 2 becomes: 0 < 2*k - n < k.\n\n        Rearranged: \n          2*k - n > 0  => k > n/2\n          2*k - n < k  => k < n\n\n        And since k is the length of s, which is the first k characters of t, we must have k <= n (because t is given and we take the first k). \n\n        Also, note: n = 2*k - L, so k must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) (since L>=1, then k = (n+L)/2 >= (n+1)/2).\n\n        So k must be in the range: floor(n/2)+1 to n-1 (because k>n/2 and k<n).\n\n        However, note: k must be an integer and n = 2*k - L, so L = 2*k - n must be positive and less than k.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let n = len(t)\n        For k from floor(n/2)+1 to n-1 (inclusive):\n          Then L = 2*k - n\n          Conditions: \n            Condition1: L must be an integer (it is, since k and n are integers) and 0 < L < k.\n            Condition2: The second part of t (from index k to the end) must be equal to the substring of s (which is t[0:k]) starting at index L (i.e., t[0:k][L:] == t[k:]).\n\n        Then, if we find such a k, then s = t[0:k] and we output \"YES\" and s.\n\n        But note: there might be multiple k? Then we can output any s.\n\n        Example: t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", n=21.\n\n        Then k must be in the range: floor(21/2)+1 = 10+1 = 11 to 20.\n\n        Let k=11: then L = 2*11 - 21 = 1. Then we require:\n          s = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabra\"\n          and t[11:] = \"brakadabra\" (which is 10 characters) and s[1:] = \"brakadabra\" (also 10 characters). So they are equal.\n\n        So k=11 works.\n\n        Example: t = \"acacacaca\", n=10.\n\n        Possibilities: k from floor(10/2)+1 = 5+1 = 6 to 9.\n\n        k=6: L=2*6-10=2. Check: s = t[0:6]=\"acacac\", then t[6:] = \"acaca\", and s[2:] = \"cacaca\"[2:] -> wait, wait: s=\"acacac\", so s[2:]= \"cacac\", but t[6:] is \"acaca\". These are not equal.\n\n        k=7: L=2*7-10=4. s = t[0:7]=\"acacaca\", then t[7:]=\"ca\", and s[4:]=\"ca\" -> matches. So k=7 is valid.\n\n        Then s = \"acacaca\", and the output would be \"YES\\nacacaca\".\n\n        However, the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"YES\\nacaca\". \n\n        Why? Because the problem says: \"If there are several possibilities, output any\". \n\n        But wait, let's check with k=5: \n          k must be from 6 to 9, so k=5 is not considered. \n\n        However, note: the minimal k is floor(n/2)+1. For n=10, floor(10/2)=5, so k from 6 to 9.\n\n        But wait, what if k=5? Then L=2*5-10=0, which is not positive. So k=5 is invalid.\n\n        How about k=4? Then L=8-10=-2, invalid.\n\n        But wait, the example output uses \"acaca\" (length 5). \n\n        Let me check with k=5 (even though our formula for k minimum was floor(n/2)+1, which is 6). \n\n        Actually, we must reconsider the condition for k: \n\n        We have: n = 2*k - L, and 0 < L < k.\n\n        Then, n = 2*k - L < 2*k (since L>0) and n = 2*k - L >= 2*k - (k-1) = k+1.\n\n        So k+1 <= n < 2*k.\n\n        Then k must satisfy: k+1 <= n, so k <= n-1, and n < 2*k, so k > n/2.\n\n        Therefore, k must be in the range: floor(n/2)+1 to n-1.\n\n        For n=10, k from 6 to 9.\n\n        But then how did the example output use k=5? \n\n        Let me check the example: \n          Input: \"acacacaca\" (n=10) -> Output: \"YES\\nacaca\"\n\n        Then, s = \"acaca\", and L must be positive and less than 5.\n\n        Then, the entire string t should be: s + s[L:].\n\n        Let s = \"acaca\", then L must be chosen such that:\n          t = \"acaca\" + \"acaca\"[L:]\n\n        What L? \n          We have: t = \"acacacaca\"\n\n        Let me try L=2: \n          s[2:] = \"caca\", so t = \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\" -> matches.\n\n        Then, with s=\"acaca\", L=2, which satisfies 0<2<5.\n\n        Then, according to our condition, k=5 (the length of s) must be in the range [floor(10/2)+1, 10-1] = [6,9]. But 5 is not in that range.\n\n        So what's wrong?\n\n        Our derivation: \n          n = 2*k - L  => 10 = 2*5 - 2 -> 10=10-2? No, wait: 2*5-2=8, not 10.\n\n        Actually, the formula: \n          t = s + s[L:] \n          => length(t) = len(s) + len(s[L:]) = k + (k - L) = 2*k - L.\n\n        So for s=\"acaca\", L=2, we get: 2*5-2=8, but the length of t is 10, so that doesn't hold.\n\n        Let me break down the construction for s=\"acaca\", L=2:\n          s = \"acaca\"\n          Then s[0:5] is \"acaca\", and s[L:] = s[2:] = \"caca\", so t = \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters.\n\n        But wait, the formula for the length is: \n          len(s) + len(s[L:]) = 5 + 4 = 9? No, wait: \n          s[L:] is the substring from index L (2) to the end, which is 5-2=3 characters? Actually, no: in Python, slicing s[L:] goes from index L to the end, so the length is (5-2)=3? But \"acaca\" from index2 is \"caca\"? Actually, no: \n          \"acaca\": \n            index0: 'a'\n            index1: 'c'\n            index2: 'a'\n            index3: 'c'\n            index4: 'a'\n          So s[2:] is \"aca\", which is 3 characters.\n\n        Then t = \"acaca\" + \"aca\" = \"acacaca\", which is 7 characters, not 10.\n\n        I see, I made a mistake: the example output says \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters.\n\n        How can we get 10 characters? \n\n        Actually, the example input is \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters.\n\n        The example output says: \n          Input: ['acacacaca'] -> Output: ['YES\\nacaca']\n\n        But wait, the example output in the problem statement is:\n\n          Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n          Output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        So for \"acacacaca\", they output \"acaca\", meaning s=\"acaca\".\n\n        How is t built from s=\"acaca\"? \n          t = s + s[L:] \n\n        Let L=2: \n          s = \"acaca\", s[2:] = \"aca\", then t = \"acaca\" + \"aca\" = \"acacaca\" (length 7) -> not 10.\n\n        Let L=1: \n          s = \"acaca\", s[1:] = \"cacaca\" -> wait, wait: \n          Actually, note: the second copy is the entire s, and we are merging the last L of the first s with the first L of the second s. But in our representation, the entire second copy is present except the first L characters. \n\n        However, the problem says: the two messages are the same. So the second copy is the entire s. Then the merged string is the entire first copy and then the second copy without the first L characters.\n\n        But the example input is \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters.\n\n        How can we get 10 characters? \n          We must have: len(s) + (len(s) - L) = 2*len(s) - L = 10.\n\n        Then, if s=\"acaca\" (len=5), then 2*5 - L = 10 - L = 10 -> L=0, which is invalid.\n\n        Alternatively, if s=\"acacac\" (len=6), then 2*6 - L = 12 - L = 10 -> L=2. Then we need to check: \n          s = \"acacac\", then t = s + s[2:] = \"acacac\" + \"cacac\" = \"acaccacac\" (length 10? Let me count: \"acacac\" is 6, \"cacac\" is 5, total 11 -> not 10).\n\n        Wait, let me compute: \n          s = \"acacac\" (6 characters)\n          s[2:] = \"cacac\" (5 characters)\n          Then t = \"acacac\" + \"cacac\" = \"acaccacac\", which is 11 characters.\n\n        How about s=\"acacacac\" (8 characters)? Then 2*8 - L = 16 - L = 10 -> L=6. Then s[6:] is the substring from index6 to the end: \"acacacac\"[6:] -> \"c\", so t = \"acacacac\" + \"c\" = \"acacacc\", which is 8+1=9, not 10.\n\n        How about s=\"acacaca\" (7 characters): then 2*7 - L = 14 - L = 10 -> L=4. Then s[4:] = \"ca\", so t = \"acacaca\" + \"ca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters. And 0<4<7 -> valid.\n\n        So s=\"acacaca\", and that matches the example output? But the example output says \"acaca\", not \"acacaca\".\n\n        Wait, the example output says: \n          Input: \"acacacaca\" -> Output: \"YES\\nacaca\"\n\n        But with s=\"acacaca\", we get the correct t. \n\n        However, the example output says \"acaca\". \n\n        Let me check with s=\"acaca\": \n          We require: 2*5 - L = 10 -> L=0, invalid.\n\n        Then why does the example output say \"acaca\"?\n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: \n          \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca.\"\n\n        But the example output provided in the problem statement is:\n\n          ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        So the second element is 'YES\\nacaca'. \n\n        But wait, the example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output is \"acaca\". \n\n        However, if we use s=\"acaca\", then we cannot form \"acacacaca\" because the length equation fails (unless we allow different interpretation). \n\n        Alternatively, note that the problem says: \n          \"if there are several possibilities, output any\".\n\n        There might be multiple s that work. \n\n        Let me try s=\"acacacaca\" (the entire t) but then we require: \n          t = s + s[L:], but then the length would be 10 + (10 - L) = 20 - L, which must be 10 -> impossible.\n\n        How about s=\"acac\" (length=4): \n          Then 2*4 - L = 8 - L = 10 -> L=-2, invalid.\n\n        How about s=\"ac\": \n          2*2 - L = 4 - L = 10 -> L=-6, invalid.\n\n        How about s=\"cacaca\" (length=6): \n          Then 2*6 - L = 12 - L = 10 -> L=2. \n          Then t = \"cacaca\" + \"cacaca\"[2:] = \"cacaca\" + \"acaca\" = \"cacacacaca\", which is 10 characters? \n          \"cacacacaca\" is 10 characters: \n            c a c a c a c a c a -> no, wait: \n            \"cacaca\" is 6, \"acaca\" is 5, so total 11.\n\n        Alternatively, wait: the problem says the two messages are the same. So the second copy is the entire s. Then the merged string is the entire first copy and then the second copy without the first L characters.\n\n        But note: the example output says \"acaca\", meaning s=\"acaca\". \n\n        However, the example input is \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters.\n\n        How can s=\"acaca\" (5 characters) yield 10 characters? \n\n        We must have: \n          t = s + s[L:] \n          => 10 = 5 + (5 - L)  => 5 = 5 - L => L=0, which is invalid.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem's example output might be using a different s. \n\n        After rechecking the example: \n          The example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output is \"YES\\nacaca\".\n\n        But note: the example output in the problem statement says:\n          ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        And the example input is provided as:\n          ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n        So the second example input is \"acacacaca\", and the second example output is \"YES\\nacaca\".\n\n        Let me check if s=\"acaca\" (5 characters) can produce \"acacacaca\" (10 characters) by overlapping with a different rule? \n\n        The problem says: the two messages are the same. So both are \"acaca\". Then the merged string should be:\n          First copy: \"acaca\"\n          Second copy: \"acaca\", and we merge the last L characters of the first copy with the first L of the second copy.\n\n        The entire string would be: \n          \"acaca\" (first copy) + \"acaca\"[L:] (second copy without the first L characters)\n\n        We need the total length to be 10: \n          5 + (5 - L) = 10 -> 10 - L = 10 -> L=0,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap of some positive length `L` (where `0 < L < len(s)`). If such an `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be constructed by taking the first copy of `s` entirely and then appending the second copy of `s` starting from position `L` (i.e., skipping the first `L` characters of the second copy). This results in the total length of `t` being `2 * len(s) - L`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `k` of `s`, we check if there exists an overlap `L` such that:\n   - `0 < L < k`\n   - The substring `t[0:k]` (the first copy of `s`) concatenated with `t[k:]` (the second part of `t`) equals `s + s[L:]`.\n   - The length of `t` must satisfy `len(t) = 2*k - L`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over all possible lengths `k` of `s` from `floor(n/2) + 1` to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of `t`). For each `k`, compute `L = 2*k - n`. If `L` is positive and less than `k`, verify if `t[k:]` matches `s[L:]` where `s = t[0:k]`. If such an `s` is found, it is a valid solution.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks all possible lengths `k` from approximately `n/2` to `n-1`, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case (due to substring operations). However, given the constraint `n ≤ 100`, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    found = False\n    ans_s = None\n    \n    for k in range(n//2 + 1, n):\n        L_val = 2 * k - n\n        if L_val <= 0 or L_val >= k:\n            continue\n            \n        s_candidate = t[:k]\n        second_part = t[k:]\n        tail_of_s = s_candidate[L_val:]\n        \n        if second_part == tail_of_s:\n            found = True\n            ans_s = s_candidate\n            break\n            \n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(ans_s)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `found` (to track if a valid `s` is found) and `ans_s` (to store the valid `s`) are initialized.\n3. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `k` of `s` (from `n//2 + 1` to `n-1`), compute the overlap length `L_val = 2*k - n`.\n4. **Validation Check**: If `L_val` is within the valid range (`0 < L_val < k`), check if the substring `t[k:]` matches the tail of `s` starting at `L_val`. If they match, set `found` to `True` and store `s_candidate`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible candidates for `s` by leveraging the constraints provided, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
