For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string of three notes. We need to determine if it's a major, minor, or strange chord.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number in the 12-note scale. The notes are: \n    ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    But note: the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically. However, the example includes 'H' which is actually 'B' in some notations? \n    Wait, the example input has \"A B H\", and the note list provided is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    Actually, the problem states: \"There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\"\n\n    So the note set is fixed. We can map each note to an index (0 to 11) as follows:\n\n    Note: We are told that the distance between two consecutive notes is 1 semitone, and the scale is cyclic.\n\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we have to consider all permutations of the three notes and check the conditions.\n\n Conditions for major: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n      distance(X, Y) = 4 semitones\n      distance(Y, Z) = 3 semitones\n\n Conditions for minor: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n      distance(X, Y) = 3 semitones\n      distance(Y, Z) = 4 semitones\n\n 3. How to compute the distance between two notes?\n    Let's assign numbers to the notes:\n\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 11   # Wait, the problem says there are 12 notes. But note: the example input has \"A B H\", so we have three distinct notes.\n\n    However, wait: the example input \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's map:\n\n        C#: 1\n        B: 10\n        F: 5\n\n    Then we need to check if there's an ordering that satisfies the condition.\n\n    But note: the musical scale is cyclic. The distance from one note to another can be computed by the difference modulo 12.\n\n    However, the problem says: the distance from the lowest tone to the uppest one. But when we have three notes, we might have to consider wrapping around?\n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n\n    This implies that the distance from E to C is 8 because going from E (4) to F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10), H(11), then back to C(0) is 8 steps (from 4 to 0: 4->5,5->6,...,11->0: that's 12-4 + 0? Actually, from E to C: \n        E (4) -> F (5): 1 semitone\n        ... until C (0): 4 to 0: (0-4) mod 12? But 0-4 is negative, so we do (0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8.\n\n    So the distance from a note at index a to a note at index b is (b - a) % 12, but if negative we adjust by adding 12.\n\n    Alternatively, we can compute: (b - a) % 12, but then if we want the smallest positive distance, we take min((b-a)%12, (a-b)%12) but wait, the problem doesn't use the minimal distance. It goes from the lowest tone to the uppest one. \n\n    However, note the example: between E and C is 8 semitones. That is the forward direction from E to C (without wrapping the other way). But the problem says \"distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are only concerned with the ascending order without wrapping? Actually, the example says \"the distance between C and E is 4\" and \"between E and C is 8\". \n\n    So the distance from a lower note to a higher note (in the cyclic scale) is the difference modulo 12, but if the second note is lower in the cyclic order, then we wrap.\n\n    Actually, we are told that the scale is cyclic and the notes are repeated. But the distance from E to C is 8, meaning we are going from E to the next C (which is after the H) and that is 8 semitones.\n\n    Therefore, we should compute the distance from note a to note b as (b - a) % 12, but if negative, add 12 and then take modulo 12? Actually, we want the forward distance (ascending) from a to b. If b is less than a, then we go from a to the end and then from the beginning to b.\n\n    So: distance(a, b) = (b - a) % 12   but if (b - a) is negative, then we can do (b - a + 12) % 12? Actually, no: the example says from E (index 4) to C (index 0): (0 - 4) % 12 gives -4, which is equivalent to 8 in modulo 12 (because -4 + 12 = 8). So we can define:\n\n        def semitone_distance(a, b):\n            # a and b are indices (0-11)\n            diff = (b - a) % 12\n            # But wait, if we do (b - a) % 12, then if b < a, we get a negative? Actually, modulo operation in Python for negative: \n            # Let me check: (0 - 4) % 12 -> (-4) % 12 = 8, which is correct.\n            # But if we do (4 - 0) % 12 -> 4, which is also correct.\n            return (b - a) % 12   # This gives the forward distance from a to b, which is the same as the minimal positive distance in the circular scale? Not exactly: the minimal distance would be min((b-a)%12, (a-b)%12) but wait, the problem does not use minimal distance.\n\n    However, note: the problem defines the distance from E to C as 8, which is the non-minimal (or the long way) but actually in the example they are going from the lowest to the highest. \n\n    But wait, how do we know the order? The problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n    In the example, the chord is given as three notes. We are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. \n\n    So for a chord [X, Y, Z] we are going to try all 6 permutations and check:\n\n        For major: is there an ordering (x0, x1, x2) such that:\n            d1 = (x1 - x0) % 12   (this gives the forward distance from x0 to x1, and if negative we adjust to be positive by modulo 12)\n            d2 = (x2 - x1) % 12\n            and d1 == 4 and d2 == 3, and also the total from x0 to x2 is 7, which is (d1+d2) % 12? Actually, (4+3)%12=7, which is the same as (x2-x0)%12=7.\n\n        Similarly for minor: d1==3, d2==4.\n\n    But note: the entire circle is 12, so the distances must be the ones that add up to 7 for major and 7 for minor (since 4+3=7, and 3+4=7). Also, the third note from the first must be 7 semitones away.\n\n    However, there's a catch: the problem says the chord is an unordered set, so we can arrange the three notes in any order. But we must arrange them in increasing order (by the musical scale) without wrapping? Or can we wrap?\n\n    Example: the minor chord \"C# B F\": they say order as \"B C# F\". \n\n    Let's map:\n        B -> 10\n        C# -> 1\n        F -> 5\n\n    Now, we have to arrange them in the musical scale (cyclic) so that we can have a sequence of three. But note: the example ordering is \"B C# F\", meaning starting from B (which is 10) then to C# (1) and then to F (5). \n\n    How do we handle the cyclic order? We can consider that the scale is circular, so we can start from any note and then the next note is the one that is the next in the cycle.\n\n    However, the condition for the chord does not require the notes to be consecutive in the entire circle? They just require the distances to be 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n    But note: the example \"C# B F\" is ordered as \"B C# F\". The distances are:\n\n        From B to C#: (1 - 10) % 12 = (1-10) = -9, then -9 % 12 = 3? Actually, wait: (1-10) % 12 = (1-10) = -9, then -9 % 12 = 3 (because -9 + 12 = 3). So distance from B to C# is 3 semitones.\n\n        From C# to F: (5 - 1) % 12 = 4. \n\n    So the condition holds.\n\n    Therefore, we can compute the distance from note a to note b as (b - a) % 12, and this gives the forward distance (ascending) without worrying about the absolute position, because the modulo operation handles the wrap-around.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"the distance between C and E is 4\" and \"between E and C is 8\". So the distance from E to C is (0-4)%12 = (-4)%12=8, which is correct.\n\n    So the function is:\n\n        def dist(a, b):\n            return (b - a) % 12\n\n    But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. We have three distinct notes.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Map the input notes to their indices.\n\n        Step 2: Generate all permutations of the three notes (there are 6).\n\n        Step 3: For each permutation (x, y, z):\n\n            Check if (dist(x,y)==4 and dist(y,z)==3) OR (dist(x,y)==3 and dist(y,z)==4)\n\n            But wait, what about the entire set? The chord must consist of three distinct notes. The problem says the chord is an unordered set, so we don't have duplicates.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set, and we are given three space-separated notes. We assume they are distinct.\n\n        Step 4: If we find at least one ordering that is major, then output \"major\". Similarly for minor.\n\n        But note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous. So if we find one major ordering, we output \"major\", if we find one minor ordering, we output \"minor\", otherwise \"strange\".\n\n        However, there's a possibility: could a chord satisfy both? The problem states: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\"\n\n        So we can break early if we find a major, or a minor.\n\n        But wait: what if we have two different orderings that are major? Then we break at the first major. Similarly for minor.\n\n        However, we must check all possibilities until we find one that matches either condition.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n        Let the input be a string. We split and then for each note, we map to an index.\n\n        Mapping dictionary:\n\n            note_to_index = {\n                'C': 0,\n                'C#': 1, 'Db': 1,   # but wait, the problem uses '#' and doesn't mention 'Db'. The input will only contain the specified notation: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n                'D': 2,\n                'D#': 3, 'Eb': 3,    # However, the problem only uses the sharp notation? The example input is \"C# B F\", so we don't see flats. The problem states: \"C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\"\n                'E': 4,\n                'F': 5,\n                'F#': 6, 'Gb': 6,    # again, the problem uses sharp. Input will be consistent with the given 12 notes.\n                'G': 7,\n                'G#': 8, 'Ab': 8,\n                'A': 9,\n                'B': 10,\n                'H': 11\n            }\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\"\n\n        So we don't have to worry about flats? The input will only contain these 12 notes.\n\n        However, the example input: \"C# B F\", so we map:\n\n            'C#' -> 1\n            'B' -> 10\n            'F' -> 5\n\n        Then we generate the six permutations.\n\n        For each permutation (n1, n2, n3):\n\n            d1 = (n2 - n1) % 12\n            d2 = (n3 - n2) % 12\n\n            Then check if (d1, d2) is (4,3) for major or (3,4) for minor.\n\n        But note: the entire circle is 12, so the distance from n1 to n3 is (n3-n1)%12, which should be (d1+d2)%12. And for major: 4+3=7, for minor: 3+4=7.\n\n        However, we don't need to check that separately because the condition on d1 and d2 is independent.\n\n        But wait: what if the three notes are not consecutive in the circle? The condition requires that the two intervals are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). The total span from the first to the last is 7 semitones, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the three notes are consecutive in the entire circle. Actually, the condition is defined by the intervals between consecutive notes in the ordering.\n\n        Example: \"C E G\": \n            C:0, E:4, G:7.\n            Ordering: [0,4,7]\n            d1 = (4-0)%12 = 4\n            d2 = (7-4)%12 = 3 -> major.\n\n        Example: \"C# B F\": \n            [10,1,5] -> ordering [10,1,5] \n            d1 = (1-10)%12 = (1-10) = -9 %12 = 3\n            d2 = (5-1)%12 = 4 -> minor.\n\n        Example: \"A B H\": \n            A:9, B:10, H:11\n            Ordering: [9,10,11]: \n                d1 = (10-9)=1, d2=(11-10)=1 -> not matching.\n\n            Other orderings? We have to try all permutations.\n\n            Permutations of [9,10,11]:\n                (9,10,11): 1,1 -> no.\n                (9,11,10): (11-9)=2, (10-11)= -1 %12=11 -> no.\n                (10,9,11): (9-10)= -1 %12=11, (11-9)=2 -> no.\n                (10,11,9): (11-10)=1, (9-11)= -2 %12=10 -> no.\n                (11,9,10): (9-11)= -2 %12=10, (10-9)=1 -> no.\n                (11,10,9): (10-11)= -1 %12=11, (9-10)= -1 %12=11 -> no.\n\n            So it's strange.\n\n        However, wait: is there a chance that the chord is considered in a different cyclic representation? \n\n        The problem says the notes are cyclic. But the condition is defined by the distances in the forward direction. \n\n        Another example: what if the chord is \"C E G\" but we consider the ordering [E, G, C]? \n            [4,7,0]: \n                d1 = (7-4)=3, d2=(0-7)= -7 %12=5 -> not major.\n\n        But the condition requires the two consecutive intervals to be 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). The ordering must be the one that gives the consecutive intervals. \n\n        In the example \"C E G\", the correct ordering is [C, E, G] (the ascending order) and that gives 4 and 3. \n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify the order, so we must consider any permutation. But the condition is defined by the consecutive intervals. \n\n        Important: the condition does not require the entire chord to be consecutive, but the ordering must be such that the first two notes are separated by 4 semitones and the next two by 3, or vice versa.\n\n        But note: the entire chord is three notes. The ordering must be the one that gives the consecutive intervals. \n\n        However, the definition says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". \n\n        So we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. \n\n        Therefore, we must consider every permutation.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n            mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n            s = input().split()\n            notes = [mapping[note] for note in s]\n\n            from itertools import permutations\n            found_major = False\n            found_minor = False\n\n            for p in permutations(notes):\n                # p is a tuple of three integers: (a, b, c)\n                d1 = (p[1] - p[0]) % 12\n                d2 = (p[2] - p[1]) % 12\n\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    found_major = True\n                if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    found_minor = True\n\n            if found_major:\n                print(\"major\")\n            elif found_minor:\n                print(\"minor\")\n            else:\n                print(\"strange\")\n\n        Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"C E G\" -> [0,4,7]\n            permutations: \n                (0,4,7): d1=4, d2=3 -> major -> found_major=True\n                (0,7,4): d1=7, d2=(4-7)= -3 %12=9 -> no.\n                (4,0,7): d1=(0-4)= -4 %12=8, d2=7 -> no.\n                (4,7,0): d1=3, d2=-7%12=5 -> no.\n                (7,0,4): d1=(0-7)= -7%12=5, d2=4 -> no.\n                (7,4,0): d1=(4-7)= -3%12=9, d2= (0-4)= -4%12=8 -> no.\n\n            So it returns major.\n\n        Example 2: \"C# B F\" -> [1,10,5]\n            We need to check all permutations.

The problem says there isn't.\n\n        Example 5: What if we have a chord that is major in one ordering and minor in another? Actually, the conditions for major and minor are different: one requires (4,3) and the other (3,4). \n\n        Example: [0,4,7] is major, but is there an ordering for [0,4,7] that is minor? \n            We need (3,4). \n            Check: \n                (0,4,7): (4,3) -> major.\n                (0,7,4): (7, (4-7)= -3%12=9) -> no.\n                (4,0,7): (0-4=8, 7-0=7) -> no.\n                (4,7,0): (3, (0-7)=5) -> no.\n                (7,0,4): (0-7=5, 4-0=4) -> (5,4): no.\n                (7,4,0): (4-7=9, 0-4=8) -> no.\n\n            So [0,4,7] is only major.\n\n        Example 6: Consider [0,3,7] (which is not a standard chord). \n            Check for major: \n                (0,3,7): d1=3, d2=4 -> minor, but wait, that's minor condition. \n                But also check other orderings for major: \n                (0,7,3): d1=7, d2=(3-7)= -4%12=8 -> no.\n                (3,0,7): d1=(0-3)=9, d2=7 -> no.\n                (3,7,0): d1=4, d2=(0-7)=5 -> no.\n                (7,0,3): d1=(0-7)=5, d2=3 -> no.\n                (7,3,0): d1=(3-7)=8, d2=(0-3)=9 -> no.\n\n            So it's minor.\n\n        But wait, the condition for minor is: the ordering must have first interval 3 and second 4. Here (0,3,7) gives (3,4) so minor.\n\n        However, note: the entire chord is three notes. The condition for minor requires the two consecutive intervals to be 3 and 4. \n\n        But wait, the total from the first to the last is 7 semitones, which is the same as major. So how can [0,3,7] be minor? \n\n        Actually, the definition:\n\n            Major: ordering (X,Y,Z) with 4 and then 3.\n            Minor: ordering (X,Y,Z) with 3 and then 4.\n\n        So [0,3,7] is minor.\n\n        However, let me check with music theory: \n            A major triad is root, major third (4 semitones), then perfect fifth (7 semitones from root). \n            A minor triad is root, minor third (3 semitones), then perfect fifth (7 semitones from root).\n\n        But note: the perfect fifth from the root is 7 semitones. \n\n        In the major triad: \n            Root to third: 4 semitones, third to fifth: 3 semitones (because 7-4=3) -> but wait, the entire fifth is 7, so from root to fifth: 7, and the third is at 4, then the fifth is at 4+3=7.\n\n        In the minor triad:\n            Root to third: 3 semitones, third to fifth: 4 semitones (because 7-3=4).\n\n        So the example [0,3,7] is indeed a minor triad (root is 0=C, third is 3=D#, fifth is 7=G). \n\n        But wait, is that a valid minor triad? The notes would be C, D#, G. In standard minor triad, the third is a minor third above the root. C to Eb is minor third, but here we have C to D# (which is the same as Eb) is a minor third? \n\n        Actually, D# is the same as Eb. The note D# is the same pitch as Eb. \n\n        So the chord C, D#, G is a minor chord? \n\n        Standard C minor chord is C, Eb, G. So yes, D# is the same as Eb.\n\n        Therefore, our algorithm correctly identifies [0,3,7] as minor.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the root to be the first note. We are checking all permutations. \n\n        However, the condition for minor is that there exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the first two are 3 semitones apart and the next two are 4. \n\n        The example [0,3,7] is identified by the ordering (0,3,7) as minor.\n\n        But what if we have the same chord but in a different root? The problem says the chord is an unordered set. \n\n        However, the definition of the chord is based on the set of intervals. \n\n        Example: the chord [0,3,7] is minor. Now, if we permute, we might get an ordering that is major? \n\n        We saw that the other orderings did not yield a major.\n\n        Therefore, we output minor.\n\n        Another example: [0,3,7] is minor, but if we take [3,0,7] then the distances are (0-3)=9, and (7-0)=7 -> not major.\n\n        So the algorithm is:\n\n            Read the input, split, map to numbers.\n            Generate all 6 permutations.\n            For each permutation, compute the two consecutive distances (using modulo 12).\n            If we find one that is (4,3) then mark major and break (but we don't break the loop because we want to check for minor too? Actually, we have to check all because one ordering might be major and another minor? But the problem says no chord is both. So we can break early only if we found one, but we still have to check for the other? Actually, no: the problem says the answer is unambiguous. So if we find a major, we don't need to check for minor, and vice versa. But note: the same chord might satisfy both conditions in two different orderings? \n\n        Let me check: is there a chord that is both major and minor? \n\n        Conditions:\n            Major: exists ordering (a,b,c) such that (b-a)%12=4 and (c-b)%12=3.\n            Minor: exists ordering (a,b,c) such that (b-a)%12=3 and (c-b)%12=4.\n\n        Suppose the same set {a,b,c} satisfies both conditions. Then we must have:\n\n            Condition 1: (b-a)%12=4 and (c-b)%12=3 => (c-a)%12=7.\n            Condition 2: (b'-a')%12=3 and (c'-b')%12=4 => (c'-a')%12=7.\n\n        But note: the set is the same, so the three numbers are the same. The ordering in condition 1 is (a,b,c) and in condition 2 is (a',b',c'). \n\n        Example: is there a set {x,y,z} such that:\n\n            Without loss of generality, assume the set is {0,4,7} (major). Then we have an ordering (0,4,7) that gives (4,3). \n\n            Now, is there an ordering (x,y,z) such that (y-x)%12=3 and (z-y)%12=4? \n\n            We have the set {0,4,7}. We need to pick an ordering (x,y,z) such that y-x=3 and z-y=4, so the entire set must be {x, x+3, x+7} (mod12). \n\n            Then the set must be {x, x+3, x+7}. \n\n            Now, the set {0,4,7} must equal {x, x+3, x+7} mod12.\n\n            Let x=0: then {0,3,7}. But we have {0,4,7} and {0,3,7} are different.\n\n            Let x=4: then {4,7,11}. Not matching.\n\n            Let x=7: then {7,10,14%12=2}. Not matching.\n\n            So no.\n\n        Therefore, we can break early: if we find a major, we don't need to check for minor, and vice versa.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n        But wait: what if we find a major in one permutation and then later we might find a minor? Actually, the problem says no chord is both, so we don't have to worry about both being present.\n\n        However, we are iterating over all permutations. We can break out of the loop once we have found either a major or a minor.\n\n        But note: we might find a major first and then a minor? No, because the set is the same and the conditions are mutually exclusive. \n\n        Actually, we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n        Revised code:\n\n            mapping = ... \n            notes = [ ... ]\n\n            perms = permutations(notes)\n            found_major = False\n            found_minor = False\n\n            for p in perms:\n                d1 = (p[1]-p[0]) % 12\n                d2 = (p[2]-p[1]) % 12\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    found_major = True\n                    break   # since we found one, and the problem says unambiguous, we can break\n                if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    found_minor = True\n                    break\n\n            But wait: what if the same permutation satisfies both? Then we break at the first condition. But the problem says no chord is both, so that won't happen.\n\n            However, we are breaking the loop at the first occurrence of either condition. But what if the first condition we check is not met, but the second is? Then we break at the second condition. \n\n            Actually, we are checking in the same permutation: if the first condition is met, we break and mark major. Otherwise, we check the second condition and if that is met, we break and mark minor.\n\n            But note: the same permutation cannot be both (unless 4==3, which is false). \n\n            However, we are checking the same permutation for two different conditions. \n\n            But wait, what if a permutation satisfies the major condition? Then we break and don't check the minor condition in the same permutation. Similarly for minor.\n\n            But the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we don't care about the same permutation satisfying both.\n\n            However, we are only checking one permutation at a time. We want to know if there exists at least one major ordering and at least one minor ordering. But the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"Print 'major' if the chord is major, 'minor' if it is minor, and 'strange' if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor.\"\n\n            So we don't need to know both. We can break at the first condition met.\n\n            However, we must check all permutations until we find either a major or a minor. \n\n            But wait: the conditions are defined by the existence of an ordering. So if we find a major in one permutation, then we can immediately output \"major\" and not check the rest.\n\n            Similarly, if we find a minor in one permutation, we output \"minor\".\n\n            But what if we don't find any? Then we output \"strange\".\n\n            However, the problem does not specify the order of the conditions. We must check all permutations until we find one that meets either condition.\n\n            But note: we are breaking the loop as soon as we find one condition. So we can break the loop as soon as we find a condition.\n\n            However, the above code breaks the loop after the first condition is found, but we are not breaking the loop until we check all conditions in the same permutation? \n\n            Actually, we break the loop after the first condition is found in the current permutation. But wait, we break the loop if either condition is found.\n\n            We can restructure:\n\n            for p in perms:\n                d1 = (p[1]-p[0]) % 12\n                d2 = (p[2]-p[1]) % 12\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    print(\"major\")\n                    exit(0)   # or break and then outside we know we found major, then we break the loop and output major.\n\n            But we don't know which condition we found until we check. \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            for p in perms:\n                d1 = (p[1]-p[0]) % 12\n                d2 = (p[2]-p[1]) % 12\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    print(\"major\")\n                    exit(0)\n                if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    print(\"minor\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            Then if we don't break, then we print \"strange\"\n\n            But the problem says the input is one line, so we can do:\n\n            notes = ... (list of three integers)\n\n            from itertools import permutations\n            for p in permutations(notes):\n                d1 = (p[1]-p[0]) % 12\n                d2 = (p[2]-p[1]) % 12\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    print(\"major\")\n                    exit(0)\n                if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    print(\"minor\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            print(\"strange\")\n\n        But wait, what if we have a permutation that is minor and we break at the first condition? We must check the conditions in the same permutation: if the first condition (major) fails, then check the second (minor). \n\n        The above code does that: for a given permutation, it checks if it's major, then if it's minor. Only if neither, then move to the next permutation.\n\n        However, we are not breaking the inner condition, we are checking sequentially.\n\n        Alternatively, we can",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval requirements for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to a corresponding index (0 to 11) based on its position in the 12-note musical scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: All permutations of the three input notes are generated to explore every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated. If the intervals match the pattern of a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones), the corresponding chord type is identified.\n4. **Output Result**: The first matching chord type found determines the output. If no matching pattern is found after checking all permutations, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    mapping = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    input_str = input().split()\n    notes_indices = [mapping[note] for note in input_str]\n    \n    for p in permutations(notes_indices):\n        d1 = (p[1] - p[0]) % 12\n        d2 = (p[2] - p[1]) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n            \n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `mapping` dictionary assigns each note to a unique integer from 0 to 11, representing their positions in the cyclic musical scale.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their corresponding indices using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The code generates all possible orderings of the three input notes. For each ordering, it calculates the interval (distance in semitones) between the first and second notes (`d1`) and between the second and third notes (`d2`).\n4. **Chord Identification**: If any permutation results in `d1` being 4 and `d2` being 3, the chord is major. If `d1` is 3 and `d2` is 4, the chord is minor. The first valid chord type encountered stops further checks.\n5. **Output**: If no valid chord type is found after all permutations, the output is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the input notes to determine the chord type, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
