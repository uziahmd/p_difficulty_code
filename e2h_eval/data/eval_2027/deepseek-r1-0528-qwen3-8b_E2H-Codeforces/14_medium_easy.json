He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n        f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n Now, we are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000) and we need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. Moreover, for a fixed m, there might be a contiguous range of n that yield the same number of trailing zeros? Actually, no: the trailing zeros increase in steps. For example, from n=5 to n=9, f(n)=1; then at n=10, f(n)=2. But note that the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\", so we are looking for n such that the trailing zeros count is exactly m.\n\n But note: the sample input m=1 outputs [5,6,7,8,9] (so k=5). Then for m=5, the output is 0.\n\n Observation:\n   The function f(n) is stepwise increasing. For example, it increases by one or more at multiples of 5. So for a given m, we are looking for n such that:\n        f(n) = m\n\n However, note that sometimes multiple consecutive n can have the same m. But also note that as n increases, the trailing zeros only increase, so once we pass m, we don't come back. Therefore, the set of n with f(n)=m forms an interval (possibly empty).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (let this be L) and the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1 (let this be R). Then the numbers n such that f(n)=m are the integers from L to R-1, provided that f(L) = m and f(R-1)=m and f(R) >= m+1.\n\n However, note: the condition is exactly m. So if we let:\n        L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n        Then we must check that f(L) == m. If not, then there is no n with f(n)=m? Actually, because f is non-decreasing, if f(L) > m then there is no n with f(n)=m. But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000, and we know that for sufficiently large n, f(n) will exceed m.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n        Let R = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Then the n's that satisfy f(n)=m are the numbers from L to R-1, but only if f(L) == m. However, what if m=0? But m>=1.\n\n        But note: it is possible that there is no n such that f(n)=m. For example, when m=5, the sample output says 0.\n\n        However, the sample input was ['1', '5'] meaning two test cases: m=1 and m=5.\n\n        Example for m=1:\n            We want n such that f(n)=1.\n\n            Find the smallest n with f(n)>=1: \n                n=5 -> f(5)=1 -> so L=5.\n            Then find the smallest n with f(n)>=2: \n                n=10 -> f(10)=2 -> so R=10.\n\n            Then the numbers are from 5 to 9 (inclusive). And indeed, for n=5 to 9, the trailing zeros are 1.\n\n        Example for m=5:\n            We want n such that f(n)=5.\n\n            Find the smallest n with f(n)>=5:\n                We know:\n                    f(20)=4, f(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6 -> wait, so actually the smallest n with f(n)>=5 is 20? \n                But wait: \n                    n=20: \n                        20//5 = 4, 20//25=0 -> total 4 -> so 20 doesn't have 5 zeros.\n                    n=21: same as 20 -> 4\n                    n=22: 4\n                    n=23: 4\n                    n=24: 4\n                    n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1 -> 5+1=6.\n\n                So the smallest n with f(n)>=5 is 25? But then f(25)=6, which is greater than 5. And there's no n such that f(n)=5? \n\n            Therefore, for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\n        So the method is:\n\n          Step 1: Find L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n          Step 2: Find R = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n          Then, if f(L) != m, then there is no n with exactly m zeros -> output 0.\n\n          But wait: we defined L as the smallest n with f(n)>=m. Then by definition, f(L) is the first time we hit at least m. However, it is possible that we jump from less than m to more than m (like from 4 to 6). In that case, there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note: the n's that have exactly m zeros must be in the interval [L, R-1]. But if f(L) > m, then there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n          However, because f is non-decreasing, if f(L) > m, then even the smallest n that gives at least m already gives more than m, so no n has exactly m.\n\n          Also, if f(L) == m, then the n's from L to R-1 (if R-1 >= L) have f(n)=m.\n\n          But note: what if m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't need to worry about m=0.\n\n          How to compute f(n)? We can use the standard method: \n              def f(n):\n                  count = 0\n                  div = 5\n                  while div <= n:\n                      count += n // div\n                      div *= 5\n\n          But note: m can be up to 100000. We cannot iterate n from 1 to a very large number (because the factorial grows fast and the n for m=100000 might be around 400000 or more). So we need to find L and R without iterating over every integer.\n\n          How to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m?\n\n          We can use binary search for n. Since f(n) is monotonic, we can set:\n\n            low = 0, high = something big (like 5*m, because we know that f(5*m) >= m)\n\n          But note: the growth of f(n) is logarithmic (base 5). We can set a high bound: since f(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + ... < n/4, so we can set high = 5 * (m+1) maybe? Actually, we know that f(5*m) >= m, but maybe we can set high = 5 * (m+1) * 5? Let's think: \n\n          Actually, we can set an upper bound: the minimal n for which f(n) >= m is at most 5*m (actually, it's known that the minimal n is at most 5*(m+1) but let me check: \n\n          We know that f(n) >= n/5 (since n/5 + n/25 + ... >= n/5). So to get f(n) >= m, we need n/5 >= m => n>=5*m. So we can set high = 5*m + 100, but wait, sometimes we might need more? Actually, consider m=1: then 5*1=5, which is correct. For m=5: we need n>=25, and 5*5=25, so that works. \n\n          However, note that for m=5, the minimal n is 25, but 25 is exactly 5*5. So we can set high = 5 * m + 100? But wait, the minimal n for m might be higher than 5*m? Actually, no: because f(5*m) = (5*m)//5 + (5*m)//25 + ... = m + m//5 + m//25 + ... >= m.\n\n          So we can set high = 5 * m + 100, but wait: what if m=0? but m>=1. \n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            low = 0\n            high = 5 * m   # but we know that at n=5*m, we have at least m zeros, so we can set high = 5*m\n\n          However, note: for m=5, 5*m=25, and f(25)=6 >=5, so we are safe.\n\n          But wait, the minimal n for m might be less than 5*m? Actually, we know that the minimal n is at least 5*m? No, because we have:\n\n            f(n) = n/5 + n/25 + ... \n\n            We require f(n) >= m.\n\n            The minimal n is the smallest n such that the sum >= m.\n\n            Since n/5 + n/25 + ... <= n/4 (geometric series), so n must be at least 4*m. But we can set high to 5*m (which is a safe upper bound) because we know f(5*m) >= m.\n\n          However, we are doing binary search for the smallest n with f(n) >= m, and we know that n must be at least 0 and at most 5*m (or maybe 5*(m+1) to be safe? Actually, we know that f(5*m) = (5*m)//5 + (5*m)//25 + ... = m + m//5 + m//25 + ... which is >= m.\n\n          But what if we set high = 5*m? Then for m=5, we get 25, which is correct. But what if we set high = 5*m? Then for m=1, we get 5, which is correct.\n\n          However, there is a catch: sometimes the minimal n might be less than 5*m? \n\n          Example: m=2. \n            We need the smallest n such that f(n)>=2.\n            n=10: f(10)=2 -> so minimal n=10, which is 5*2.\n\n          Example: m=3.\n            n=15: f(15)=3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0) -> so minimal n=15, which is 5*3.\n\n          Example: m=4.\n            n=20: f(20)=4 -> minimal n=20, which is 5*4.\n\n          Example: m=5.\n            n=25: f(25)=6, but wait, we are looking for the smallest n such that f(n)>=5. Then n=20: f(20)=4 -> too low, n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6 -> so minimal n=25.\n\n          So for m=5, the minimal n is 25, which is 5*5.\n\n          But wait, is it always 5*m? Not exactly: for m=6, the minimal n is 25 (because f(25)=6). For m=7, minimal n=25? f(25)=6, then n=26:6, until n=29:6, then n=30:7. So minimal n=30 for m=7.\n\n          So the minimal n for m might be less than 5*m? Actually, no: the minimal n for m=5 is 25=5*5, for m=6 is 25, for m=7 is 30. \n\n          Actually, we can set high = 5*m + 100? Or we can use the known fact that the minimal n is at most 5*m + 5? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use binary search with high = 5 * (m+1) * 5? But that would be too high.\n\n          Actually, we can set high = 5 * (m+1) * 5? \n\n          But note: we are just doing binary search for the minimal n such that f(n)>=m, and we know that n must be at least 0 and at most ... well, we can set an upper bound: \n\n          We know that f(n) >= n/5 (approximately). So to have n/5 >= m, we need n>=5*m. But actually, we can set high = 5 * m * 5? \n\n          Alternatively, we can set high to a value that we know for sure that f(high) >= m. We know that f(5*m) >= m (as above). But we can set high = 5*m, and then if we don't find any n below 5*m, then we set high to 5*m. But wait, we know that 5*m is an upper bound.\n\n          However, the minimal n might be greater than 5*m? \n\n          Let me compute for m=5: minimal n=25, which is 5*5 -> so 5*m is 25.\n\n          For m=6: minimal n=25, which is less than 5*6=30.\n\n          So we can set high = 5*m, but then for m=5, we found 25 which is 5*5=25, okay. For m=6, we found 25 which is less than 30.\n\n          Actually, we are using the same binary search for both L and R. We need to find the minimal n for f(n)>=m and minimal n for f(n)>=m+1.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Define a function count_trailing_zeros(x):\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= x:\n                    count += x // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n                return count\n\n            Then, we want to find the minimal n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                low_bound = 0\n                high_bound = 5 * m   # This is an upper bound because f(5*m) >= m.\n\n            But wait, for m=5, we set high_bound=25, and that is correct. For m=6, we set high_bound=30, and the minimal n for m=6 is 25 (which is <=30). \n\n            However, what if m=100000? Then 5*m=500000, and the minimal n might be much lower? Actually, the minimal n for m=100000 is the smallest n such that the sum of digits (base5) is at least 100000. \n\n            But note: we know that the minimal n is at most 5*m (because f(5*m) >= m). So we can set high_bound = 5*m.\n\n            However, wait: for m=100000, 5*m=500000, and f(500000) is:\n\n                500000//5 = 100000\n                500000//25=20000\n                500000//125=4000\n                500000//625=800\n                500000//3125=160\n                500000//15625=32\n                500000//78125=4\n                500000//390625=1\n                500000//1953125=0 -> stop.\n\n                Sum = 100000+20000+4000+800+160+32+4+1 = 124997, which is way more than 100000.\n\n            So the minimal n for m=100000 is definitely less than 500000.\n\n            But we don't know the exact minimal n, but we know that our binary search will work with high_bound=5*m.\n\n            However, we must be cautious because m can be up to 100000, and 5*m is 500000, and we are doing binary search from 0 to 500000 (about 19 iterations). Then we do two binary searches (for m and m+1). That should be efficient.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            def count_trailing_zeros(n):\n                cnt = 0\n                i = 5\n                while i <= n:\n                    cnt += n // i\n                    i *= 5\n                return cnt\n\n            Then, we define:\n\n            def find_min_n_for_at_least(m):\n                # returns the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n                low = 0\n                high = 5 * m   # because we know that n=5*m gives at least m zeros.\n\n                while low < high:\n                    mid = (low + high) // 2\n                    if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n                        high = mid\n                    else:\n                        low = mid + 1\n                return low\n\n            Then:\n\n            L = find_min_n_for_at_least(m)\n            R = find_min_n_for_at_least(m+1)\n\n            Then, if count_trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n                Then there is no n with exactly m zeros -> output 0.\n\n            Otherwise, the numbers are from L to R-1.\n\n            Then we output:\n\n                k = R - L\n                Then print(k) and then print the numbers from L to R-1 (in increasing order). But note: the problem requires to output the numbers in increasing order.\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\n            Example: m=1 -> k=5, then numbers 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n            But wait: what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't handle m=0.\n\n            But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n            However, what if m=0? According to the problem, m>=1, so we don't need to handle m=0.\n\n            But what if m is very large, say 100000, and there are no n with exactly 100000 zeros? Then we output 0.\n\n            However, note: the minimal n for m=100000 is the smallest n such that f(n)>=100000. Then we check if f(L)==100000. It might be that the minimal n jumps from 99999 zeros to 100005 zeros (if there is a number that adds multiple zeros at once). Then we output 0.\n\n            Example: m=5, we saw that the minimal n for m=5 is 25, and f(25)=6 !=5, so we output 0.\n\n            But wait, how do we check? We compute count_trailing_zeros(L) and compare to m.\n\n            However, note: by the definition of L, we know that count_trailing_zeros(L) >= m, but it could be > m.\n\n            So:\n\n                if count_trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n                    print(0)\n                else:\n                    k = R - L\n                    print(k)\n                    if k > 0:\n                        # Then we output the numbers from L to R-1\n                        # But note: we cannot output a list of numbers if k is very large (like 100000 numbers) because the problem says m up to 100000, and the numbers might be very large (n can be as large as 5*m, which is 500000, and the range from L to R-1 might be a few numbers or even a large range? Actually, the range is the gap between two consecutive jumps. The gap can be up to 4 numbers (if we jump from m to m+1 at a multiple of 5) but wait, sometimes we jump by more than one.\n\n            Actually, the gap (the consecutive n that have the same number of trailing zeros) is at most 4. Why? Because when you hit a multiple of 5, you add at least one zero. But sometimes you hit a multiple of 25, then you add two zeros (one from the new factor of 5 and one from the previous accumulation). Actually, the jump in trailing zeros is the multiplicity of 5 in n. So if n is divisible by 5^k but not 5^(k+1), then adding n to the sequence will add k zeros. But note: the trailing zeros are cumulative.\n\n            Actually, the function f(n) increases by the number of times 5 divides (n+1) (if n+1 is being added) but actually we are considering n!.\n\n            However, the key is that the trailing zeros function f(n) increases by the exponent of 5 in n (if n is divisible by 5, then the increase is the exponent of 5 in n). \n\n            Therefore, the gap for a fixed m is the number of consecutive n for which the trailing zeros remain at m. Then the next jump happens when n+1 is divisible by 5 (and then the jump is the exponent of 5 in n+1). \n\n            But note: we are looking for the n such that f(n)=m. The n's that yield m are the ones that are in the interval [L, R-1] where R is the smallest n such that f(n)>=m+1.\n\n            The length of the interval is (R - L). \n\n            However, we don't need to output the entire list if the interval is very large (like 100000 numbers) because that would be too slow and use too much memory. \n\n            But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000, and the gap (the consecutive numbers with the same trailing zeros) is at most 4? \n\n            Let me check:\n\n                Consider n=24 and n=25: \n                    f(24)=4, f(25)=6 -> so for m=5, we have no solution, but for m=4, the numbers are from 20 to 24 (5 numbers). \n\n                Actually, the gap can be more than 4. \n\n            Wait, the gap is determined by the next jump. The next jump occurs at the next multiple of 5. But note, the jump at n=25 is 2 (because 25 has two factors of 5). Then the trailing zeros at n=25 is 6, so the trailing zeros for n=20 to 24 is 4, then at 25 it becomes 6. So the gap for m=4 is 5 numbers (20,21,22,23,24). \n\n            Similarly, for n=19 to 24: \n                f(19)=3, f(20)=4, then from 20 to 24: 4 zeros.\n\n            Actually, the gap for m=4 is 5 numbers. \n\n            How about m=0? (but m>=1) so we skip.\n\n            But note: the gap can be arbitrary? Actually, the gap is the distance between two consecutive jumps (when the trailing zeros increase). The jumps occur at multiples of 5, and the size of the jump is the exponent of 5 in n (the number of trailing zeros added). \n\n            However, the gap (consecutive n with the same trailing zeros) is at most 4? \n\n            Actually, no: the gap is the number of consecutive n that do not contain a factor of 5 (or more precisely, the next jump is the next multiple of 5). So the gap is at most 4, because between two multiples of 5 (say 5*k and 5*(k+1)), there are 4 numbers (5*k, 5*k+1, 5*k+2, 5*k+3, 5*k+4). \n\n            But wait, the jump at 5*k is the exponent of 5 in 5*k, which can be more than 1 (if k is divisible by 5). Then the next jump might be larger, but the gap for a fixed m is the consecutive numbers from the n that gives m until the next n that gives m+something.\n\n            Actually, the gap for a fixed m is the distance from the last jump (that increased the zeros to m) to the next jump (that increases the zeros to at least m+1). \n\n            How many consecutive n have the same trailing zeros after a jump? \n\n            After a jump at n0 (where n0 is divisible by 5^k and not by 5^(k+1)), the trailing zeros become m. Then the next jump is at the next multiple of 5 (if there isn't one that is higher power). \n\n            Actually, the next jump is the next multiple of 5, unless the current n0 is a multiple of 25, then the next jump might be at n0+5 (if n0 is 25, then the next jump is at 30? Actually, no: at 25 we added 2 zeros (so from 4 to 6). Then at 30, we add one zero (so from 6 to 7). \n\n            But note: the trailing zeros are additive. The jump at n is the exponent of 5 in n. \n\n            The gap for m is the set of n from the point where we first reached m (at some n0) until the next jump (which is the next multiple of 5). The length of the gap is the distance from n0 to the next multiple of 5, which is at most 4 (if n0 is not a multiple of 5, then the next multiple is within 4 steps). \n\n            Actually, no: the gap is the set of n from the smallest n with trailing zeros m (which we call L) to the smallest n with trailing zeros m+1 (which is R). The gap can be more than 4? \n\n            Example: m=4, L=20, R=25 -> the gap is 5 numbers (20,21,22,23,24). \n\n            So the gap can be 5. \n\n            But note: the next jump for m=4 is at 25 (which adds 2 zeros, so it jumps from 4 to 6). Then the gap for m=4 is the numbers from 20 to 24 (inclusive), which is 5 numbers.\n\n            Similarly, for m=6, the gap is from 25 to 29 (5 numbers) because at 30 we get 7.\n\n            However, what if the jump is more than 1? Then the gap for m might be broken by a jump that skips m? \n\n            Example: m=5: \n                The minimal n for m=5 is 25 (because at 20-24 we have 4, and at 25 we have 6). Then the gap for m=5 is empty because we never had 5.\n\n            So the gap length (if exists) is the distance between L and R, which is (R - L). \n\n            But note: the gap is at most 5? Actually, the gap is the number of consecutive n that do not contain a factor of 5 (except the jump at the next multiple of 5). But wait, the gap is defined by the next jump (which is the next multiple of 5). However, if the next jump is a multiple of 25, then the next jump might add more than one, but the gap for m is still the numbers until the next multiple of 5. \n\n            Actually, the gap for m is the set of n from L to the next multiple of 5 (exclusive of the next jump). But wait, the next jump is the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. \n\n            However, the gap can be arbitrarily long? \n\n            Let me think: \n\n            The trailing zeros function f(n) increases only when n is a multiple of 5. The amount of increase is the exponent of 5 in n. \n\n            The gap for a fixed m is the set of n such that the trailing zeros remain m. \n\n            Since the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5, then the gap is the set of n from L (the smallest n with trailing zeros m) to the next multiple of 5 (exclusive) but wait, if the next multiple of 5 is a multiple of 25, then the trailing zeros jump by more than one, so the gap for m is only until the previous multiple of 5? \n\n            Actually, the gap for m is the set of n from L to the next jump (which is the next multiple of 5) minus one. But note: the next jump (the next multiple of 5) will increase the trailing zeros. \n\n            However, the next jump might increase the trailing zeros by more than one (if the next multiple of 5 is divisible by 25). Then the trailing zeros go from m to m+k (k>=1). Then the gap for m is from L to the next multiple of 5 (exclusive). \n\n            But the length of the gap is (next multiple of 5 - L). \n\n            Example: m=4, L=20, next multiple of 5 is 25, so gap length = 25 - 20 = 5. \n\n            Example: m=6, L=25, next multiple of 5 is 30, so gap length = 30 - 25 = 5.\n\n            Example: m=1, L=5, next multiple of 5 is 10, so gap length=10-5=5.\n\n            Example: m=2, L=10, next multiple of 5 is 15, gap length=15-10=5.\n\n            Example: m=3, L=15, next multiple of 5 is 20, gap length=20-15=5.\n\n            Example: m=4, L=20, next multiple of 5 is 25, gap length=5.\n\n            Example: m=5: no gap because the jump from 24 to 25 is from 4 to 6, skipping 5.\n\n            So the gap is always 5 numbers, except when the trailing zeros jump over m.\n\n            But wait, what about m=0? (not applicable)\n\n            What about m=7? \n                We need to find the minimal n for m=7: \n                    We know that f(25)=6, then f(26)=6, f(27)=6, f(28)=6, f(29)=6, f(30)=7 -> so L=30.\n                Then the next jump is at 35? (since 30 adds 1, then 31-34: same, then 35 adds 1 again? Actually, 35 is divisible by 5 and 7, so exponent of 5 is 1 -> adds 1. Then f(35)=8 (from 7 at 30, then 35: 35//5=7, 35//25=1, so 7+1=8? Actually, wait:\n\n                f(30)= floor(30/5)+floor(30/25)=6+1=7.\n                f(31)=7, f(32)=7, f(33)=7, f(34)=7, f(35)= floor(35/5)+floor(35/25)=7+1=8.\n\n                So the gap for m=7 is from 30 to 34, which is 5 numbers.\n\n            But wait, what if the jump is more than one? \n\n            Example: m=10, then the minimal n for m=10: \n                We know that f(45)=? \n                45//5=9, 45//25=1, 45//125=0 -> 10.\n                So L=45? But wait, let's check:\n\n                f(40)=8, f(41)=8, f(42)=8, f(43)=8, f(44)=8, f(45)=10.\n\n                Then the gap for m=9 is from 40 to 44 (5 numbers). \n\n                And for m=10, L=45, then the next jump is at 50? \n                f(45)=10, f(46)=10, f(47)=10, f(48)=10, f(49)=10, f(50)=12 (because 50//5=10, 50//25=2, 50//125=0 -> 12).\n\n                So the gap for m=10 is from 45 to 49 (5 numbers).\n\n            But wait, why did we skip m=11? \n\n            Actually, the gaps are always 5 numbers, unless the jump is more than one and skips some m. \n\n            In summary, the gap (the consecutive n with the same trailing zeros) is always 5 numbers, except when the jump at the next multiple of 5 is more than 1, then the gap for the previous m (which is m_jump-1) is 5 numbers, and the current m might be skipped. \n\n            Therefore, the gap for a particular m is either 5 numbers (if the minimal n for m is not followed by a jump that skips m) or 0 (if the minimal n for m is followed by a jump that goes from m to m+k with k>=2).\n\n            But note: the gap for m is defined by the next jump (which is the next multiple of 5). The next jump adds the exponent of 5 in that multiple. \n\n            How does the gap relate to m? \n\n            Actually, we don't need to know the gap length by hand. We have:\n\n                L = minimal n with f(n)>=m\n                R = minimal n with f(n)>=m+1\n\n                Then the gap for m is the set of n from L to R-1, and the length is R-L.\n\n            And we output the numbers from L to R-1 (if they exist) or nothing if the gap is empty (i.e., if f(L) != m).\n\n            But note: the problem constraints: m from 1 to 100000, and the gap (if exists) is at most 5? Actually, we see that the gap is always 5 numbers, except when the jump skips m (then the gap is 0). \n\n            However, wait: \n\n            In the example for m=5, we have:\n\n                L = 25 (minimal n with f(n)>=5) and f(25)=6 !=5, so we output 0.\n\n            But what if m=6?\n\n                Minimal n for m=6: \n                    We know that f(25)=6, so L=25.\n                    Then we check f(25)==6 -> yes, so we output the numbers from 25 to R-1, where R is the minimal n with f(n)>=7.\n\n                    f(25)=6, then we need to find the smallest n>=25 with f(n)>=7.\n                    n=25:6, n=26:6, n=27:6, n=28:6, n=29:6, n=30:7 -> R=30.\n\n                    Then the numbers are from 25 to 29 (inclusive) -> 5 numbers.\n\n            So the gap is 5 numbers.\n\n            But wait, what if m=12? \n\n                We",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such integers \\( n \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is essentially the number of times 5 appears in the factorization of all numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is calculated by summing \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots \\) until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that the count of trailing zeroes in \\( L! \\) is at least \\( m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that the count is at least \\( m+1 \\). The integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition of having exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes lie in the interval \\([L, R-1]\\), provided \\( L \\)'s trailing zeroes count is exactly \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: Directly computing the trailing zeroes for large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 5 \\times 10^5 \\)) for each test case would be inefficient. Instead, we use binary search to quickly locate \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) by leveraging the monotonic nature of the trailing zeroes function.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        cnt += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return cnt\n\ndef find_min_n_for_at_least(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        return\n    \n    L = find_min_n_for_at_least(m)\n    R = find_min_n_for_at_least(m + 1)\n    \n    zeros_at_L = count_trailing_zeros(L)\n    if zeros_at_L != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = R - L\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(L, R))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **find_min_n_for_at_least(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\).
