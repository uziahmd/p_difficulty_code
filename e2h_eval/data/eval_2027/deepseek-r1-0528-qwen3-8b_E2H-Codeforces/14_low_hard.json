He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n        f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n Now, we are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000) and we need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. Moreover, for a fixed m, there might be a contiguous range of n that yield the same number of trailing zeros? Actually, no: the trailing zeros increase in steps. For example, from n=5 to n=9, we have 1 trailing zero (for n=5 to 9). Then at n=10, we get 2 trailing zeros.\n\n But note: the problem asks for n such that the factorial ends with *exactly* m zeros.\n\n Observation:\n   Let g(m) be the set of n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   Since f(n) is non-decreasing, we can find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, and then check the numbers until the trailing zeros change.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\n Steps:\n\n   We know that if we let n0 be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, then the set of n for which f(n)=m must lie in [n0, n1-1] where n1 is the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   But wait: what if there are no n such that f(n)=m? Then we output 0.\n\n   However, note the example: m=1 -> n from 5 to 9.\n\n   How to compute the smallest n such that f(n) >= m? We can use binary search.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require the exact n for each m, but the entire set of n for a given m.\n\n   However, m can be up to 100000, so we cannot iterate over n from 1 to a very large number.\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   We can first find:\n      low: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n      high: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n   Then the numbers n that satisfy f(n)=m are the numbers from low to high-1, provided that f(low)==m and f(high-1)==m.\n\n   But note: it is possible that there is no n such that f(n)=m? Actually, the trailing zeros function f(n) is strictly increasing in the sense that once we pass a multiple of 5 (or higher powers) we jump by more than one. However, note that the trailing zeros can skip some numbers. For example, when m=0, then n from 0 to 4. But here m>=1.\n\n   However, note that the problem says m>=1. So we don't have to consider m=0.\n\n   But wait: the example input '1' gives output starting with '5'. And input '5' gives output '0' meaning no n.\n\n   Why for m=5, there might be no n? Because the trailing zeros function jumps from 1 (at n=5..9) to 2 (n=10..14), then to 6 (n=25) because 25 adds two zeros (since 25=5^2). Actually, let me check:\n\n   f(24) = floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 = 4.\n   f(25) = floor(25/5)+floor(25/25)+floor(25/125)=5+1+0=6.\n\n   So indeed, there is no n such that f(n)=5.\n\n   Therefore, we need to find the set of n such that f(n)=m, and if no such n exists, we output 0.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Call this left_bound.\n   2. Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Call this right_bound.\n\n   Then the numbers n for which f(n)=m are",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such \\( n \\) values for a given \\( m \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which depends on the pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\) (lower bound) and the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (upper bound). The valid \\( n \\) values lie between these bounds, inclusive of the lower bound and exclusive of the upper bound, provided \\( f(n) = m \\).\n\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: If no \\( n \\) exists such that \\( f(n) = m \\), the output should indicate zero such values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while n >= divisor:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    low = None\n    high = None\n    left, right = 0, 5 * m\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n            low = mid\n            \n    if low is None:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_bound = low\n    zeros_low = count_trailing_zeros(left_bound)\n    \n    if zeros_low != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left, right = left_bound, 5 * (m + 1)\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m + 1:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n            high = mid\n            \n    if high is None:\n        high = left_bound\n    else:\n        high -= 1\n        \n    if count_trailing_zeros(high) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    result_count = high - left_bound + 1\n    print(result_count)\n    if result_count > 0:\n        numbers = list(range(left_bound, high + 1))\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: The binary search starts between 0 and \\( 5 \\times m \\) to find the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( f(n) \\geq m \\). This \\( n \\) is stored as `left_bound`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: Similarly, another binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( f(n) \\geq m + 1 \\). The upper bound is adjusted to `high` minus one.\n\n4. **Validation and Output**: After determining the bounds, the solution checks if the values within these bounds indeed have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. If they do, it prints the count of such numbers and the numbers themselves; otherwise, it outputs zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zeroes function, and handles edge cases where no such \\( n \\) exists.",
