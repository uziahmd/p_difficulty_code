The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

The second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, etc.\n\n Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle size is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n However, note that the ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n But note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (so the outermost rectangle is w x h). \n Then the next ring is 2 cells away, meaning the next rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4) for the next ring's border?\n\n Actually, let's break down:\n\n Example: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n\n The plate is 3x3. The first ring is the entire border. How many cells? \n   The border of a 3x3: \n      Top and bottom: 3 + 3 = 6, but wait, the corners are shared. Actually, the border of a 3x3 is:\n        Top row: 3, bottom row: 3, and the two middle rows (row1 and row2) only the two columns at the edges: 2*2 = 4? \n        So total = 3+3+2+2 = 10? \n\n But wait, the example output is 8 for \"3 3 1\". \n\n Let me re-read: the ring is defined as the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\n For the first ring (i=1): \n   The inner rectangle is (w - 0) x (h - 0) = 3x3.\n   The border of a 3x3: \n        Top: 3, bottom: 3, left: 1 (because we don't count the top and bottom again for the sides? Actually, no: the border is the outer part of the rectangle.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\", so we are gilding the outer edge.\n\n How to compute the border of an n x m rectangle?\n   The border (if we consider the rectangle as having no internal structure) has:\n     top: m\n     bottom: m\n     left: n - 2\n     right: n - 2\n\n   But wait: in the 3x3 example, if we use this formula for the first ring (n=3, m=3):\n        top: 3, bottom: 3, left: 3-2 = 1, right: 3-2 = 1 -> total = 3+3+1+1 = 8.\n\n   That matches.\n\n   Now, what about the second ring? \n        The second ring uses the inner rectangle of size (w-4) x (h-4). \n        For the example \"7 9 2\": \n            First ring: inner rectangle is 7x9 -> border: top:9, bottom:9, left:5, right:5 -> 9+9+5+5 = 28 -> which is the first example's output for k=1, but wait the input was \"7 9 1\" giving 28.\n\n        Now, for the second ring (k=2): \n            The inner rectangle for the second ring is (7-4*1) x (9-4*1) = 3x5.\n            Then the border of 3x5: \n                top:5, bottom:5, left:1, right:1 -> 5+5+1+1 = 12.\n            Total gilded cells = 28 (first ring) + 12 (second ring) = 40.\n\n        The example input \"7 9 2\" gives 40.\n\n   So the formula for the i-th ring (with i starting at 1) is:\n        Let n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        Let m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        Then the number of cells in the i-th ring is: \n            If n_i < 3 or m_i < 3, then we cannot form a ring (but the input condition ensures k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so the ring will be valid).\n\n        The ring's border: \n            top = m_i\n            bottom = m_i\n            left = n_i - 2\n            right = n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed inside the previous one, starting from the edge of the plate. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the i-th ring are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where w and h are the original dimensions of the plate. The number of cells in each ring is calculated as the perimeter of this inner rectangle minus the corners (since they are counted twice). Specifically, for an inner rectangle of size n x m, the number of cells in its border is 2*(n + m) - 4, which simplifies to 2*n + 2*m - 4.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. Then, using the formula derived above, calculate the number of cells in that ring. Sum these values across all k rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the k rings once, performing constant-time operations for each. Since k is at most floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4), the complexity is O(k), which is efficient given the constraints (w, h ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    w = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    k = int(data[2])\n    \n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if n_i < 3 or m_i < 3:\n            break\n        total_cells += 2 * (n_i + m_i) - 4\n    \n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize `total_cells` to 0, which will accumulate the number of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - **Calculate Inner Dimensions**: The inner rectangle's dimensions are derived by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both width and height. This adjustment accounts for the cells occupied by previous rings.\n   - **Check Validity**: If the inner dimensions become less than 3 in either direction, the loop breaks as further rings cannot be formed.\n   - **Compute Ring Cells**: The number of cells in the current ring is calculated using the formula `2*(n_i + m_i) - 4`, which effectively computes the perimeter of the inner rectangle while adjusting for overlapping corners.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of gilded cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and ensures correctness by validating each ring's dimensions before processing.",
