After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line as two integers n and m, then n lines each with m characters (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is one student's grades for m subjects).\n\n We are to count the number of successful students. A student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., no other student has a higher mark for that subject).\n\n Approach:\n For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), we can find the maximum mark. Then, for each student i, we check for at least one subject j where:\n    gradebook[i][j] == max_mark for subject j, and note: if there are multiple students with the same maximum mark, they are all considered best in that subject.\n\n However, note: being best in a subject requires having the highest mark. So for subject j, the best mark is the maximum in that column.\n\n But caution: if multiple students have the same highest mark in a subject, they are all best in that subject.\n\n Now, for a student to be successful, he must be the best in at least one subject.\n\n We can do:\n   For each subject j, compute max_j = max(gradebook[i][j] for all i)\n\n   Then, for each student i, check for any subject j: \n        gradebook[i][j] == max_j   [for that j]\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the same student to be best in multiple subjects. We just need one subject.\n\n But wait: what if two students are best in the same subject? Then both are successful because they have at least one subject (that one) where they are best.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Option 1:\n   Precompute for each subject j, the maximum value and also note which students achieved that maximum (but we don't need to store which ones, just for each student we check per subject).\n\n However, we can do:\n\n   Let's create a list `max_marks` for each subject j: max_marks[j] = max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n   Then, for each student i, we check for any subject j from 0 to m-1:\n        if int(grades[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:   -> then this student is successful.\n\n   But wait: the marks are given as characters, so we can compare by character? Since the marks are digits from '1' to '9', the lex order is same as numeric order.\n\n   Alternatively, we can convert to int, but note: the input is given as a string of digits without spaces.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   Steps for example:\n        n=3, m=3\n        grades = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n        For subject0 (index0): \n            column0: '2','2','1' -> max is '2'\n        For subject1 (index1):\n            column1: '2','3','1' -> max is '3'\n        For subject2 (index2):\n            column2: '3','2','2' -> max is '3'\n\n        Now, for student0: \"223\"\n            subject0: '2' == '2' -> True (so student0 is successful, we can break for this student)\n            subject1: '2' != '3'\n            subject2: '3' == '3' -> True (but we already found one, so we break)\n\n        Student1: \"232\"\n            subject0: '2'=='2' -> True -> successful\n\n        Student2: \"112\"\n            subject0: '1' != '2'\n            subject1: '1' != '3'\n            subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n        So output is 2.\n\n   But wait, the example says: \n        student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3 -> note: the problem indexes subjects starting at 1? \n        Actually, the problem states: \n          \"student number 1\" (which is the first row) is best at subjects 1 and 3.\n\n        In our 0-indexed, subject0 is the first subject. But the example says subject1 and subject3? \n        The example input: \n          223\n          232\n          112\n\n        The subjects are three: \n          Subject1: grades are 2,2,1 -> so the best is 2 (appearing in two students) -> so student1 (first) and student2 (second) are best in subject1.\n          Subject2:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves analyzing a gradebook where each student's marks across multiple subjects are given as characters. For each subject, we need to find the highest mark. A student is successful if, for any subject, their mark matches the highest mark in that subject.\n2. **Intuition**: For each subject, the highest mark determines the best students. We can precompute the maximum mark for each subject. Then, for each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Read the input values, which include the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook entries.\n   - For each subject, compute the maximum mark by examining the corresponding column in the gradebook.\n   - For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If yes, the student is marked as successful.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves processing each element in the gradebook once to find column maxima (O(n*m)) and then checking each student against these maxima (O(n*m)), resulting in an overall O(n*m) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grades = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grades.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_max = '0'\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grades[i][j] > col_max:\n                col_max = grades[i][j]\n        max_marks[j] = col_max\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count_successful += 1\n            \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Subsequent lines contain the gradebook entries.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by scanning all student entries for that subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, we check if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, the student is counted as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons to achieve the desired result.",
