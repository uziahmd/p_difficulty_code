The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of rounds where Nikephoros loses and where Polycarpus loses.\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we note that the sequences A and B are cyclic. Let m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n In round i (0-indexed), Nikephoror uses A[i % m] and Polycarpus uses B[i % k].\n\n We are to count:\n   - The number of rounds where Nikephoros loses: \n        (A[j], B[l]) such that (A[j] == 'R' and B[l] == 'S') OR\n        (A[j] == 'S' and B[l] == 'P') OR\n        (A[j] == 'P' and B[l] == 'R')\n     But note: in a round, if the two items are the same, it's a draw (no one loses). Otherwise, the rules above determine the winner.\n\n However, note: in each round, there is exactly one outcome. We are only concerned with the losses for each player.\n\n Actually, we can break down the rounds:\n\n   For a given round i (0-indexed):\n      Let a = A[i % m]\n      Let b = B[i % k]\n\n      Then:\n        If a == b: no red spot.\n        Else:\n            If (a, b) is one of: ('R','P'), ('P','R'), ('S','R')? Let me check:\n\n            Actually, the rules:\n                Rock beats Scissors -> so if a='R' and b='S', then a wins -> so b loses (Polycarpus loses).\n                Similarly, if a='S' and b='P', then a wins -> Polycarpus loses.\n                If a='P' and b='R', then a wins -> Polycarpus loses.\n\n            And for the other cases (when a loses):\n                If a='R' and b='S' -> wait, no: actually, the rules say:\n                    Rock (a) vs Paper (b): Paper beats Rock -> so if a='R' and b='P', then Polycarpus wins (so Nikephoros loses).\n                    Similarly, if a='S' and b='R': Scissors vs Rock -> Rock beats Scissors -> so Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros loses).\n                    If a='P' and b='S': Paper vs Scissors -> Scissors beats Paper -> so Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros loses).\n\n            So we have two sets of outcomes:\n\n            When does Nikephoros lose?\n                (a, b) = ('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')\n\n            When does Polycarpus lose?\n                (a, b) = ('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')\n\n Therefore, we need to count for each round i from 0 to n-1:\n\n    Let i1 = i % m, i2 = i % k.\n\n    Then:\n        If (A[i1], B[i2]) is in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')] -> then Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n        Else if (A[i1], B[i2]) is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n But note: the entire game has n rounds, and n can be very large (up to 2e9). \n\n Approach:\n\n Let M = LCM(m, k) [the least common multiple of the lengths of A and B] but note: we don't necessarily need the LCM for the entire cycle? Actually, we can consider one full cycle of both sequences: which is LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n However, note that we have two independent cycles. We can precompute the outcomes for all pairs (i mod m, j mod k) for i,j in [0, min(m*k)-1] but wait: we are going to use the same index i for both (so i mod m and i mod k). The entire pattern repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the total number of red spots for one full cycle (of length T = LCM(m,k)). But note: we are indexing by i (from 0 to T-1) and then the next cycle starts.\n\n 2. Then, the total number of full cycles in n rounds is: cycles = n // T\n 3. Then, the remainder rounds: rem = n % T\n\n 4. Then, total red spots for Nikephoros = cycles * (number of times he loses in T) + (number of times he loses in the first rem rounds)\n Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n However, note: the outcome for round i depends on (i % m, i % k). We can precompute for i from 0 to T-1 (where T = LCM(m,k)) the outcome for each round.\n\n But T might be as large as m*k (if m and k are coprime, then T = m*k, and m,k <=1000, so T <= 1e6, which is acceptable).\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid computing LCM by iterating over the product of the two cycles? But we can compute T = (m * k) // gcd(m,k)\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, string A, string B.\n\n   Step 2: Compute T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n   Step 3: Precompute an array for one cycle of T rounds.\n\n        Let base_cycle = []   # Each element is a tuple (nike_loses, poly_loses) for a round? Or just record the outcome for each round.\n\n        But we don't need the entire history, we can just count.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute the counts for one cycle:\n\n            nike_count = 0\n            poly_count = 0\n\n            for i in range(T):\n                a_index = i % m\n                b_index = i % k\n\n                a_char = A[a_index]\n                b_char = B[b_index]\n\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    # nothing\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]:\n                    poly_count += 1\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    nike_count += 1\n\n        Then, the counts for one cycle are (nike_count, poly_count)\n\n   Step 4: Let full_cycles = n // T\n        Then, total_nike = full_cycles * nike_count\n        total_poly = full_cycles * poly_count\n\n   Step 5: Now, handle the remaining rounds (0 to rem-1, where rem = n % T)\n\n        For i in range(rem):\n            a_index = i % m\n            b_index = i % k\n\n            a_char = A[a_index]\n            b_char = B[b_index]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]:\n                total_poly += 1\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                total_nike += 1\n\n   Step 6: Print total_nike and total_poly.\n\n However, note: the above approach uses T = LCM(m,k) which is at most 1e6 (since m,k <=1000, the LCM is at most 1000*1000=1e6, and then we iterate T once and then the remainder (which is less than T) so worst-case 1e6 + 1e6 = 2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait: n can be up to 2e9, and T is the LCM, which is the LCM of two numbers <=1000. The maximum LCM is 1000*1000//gcd(1000,1000)=1000. Actually, the maximum LCM for two numbers <=1000 is 1000*1000 (if they are coprime) but 1000*1000=1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we must compute the GCD and LCM correctly.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid using the LCM cycle by using the fact that the two cycles repeat independently. We can use the concept of the period being the LCM, but we don't have to if we use two separate cycles.\n\n But the above method is standard for cyclic sequences.\n\n However, note: the round i uses (i%m, i%k). The sequence of pairs (i%m, i%k) repeats every T rounds, where T is the LCM of m and k.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   import math\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   A_str = input().strip()\n   B_str = input().strip()\n\n   m = len(A_str)\n   k = len(B_str)\n\n   # If n==0, then answer is (0,0)\n   if n == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        exit(0)\n\n   # Compute the LCM of m and k\n   def gcd(a, b):\n        if b == 0:\n            return a\n        return gcd(b, a % b)\n\n   T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n   # Count for one full cycle (T rounds)\n   nike_count_cycle = 0\n   poly_count_cycle = 0\n\n   # We'll iterate i from 0 to T-1\n   for i in range(T):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n\n        # Check for Polycarpus losing (when Nikephoros wins)\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]:\n            poly_count_cycle += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            nike_count_cycle += 1\n\n   full_cycles = n // T\n   remainder = n % T\n\n   total_nike = full_cycles * nike_count_cycle\n   total_poly = full_cycles * poly_count_cycle\n\n   for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]:\n            total_poly += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            total_nike += 1\n\n   print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\n However, note: the above condition checks are correct?\n\n Let me verify:\n\n   Condition for Polycarpus losing (i.e., Nikephoros wins): \n        (a_char, b_char) = \n            ('R','P'): R vs P -> R loses (because P beats R) -> so this is a win for Polycarpus (so Polycarpus doesn't get a red spot, but Nikephoros loses? Wait, no: we defined:\n\n        Actually, in our breakdown:\n            If (a_char, b_char) is in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')] -> then Polycarpus loses (meaning Nikephoros wins) -> so we add to poly_count_cycle? \n\n        But wait, let's re-read:\n\n            We defined:\n                (a_char, b_char) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')] means Polycarpus loses.\n\n            However, in the sample:\n\n                Round 1: R - R -> Draw.\n                Round 2: P - S -> Nikephoros loses (because P vs S: P beats S? Actually, no: the rules: \n                    Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock.\n\n                So in round 2: \n                    Nikephoros: P, Polycarpus: S -> P beats S? Actually, yes: because Paper beats Rock? Wait, no: the rule says \"the scissors beat the paper\", so actually:\n\n                Let me clarify the rules:\n\n                    Rock beats Scissors -> so if I show Rock and you show Scissors, I win.\n                    Scissors beats Paper -> so if I show Scissors and you show Paper, I win.\n                    Paper beats Rock -> so if I show Paper and you show Rock, I win.\n\n                So for round 2: \n                    Nikephoros: P (Paper), Polycarpus: S (Scissors) -> \n                    According to the rule: Scissors beats Paper -> so Polycarpus wins (because his Scissors beat Nikephoros's Paper). \n\n                But wait, the problem says: \"the loser gets pinched\". So in round 2, Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\n                Now, our condition for Polycarpus losing (meaning he is the one who loses) should be when his item is beaten by Nikephoros's.\n\n                So for Polycarpus to lose, his item must be beaten by Nikephoros's.\n\n                How do we map?\n\n                Let's list:\n\n                Outcome table:\n\n                    Nikephoros \\ Polycarpus | R       S       P\n                    --------------------------------------------\n                    R                         Draw   Win (for N)   Lose (for N)\n                    S                         Lose (for N)   Draw   Win (for N)\n                    P                         Win (for N)   Lose (for N)   Draw\n\n                Alternatively, we can see:\n\n                When does Polycarpus lose?\n                    He loses when his item is beaten by Nikephoros's.\n\n                    His item is R: beaten by S -> so if Nikephoros shows S and Polycarpus shows R, then Polycarpus loses.\n                    His item is S: beaten by P -> so if Nikephoros shows P and Polycarpus shows S, then Polycarpus loses.\n                    His item is P: beaten by R -> so if Nikephoros shows R and Polycarpus shows P, then Polycarpus loses.\n\n                So the conditions for Polycarpus losing (and hence Nikephoros wins) are:\n\n                    (a_char, b_char) = (S,R), (P,S), (R,P)\n\n                Similarly, for Nikephoros losing (Polycarpus wins):\n\n                    (a_char, b_char) = (R,S), (S,P), (P,R)\n\n                Therefore, the conditions above are reversed.\n\n                Correction:\n\n                We had initially:\n\n                    Condition for Polycarpus losing (i.e., when Nikephoros wins): [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]\n\n                But according to the table:\n\n                    For Polycarpus to lose, we need:\n\n                        (a_char, b_char) = (S,R) -> then Polycarpus loses (his R is beaten by S) -> so this is correct for the above condition? \n\n                    Let's check:\n\n                        Condition set: [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]\n\n                    Now, for (S,R): that is included.\n\n                    But also (R,P): that is included, and (P,S) is included.\n\n                However, wait: the table for (R,P): \n                    a_char = 'R', b_char = 'P'\n                    Then: R vs P -> P beats R, so Polycarpus wins (so Nikephoros loses) -> so this condition should not be for Polycarpus losing.\n\n                So I think I got the condition backwards.\n\n                Let me reassign:\n\n                We want to count:\n\n                    For a round (a, b):\n\n                    If (a, b) is one of:\n                        (R, S): then a wins (because R beats S) -> so Polycarpus (who showed S) loses -> add to Polycarpus count? \n                            But wait, the problem: \"the loser gets the red spot\".

Because in every round: \n            A_str = \"RRRRRRRR\", B_str = \"R\"\n\n        So for any i: \n            a_char = 'R', b_char = 'R' (since B has only one char, and i % 1 is always 0 -> 'R')\n\n        Therefore, all rounds are draws.\n\n        So the code should output (0,0).\n\n        Let me run the code for n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\":\n\n          m=8, k=1 -> T = (8*1)//gcd(8,1)=8\n\n          Cycle of 8 rounds:\n\n            i=0: (R,R) -> skip\n            i=1: (R,R) -> skip\n            ... all 8 rounds are skips.\n\n          So full_cycles = 5//8 = 0, remainder=5 rounds.\n\n          Then we iterate i from 0 to 4:\n\n            Each time: (R,R) -> skip.\n\n          So total_nike=0, total_poly=0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n  Another example: \n        Input: \n          1\n          R\n          S\n\n        Expected: Nikephoros loses (because R vs S: R loses) -> so output \"1 0\"\n\n        Condition: (a_char, b_char) = ('R','S') -> in [('R','S'),('S','P'),('P','R')] -> so Polycarpus loses (meaning Nikephoros wins) -> so we add to Nikephoros? \n\n        Wait, no: the condition for Polycarpus losing is [('R','S'),('S','P'),('P','R')]. \n\n        In this case, ('R','S') is in that set, so we add to Poly_count_cycle? \n\n        But the problem: \n            The outcome: \n                Nikephoros: R, Polycarpus: S -> R vs S: R loses (so Polycarpus wins) -> so Polycarpus loses? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: the loser gets the red spot.\n\n        In this round, Nikephoros loses (so he gets a red spot). \n\n        But wait, our condition says: \n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                poly_count_cycle += 1   # meaning Polycarpus loses (so we count a red spot for Polycarpus)\n\n        But in this round, Polycarpus did not lose, Nikephoros lost.\n\n        So there is a confusion in the condition.\n\n        Let me re-map:\n\n            We defined:\n                Polycarpus loses (so we count a red spot for Polycarpus) if the outcome is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n\n            But in the round (R,S): \n                According to the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently handling large `n` (up to 2·10^9) without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). The outcome of each round depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The loser of each round gets a red spot. The key observation is that the sequences repeat cyclically, so the outcomes also repeat every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of processing each of the `n` rounds one by one, we can leverage the periodic nature of the sequences. We first compute the outcome for one full cycle (of length `T`). Then, the total number of red spots for each player is the sum of red spots from all complete cycles multiplied by the number of full cycles, plus the red spots from the remaining incomplete cycles.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Calculate `T` as the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This `T` represents the number of rounds after which the combined state of both sequences repeats.\n   - **Cycle Processing**: For each round in one full cycle (`0` to `T-1`), determine the outcome (whether Nikephoros or Polycarpus loses) based on their moves. Count these losses for the cycle.\n   - **Total Calculation**: Multiply the counts from one cycle by the number of full cycles (`n // T`) and then process the remaining `n % T` rounds individually to get the final counts.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes `T` rounds once, where `T` is the LCM of the sequence lengths (up to 1,000,000 for sequences of length 1000). The remainder processing is linear in the number of remaining rounds (less than `T`). Thus, the overall complexity is O(T + n % T), which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    B_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        if b == 0:\n            return a\n        return gcd(b, a % b)\n        \n    g = gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n    \n    nike_count_cycle = 0\n    poly_count_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            poly_count_cycle += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('R','P'), ('P','S')]:\n            nike_count_cycle += 1\n            \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    total_nike = full_cycles * nike_count_cycle\n    total_poly = full_cycles * poly_count_cycle\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            total_poly += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('R','P'), ('P','S')]:\n            total_nike += 1\n            \n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by two strings representing the sequences of moves for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences (`T`) is computed to determine the cycle length after which the game state repeats.\n3. **Cycle Processing**: For each round in one full cycle (`0` to `T-1`), the moves of both players are determined using modulo arithmetic. The outcome (loss) is counted if the moves do not result in a draw.\n4. **Total Loss Calculation**: The total losses for each player are computed by multiplying the cycle losses by the number of full cycles and then processing any remaining rounds individually.\n5. **Output**: The final counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, avoiding the need for individual round processing.",
