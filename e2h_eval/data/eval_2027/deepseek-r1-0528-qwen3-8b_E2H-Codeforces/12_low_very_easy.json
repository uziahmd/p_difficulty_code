The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers.\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) and we start at house 1, we can think of the houses as a circular array.\n\n However, note: The problem says that initially Xenia is at house 1. Then she has to complete tasks in order. For the i-th task, she must be at house a_i and also have completed all tasks before.\n\n Important: The ringroad is clockwise and one-way. So from a house i, moving clockwise: i -> i+1 (if i < n) or i->1 (if i==n).\n\n But note: the problem does not require to go back to house 1 after each task. Instead, we can consider the entire journey as a sequence of moves.\n\n Observation:\n Since we must complete tasks in increasing index order (the condition: for the i-th task, we must complete all tasks with numbers less than i) and the tasks are given in the order of i from 0 to m-1.\n\n We can break the journey into segments between consecutive tasks (including the start from house 1 to the first task, then between tasks, and then if we need to go from the last task back to house 1? Actually, note: the condition only requires that we do the tasks in order, but we don't necessarily have to end at house 1. However, the problem does not specify that we must return to house 1, so we just need to complete the last task and stop.\n\n But wait: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" gives output 6.\n\n Let's simulate:\n\n Start at house 1.\n\n Task1: must be at house 3.\n   From 1 to 3: clockwise: \n        1->2 (1 step), 2->3 (another step): total 2 steps.\n\n Then from house 3 to house 2 (for task2):\n   Since we are at 3, and we need to go to 2: \n        In clockwise, from 3 we can go: 3->4 (step 1), then 4->1 (step 2), then 1->2 (step 3). But wait, is there a shorter way?\n        Alternatively, we can consider the ring: the clockwise movement from 3 to 2 is going the long way? Actually, no: the ring is one-way. We must move clockwise. So the path from 3 to 2 is: 3->4->1->2 (which is 3 steps).\n\n Then from house 2 to house 3 (task3):\n        From 2: 2->3 (1 step).\n\n Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"she needs to complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that the tasks are in order. But the example does not require her to return to house 1 at the end, so we don't have an extra segment.\n\n But wait, what if we consider that after completing a task we might not need to go all the way around? Actually, we are allowed to traverse the ring arbitrarily.\n\n Alternate approach: since the ring is circular, we can consider the positions modulo n.\n\n However, note: the problem is that we are moving in a fixed direction (clockwise). So from any house i, to get to house j, the distance is:\n\n If j >= i: then we can go from i to j by moving forward (j - i) steps.\n\n If j < i: then we have to go from i to n (n - i steps) and then from n to 1 (but wait, the ring is circular and we are at house i, then the next house is i+1, until we reach n, then 1, etc.)\n\n Actually, the clockwise distance from i to j is:\n   If j >= i: d1 = j - i\n   If j < i: d1 = (n - i) + j   [because we go from i to n (n-i steps), then from n to 1, and then from 1 to j (j steps)]\n\n But wait, let me check: \n   n=4, i=3, j=2: \n        d1 = (4-3) + 2 = 1+2 = 3. Correct.\n\n However, note: the example also goes from 1 to 3: \n   i=1, j=3: d1 = 3-1 = 2. Correct.\n\n But wait: the example then from 3 to 2: 3 steps, and then from 2 to 3: 1 step. So total 2+3+1=6.\n\n However, the above formula for the distance from i to j is correct.\n\n But note: the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks, given that she starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in a specific order. The houses are arranged in a circular ring, and movement is only allowed in a clockwise direction. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must visit a sequence of houses specified by the task list. Each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time. The challenge is to compute the total time taken to move from her starting position through each task's location in the given order.\n2. **Key Insight**: The ring structure means that moving from a higher-numbered house to a lower-numbered house requires going around the ring (from the current house to the end of the ring and then wrapping around to the target house). The distance between two houses can be calculated based on their positions:\n   - If the target house is ahead of the current house, the distance is simply the difference between their positions.\n   - If the target house is behind, the distance is the sum of the steps from the current house to the end of the ring and then from the start of the ring to the target house.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We process each task in sequence, calculating the time taken to move from the previous task's house (or the starting position for the first task) to the current task's house. The total time is the cumulative sum of these individual movement times.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += a - current\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current + a)\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: `total_time` keeps track of the cumulative time taken, and `current` stores the current house position, starting at house 1.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location:\n   - If the task location is greater than or equal to the current position, the time taken is the difference between the task location and the current position.\n   - If the task location is less than the current position, the time taken is the sum of the steps from the current position to the end of the ring (`n - current`) and the steps from the start of the ring to the task location (`a`).\n4. **Updating Position**: After processing each task, the current position is updated to the task's location.\n5. **Output**: The total time taken to complete all tasks is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ring road and straightforward arithmetic to determine movement distances between consecutive tasks.",
