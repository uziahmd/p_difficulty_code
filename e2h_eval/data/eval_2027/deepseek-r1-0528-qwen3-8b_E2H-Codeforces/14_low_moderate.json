He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n        f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n But note: We are given m (the exact number of trailing zeros) and we want to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the value of n for a fixed m, but the set of n for which the factorial has exactly m zeros.\n\n Observation:\n   The function f(n) is non-decreasing. Also, note that if we let n0 be the smallest integer such that f(n0) >= m, then we can look for n in an interval around n0.\n\n But note: There might be gaps. For example, if m=5, then note that:\n     f(20)=4, f(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6 -> so there's no n with f(n)=5.\n\n Therefore, we must check for each m if there exists any n such that f(n)=m.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (let this be L).\n 2. Then, we need to find the largest n such that f(n) <= m (let this be R).\n\n However, note: we are only interested in the n for which f(n)=m.\n\n But wait: what if m is very large? We have to be careful.\n\n However, note that the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We know that the sequence of trailing zeros increases, but sometimes jumps (like from 4 to 6 at n=25). So, we are looking for an interval [a, b] such that for every n in [a, b], f(n)=m, but if there's a jump, then there might be no solution.\n\n Actually, we are to output:\n   First, the number k of such n.\n   Then, the k integers (if k>0) in increasing order.\n\n Example: \n   Input: 1 -> Output: 5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\n Why? Because:\n   f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, and then f(10)=2.\n\n So, for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n But for m=5, there is no n such that f(n)=5. So we output 0.\n\n How to compute?\n\n   We can use binary search to find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m (lower_bound) and the minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1 (to get the upper_bound for the previous m, or alternatively, we can find the maximal n such that f(n) <= m).\n\n   Actually, we want:\n      Let L = minimal n such that f(n) >= m.\n      Then, we want to check the value of f(L) and also see how many consecutive n have f(n)=m.\n\n   However, note: once we have L, then the next n that might change the trailing zeros is when we hit a multiple of 5 (or higher powers). But note: the trailing zeros only increase when we hit multiples of 5, and the jump might skip m.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      Let left = minimal n such that f(n) >= m.\n      Then, we can check if f(left) == m. If not, then there's no n with f(n)=m.\n\n      But wait, consider: the minimal n such that f(n)>=m might have f(n)=m, or it might be greater than m (because of the jump). So we need to check the value at left.\n\n      Actually, we can define:\n          low = minimal n such that f(n) >= m.\n          high = minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n      Then, the set of n with f(n)=m is the set of n from low to high-1, provided that f(low)==m and f(high)==m+1. But note: if f(low) != m, then there is no solution.\n\n      However, wait: the minimal n for which f(n)>=m",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such integers \\( n \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is essentially the number of times 5 appears in the prime factorization of the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   where the sum continues until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( f(L) \\geq m \\) and the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( f(R) \\geq m + 1 \\). The integers \\( n \\) for which \\( f(n) = m \\) lie in the interval \\([L, R - 1]\\), provided \\( f(L) = m \\). If \\( f(L) \\neq m \\), no such integers exist.\n\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: Special cases include \\( m = 0 \\) (though the input ensures \\( m \\geq 1 \\)), and large values of \\( m \\) where no \\( n \\) satisfies \\( f(n) = m \\) due to jumps in the count of trailing zeroes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while n >= divisor:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    \n    if m == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n            \n    L = low\n    \n    high_next = 5 * (m + 2)\n    high_bound = 0\n    low_bound = 0\n    while low_bound < high_next:\n        mid_bound = (low_bound + high_next) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid_bound) < m + 1:\n            low_bound = mid_bound + 1\n        else:\n            high_next = mid_bound\n            \n    R = low_bound\n    \n    if count_trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = R - L\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(L, R))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n            \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by counting the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., up to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound (L)**: The binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\). This is done by adjusting the search range based on whether the midpoint's trailing zeroes are less than \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound (R)**: Similarly, another binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m + 1 \\). The difference between \\( R \\) and \\( L \\) gives the count of integers \\( n \\) where \\( f(n) = m \\).\n\n4. **Output**: If the lower bound \\( L \\) does not satisfy \\( f(L) = m \\), the output is 0. Otherwise, the integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\) are printed, representing all \\( n \\) where \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zeroes function \\( f(n) \\), ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
