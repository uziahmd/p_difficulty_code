The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers.\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) and we start at house 1, we can think of the houses as a circular array.\n\n However, note: The problem says that initially Xenia is at house 1. Then she has to complete tasks in order. For the i-th task, she must be at house a_i and also have completed all tasks before.\n\n Important: The ringroad is clockwise and one-way. So from a house i, moving clockwise: i -> i+1 (if i < n) or i->1 (if i==n).\n\n But note: the problem does not require to go back to house 1 after each task. Instead, we can consider the entire journey as a sequence of moves.\n\n Observation:\n Since we must complete tasks in increasing index order (the condition: for the i-th task, we must complete all tasks with numbers less than i) and the tasks are given in the order of i from 0 to m-1.\n\n We can break the journey into segments between consecutive tasks (including the start from house 1 to the first task, then between tasks, and then if we need to go from the last task back to house 1? Actually, note: the problem says \"complete all tasks\" and the next task must be done, but there is no requirement to end at house 1. However, the problem only asks for the minimum time to complete all tasks.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Start at house 1.\n 2. For each task i, we must be at house a_i (the i-th task's house). Also, note that the tasks might be repeated.\n\n However, the key is that we are allowed to move arbitrarily along the ring. The ring has n houses. The distance from house x to house y in a clockwise ring of n houses is:\n   If we are at x and want to go to y:\n     Option 1: Moving clockwise until we hit y. But note: we can also consider the possibility of going around the ring multiple times? Actually, we don't need to because the problem doesn't require returning to 1 at the end.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to return to house 1, so we just need to cover the tasks in order.\n\n However, the catch: the tasks are in order, so we must do them sequentially. After completing a task, we are at the house of that task, and then we move to the next task.\n\n But wait: the example input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Houses: 1,2,3,4 (in a circle: 1->2->3->4->1)\n   Start at 1.\n   First task at 3: \n        From 1 to 3: clockwise: 1->2->3 (distance 2)\n   Second task at 2: \n        From 3 to 2: clockwise? But 3->4->1->2: that would be 3 steps. Alternatively, we can also note that the ring is circular and we can go backwards? However, the problem states the traffic is one-way and clockwise. Therefore, we cannot go counterclockwise.\n\n   But wait: the example output is 6. Let's break down the example:\n\n   Example: \n        Input: n=4, m=3, tasks = [3,2,3]\n\n        Step-by-step:\n            Start at 1.\n            Go from 1 to 3: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n            Then from 3 to 2: Since we can only move clockwise, we have to go 3->4->1->2 (3 steps)\n            Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step)\n\n            Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n   However, note that the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" gives output 2.\n\n        Step-by-step for [2,3,3]:\n            Start at 1.\n            Go from 1 to 2: 1->2 (1 step)\n            Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step)\n            Then from 3 to 3: 0 steps.\n\n            Total steps: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.\n\n   But wait, why did the example say the answer is 2? Yes, that matches.\n\n   However, let me check the first example again: [3,2,3] gives 6.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\", meaning the tasks must be done in order. So we cannot change the order.\n\n   Approach:\n\n   We can consider the journey as:\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for each task in the list (from first to last):\n            Let d = the clockwise distance from current to the task house.\n\n            How to compute clockwise distance from x to y in a ring of n houses?\n                We can define: \n                    If x <= y: then the distance is y - x.\n                    If x > y: then we have to go from x to the end (n) and then wrap around to the beginning and go to y: (n - x) + y.\n\n                Alternatively, we can also compute: \n                    d = (y - x) % n   ... but that doesn't work for negative.\n\n                Actually, we want the minimal clockwise steps. In a ring, we can also think: the distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n, but if we take modulo n, then we have to adjust.\n\n                However, note: we are only allowed to move clockwise, so we cannot use modulo that wraps the other way. The above formula for clockwise distance from x to y is:\n\n                    If y >= x: d = y - x\n                    Else: d = (n - x) + y\n\n                This is the same as: d = (y - x) % n, but wait: \n                    Example: x=3, y=2, n=4: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 (if using modulo that gives non-negative) which is correct: 3->4->1->2 is 3 steps.\n\n                Actually, we can write: \n                    d = (y - x) % n \n                    But if (y-x) is negative, then (y-x) % n gives a positive number. However, we can also do:\n\n                    d = (y - x + n) % n   if we want to get the minimal clockwise steps? \n\n                However, note: the example [2,3,3] for the second part (from 2 to 3): \n                    x=2, y=3: (3-2)%4 = 1 -> correct.\n\n                But wait: from 3 to 2: (2-3+4)%4 = (1)%4 = 1? That's incorrect because we need 3 steps.\n\n                Actually, the above modulo operation is giving the minimal steps in a bidirectional ring? No, we are constrained to clockwise.\n\n                Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n                    d = (y - x) % n\n                    But if d == 0 and x != y, we are already at y? Actually, if x==y then d=0.\n\n                However, our formula for the case x>y: \n                    We want to go from x to y by passing through the next houses until we hit y. The clockwise path is from x to the end and then from 1 to y.\n\n                We can also compute without condition:\n\n                    d = (y - x) % n\n                    But that gives the shortest path in a bidirectional ring. We need the clockwise path.\n\n                In a clockwise-only ring, the distance from x to y is:\n                    If x <= y: then d = y - x\n                    Else: d = (n - x) + y\n\n                This can be written as: d = (y - x) % n if (y>=x) then (y-x) else (y-x+n) % n? Actually, if we do (y-x+n) % n, then:\n\n                    When y>=x: (y-x+n) % n = (y-x) % n, but since y-x is positive and less than n (because y<=n and x>=1, so y-x <= n-1) then (y-x) % n = y-x.\n                    When y<x: then y-x+n is positive and (y-x+n) % n = (y-x+n) (since y-x+n is between 1 and n-1+n, but actually when y<x, y-x is negative, so adding n makes it positive and less than n? Not necessarily: if y-x+n >= n? Actually, (y-x+n) is in the range [n - (x-y), n + (y-x)] but we know y-x is negative, so let k = x-y (positive), then y-x+n = n - k. And k = x-y, so n-k is the distance.\n\n                Actually, the formula (y-x+n) % n gives the clockwise distance? Let's test:\n\n                    Example 1: x=3, y=2, n=4 -> (2-3+4) = 3, then 3 %4=3 -> correct.\n                    Example 2: x=1, y=3, n=4 -> (3-1+4)=6, 6%4=2 -> correct (1->2->3: 2 steps).\n                    Example 3: x=4, y=1, n=4 -> (1-4+4)=1, 1%4=1 -> correct (4->1: 1 step).\n\n                However, wait: from 4 to 1: we have two possibilities: clockwise: 4->1 (step1) and counterclockwise: 4->3->2->1 (3 steps). But we are forced to clockwise, so we take the clockwise direction: 1 step.\n\n                But note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise, so from 4 you can only go to 1 (the next house) and then 2, etc.\n\n                Therefore, the clockwise distance from x to y is:\n\n                    d = (y - x + n) % n   if (y-x+n) is taken modulo n, but note: when (y-x+n) is a multiple of n, then modulo n becomes 0, which is correct (if x=y, then d=0).\n\n                However, wait: if x=y, then (y-x+n)=n, and n % n =0 -> correct.\n\n                But wait: what if x=2, y=5, n=5? Then (5-2+5)=8, 8%5=3. But the actual clockwise steps from 2 to 5 in a ring of 5: 2->3->4->5: 3 steps. Correct.\n\n                However, note: the houses are numbered 1 through n. So if we have n=5, then the houses are 1,2,3,4,5. Then from 2 to 5: 2->3->4->5: 3 steps.\n\n                But wait, what if we have x=5, y=2, n=5? Then (2-5+5)=2, 2%5=2. The clockwise steps from 5 to 2: 5->1->2: 2 steps. Correct.\n\n                However, wait: in the example [3,2,3] for n=4, from 3 to 2: (2-3+4)=3, which is correct. From 2 to 3: (3-2+4)=5, 5%4=1. Correct.\n\n                But note: the modulus operation: we are doing (y-x+n) % n. However, we must note that (y-x+n) might be more than n? Then modulus will reduce it.\n\n                Actually, the formula: (y-x) mod n, but if negative, we add n until positive. But we can use modulo arithmetic.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative: \n                    (a % n) returns a value in [0, n-1]. \n\n                We can also write: \n                    d = (y - x) % n\n                    But wait: if y-x is negative, then (y-x)%n = (y-x + k*n) for some k to make it positive. We want the smallest nonnegative residue. \n\n                But note: the clockwise distance must be at least 0 and at most n-1. However, the above formula (y-x+n)%n gives the same as (y-x) % n? \n\n                Let me check: \n                    (y-x+n) % n = (y-x) % n + n % n? Not exactly.\n\n                Actually, (a + n) % n = a % n. So (y-x+n) % n = (y-x) % n. \n\n                But wait, that's not true: \n                    (a + n) % n = a % n   because n % n =0, and (a+n) % n = (a % n + n % n) % n? No, modulo is linear: (a+b) % n = (a%n + b%n) % n, but here we are adding n (which is 0 mod n) so (a+n) % n = (a % n + 0) % n = a % n.\n\n                So then (y-x+n) % n = (y-x) % n. \n\n                But wait, in the example from 3 to 2: \n                    (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3 (in Python, -1 %4 gives 3). \n\n                So we can simply do: d = (y - x) % n, but wait: if (y-x) is positive, then (y-x)%n = y-x (if y-x < n). But if y-x >= n, then we can subtract multiples of n until it's in [0, n-1]. However, since y and x are in [1, n], the difference y-x is in [-n+1, n-1]. \n\n                Actually, we don't want to use modulo if we are only moving clockwise. The above formula (y-x+n) % n is the same as (y-x) % n, and that gives the minimal steps in the clockwise direction? \n\n                But wait: the clockwise movement from x to y is defined as the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (x + d) mod n = y. However, note that we are starting at x and moving clockwise, and the houses are labeled 1 to n. But modulo arithmetic with labels 1 to n is tricky because we usually do 0-indexed.\n\n                Alternatively, we can map the houses: subtract 1 to make them 0-indexed, then the distance from x to y is (y-x) mod n, but then we have to account for the fact that we are in a circle.\n\n                However, note: the problem does not require to use modulo for the entire calculation. We can compute the distance without modulo by:\n\n                    if y >= x:\n                        d = y - x\n                    else:\n                        d = y - x + n\n\n                But wait, what if we are in 0-indexed? Let me map the houses to 0-indexed:\n\n                    House 1 -> index0, House 2 -> index1, ..., House n -> index(n-1)\n\n                Then the clockwise movement from index i to index j (in 0-indexed) is:\n                    if j >= i: d = j - i\n                    else: d = j - i + n\n\n                Then we can convert back: but note the input is given in house numbers (1-indexed).\n\n                Alternatively, we can keep 1-indexed and do:\n\n                    d = (y - x) % n   if we define n as the modulus, but wait: the modulus should be the total houses? Actually, the modulus is the number of houses.\n\n                However, we must be cautious: the modulus operation for negative numbers: \n                    In Python, (y-x) % n gives the result in the range [0, n-1]. But note: if y < x, then (y-x) is negative, so (y-x) % n = (y-x) + k*n, where k is chosen so that the result is in [0, n-1]. Specifically, k = ceil((x-y)/n) ? Actually, k = 1 if (x-y) < n.\n\n                Since the maximum gap is n (if we go from house n to house 1, then the gap is 1, but wait: from n to 1: \n                    (1-n) % n = (1-n) % n = 1-n+n = 1 (if n>0) but wait, that's not correct because we want the clockwise distance from n to 1 to be 1, and (1-n) % n is 1? \n\n                Let me compute: \n                    n=4, x=4, y=1: (1-4) %4 = (-3)%4 = 1 (because -3 + 4 = 1). Correct.\n\n                Similarly, from 3 to 2 in n=4: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3. Correct.\n\n                So we can use: d = (y - x) % n   if we ensure that the modulus n is the total number of houses.\n\n                But wait: is that always the clockwise distance? \n\n                Consider: \n                    We have a ring of n houses. The clockwise distance from x to y is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (x + d) ≡ y (mod n), but note that the houses are labeled 1 to n, and we are moving in steps. However, the modulus operation we did is in terms of the house numbers, but the modulus base is n. \n\n                However, note: the movement is defined on the physical houses. The ring has n houses. The clockwise distance from x to y is the number of edges traversed. The modulus n is the total number of houses, and the distance is the smallest nonnegative solution to (x + d) mod n = y, but wait: if we label the houses from 1 to n, then we can think of the positions as 1,2,...,n, and then the next house after n is 1. \n\n                But note: (x + d) mod n might not directly give the house number because we are using 1-indexed. \n\n                Alternatively, we can map the houses to 0-indexed and then the distance is (y0 - x0) mod n, but then the modulus n is the size of the ring. However, we are using the same n (number of houses) for modulus.\n\n                Actually, let's map: \n                    x0 = x - 1, y0 = y - 1.\n\n                Then the clockwise distance in 0-indexed is (y0 - x0) % n, but then we have to account for the fact that the modulus n in 0-indexed is the same n (because the ring has n houses, so the indices go from 0 to n-1). Then the distance in 0-indexed is (y0 - x0) % n, but wait: \n\n                    Example: x=3, y=2, n=4 -> x0=2, y0=1.\n                    (1-2) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3. Then we would have to traverse 3 edges? But in 0-indexed, the houses are 0,1,2,3. The clockwise from 2 (which is house3) to 1 (house2) is: 2->3->0->1 (three steps). Correct.\n\n                However, note: the problem counts the edges (each edge is one unit). So the distance is the same.\n\n                Therefore, we can compute:\n\n                    d = ( (y-1) - (x-1) ) % n   # This is the same as (y-x) % n.\n\n                But wait: (y-1 - (x-1)) = y-x. So indeed d = (y-x) % n.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative: \n                    Example: (2-3) %4 -> (-1)%4 = 3 (correct)\n\n                But wait: if we are at house 1 (x=1) and want to go to house 1 (y=1): (1-1)%n=0 -> correct.\n\n                So we can use: d = (y - x) % n\n\n                However, wait: what if the distance is 0? Then we don't move.\n\n                But note: the problem says from house 1, we have to do the tasks. The first task might be at house 1, then we don't move.\n\n                Now, the plan:\n\n                    total_time = 0\n                    current = 1\n\n                    for each task_house in task_list:\n                        d = (task_house - current) % n\n                        But wait: is that the correct clockwise distance? \n\n                    However, note: the modulus operation gives the minimal nonnegative solution in the ring. But in our ring, the clockwise movement is defined as the minimal steps to reach y from x by moving clockwise. And the modulus operation gives that.\n\n                    But wait: from current to task_house, we must move clockwise. The modulus operation gives the minimal steps? Actually, in a ring, the minimal clockwise steps is the same as the minimal steps in the clockwise direction (since we cannot go counterclockwise). However, the modulus operation gives the smallest nonnegative solution to (current + d) mod n = task_house, but note: we are labeling houses 1 to n, and the modulus is n, but the mapping from house numbers to modular arithmetic is:\n\n                        We have an equation: (current + d) mod n = task_house?\n\n                    Let me map the houses to 0-indexed: \n                        current0 = current - 1, task0 = task_house - 1.\n\n                    Then the equation becomes: (current0 + d) mod n = task0.\n\n                    Then d = (task0 - current0) mod n, but then d is in [0, n-1]. Then the actual time is d.\n\n                    Then the time to move from current (1-indexed) to task_house (1-indexed) is d = (task_house - current) % n? \n\n                    But wait: in 0-indexed, the modulus is n (the same n). So yes.\n\n                However, wait: the modulus operation in the 1-indexed system: \n                    (task_house - current) % n\n\n                Example: current=1, task_house=3, n=4: (3-1)%4=2 -> correct.\n\n                Example: current=3, task_house=2, n=4: (2-3)%4=-1%4=3 -> correct.\n\n                Therefore, we can compute the distance for each segment as (task_house - current) % n.\n\n                Then update current = task_house.\n\n                But wait: is that the entire story? \n\n                Let's simulate the first example: [3,2,3] with n=4.\n\n                    Start: current = 1, total_time=0.\n\n                    First task: 3\n                        d = (3-1)%4 = 2 %4 = 2 -> time +=2, current=3.\n\n                    Second task: 2\n                        d = (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> time +=3, current=2.\n\n                    Third task: 3\n                        d = (3-2)%4 = 1 -> time +=1, current=3.\n\n                    Total_time = 2+3+1 = 6 -> correct.\n\n                Now the second example: [2,3,3] with n=4.\n\n                    Start: current=1, total_time=0.\n\n                    First task: 2\n                        d = (2-1)%4=1 -> time=1, current=2.\n\n                    Second task: 3\n                        d = (3-2)%4=1 -> time=2, current=3.\n\n                    Third task: 3\n                        d = (3-3)%4=0 -> time=2, current=3.\n\n                    Total_time=2 -> correct.\n\n                Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n                    Read n, m.\n                    Read the list of m integers (tasks).\n\n                    current = 1\n                    total_time = 0\n\n                    for each task in the list:\n                        d = (task - current) % n\n                        But wait: what if (task - current) is negative? The modulus operation in Python handles it.\n\n                        However, note: the modulus operation for negative in Python returns a nonnegative number. So we can use:\n\n                        d = (task - current) % n\n\n                        But wait: if (task - current) is negative, then (task - current) % n gives a positive number. However, we must note: the modulus operation we are using is defined for the ring of n houses. \n\n                    However, wait: what if the task is the same as current? Then d=0, which is correct.\n\n                But wait: is this formula correct for all cases? Let's test a case where we go from house n to house 1.\n\n                    Example: n=5, current=5, task=1: \n                        d = (1-5)%5 = (-4)%5 = 1 (because -4 + 5 = 1) -> correct: from 5, we go to 1: one step.\n\n                Another: from house 5 to house 2: \n                        d = (2-5)%5 = (-3)%5 = 2 -> correct: 5->1->2 (two steps).\n\n                And from house 5 to house 3: \n                        d = (3-5)%5 = (-2)%5=3 -> correct: 5->1->2->3 (three steps).\n\n                However, wait: from house 5 to house 3, clockwise: 5->1->2->3: that's three steps. Correct.\n\n                Therefore, we can use:\n\n                    d = (task - current) % n\n\n                But wait: what if the modulus operation gives a negative? Actually, in Python, the modulus of a negative number by n returns a nonnegative result. \n\n                However, note: the modulus operation is defined as: a % n = a - floor(a/n)*n. For negative a, floor(a/n) is negative, so we add enough multiples of n to make it positive.\n\n                But note: the above formula gives the minimal steps to reach the task by moving clockwise.\n\n                However, there is an alternative: sometimes we might consider that the ring is circular and we can also move beyond the ring? But no, the modulus n gives the minimal steps in the clockwise direction.\n\n                But wait: is it minimal? In a clockwise ring, the distance from x to y is uniquely defined (because we cannot go counterclockwise). So the minimal clockwise steps is the one we computed.\n\n                Therefore, code:\n\n                    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n                    tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n                    current = 1\n                    total_time = 0\n\n                    for t in tasks:\n                        # Compute the clockwise distance from current to t\n                        d = (t - current) % n\n                        # But wait: if (t - current) is negative, then % n gives a positive number. However, the modulus operation is defined as above.\n\n                        # However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative: \n                        #   (t - current) % n is the same as (t - current + k * n) for the smallest k such that the result is nonnegative and less than n.\n\n                        # But note: the modulus operation gives a number in [0, n-1]. However, the clockwise distance from current to t must be at least 0 and at most n-1.\n\n                        total_time += d\n                        current = t\n\n                But wait: the example [3,2,3] gives 6, [2,3,3] gives 2. However, wait: let me check the modulus operation for the second example:\n\n                    Example [2,3,3]: n=4\n                    First task: t=2, current=1 -> (2-1)%4=1 -> correct.\n                    Second task: t=3, current=2 -> (3-2)%4=1 -> correct.\n                    Third task: t=3, current=3 -> (3-3)%4=0 -> correct.\n\n                However, wait: what if we have a different example: [4, 1, 2] for n=4.\n\n                    Start at 1.\n                    First task: 4 -> (4-1)%4=3 -> time=3, current=4.\n                    Second task: 1 -> (1-4)%4=(-3)%4=1 -> time=4, current=1.\n                    Third task: 2 -> (2-1)%4=1 -> time=5, current=2.\n\n                But let's simulate the moves:\n\n                    Start at 1.\n                    Move to 4: 1->2->3->4 (3 steps)\n                    Then from 4 to 1: 4->1 (1 step)\n                    Then from 1 to 2: 1->2 (1 step)\n\n                    Total steps: 3+1+1=5 -> correct.\n\n                But wait, is that the minimal? \n\n                Alternatively, after the first task (at 4), could we have gone from 4 to 1 to 2 without going from 4 to 1? \n\n                However, the second task requires being at house 1. So we must be at house 1 for the second task.\n\n                Then from house 1 to house 2 for the third task.\n\n                So the simulation is correct.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation is giving the minimal clockwise steps. \n\n                But wait: the modulus operation is defined as the remainder, and in a ring of n houses, the clockwise distance from x to y is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (x + d) ≡ y (mod n) and d is in [0, n-1]. \n\n                However, note: the problem does not allow negative moves, so we are constrained to the clockwise direction.\n\n                But wait: is the modulus operation giving the minimal steps? \n\n                Example: from house 1 to house 1: d=0. Correct.\n\n                Example: from house 1 to house 2: d=1. Correct.\n\n                Example: from house 1 to house 3: d=2. Correct.\n\n                Example: from house 1 to house 4: d=3. Correct.\n\n                Example: from house 2 to house 1: d = (1-2)%4 = (-1)%4=3. Correct.\n\n                Example: from house 3 to house 1: (1-3)%4 = (-2)%4=2. \n                    Steps: 3->4->1: 2 steps. Correct.\n\n                Example: from house 4 to house 1: (1-4)%4= (-3)%4=1. Correct.\n\n                Therefore, the modulus operation is giving the correct clockwise distance.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation is defined for the entire ring. But wait, what if we have a ring of n=100000 and the task is at house 1 and we are at house 99999? Then:\n\n                    d = (1 - 99999) % 100000 = (-99998) % 100000 = 2 (because -99998 + 100000 = 2). \n\n                The clockwise steps: from 99999 to 1: \n                    99999 -> 100000 -> 1 (but wait, if n=100000, then the houses are 1 to 100000. Then from 99999, the next is 100000, then from 100000 the next is 1. So two steps. Correct.\n\n                Therefore, the code is:\n\n                    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n                    tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n                    current = 1\n                    ans = 0\n\n                    for t in tasks:\n                        # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to t\n                        # Using modulus: \n                        #   d = (t - current) % n\n                        # But note: the modulus operation in Python for negative gives a positive, but the modulus base is n (the total number of houses)\n\n                        # However, wait: what if (t - current) is positive and greater than or equal to n? \n                        #   Example: n=4, current=1, t=5? But t is at most n (<=n) so t is in [1, n]. Similarly, current is in [1, n] (and initially 1 and then set to task which is in [1,n]). So (t-current) is in [-n+1, n-1].\n\n                        # But note: the modulus operation for positive numbers: \n                        #   (t - current) % n: if (t-current) is positive and less than n, then it remains the same. But if (t-current) is positive and >=n, then we do modulus. However, since t and current are at most n, the maximum (t-current) is n-1 (when t=n, current=1) and minimum is 1-n (when t=1, current=n). So we don't get numbers >=n.\n\n                        d = (t - current) % n\n                        # However, wait: if t==current, then d=0. Correct.\n\n                        ans += d\n                        current = t\n\n                    print(ans)\n\n                But wait: the example [4, 1, 2] for n=4: \n                    tasks = [4,1,2]\n                    current=1, t=4: d=(4-1)%4=3, ans=3, current=4.\n                    t=1: d=(1-4)%4= (-3)%4=1, ans=4, current=1.\n                    t=2: d=(2-1)%4=1, ans=5.\n\n                However, wait: the example [4, 1, 2] is provided by me, and the simulation was 5.\n\n                But wait: the problem statement does not have this example. However, the above reasoning seems consistent.\n\n                However, wait: is there a possibility that the modulus operation gives a wrong value for very large n? \n\n                The modulus operation is defined for any integer, so it should be fine.\n\n                But wait: what if n=1? The problem states n>=2.\n\n                Therefore, we can use the above code.\n\n                However, wait: the modulus operation in the example from 3 to 2 for n=4 gives 3. But note: the modulus operation in Python for (2-3)%4 is 3, which is correct.\n\n                But wait: what if the distance is 0? Then we don't move. Correct.\n\n                However, wait: what if we have a task list that is empty? m=0. Then the loop doesn't run and we output 0. Correct.\n\n                But note: the constraints say m>=1, but the problem says m>=1. Actually, the input says m>=1? No: the problem says \"1 ≤ m ≤ 105\", so m>=1.\n\n                But wait: the problem says \"The second line contains m integers\", so we assume m>=1.\n\n                However, the problem says \"1 ≤ m ≤ 105\", so m can be 1 to 105.\n\n                But note: the modulus operation might be slow for large n? But n up to 10^5, and we do m (up to 10^5) modulus operations. Each modulus operation is O(1), so overall O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n                Let me run the provided examples:\n\n                    Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> 6\n                    Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> 2\n\n                But wait: the example input format is given as two strings: \n                    ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n                Actually, the input is two lines. The first line is n and m, the second line is m integers.\n\n                The example input is given as a string that we read from stdin.\n\n                However, the example input is provided as:\n\n                    Input:\n                        4 3\n                        3 2 3\n\n                and \n\n                    Input:\n                        4 3\n                        2 3 3\n\n                Our code reads two integers from the first line and then a list of m integers from the second line.\n\n                Therefore, the code is:\n\n                    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n                    tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n                    current = 1\n                    ans = 0\n\n                    for t in tasks:\n                        # Compute the clockwise distance from current to t\n                        d = (t - current) % n\n                        ans += d\n                        current = t\n\n                    print(ans)\n\n                However, wait: I just realized that the modulus operation might be giving the same result as if we were in a bidirectional ring? \n\n                But note: we are only allowed to move clockwise. The modulus operation gives the minimal nonnegative solution for the equation (current",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks, moving only clockwise along a ring of houses. The key observation is that the ring is circular and movement is restricted to the clockwise direction, so the distance between any two houses can be calculated using modular arithmetic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in sequence, moving only clockwise. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete all previous tasks before starting the next one. The challenge is to compute the minimal time (number of moves) required to traverse from her current house to the next task's house, considering the circular nature of the ring.\n2. **Insight**: The clockwise distance from house `x` to house `y` in a ring of `n` houses is given by `(y - x) % n`. This formula accounts for both direct paths (when `y >= x`) and paths that wrap around the ring (when `y < x`).\n3. **Algorithm**: For each task, calculate the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house using the modulus operation. Sum these distances to get the total time required. Update the current house to the task's house after each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\nans = 0\n\nfor t in tasks:\n    d = (t - current) % n\n    ans += d\n    current = t\n\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 (`current = 1`) with initial time (`ans = 0`).\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `t`:\n   - **Distance Calculation**: Compute the clockwise distance from `current` to `t` using `(t - current) % n`. This handles both direct moves and wrap-around paths.\n   - **Update Time and Position**: Add the computed distance to the total time and update the current house to `t`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal path by leveraging modular arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
