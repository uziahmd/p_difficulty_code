    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing an element from the array will remove one occurrence of that element, and then we look at the new min and max.\n\n Observation:\n The instability is defined as (max - min). After removing one element, the instability can be calculated as the maximum minus the minimum of the remaining array.\n\n Since we are allowed to remove exactly one element, we can consider the effect on the overall min and max.\n\n However, note that the entire array might have duplicates. So we cannot simply assume that removing an element only affects the min or max if it is the only occurrence.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Sort the array.\n 2. Note that the overall instability of the original array is (last element - first element) but after removal, we can remove one element which might be at either end.\n\n But note: we can also remove an element in the middle? Actually, if we remove an element in the middle, the min and max remain the same as the original min and max (unless the min or max appears only once).\n\n Therefore, the idea is to consider removing each candidate that is either the minimum or the maximum? Actually, we can consider two cases:\n\n Case 1: Removing an occurrence of the minimum value. Then the new min is the next smallest value (which might be the same as min if there are duplicates).\n Case 2: Removing an occurrence of the maximum value. Then the new max is the next largest value.\n\n However, what if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability remains (max - min). But that might not be minimal.\n\n Actually, we can think: the goal is to minimize the instability. The instability is determined by the difference between the max and min of the remaining array.\n\n What are the possibilities?\n  - If we remove an element that is not the minimum, then the minimum might still be present, unless all minimums are removed. Similarly for maximum.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We note that the resulting array must have a min >= the original min (if we don't remove the min) and similarly max <= the original max.\n\n The best way is to consider: for each index i (0-indexed) we remove the element at i, and then compute the instability of the remaining array.\n\n However, n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot do an O(n^2) solution.\n\n Insight:\n\n After sorting the array, the entire array is sorted. Then:\n\n Let the sorted array be b[0..n-1].\n\n Then, if we remove an element, we get two segments: [b[0] ... b[i-1]] and [b[i+1] ... b[n-1]].\n\n The new min is the minimum of the left segment (if any) and the new max is the maximum of the right segment (if any). \n\n But note: the left segment's min is b[0] (if we don't remove the first element) and the right segment's max is b[n-1] (if we don't remove the last element). \n\n Actually, the min of the entire array without the removed element is:\n   If we remove an element that is greater than the current min, then the min remains the same (unless all min values are removed). But wait: if we remove one occurrence of the min, then if there are multiple mins, the min remains the same until we remove all occurrences.\n\n Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, we can precompute:\n   Let left_min[i] = the minimum of the subarray from 0 to i (inclusive)\n   But actually, we don't need that because the array is sorted.\n\n Actually, since the array is sorted, we know:\n\n   If we remove an element at index i (0-indexed), then:\n     new_min = \n        if i == 0: then the next element (b[1]) becomes the new min? Actually no: because we remove the first element, then the new min is the next element (b[1]).\n        else: the min is still b[0] (unless we remove the last occurrence of b[0] then the min becomes b[1] but note: we are removing one element. However, if there are multiple b[0], then we need to know how many b[0] are there.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   The instability after removal is: (max_remaining - min_remaining)\n\n   Where:\n     min_remaining = \n        if we remove an element that is not the first occurrence of the minimum, then the min is still the original min.\n        but if we remove the last occurrence of the original min, then the min becomes the next distinct value.\n\n However, we can also consider:\n\n   The overall instability of the array after removal is the maximum of the remaining elements minus the minimum of the remaining elements.\n\n   We can precompute:\n     Let b = sorted(a)\n\n  ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the new minimum and maximum values after removing any element.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: If the array has all elements the same, removing any element will result in zero instability.\n3. **Evaluate Removal of Each Element**: For each element in the sorted array, consider removing it and compute the new instability by checking the next smallest and largest elements in the remaining array.\n4. **Track Minimum Instability**: Keep track of the smallest instability encountered during the evaluation.\n\nThe key insight is that removing an element from the sorted array affects the minimum or maximum only if it was the last occurrence of that value. Otherwise, the minimum or maximum remains unchanged. By iterating through the sorted array and considering each possible removal, we can efficiently determine the minimal instability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    \n    if len(set(a)) == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            new_min = a_sorted[i+1] if n > 1 else float('inf')\n            new_max = a_sorted[-1]\n        elif i == n-1:\n            new_min = a_sorted[0]\n            new_max = a_sorted[i-1]\n        else:\n            new_min = a_sorted[0]\n            new_max = a_sorted[-1]\n            \n        current_instability = new_max - new_min\n        if current_instability < min_instability:\n            min_instability = current_instability\n            \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only one element, the instability is trivially zero. If all elements are the same, removing any element leaves all elements identical, resulting in zero instability.\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to facilitate the calculation of new min and max values after removal.\n4. **Iterating Through Elements**: For each element in the sorted array, the code checks what the new min and max would be if that element were removed. \n   - If the element is the first in the sorted array, the new min is the next element.\n   - If the element is the last, the new max is the previous element.\n   - For elements in the middle, both min and max remain unchanged unless they are the only occurrence of their respective values.\n5. **Tracking Minimum Instability**: The instability for each removal scenario is calculated and the minimum value is tracked and printed at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to evaluating each possible removal in a sorted array, leveraging sorting to simplify the determination of new min and max values. The solution handles all edge cases and operates in O(n log n) time due to the sorting step, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
