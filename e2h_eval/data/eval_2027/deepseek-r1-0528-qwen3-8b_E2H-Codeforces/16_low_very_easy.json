Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two points: home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) that define the roads.\n\n The key observation: \n Moving from one block to another is allowed if they share a common border of nonzero length. This is essentially crossing a road.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n But note: the entire plane is divided by the n infinite lines. Each line divides the plane into two half-planes. The blocks are the connected regions (which are polygons or unbounded regions). \n\n We can think of the problem as: we start in the home's block and want to get to the university's block. Each time we cross a road (i.e., a line) we move from one block to an adjacent one. However, the catch is that we can only cross one road at a time, and the step is defined by crossing a single contiguous segment of a road? Actually, note: the problem says that if the common border is nonzero, then we can move. Since two blocks are adjacent if they share a part of a road (and not just an intersection point), then crossing one road (one line) is sufficient to go from one side to the other.\n\n However, note that sometimes we might need to cross multiple roads. But observe:\n\n The entire arrangement of lines divides the plane. The home and university are in two different blocks. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads we have to cross?\n\n Actually, consider: \n   In order to go from one block to another, we must cross every road that separates the two blocks. But note that each road is a line and the two sides of the road are separated by that road.\n\n However, the problem does not require us to count the number of roads separating the two blocks. Because the movement rule is: one step moves you from one block to an adjacent one (which requires crossing one contiguous segment of a road). But note: crossing one road might not be independent of others.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Consider that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university lie in either one of the two sides for each road.\n\n Now, if the home and university are on the same side of a road, then we don't need to cross that road. Otherwise, we must cross that road.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home from the university. But wait: is it simply the count of roads for which the home and university are on opposite sides?\n\n However, note: when we cross a road, we change our side for that road. But the problem allows moving from one block to an adjacent one by crossing a road. However, we cannot necessarily cross multiple roads at the same time. Each step crosses one road (because the common border is a segment of a single road).\n\n But here is the catch: if two roads separate the two points, then we must cross both. However, we can cross them in any order, but each crossing is one step.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is exactly the number of roads for which the home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n However, let's test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n        Roads: \n            Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  -> y=0 (the x-axis)\n            Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  -> x=0 (the y-axis)\n\n   How many roads separate home and university?\n      For Road1: \n          Home: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 > 0\n          University: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 < 0 -> opposite, so count=1.\n      For Road2:\n          Home: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 > 0\n          University: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 < 0 -> opposite, so count=2.\n\n   Then the answer is 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n        Roads: \n            Road1: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  -> x=0\n            Road2: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  -> y=0\n            Road3: 1*x + 1*y - 3 = 0  -> x+y=3\n\n   Check Road3:\n        Home: 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing the university, given that each step involves crossing a road (an infinite line) that separates the two blocks. The key insight is that each road acts as a boundary between two half-planes, and the minimal steps correspond to the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many of the given lines (roads) separate the home and university points. For each line, if the home and university lie on opposite sides, then crossing that line is necessary.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each line equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\), compute the sign of the expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, the line separates the two points, and thus, it must be crossed.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each line, evaluate the sign of the expression for both points, and count how many lines separate them. The count directly gives the minimal steps needed since each crossing of a separating line constitutes one step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        side1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        side2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (side1 < 0 and side2 > 0) or (side1 > 0 and side2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, the number of roads, and the coefficients defining each road's line equation.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the code checks the side of the line where the home and university points lie by evaluating the expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both points. If the evaluation results in opposite signs (one positive and one negative), the road separates the two points.\n3. **Counting Separating Lines**: The code counts how many such separating lines exist. This count is the minimal number of steps needed, as each step involves crossing one such line.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of separating lines is printed, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each line once, leveraging simple arithmetic operations to determine the relative positions of the points with respect to each line, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
