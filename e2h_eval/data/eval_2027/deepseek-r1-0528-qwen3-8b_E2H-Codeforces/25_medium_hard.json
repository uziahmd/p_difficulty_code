При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` (the received message) and we need to determine if it could be the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message `s` with an overlapping error.\n\n Conditions for the error:\n  - The two messages are identical (so the original was two copies of `s`).\n  - The error occurs when the second copy starts to overlap with the first. The overlap must be a positive number of characters (at least 1) and less than the length of `s`.\n  - The resulting string is `s + s[overlap_length:]`, but note that the entire second part after the overlap is appended.\n\n However, note from the problem: \n   Example: \n      \"abrakadabra\" sent twice -> could become \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap of 1) or \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap of 4).\n\n But note: the problem says that without error, two messages would just be concatenated. So the original two messages are `s` and `s`. \n\n We are to check: \n   Is there a non-empty string `s` such that t = s + s[k:] for some k (with 0 < k < len(s))?\n\n However, note the example \"abcabc\": \n   Without error, we have two copies of \"abc\", so t = \"abc\" + \"abc\" = \"abcabc\", but this is not considered an error. Why?\n   Because the problem states: \"simple concatenation is not an error\". Therefore, we require that the error occurred, meaning that the two messages overlapped.\n\n Also note: the example says that if the message is \"abcd\", then there's no error.\n\n How can we approach this?\n\n Observation:\n   The entire string `t` must be formed by taking two copies of some string `s` and overlapping them by at least one character and at most len(s)-1.\n\n   Let n = len(t). Then we must have that the string `t` can be split into two parts: \n        t = s + s[k:]\n   where k is between 1 and len(s)-1.\n\n   But note: the total length of t is len(s) + (len(s) - k) = 2*len(s) - k.\n\n   Also, note that the beginning of the second copy (which is s[k:]) must match the corresponding part of the first copy? Actually, the entire second copy is the same as the first, so the overlapping part is the prefix of the second copy matching the suffix of the first copy.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: \n        t = s + s[k:] \n        and also note that the last part of the first copy (the last (k-1) characters) must equal the first (k-1) characters of the second copy? Actually, the entire second copy is s, so the overlapping part is the first k characters of the second copy (which is s[0:k]) must match the last k characters of the first copy (which is s[-k:]).\n\n   However, note: the error condition is that the two messages are identical and the overlapping happens. So the string `t` must have the form:\n\n        t = s + s[k:]   for some k in [1, len(s)-1]\n\n   And note: the total length of t is 2*len(s) - k.\n\n   Also, we can consider that `t` must be periodic in a certain way. In fact, we can use the idea of the failure function (like KMP) to check for overlaps.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We know that the entire string `t` is built from two copies of `s` with an overlap of k. Then:\n\n        t[i] = s[i] for i in [0, len(s)-1]\n        t[i] = s[i - len(s) + k] for i in [len(s), len(t)-1]   ??? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, let me write:\n\n        s = \"some string\" (of length L)\n        t = s + s[k:]   => t has length 2*L - k\n\n   Then the condition is that the substring of t starting at index 0 to L-1 is s, and the substring from L to 2*L-k-1 is the tail of s (from index k to L-1).\n\n   But note: we don't know L. However, note that the total length of t is fixed. Let n = len(t). Then n = 2*L - k, and k is in [1, L-1]. Therefore, L must satisfy: L = (n + k) / 2, and since k>=1 and k<=L-1, then L must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most floor(n/1) but wait: actually, from n = 2*L - k, and k>=1, then n <= 2*L-1, so L >= ceil((n+1)/2). And from k<=L-1, then n = 2*L - k >= 2*L - (L-1) = L+1, so L <= n-1.\n\n   However, we don't need to iterate over all possible L and k. Instead, note:\n\n   The string `t` must have a suffix that is a prefix of itself, and the period of repetition must be such that the entire string is two copies of `s` with an overlap.\n\n   Another idea: \n        The entire string `t` must be a repetition of a string `s` but with the last part overlapping. This is similar to a string having a border.\n\n   Specifically, the string `t` must be equal to `s` repeated twice with an overlap. Then, the entire string `t` must have the property that the prefix of length (n - (L - k)) equals the suffix of length (n - (L - k))? \n\n   Alternatively, consider: \n        We know that the first copy of `s` is the first L characters, and the second copy (starting at L) is the substring from L to n-1, which is s[k:]. Therefore, the substring of `t` from 0 to L-1 is `s`, and from L to n-1 is `s[k:]`.\n\n        Also, note that the last L-k characters of the first copy must equal the first L-k characters of the second copy? Actually, the entire second copy is `s`, so the part from L to L + (L-k) - 1 is `s[k:]` and the part from 0 to L-k-1 is the first L-k characters of `s`. But note, the first L-k characters of `s` is the same as the first L-k characters of the first copy, and the last L-k characters of the first copy is the last L-k characters of `s`. \n\n   However, we don't know `s`. But note: the entire string `t` is built from two copies of `s` with an overlap. Therefore, we can try to find a `s` such that:\n\n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n   and k is in [1, len(s)-1].\n\n   How about: \n        Let n = len(t). Then the length of `s` must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1 (because k>=1, so n = 2*|s| - k >= |s|+1, so |s| <= n-1). \n\n   But note: we can also consider that the string `t` must have a structure: the first half (if we assume |s| is L) and the second part is the tail of `s`. \n\n   However, note that the problem says: if the message is \"abcabc\", then output \"NO\". Why? Because in that case, we could have taken `s = \"abc\"` and k=3, but then k must be less than 3 (since |s|=3, k must be in [1,2]). But wait, if we take `s = \"abcabc\"` then that's not allowed because then k would have to be 6, which is not allowed (must be less than 6). \n\n   Actually, note: the two messages are the same, so they are both `s`. In the example \"abcabc\", if we let s=\"abc\", then the two messages are \"abc\" and \"abc\", and the error didn't occur because the overlap must be less than the length of s (which is 3) and the entire second message is appended without any overlap? Actually, wait: the problem says that the error occurs only if the two messages are identical and the network messes up by overlapping. But note: the problem says that the simple concatenation (without error) is two copies of `s` without overlapping. So the error is defined only when the two copies are overlapped. \n\n   Therefore, the string \"abcabc\" is simply two copies of \"abc\" without any overlap. So we must rule that out.\n\n   But note: what if we consider s=\"abcab\"? Then we have two copies: \"abcab\" and \"abcab\", and the error could have overlapped by 2? Then the resulting string would be \"abcab\" + \"cab\" = \"abcabcab\", which is not \"abcabc\". \n\n   Alternatively, what if we consider s=\"abcabc\"? Then the two copies would be \"abcabc\" and \"abcabc\", and the error would require an overlap of at least 1 and less than 6. If we overlap by 3, then the result would be \"abcabc\" + \"bcabc\" = \"abcabcbcabc\", which is too long.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: the error results in the two messages being transmitted and then the second one starts to overlap. The entire second copy is used from the point of overlap. So the resulting string is the first copy (all of it) and then the second copy without the overlapping part.\n\n   Therefore, the length of the resulting string is |s| + (|s| - k) = 2|s| - k.\n\n   For \"abcabc\", we have two possibilities for `s`:\n        Possibility 1: `s` = \"abc\", then k must be in [1,2] (because |s|=3). Then the resulting string would be \"abc\" + \"abc\"[k:] for k=1 or 2.\n            k=1: \"abc\" + \"bc\" = \"abcbc\" -> not \"abcabc\".\n            k=2: \"abc\" + \"c\" = \"abcc\" -> not \"abcabc\".\n\n        Possibility 2: `s` = \"abcabc\", then k must be in [1,5]. Then the resulting string would be \"abcabc\" + \"abcabc\"[k:], which for k=1: \"abcabc\" + \"bcabc\" = \"abcabcbcab\" (length 11) -> not 6.\n\n        Possibility 3: `s` = \"abca\", then k in [1,3]: \n            k=1: \"abca\" + \"bca\" = \"abcabca\" -> length 7, not 6.\n            k=2: \"abca\" + \"ca\" = \"abcaca\" -> not 6.\n            k=3: \"abca\" + \"a\" = \"abcaa\" -> not 6.\n\n        Possibility 4: `s` = \"abcab\", then k in [1,4]:\n            k=1: \"abcab\" + \"bcab\" = \"abcabbcab\" -> length 9\n            k=2: \"abcab\" + \"cab\" = \"abcabcab\" -> length 8\n            k=3: \"abcab\" + \"ab\" = \"abcabab\" -> length 7\n            k=4: \"abcab\" + \"b\" = \"abcabb\" -> length 6 -> but then we get \"abcabb\", not \"abcabc\".\n\n        Possibility 5: `s` = \"abcab\" doesn't work.\n\n        Possibility 6: `s` = \"aba\", then k in [1,2]:\n            k=1: \"aba\" + \"ba\" = \"ababa\" -> length 5\n            k=2: \"aba\" + \"a\" = \"abaa\" -> length 4\n\n        Possibility 7: `s` = \"ab\", then k in [1,1]:\n            k=1: \"ab\" + \"b\" = \"abb\" -> length 3\n\n        Possibility 8: `s` = \"a\", then k must be in [1,0] -> invalid.\n\n   So it seems that \"abcabc\" cannot be produced by the error mechanism. Therefore, we output \"NO\".\n\n   Now, how to check for a given `t`?\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Let n = len(t)\n\n   2. We must have that the entire string t is built from two copies of s with an overlap. Therefore, the length of s must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1 (since k>=1, then n = 2*|s| - k <= 2*|s|-1, so |s| >= ceil((n+1)/2) and |s| <= n-1).\n\n   3. But note: we don't know |s|. However, note that the string t must have a prefix that is s and a suffix that is the tail of s (starting at index k). Moreover, the entire string t must be the first copy of s and then the second copy without the first k characters.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to find a period p (which is the length of s) such that:\n\n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n        and k = p - (n - p)   [because the length of the second part is n - p = k?] Actually, wait: the second part is s[k:], so its length is p - k. And the total length is p + (p - k) = 2p - k = n.\n\n        So we have: k = 2p - n.\n\n        Also, we require that 1 <= k < p, so 1 <= 2p - n < p.\n\n        From 2p - n < p  => p < n, which we already have (p<=n-1).\n\n        From 2p - n >= 1 => p >= (n+1)//2 (ceiling division) but note: if n is even, then p>= (n+1)//2, and if n is odd, then p>= (n+2)//2? Actually, 2p >= n+1 => p >= ceil((n+1)/2).\n\n        Then, for a candidate p (length of s) in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1], we can set k = 2p - n, and then check:\n\n            Condition 1: k is between 1 and p-1 (which is satisfied by our choice of p, because p>=ceil((n+1)/2) implies 2p>=n+1 => k>=1, and k=2p-n < p because p<n, so 2p-n < p => p < n, which holds).\n\n            Condition 2: The string t must be equal to s + s[k:].\n\n            But note: s is the first p characters of t? Actually, we don't know s. However, from the construction, s must be the first p characters of t, and then the rest (from p to n-1) must be equal to s[k:].\n\n            But wait, what if the entire string t is built from two copies of s, then the first p characters are s, and the next part (from p to n-1) is s[k:]. Also, the last p - k characters of the first copy (which are t[p-k : p]) must equal the first p - k characters of the second copy (which are t[p: p+p-k] but wait, the second copy is only from p to n-1, which is p-k characters). \n\n        However, note: the second copy is s[k:], so the entire string t is:\n\n            t[0:p] = s\n            t[p:] = s[k:]\n\n        Then, we can check: \n            s = t[0:p]\n            expected_second_part = s[k:]\n            and then the actual second part is t[p:p+len(expected_second_part)] = t[p:]\n\n        But note: the length of the second part is p - k, and the total length of t is p + (p-k) = 2p - k = n, so we have that the second part of t is exactly t[p:] and we require t[p:] == s[k:].\n\n        However, we don't know s. But note: s is the first p characters. Then we can set:\n\n            s = t[:p]\n            k = 2*p - n\n            Then the second part should be t[p:] and we require that t[p:] == s[k:]\n\n        But wait: is that sufficient? \n\n        Example: t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", n = 21.\n        Candidate p: from ceil((21+1)/2)=11 to 20.\n\n        Let's try p=11: then k = 2*11 - 21 = 1. Then s = \"abrakadabr\", and s[1:] = \"brakadabr\", and t[11:] = \"abrakadabra\" (the rest of the string) -> wait, that's 10 characters, but s[1:] is 10 characters? Yes, because s is 11, so s[1:] is 10. But the rest of t is 21-11=10, so we compare \"brakadabr\" (from s[1:]) and \"abrakadabra\" (from t[11:]) -> these are different.\n\n        But wait, the example says that the answer for \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" is \"YES\" and s=\"abrakadabra\". Note: the example also says that one possibility is an overlap of 1, so then s should be \"abrakadabra\" (length 11) and k=1, then the second part is s[1:] = \"brakadabra\", and the entire t would be s + s[1:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is correct.\n\n        So why did we choose p=11? The length of s is 11. Then k=2*11-21=1. Then we check:\n            s = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabr\"\n            s[1:] = \"brakadabr\"\n            t[11:] = \"abrakadabra\"\n\n        These two strings are not equal.\n\n        What went wrong? \n\n        Let me recast: \n            The two copies are two identical copies of s. The error occurs by overlapping the second copy by k characters. Then the entire string t is:\n\n                t = s + s[k:]\n\n            But note: the first copy is s (the entire first message) and the second copy is s (the entire second message) but we start printing from the k-th character of the second copy. \n\n            So the entire second copy is s, but we drop the first k-1 characters? Actually, we keep the entire second copy from index k onward.\n\n            However, the example: \n                s = \"abrakadabra\", k=1: \n                    First copy: \"abrakadabra\"\n                    Second copy: from index 1: \"brakadabra\"\n                    Then t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n            But in the example, the provided string is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 21 characters. \n\n            Now, in our candidate p=11, we took the first 11 characters as s. But wait, the example s is \"abrakadabra\" (which is 11 characters). Then the first copy is 11, and the second copy is 11, but we only take from index 1 to the end (10 characters). Then the total length is 11+10=21.\n\n            But then why did we take the first 11 characters as s? Because the problem says that the two messages are the same. So the first message is s and the second is s. Therefore, the entire t is built from two copies of s, but the second copy is overlapped by k (so the first k characters of the second copy are omitted from being transmitted separately, but they might have been included in the first copy? Actually, the problem says: \"the end of the first message is merged with the beginning of the second\". \n\n            However, note: the two messages are two identical copies of s. The first message is s (so we have the entire s). Then the second message is s, but the transmission starts at the k-th character of the second copy. Therefore, the entire string t is:\n\n                t = s + s[k:]\n\n            And the length is |s| + (|s| - k) = 2*|s| - k.\n\n            Now, in the example, |s|=11, k=1, so the second part is 10 characters. But the example string \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" has 21 characters.\n\n            How do we extract s from t?\n\n            We know that the entire string t is built from two copies of s, so s must be a substring of t that appears at least twice. But note: the first copy is the entire s, and the second copy is the entire s, but we only take from the k-th character. Therefore, the first |s| characters of t is s, and the next part is s[k:].\n\n            Therefore, we must have:\n\n                s = t[0:p]\n                and the rest is t[p:]\n\n                and we require t[p:] == s[k:]\n\n            But in the example, p=11, then s = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabr\", and s[1:] = \"brakadabr\", and t[11:] = \"abrakadabra\", which is not equal to \"brakadabr\".\n\n            So what is the issue? \n\n            Actually, the example provided in the problem is:\n\n                Input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'\n\n                Output: 'YES\\nabrakadabra'\n\n            So the intended s is \"abrakadabra\", which is 11 characters. But wait, the example string \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" is 21 characters, and 11+10=21. \n\n            How do we get s from t?\n\n            Notice: the entire string t is 21 characters. We are told that the two copies were of the same string s. The first copy is s, the second copy is s without the first k characters (k=1). Then the first copy is the entire s (so the first 11 characters) and the second copy's part is the remaining 10. But the example output says s is \"abrakadabra\", which is the first 11 characters? \n\n            However, if s is \"abrakadabra\", then the first copy is \"abrakadabra\", and the second copy is s (which is \"abrakadabra\") but we start at k=1, so we take from index1 to the end: \"brakadabra\", so the entire string becomes \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which matches.\n\n            But then why did we set p=11? That is the length of s. Then we have:\n\n                s = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabr\"   (wait, that's the first 11 characters: \n                    t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n                    indices 0-10: \"abrakadabr\")\n\n            But the example s is \"abrakadabra\", which is 11 characters. Let me count: \n                \"a b r a k a d a b r a\" -> that's 11 characters. \n\n            However, the first 11 characters of t are \"a b r a k a d a b r a\" (if we break the string):\n\n                t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n                breaking: \n                    a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\n\n                The first 11 characters: \n                    index0: 'a'\n                    index1: 'b'\n                    index2: 'r'\n                    index3: 'a'\n                    index4: 'k'\n                    index5: 'a'\n                    index6: 'd'\n                    index7: 'a'\n                    index8: 'b'\n                    index9: 'r'\n                    index10: 'a'\n\n                So the first 11 characters are \"abrakadabra\" (including the last 'a')? \n\n            Let me write:\n\n                s = \"abrakadabra\" -> 11 letters: \n                    a, b, r, a, k, a, d, a, b, r, a.\n\n            Then the string t is:\n\n                First copy: \"abrakadabra\"\n                Second copy (from index1): \"brakadabra\"\n\n            Then t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n            But wait, the provided example string is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is:\n\n                a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\n\n            Now, if we break the provided string:\n\n                \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> \n                a, b, r, a, k, a, d, a, b, r, a, b, r, a, k, a, d, a, b, r, a.\n\n            The first 11 characters: \n                a, b, r, a, k, a, d, a, b, r, a -> that's 11.\n\n            Then the next part (from index11) is: \n                index11: 'b', index12: 'r', ... until the end.\n\n            So the second part is \"brakadabra\", which is 10 characters.\n\n            But wait, the example s is \"abrakadabra\", which is 11 characters. Then the second part should be s[1:] which is \"brakadabra\", and that matches the substring from index11 to the end.\n\n            So the mistake was in the extraction: we set s = t[0:p] (the first p characters) and then the rest is t[p:]. Then we check that the rest is equal to s[k:].\n\n            But note: the example uses k=1, so s[1:] is \"brakadabra\", and the rest is t[11:] = \"brakadabra\", which matches.\n\n            Why did I think the first 11 characters were \"abrakadabr\" (without the last 'a')? \n\n            Let me count the positions:\n\n                t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n                Let me index from 0 to 20:\n\n                0: a\n                1: b\n                2: r\n                3: a\n                4: k\n                5: a\n                6: d\n                7: a\n                8: b\n                9: r\n                10: a   --> so the 11th character (index10) is 'a'\n\n                Then the substring from 0 to 10 (inclusive) is \"abrakadabra\", which is 11 characters.\n\n            Therefore, the candidate p=11 works.\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n            For a given t (string of length n), we consider all p in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1] (both inclusive) such that:\n\n                k = 2*p - n   (must be an integer and in the range [1, p-1])\n\n            Then, we set:\n\n                s = t[0:p]\n\n            Then, we require that the substring t[p:] is equal to s[k:].\n\n            If we find at least one p for which this holds, then we output \"YES\" and the string s (which is t[0:p]).\n\n            But note: there could be multiple p? The problem says: if there are multiple, output any.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: what if the same t can be broken down in multiple ways? \n\n            Example: t = \"ababab\", n=6.\n\n            Possibilities:\n\n            p must be in [ceil((6+1)/2)=ceil(3.5)=4, 5]. \n\n            p=4: k=2*4-6=2, then s = t[0:4]=\"abab\", and s[2:]=\"ab\", and t[4:]==\"ab\", so matches -> YES, s=\"abab\"\n\n            p=5: k=2*5-6=4, then s=t[0:5]=\"ababa\", and s[4:]=\"a\", and t[5:]=\"b\", so not equal.\n\n            So only one solution.\n\n            But what about t=\"ababa\", n=5.\n\n            p in [ceil((5+1)/2)=3,4].\n\n            p=3: k=2*3-5=1, then s=\"aba\", s[1:]=\"ba\", t[3:]=\"ba\" -> matches.\n\n            p=4: k=2*4-5=3, then s=\"abab\", s[3:]=\"b\", t[4:]=\"a\" -> doesn't match.\n\n            So one solution.\n\n            However, note: the problem says that if the message t does not contain an error, output \"NO\".\n\n            But what if the message t can be broken down in two different ways? \n\n            Example: t = \"abcabcabc\", n=9.\n\n            Possibilities: p from ceil((9+1)/2)=5 to 8.\n\n            p=5: k=2*5-9=1, s=\"abcab\", then t[5:]==\"cabcabc\", s[1:]==\"bcab\", which is not equal to \"cabcabc\".\n\n            p=6: k=2*6-9=3, s=\"abcabc\", then s[3:]=\"abc\", t[6:]=\"abc\", matches. So one solution.\n\n            p=7: k=2*7-9=5, s=\"abcabca\", then s[5:]=\"a\", t[7:]=\"bc\", no.\n\n            p=8: k=2*8-9=7, s=\"abcabcab\", then s[7:]=\"b\", t[8:]=\"c\", no.\n\n            So only one.\n\n            But consider t=\"aaa\", n=3.\n\n            p in [ceil((3+1)/2)=2, 2].\n\n            p=2: k=2*2-3=1, s=\"aa\", then s[1:]=\"a\", and t[2:]=\"a\" -> matches. So output YES, s=\"aa\".\n\n            But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical. The two messages are \"aa\" and \"aa\", and the error occurred by overlapping by 1. The resulting string is \"aa\" + \"a\" (the tail of the second copy) = \"aaa\", which is correct.\n\n            However, note that the problem says: \"if the message is 'abcd', then output NO\". \n\n            Example: t=\"abcd\", n=4.\n\n            p in [ceil(5/2)=3,3].\n\n            p=3: k=2*3-4=2, s=\"abc\", then s[2:]=\"c\", and t[3:]=\"d\", not equal -> NO.\n\n            Example: t=\"abcabc\", n=6.\n\n            p in [ceil(7/2)=4,5].\n\n            p=4: k=4, but k must be < p (which is 4) -> k=4 is not allowed (must be <4). So skip? Actually, our condition is k in [1, p-1]. Here k=4 is not in [1,3] -> invalid.\n\n            p=5: k=2*5-6=4, which is not in [1,4] (wait, p=5, so k must be in [1,4] -> 4 is allowed). Then s=t[0:5]=\"abcab\", and s[4:]=\"b\", and t[5:]=\"c\", not equal.\n\n            So no candidate -> NO.\n\n            But wait, the example input includes \"abcabc\" and the expected output is \"NO\".\n\n            However, note: the problem says that without error, two copies of s would be concatenated. But if we let s=\"abc\", then the two copies without error is \"abc\"+\"abc\"=\"abcabc\", but that is not considered an error. The error requires an overlap (so k must be positive and less than the length of s). Therefore, we are only considering the error scenario.\n\n            So our method is correct.\n\n            Implementation:\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Read the string t.\n\n            n = len(t)\n\n            Let low = (n+1)//2   [ceiling division for (n+1)/2: (n+1)//2 is the ceiling for integer division when n is odd/even? Actually, for n=3: (3+1)//2 = 4//2=2 -> correct. For n=4: (4+1)//2=5//2=2 (but ceil(5/2)=3) -> wait, no: we want ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n            Actually, for n=4: ceil((4+1)/2) = ceil(5/2)=3.\n\n            We can compute: low = (n+1+1)//2? No, for n=4: (n+1)=5, then (5+1)//2=3 -> that's the same as ceil(5/2)=3.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use: low = (n+1)//2 + (1 if (n+1)%2!=0 else 0) -> no, better to use: \n\n            Actually, we want the smallest integer p such that p >= (n+1)/2. That is: p_min = ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n            In Python, we can use: \n                p_min = (n+1) // 2   # This is floor division. But for even: \n                Example: n=4: (4+1)=5 -> 5//2 = 2 -> not 3.\n\n            We can use: \n                p_min = (n+1) // 2 \n                But then for n=4, (n+1)//2 = 5//2 = 2 (floor) -> not the ceiling.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                p_min = (n+1) // 2 \n                But wait: the condition is p >= ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n            Actually, we can set:\n\n                p_min = (n+1 + 1) // 2   -> that is, (n+2)//2, then for n=4: (4+2)//2=3, for n=5: (5+2)//2=7//2=3 (ceiling of (5+1)/2=3) -> wait, (5+1)/2=3, so ceiling is 3, and (5+2)//2=3 -> okay.\n\n            Actually, the formula for the ceiling of (n+1)/2 is: (n+1)//2 if (n+1)%2==0 then floor, but if odd then ceil? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                p_min = (n+1) // 2 + (1 if (n+1) % 2 != 0 else 0) -> no, that's not necessary.\n\n            Actually, note: \n                ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b   for positive integers.\n\n            Here, we want ceil((n+1)/2). So:\n\n                ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1 + 2-1) // 2 = (n+2)//2\n\n            But wait, let me test:\n\n                n=3: (3+1)/2=2 -> ceil(2)=2, and (3+2)//2=5//2=2 -> correct.\n                n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 -> ceil=3, and (4+2)//2=6//2=3 -> correct.\n\n            So p_min = (n+2)//2\n\n            Then p_max = n-1\n\n            Then for p from p_min to p_max:\n\n                k = 2*p - n\n\n                If k < 1 or k >= p: continue   [but by our derivation, k must be in [1, p-1] and p>=ceil((n+1)/2) ensures k>=1 and p<=n-1 ensures k < p (because k=2p-n, and p<=n-1 => 2p<=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlapping error. The overlapping error means that the second copy of `s` starts from a position `k` (1 ≤ k < len(s)) into the first copy. The solution involves checking all possible lengths of `s` that could produce `t` through such an overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by taking the first `p` characters (which is `s`) and then appending the remaining part of `s` starting from the `k`-th character (where `k = 2*p - n`, and `n` is the length of `t`). The value of `p` must satisfy certain conditions to ensure the overlap is valid.\n2. **Conditions for Valid `p`**: The length `p` of `s` must be at least `ceil((n + 1)/2)` and at most `n - 1`. For each valid `p`, compute `k = 2*p - n`. If `k` is between 1 and `p - 1`, then check if the substring of `t` starting from `p` equals the substring of `s` starting from `k`.\n3. **Output Result**: If any valid `p` satisfies the condition, output \"YES\" followed by `s` (the first `p` characters of `t`). If no such `p` exists, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    \n    if n <= 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    p_min = (n + 2) // 2\n    p_max = n - 1\n    \n    found = False\n    for p in range(p_min, p_max + 1):\n        k = 2 * p - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= p:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:p]\n        rest = t[p:]\n        if rest == s_candidate[k:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the length of `t` is 0 or 1, it's impossible to have an overlapping error, so the output is \"NO\".\n3. **Range Calculation**: The minimum possible length `p_min` of `s` is calculated as `(n + 2) // 2`, which ensures `p` is at least the ceiling of `(n + 1)/2`. The maximum length `p_max` is `n - 1`.\n4. **Checking Valid `p`**: For each `p` from `p_min` to `p_max`, compute `k = 2*p - n`. If `k` is within the valid range [1, `p - 1`], check if the substring of `t` starting at `p` matches the substring of the first `p` characters of `t` starting at `k`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `p` is found, print \"YES\" and the corresponding `s`; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could be formed by overlapping two copies of `s`, ensuring correctness while minimizing unnecessary computations.",
