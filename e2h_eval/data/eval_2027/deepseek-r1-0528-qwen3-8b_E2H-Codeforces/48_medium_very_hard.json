He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens on the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (Roman numeral system) or both integers in the range [2,25].\n The next line is a string representing a non-negative integer c in base a (which may have leading zeros, but length <= 1000). \n However, note that if b is 'R', then we convert from base a to base (the Roman numeral representation). Also, the number in base a is given as a string.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Parse the first line: if the second token is 'R', then we need to convert from base a to Roman numerals.\n    Otherwise, convert from base a to base b (which is an integer base).\n\n 2. Convert the given string (which is in base a) to an integer in base 10.\n    But note: the input number can be very long (up to 1000 digits). However, the base a is at most 25, so we can do this conversion by iterating over the string.\n\n 3. If the target base is 'R' (Roman):\n    - We know the number (in base 10) is positive and guaranteed to be <= 300010 (if Roman is used) and not zero.\n    - We need to convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral string.\n\n 4. If the target base is an integer (b) between 2 and 25:\n    - Convert the base-10 integer to base b (as a string of digits, without leading zeros). \n      Note: the base b might be greater than 10, so we use letters for digits above 9 (like A for 10, B for 11, etc.)\n\n However, note the guarantee: \n   - In the case of Roman, the number is at most 300010 (so we don't need to handle very large numbers for Roman).\n   - In any other case, the number (base 10) is not greater than 10^1510? Actually, the input string has up to 1000 digits and base a is at most 25, so the base-10 integer could be extremely large (but the problem says \"it won't be greater than 10^1510\" only when it's not Roman). However, note that the input string length is up to 1000, and base a is at most 25, so the maximum value is 25^1000 which is way beyond 10^1510, but wait: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\". So we are safe in the non-Roman case because we are guaranteed that the base-10 integer is <= 10^1510? Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", meaning when b is an integer base, the base-a number (converted to base 10) is <= 10^1510. However, 10^1510 is a very big number, but our base b is at most 25, so we cannot directly use the standard integer conversion for such a big number (because 10^1510 is too big for standard integers in Python? Actually, Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but the conversion from base a string to base 10 might be done with careful handling of the exponentiation, but note: the base a is at most 25 and the string length is 1000, so the base-10 integer might have up to 1000 * log10(25) ~ 1000 * 1.4 = 1400 digits? That is acceptable as a string, but when we convert to an integer, Python can handle that. However, the problem says that in non-Roman cases the number is at most 10^1510, which is a number with 1511 digits. But note: 10^1510 is a 1 followed by 1510 zeros, which is a 1511-digit number. Our base-a (base<=25) number of 1000 digits in base25 is 25^1000, which is about 10^(1000*log10(25)) ~ 10^1400, which is less than 10^1510. So the problem's guarantee holds.\n\n However, there's a catch: the input number is given in base a (string) and we must convert it to base 10. Then if the target is an integer base, we convert the base-10 integer to base b. But wait: the base-10 integer might be too big to represent as an integer if we do direct conversion (because 10^1510 is huge). \n\n Alternative approach for non-Roman:\n   - Instead of converting the entire base-a string to a base-10 integer (which might be huge), we can convert the base-a string to base b directly.\n\n But wait: the problem says that in non-Roman cases the base-a number is <= 10^1510, so we can use the fact that we can convert the base-a string to an integer in base 10, but then we have to worry about the size of that integer. However, 10^1510 is a number that has 1511 digits, which is acceptable as a string but the integer might be too big for efficient conversion to base b? Actually, we can use the standard algorithm to convert from base a to base b without going through base 10.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n Option 1: Convert the base-a string to base 10, then if b is an integer base, convert base-10 to base b.\n\n But the base-10 integer might be too big (with 1511 digits) and then converting to base b (which is at most 25) would require many steps (but the base-10 integer is stored as a big integer, and Python can handle that, but the conversion might be slow for such a big number). However, 1511 digits in base 10 is about 10^1510, which is a number with 1511 digits, and converting to base 25 would take about 1511 * log_25(10) ~ 1511 * (log10(10)/log10(25)) = 1511 * (1/1.4) ~ 1079 digits in base25? Actually, the number of digits in base b is floor(log_b(n)) + 1. But we are not concerned with the exact number of digits, just the process.\n\n However, the problem says the input number (in base a) is represented by a string of up to 1000 digits. The base a is at least 2 and at most 25. The maximum value of the base-a number is (a^len - 1). For a=25 and len=1000, that is 25^1000, which is about 10^(1000*1.39794) ~ 10^1398, which is less than 10^1510. So the base-10 integer we get from the base-a string is at most 10^1510, which is a 1511-digit number. This is acceptable for Python's big integers, but we must be cautious because the problem says the number is non-negative and may contain leading zeros.\n\n But note: the problem says the input string may contain leading zeros. So we should strip any leading zeros? Actually, the input is given as a string, and we are to convert from base a. Leading zeros don't change the value, but they are present. We can convert the string with leading zeros by processing each digit.\n\n Steps for converting base-a string to base-10 integer:\n   Let s = input string (without spaces)\n   value = 0\n   for each char in s:\n        digit = convert char to integer in base a (if the char is a digit, then int(char); if base>10, then we might have letters? Actually, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" So the input string for base a (if a>10) uses digits and then letters from 'A' onward? But note: the input is given in base a, and a is at least 2 and at most 25.\n\n   However, the input is provided as a string. How are the digits represented?\n   Since a is at most 25, the digits can be from '0' to '9' and then 'A' to the letter representing (a-1) (if a>10). But note: the problem says \"integer number c in base a\", and the input string is given in that base.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base12, then A is 10 in base12. Then convert to base13: 10 in base12 is 10 in base10, then 10 in base13 is 'A'.\n\n   But wait: how do we read the string? The problem says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\"\n\n   However, the input string for base a (when a<=10) will only contain digits and possibly letters? Actually, no: the input string is given in base a, so the digits must be in the range [0, a-1]. For example, if base a=16, then we use 0-9 and A-F. But our base a is at most 25, so we might have digits beyond 10.\n\n   How to map the characters to digits?\n   We can do:\n        if the character is between '0' and '9': digit = int(char)\n        else: digit = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n\n   But note: the input string may have been given with digits that are in base a. For example, if base a=10, then we have digits 0-9. If base a=11, then we have digits 0-9 and 'A'. But what if the base a is 11 and the input string contains a 'B'? That would be invalid. However, the problem says: \"a non-negative integer c in base a\", so we assume the string is valid.\n\n   Steps for converting base-a string to base-10 integer:\n        n = 0\n        for each char in the string (from left to right):\n            d = convert_char(char, a)   # returns the integer value of the digit\n            n = n * a + d\n\n   But note: the string might have leading zeros, and the base a is given. This method works.\n\n   However, if the base-10 integer is too big (like 10^1510) and we are going to convert it to base b (an integer base) by repeated division, that repeated division would be too slow because the number has 1511 digits. \n\n   Alternative: we can convert the base-a string directly to base b without going through base 10.\n\n   Steps for direct conversion (base a to base b):\n        We can use the same method as base 10 conversion, but we use base b.\n\n        However, we are starting from base a. We can do:\n\n        Let x be the base-a number (we can compute it by the above method, but that gives a base-10 integer). Then convert that base-10 integer to base b.\n\n        But wait: the base-10 integer might be too big to store as an integer? Actually, 10^1510 is a number with 1511 digits, which is acceptable in Python as an integer (though it is big, Python supports arbitrary large integers). However, the conversion from base 10 to base b (for b<=25) by repeated division would take about O(log_b(n)) steps, which is about 1511 * log(10^1510)/log(b) ~ 1511 * 1510 / log(b). For base 25, log(25) is about 1.3979, so 1510 / 1.3979 ~ 1080, so total steps around 1511 * 1080 ~ 1.6 million steps, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the base-10 integer is <= 10^1510, so we are safe.\n\n   However, there's another issue: the input string has up to 1000 digits, and base a is at most 25. The base-10 integer we compute from the string is at most 25^1000, which is about 10^1398.5, so less than 10^1510. So we can safely convert the base-a string to base-10 integer.\n\n   But note: the input string might be \"0\" (but the problem says: in Roman case the number isn't zero, and in non-Roman the number is non-negative; however, the input string might be \"0\" in non-Roman case? The problem says: \"non-negative integer c in base a\", and \"its length doesn't exceed 1000\". Also, in non-Roman case, the number is at most 10^1510, so 0 is allowed? But note the condition: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", so 0 is allowed. And the problem says non-negative.\n\n   However, the example inputs: \n        ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n   We must handle the case when the base-a number is 0.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Case 1: b is 'R'\n        Convert base-a string to base-10 integer (if the string is \"0\", then output is \"?\" but note: the problem says in Roman case the number is not zero. So we don't have to handle 0 in Roman? Actually, the problem says: \"if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0\". So we can assume the input number in base a is positive and <= 300010.\n\n        Then convert the base-10 integer to Roman.\n\n   Case 2: b is integer\n        Convert base-a string to base-10 integer (n). If n==0, then output \"0\".\n        Then convert n to base b.\n\n   But wait: what if the base-a string is \"0\"? Then n=0. Then we output \"0\" in base b (if b is integer). But if b is 'R', then according to the problem we don't get 0, so we don't have to handle 0 in Roman.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\", so 0 is possible in non-Roman.\n\n   How to convert base-a string to base-10 integer?\n\n        We can do:\n\n        digits = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n        # But note: the base a might be 11, then the digits only go up to 'A'. We don't need to use the full 36 digits.\n\n        Actually, we can map the character to a digit by:\n\n        if char in '0123456789':\n            d = int(char)\n        else:\n            d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n\n        But wait: what if the base a is 11, then the digit 'A' is allowed, but if the base a is 10, then 'A' is not allowed. Similarly, if base a is 12, then we have digits from 0 to 11, so we use '0'-'9' and 'A','B'. \n\n        However, the input string is given in base a, so the digits must be in the range [0, a-1]. Therefore, we can also check: if the char is not a digit and not a letter, then it's invalid? But the problem says it's a valid base a number.\n\n        Alternatively, we can map the character to a digit by:\n\n        def char_to_digit(char):\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                return int(char)\n            else:\n                # It must be a letter, but we don't know the base? Actually, we know base a.\n                # But the mapping: we can use the index in the string of allowed digits? \n                # Actually, we can use the entire set of digits from 0 to a-1, and the representation uses the usual: 0-9 and then A, B, ... until we have a digits.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" So the representation is exactly the first a characters of the string \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\".\n\n        So we can create a string of a digits: \n            digits_str = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"[:a]\n\n        Then, the digit for a character is the index of that character in digits_str.\n\n        Example: base a=16, then digits_str = \"0123456789ABCDEF\", and then for char 'A', index is 10.\n\n        But note: the input string might use a digit that is beyond the first a characters? According to the problem, no. So we can do:\n\n        n = 0\n        digits_str = ''.join(str(i) for i in range(a))\n        # But wait, if a=11, then we need to include letters. Actually, we should form a string of a characters: the first 10 are '0' to '9', then the next are uppercase letters.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        base_a_digits = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n        if a <= len(base_a_digits):\n            digits_str = base_a_digits[:a]\n        else:\n            # but a is at most 25, so we don't need to worry.\n\n        Then, for each char in the input string:\n            if char not in digits_str: \n                # This should not happen per the problem, but let's assume valid input.\n                # But the problem says the input is valid, so we skip this check.\n            d = digits_str.index(char)\n\n        Then, n = n * a + d\n\n   But note: the input string might have leading zeros. This method naturally handles that.\n\n   Now, converting base-10 integer to base b (if b is integer):\n\n        If n==0, then return \"0\"\n\n        Otherwise, we do:\n\n        digits_list = []\n        while n:\n            n, r = divmod(n, b)\n            digits_list.append(convert_r_to_char(r))\n\n        Then reverse digits_list and combine.\n\n        How to convert r (which is in [0, b-1]) to a character?\n            if r < 10: char = str(r)\n            else: char = chr(ord('A') + r - 10)\n\n   However, note: the base b might be 1? But the problem says base b is at least 2 and at most 25.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the first token is a (integer base) and the second token is either integer base b (in [2,25]) or 'R'. So b is at least 2.\n\n   Now, the Roman numeral conversion:\n\n        We are given a base-10 integer n (positive, and <= 300010) and we want to convert it to Roman.\n\n        We can use the standard method: mapping the integer to the corresponding Roman numerals by subtractive notation.\n\n        Steps for Roman conversion:\n\n        We'll use the following mapping (from highest to lowest):\n\n        roman_numerals = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400), ('C', 100),\n            ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40), ('X', 10),\n            ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n        ]\n\n        Then, we can do:\n\n        def to_roman(n):\n            res = ''\n            for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n                # While n >= value, subtract value and append numeral\n                count = n // value\n                res += numeral * count\n                n -= value * count\n                if n == 0:\n                    break\n            return res\n\n        But wait: the standard method is to use greedy from highest to lowest.\n\n        Example: 58 -> \n            M: 58//1000=0\n            CM: 58//900=0\n            D: 58//500=0\n            CD: 58//400=0\n            C: 58//100=0\n            XC: 58//90=0\n            L: 58//50=1 -> then we subtract 50, then n=8.\n            Then X: 8//10=0\n            IX: 8//9=0\n            Then V: 8//5=1 -> subtract 5, then n=3.\n            IV: 3//4=0\n            I: 3//1=3 -> subtract 3, then n=0.\n\n            Result: LIII? But 58 is LVIII.\n\n        Correction: the standard method is to use the mapping in descending order and then use the next lower symbol when the current one is not available.\n\n        Actually, the standard algorithm is:\n\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'),\n            (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n\n        Then:\n\n        def to_roman(n):\n            roman_map = [\n                (1000, 'M'),\n                (900, 'CM'),\n                (500, 'D'),\n                (400, 'CD'),\n                (100, 'C'),\n                (90, 'XC'),\n                (50, 'L'),\n                (40, 'XL'),\n                (10, 'X'),\n                (9, 'IX'),\n                (5, 'V'),\n                (4, 'IV'),\n                (1, 'I')\n            ]\n            res = ''\n            for value, numeral in roman_map:\n                # Count how many times `value` fits in n\n                count = n // value\n                if count:\n                    res += numeral * count\n                n -= value * count\n                if n == 0:\n                    break\n            return res\n\n        Let's test with 58:\n            Start with 1000: 58//1000=0\n            900: 0\n            500:0\n            400:0\n            100:0\n            90:0\n            50: 58//50=1 -> subtract 50, n=8, then add 'L'\n            Then 40: 8//40=0\n            10: 8//10=0\n            9: 8//9=0\n            5: 8//5=1 -> subtract 5, n=3, then add 'V'\n            Then 4: 3//4=0\n            1: 3//1=3 -> subtract 3, then add 'III'\n\n            Result: 'LVIII'\n\n        Another test: 4 -> \n            1000:0, ... until 5: 4//5=0, then 4: 4//4=1 -> 'IV'\n\n        This matches.\n\n   However, note the problem says: the number in Roman is at most 300010. The Roman numeral for 300010 is \"MM...M\" (300000) plus 10? Actually, 300010 is 300000+10, but 300000 is represented as MMM... (300000/1000=300 times 'M') and then 10 is 'X'. But wait, 300000 is 300 thousands, so actually we break down:\n\n        300000: \n            MMM... (300 times) -> but that's 300*M, which is 300*1000=300000.\n\n        Then 10: X.\n\n        So total: 300*M and 1*X -> MMM... (300 times) and then X.\n\n        But 300010 is within the limit.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read the first line: split into two tokens.\n\n   tokens = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n   a_str = tokens[0]\n   b_str = tokens[1]\n\n   Then read the next line: num_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n   If b_str == 'R':\n        # Convert num_str from base a to base 10\n        base_a = int(a_str)\n        # Create a string of base_a digits: from '0' to the digit representing base_a-1\n        # We assume the input digits are in the set of the first base_a characters of \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n\n        # But note: the base_a might be 1?

However, we modified n in the Roman conversion? \n\n        In the Roman conversion, we have:\n            n = original base10 integer\n            then we do: \n                for each numeral, subtract value * count from n.\n\n            Then we break when n becomes 0.\n\n        But then we don't use n anymore. So that's okay.\n\n   However, in the non-Roman case, we use the same base10 conversion and then the variable n is the base10 integer.\n\n   But note: the base10 conversion for the same input string is done regardless of whether we are doing Roman or not.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let's test with the examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"10 2\\n1\"\n        base_a=10, base_b=2, num_str=\"1\"\n        n = 1 (from base10 conversion: 1 in base10 is 1)\n        Then, convert 1 to base2: \n            while 1: \n                divmod(1,2) -> (0,1)\n                digits_list = ['1']\n            reversed is '1'\n        Output: \"1\"\n\n   Example 2: \"16 R\\n5\"\n        base_a=16, base_b='R', num_str=\"5\"\n        n = 5 (from base16: but wait, base16 digits: the string \"5\" is valid, so n=5)\n        Then, convert 5 to Roman: \n            roman_numerals: \n                5: count=1, so add 'V', then n=0 -> break.\n        Output: \"V\"\n\n   Example 3: \"5 R\\n4\"\n        base_a=5, base_b='R', num_str=\"4\"\n        n = 4 (since base5: 4 is 4 in base10)\n        Then, convert 4 to Roman: \n            Check: 1000,900,...,5: 4//5=0, then 4: 4//4=1, so add 'IV' -> wait, no: the mapping for 4 is 'IV'. \n            Actually, the mapping for 4 is (4, 'IV') so we add 'IV' once and then n becomes 0.\n        Output: \"IV\"\n\n   Example 4: \"2 2\\n1111001\"\n        base_a=2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of converting to Roman numerals. The solution involves reading input values, converting the number from its original base to base 10, and then either converting it to the target base or to Roman numerals based on the input specifications.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to get the source base (a) and the target base (b), which could be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. The second line contains the number in the source base as a string.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input string from the source base to a base-10 integer. This involves processing each character of the string, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value by considering the base.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', convert the base-10 integer to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman symbols, processed in descending order.\n4. **Base Conversion from Decimal**: If the target base is an integer, convert the base-10 integer to the target base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (using letters for values greater than 9).\n5. **Output Handling**: Ensure leading zeros are omitted in the output. For Roman numerals, handle the conversion correctly according to Roman numeral rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1]\n    \n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    base_a_digits = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    \n    n = 0\n    for char in num_str:\n        if char in base_a_digits:\n            digit_val = base_a_digits.index(char)\n        else:\n            digit_val = 0\n        n = n * int(a_str) + digit_val\n\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'),\n            (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        roman_str = ''\n        for value, numeral in roman_numerals:\n            count = n // value\n            if count:\n                roman_str += numeral * count\n                n -= value * count\n                if n == 0:\n                    break\n        print(roman_str)\n    else:\n        base_b = int(b_str)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits_list = []\n            num = n\n            while num:\n                num, r = divmod(num, base_b)\n                if r < 10:\n                    digits_list.append(str(r))\n                else:\n                    digits_list.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n            s = ''.join(digits_list[::-1])\n            print(s)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads two lines: the first line specifies the source and target bases, and the second line provides the number in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion**: The input number string is converted from the source base to a base-10 integer by processing each character, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the base-10 integer is converted to Roman numerals by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the integer and appending the corresponding symbols to the result string.\n4. **Base Conversion**: For an integer target base, the base-10 integer is divided by the target base repeatedly. The remainders of these divisions are collected and mapped to digits (using letters for values 10 and above). The collected digits are then reversed to form the correct order in the target base.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, ensuring no leading zeros are present. The solution efficiently handles all edge cases, including zero and very large numbers (within specified limits).",
