Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers for the lantern positions.\n The idea is to find the minimum d such that the entire street [0, l] is covered by the lanterns' light.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps between the lanterns and also the edges (from 0 to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to l).\n\n However, note that the problem states that the street is from 0 to l, and the lanterns can be at any points (including ends).\n\n Approach:\n Let the sorted lantern positions be in an array `a`.\n\n We need to cover the entire interval [0, l]. The coverage of a lantern at position x with radius d is [x-d, x+d].\n\n But note: the entire street must be covered. So we have to consider:\n\n - The leftmost gap: from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the first lantern's position.\n   Therefore, the required d must be at least (a[0] - 0) / 2? Actually, no: if the first lantern is at a[0], then to cover 0, we require that the left side of the lantern's light (a[0]-d) is <= 0, so d >= a[0]/2. But wait, actually the entire segment from 0 to a[0] must be covered. The best way is to extend from the left by d. Similarly for the right.\n\n However, note that multiple lanterns might cover overlapping segments.\n\n Actually, we can break the problem into:\n\n 1. Cover the left end: from 0 to the first lantern. The distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0]. To cover 0, the first lantern must have d >= a[0]/2? Not necessarily: if there is another lantern to the left (but we don't have any), so we must have d >= a[0] (if we only use the first lantern to cover 0) but wait: actually, the first lantern covers from a[0]-d to a[0]+d. For 0 to be covered, we require a[0]-d <= 0 -> d>=a[0]. However, if we have more than one lantern, we can use the combination. But note: the problem asks for the minimum d such that the entire street is lit.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can think of the entire street as being covered by the union of intervals [ai-d, ai+d]. We want the minimum d such that [0, l] is contained in the union.\n\n We can compute the coverage from left to right.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. The coverage must start from 0 and go to l.\n\n How about:\n\n Let d_min = 0.0\n\n We know that the entire street must be covered. We can consider:\n\n - The gap from 0 to the first lantern: the first lantern must cover from 0 to its position. The required d for the first lantern to cover the left side is (first_lantern_position - 0) / 2? Actually, the first lantern doesn't necessarily have to cover half the gap by itself. But note: if the first lantern is the only one to cover the beginning, then we must have d >= (first_lantern_position)/2? No, because the lantern must cover from 0 to first_lantern_position. The condition is that the leftmost point 0 must be within d of the first lantern: i.e., first_lantern_position - d <= 0 -> d >= first_lantern_position. But wait, that would be if we require the entire segment from 0 to first_lantern_position to be covered by this lantern alone? Actually, no: the lantern at first_lantern_position covers from (first_lantern_position - d) to (first_lantern_position + d). We require that 0 is in [first_lantern_position - d, ...], so first_lantern_position - d <= 0 -> d >= first_lantern_position.\n\n However, consider the example: \"2 5\\n2 5\". \n   n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5].\n   If we set d=2, then:\n      First lantern at 2: covers [0,4]\n      Second lantern at 5: covers [3,7]\n   Together they cover [0,7] which includes [0,5]. So d=2 works.\n\n   Now, what if we set d=2 for the first lantern: then the first lantern must cover from 0 to 4. Then the second lantern must cover from 3 to 7. But note the gap from 4 to 3? Actually, 4 to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points along a street of length `l` are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at specific points along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This allows us to systematically analyze the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the edges of the street (from 0 to the first lantern and from the last lantern to `l`).\n\n2. **Check Edge Cases**: \n   - If there are no lanterns (`n = 0`), the entire street must be covered by a single lantern, so the required `d` is `l / 2`.\n   - If the street is already fully lit by the existing lanterns, the required `d` might be zero, but typically we need to cover the gaps between lanterns.\n\n3. **Calculate Minimum Radius**:\n   - **Left Edge Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the start of the street (0). The required `d` here is the distance from the first lantern to 0, which is simply the position of the first lantern.\n   - **Right Edge Coverage**: Similarly, the last lantern must cover the end of the street (`l`). The required `d` here is the distance from the last lantern to `l`, i.e., `l - last_lantern_position`.\n   - **Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between them is `(next_lantern - current_lantern)`. To ensure the entire street is covered, the sum of the radii from both sides of the gap must cover the entire gap. The required `d` for each gap is half the gap length, i.e., `gap / 2`.\n\n4. **Determine the Overall Minimum Radius**: The solution involves taking the maximum value among the left edge coverage, right edge coverage, and the midpoints of the gaps between consecutive lanterns. This ensures that even the largest gap or edge is adequately covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    a = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(l / 2))\n        return\n        \n    a.sort()\n    \n    if a[0] == 0 and a[-1] == l:\n        d_required = 0.0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            if gap > 2 * d_required:\n                d_required = gap / 2.0\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d_required))\n        return\n        \n    d_candidate = 0.0\n    \n    # Check left edge\n    d_candidate = max(d_candidate, a[0])\n    \n    # Check gaps between lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        d_candidate = max(d_candidate, gap / 2.0)\n        \n    # Check right edge\n    d_candidate = max(d_candidate, l - a[-1])\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d_candidate))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If there are no lanterns, the solution defaults to covering the entire street with a single lantern's radius, which is `l / 2`.\n3. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate gap analysis.\n4. **Coverage Calculation**: The algorithm checks three main areas:\n   - **Left Edge**: The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern.\n   - **Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the midpoint of the gap determines the required radius to cover the space between them without overlapping lantern coverage.\n   - **Right Edge**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`).\n5. **Output**: The maximum value among these three areas is printed as the minimum required radius `d`, formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the entire street is covered by the lanterns with the minimal possible radius, considering all potential gaps and edges.",
