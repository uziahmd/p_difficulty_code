Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are going to process up to 10^5 queries and the initial string can be up to 10^5 in length.\n The idea: We cannot do naive string replacement (which would be too slow) because each query could replace many digits and the replacements might chain.\n\n However, note that there are only 10 digits (0-9). We can precompute for each digit what transformation it goes through in the entire sequence of queries.\n\n But note: the queries are applied in order. So a later query might override an earlier one for the same digit? Actually, the problem says:\n   Initially, s is given.\n   Then, multiple queries: each is \"di -> ti\"\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"222\", then two queries: first \"2->0\", then \"0->7\". Then the final string is \"777\".\n\n How to handle?\n   We can think backwards: but note the problem is sequential.\n\n Alternate approach: Since there are only 10 digits, we can process the queries from last to first to build a transformation for each digit.\n\n However, the problem: the replacement in one query uses the current string and replaces every occurrence of a digit by a string. Then the next query operates on the entire string.\n\n We can model the entire process as a transformation on the string. But note: the total length of all ti's is at most 10^5, so we can store for each digit a string that it becomes after all queries.\n\n But note: if we do forward substitution naively, the string might become very long (exponential in worst-case if we have cycles? Actually, the total length of ti's is bounded by 10^5, but note that the same digit might be replaced multiple times and the replacement strings might contain digits that are also being replaced.\n\n However, the problem says: the queries are performed in the given order.\n\n Let me explain:\n\n   We have an initial string s. Then we do query1, then query2, ... queryn.\n\n   Each query i: replace every occurrence of digit di with ti.\n\n   But note: after a query, the string becomes longer (or shorter, if ti is empty) and then the next query is applied to the entire string.\n\n   Example: \n        s = \"123\"\n        Query1: \"2->00\" -> becomes \"1003\"\n        Query2: \"3->\"   -> becomes \"100\"\n\n   However, if we have:\n        s = \"22\"\n        Query1: \"2->00\" -> becomes \"0000\"\n        Query2: \"0->7\"   -> becomes \"7777\"\n\n   But note: the second query uses the current string which now contains '0's.\n\n   We have to consider that the same digit might be expanded in multiple steps.\n\n   We can use dynamic programming or iterative mapping for each digit.\n\n   Idea: Instead of processing the entire string for each query (which would be too slow, because the string can grow exponentially), we precompute for each digit what it becomes after all the queries.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let's define for each digit d (from '0' to '9') a string T(d) which is the final representation after all queries.\n\n   However, the queries are applied sequentially. So we need to know: when we have a digit d, we look at the last query that targets d? Actually, no: because the queries are applied in order, and the same digit might appear multiple times and be replaced by different strings at different steps.\n\n   But wait: the queries are independent in the sense that they specify a digit and a replacement. However, the replacement in an earlier query might introduce digits that are then replaced by later queries.\n\n   Therefore, we can process the queries backwards.\n\n   Consider: \n        We start from the last query and go backwards. For each digit, we want to know what it becomes at the end.\n\n        Let f(d) be the final string for digit d.\n\n        When we see a query \"d0 -> s0\", then if we are processing from the last query to the first, then this query is the last one that affects d0. But note: after the last query, we don't have any more transformations. However, before that, the digit d0 might have been transformed by previous queries? Actually, no: because the last query is the one that was applied last, so if we are processing backwards, we are essentially undoing the last query.\n\n        Alternatively, we can build a transformation for each digit from the last query to the first, such that:\n\n          Initially, for each digit d, let F[d] = d (a string of one character)\n\n          Then, for each query from last to first (reverse order) of \"d -> t\":\n            For each digit d' (0-9), we update F[d'] as",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing specific digits with other strings. The challenge lies in efficiently handling these transformations without resorting to naive string replacements, which could be computationally expensive due to the potential growth of the string length. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The initial string consists of digits, and each query specifies replacing all occurrences of a particular digit with another string. The key observation is that the transformations must be applied in sequence, and each transformation can affect subsequent ones if the replacement string contains digits that are themselves subject to later transformations.\n2. **Insight**: Since there are only 10 possible digits (0-9), we can model the transformations for each digit independently. By processing the queries in reverse order, we can determine the final form of each digit after all transformations have been applied. This involves updating the transformation for each digit based on the current query and the transformations that will follow it.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming where each digit's final representation is built iteratively from the last query backward. For each query, we update the representation of the target digit by replacing it with the specified string, but also consider that any digits within this string might themselves be transformed by subsequent queries. Thus, we incorporate the latest known transformations during each update.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each query once in reverse order and updates the transformations for all 10 digits. The total operations are linear with respect to the number of queries and the sum of the lengths of the replacement strings, making it efficient for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries.append(input().strip())\n    \n    rep = {str(i): str(i) for i in range(10)}\n    \n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d = parts[0]\n        t_str = parts[1] if len(parts) >= 2 else ''\n        \n        if d not in '0123456789':\n            continue\n            \n        new_t = []\n        for char in t_str:\n            if char in rep:\n                new_t.append(rep[char])\n            else:\n                new_t.append(char)\n        rep[d] = ''.join(new_t)\n    \n    num_str = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char in rep:\n            num_str.append(rep[char])\n        else:\n            num_str.append(char)\n    \n    result = ''.join(num_str)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input. Each query is stored in a list.\n2. **Reverse Processing**: The queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the target digit is replaced by the specified string, but any digits within this string are further processed using the latest transformations (from subsequent queries).\n3. **Transformation Handling**: A dictionary `rep` keeps track of the final form of each digit after all transformations. For each query, the target digit's entry in `rep` is updated to the transformed version of the replacement string.\n4. **Result Construction**: After processing all queries, the initial string `s` is transformed by replacing each digit with its final form from the `rep` dictionary. The resulting string is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformations by leveraging dynamic updates and ensures optimal performance even for large inputs.",
