    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are to count the number of arrays [S1, S2, ..., SN] of N sets (each set contains distinct integers from 1 to K) such that there exists a rearrangement [S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N] satisfying:\n   S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1} for each i from 1 to N-1.\n\n Definition: A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, the set B contains x+1.\n\n Note: The condition must hold for the entire chain. Since we can rearrange arbitrarily, we are effectively looking for sequences of sets (possibly with repetition) that form a chain under the \"child\" relation.\n\n Observation:\n\n Let T be the multiset of sets in the array. Then we require that there exists an ordering of T such that for each consecutive pair (S_i, S_{i+1}), \n   For every x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}.\n\n This condition is equivalent to saying that the entire sequence of sets must be \"compatible\" in the sense that the elements present in the sets can be linked by increasing by one.\n\n However, note that the sets are allowed to be any subsets of {1,2,...,K}. But note the condition: we can rearrange arbitrarily. So we are free to assign the sets to positions arbitrarily.\n\n What does it mean for two sets to be connected? Actually, the condition must hold for consecutive sets. We can think of the entire multiset as being arranged in a chain.\n\n Let's denote by F(n, k) the answer for given n and k.\n\n Another way: Consider what numbers can appear in the sets. Note that if a set contains a number x, then the next set must contain x+1. Therefore, the chain must have increasing numbers by at least one step at each link.\n\n Also note that we are allowed to use any numbers from 1 to K, but the chain must not break (unless we use the empty set). However, the empty set is allowed and has no constraints.\n\n We can think of the chain as having a \"flow\" of numbers. Each set must be contained in the next set (with the transformation x -> x+1). But note: the condition is only one direction: for every x in A, x+1 is in B. It does not require that B has only x+1's or that A is a subset of B (in terms of set inclusion). \n\n Example: \n   Let A = {1,3} and B = {2,4}. Then A is a child of B because:\n      1 is in A -> 2 is in B (ok)\n      3 is in A -> 4 is in B (ok)\n\n But note: A is not necessarily a subset of B. So the sets can share numbers arbitrarily, as long as the condition holds.\n\n However, note that the chain must hold for the entire array. Since we can rearrange arbitrarily, we are effectively counting the number of multisets of size N (each element is a set) such that the multiset can be arranged in a chain.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the entire collection of sets and the requirement for the chain. The chain condition imposes that if we consider the entire multiset, then for any number x that appears, then x+1 must appear in a set that comes after (in the chain) the set containing x. But note: we are allowed to have multiple copies of the same set? And also, the sets are not necessarily distinct.\n\n However, note the definition: two arrays of sets are different if at least one index has a different set. And two sets are different if they differ in at least one element.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let's try small cases.\n\n Case 1: N=1.\n   Then we don't need any rearrangement (only one set). So we can choose any set from the power set of {1..K}. There are 2^K possibilities.\n\n   But wait: the condition is vacuously true (no consecutive pairs). So answer for N=1 is 2^K.\n\n Case 2: N=2.\n   We have two sets [A, B]. We can arrange them as either [A, B] or [B, A]. The condition requires that one arrangement satisfies the child condition.\n\n   Condition: Either A is a child of B, OR B is a child of A.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"there exists a rearrangement\", so we don't require both.\n\n   How to count?\n\n   Let's denote by F(S) the set of sets T such that S is a child of T. Then the condition for two sets is that either:\n        A ⊆ F(B)   OR   B ⊆ F(A)\n\n   But note: the condition is defined by: for all x in A",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of different arrays of N sets such that there exists a rearrangement of these sets where each set is a child of the next set in the sequence. A set A is considered a child of set B if for every element x in A, the element x+1 is present in B.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the condition for the sets to form a valid chain under the \"child\" relation can be broken down into independent conditions for each number from 1 to K. Specifically, for each number x (from 1 to K-1), we must ensure that if a set contains x, then the next set in the chain must contain x+1. \n\n2. **Intuition**: The problem can be reduced to considering the transitions between consecutive sets in the chain. For each position in the chain, the presence of certain numbers in the current set imposes constraints on the next set. \n\n3. **Dynamic Programming and Combinatorics**: We use dynamic programming to count the valid sequences. The solution involves recognizing that the problem can be modeled by considering the state of each set in terms of the numbers it contains, but a more efficient approach leverages combinatorial mathematics to avoid the high computational cost of direct enumeration.\n\n4. **Mathematical Insight**: The answer can be derived by considering the choices available at each step. For the first set, any subset of {1, 2, ..., K} can be chosen. For subsequent sets, the choice depends on the previous set's elements. However, a combinatorial approach simplifies this by recognizing that the problem can be separated into independent segments for each number from 1 to K.\n\n5. **Final Formula**: The solution involves computing the product of combinations for each number from 1 to K, adjusted by the number of sets (N). Specifically, for each number i from 1 to K, we consider the number of ways to distribute the occurrences of i across the N sets, ensuring the child condition is met. The result is the product of these combinations modulo 998244353.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(pow(2, k, MOD))\n        return\n        \n    total = 1\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        if i < k:\n            total = total * pow(2, n - 1, MOD) % MOD\n        else:\n            total = total * pow(n + 1, n, MOD) % MOD\n            \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Case Handling**: If there is only one set (N=1), the answer is simply \\(2^K\\) because any subset of {1, 2, ..., K} is allowed.\n2. **General Case**: For N > 1, the solution involves iterating over each number from 1 to K. For each number i:\n   - If i is not the last number (i < K), the number of valid transitions is \\(2^{N-1}\\), as each subsequent set can either include or exclude i+1 independently, but constrained by the previous set's inclusion of i.\n   - For the last number (i = K), the number of valid transitions is \\((N + 1)^N\\), accounting for all possible distributions of K across the N sets while maintaining the child condition.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: The result is computed modulo 998244353 to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the answer by leveraging combinatorial mathematics and modular arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of N and K.",
