There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: n, h, m and then m lines of [l, r, x]\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use dynamic programming or iterate over possibilities, but note that the restrictions might overlap.\n\n Idea:\n We have to assign a height for each spot from 0 to h (with the condition that the house at spot i must be at most h) such that for every restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i), the maximum height in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i.\n\n However, note that the same spot may be covered by multiple restrictions. The catch is that we must satisfy all restrictions.\n\n Alternate idea: Since n and m are small (<=50), we can try to use state space search with memoization. But note: the state for each spot could be from 0 to h (so 51 states per spot) and we have 50 spots -> 51^50 states which is too many.\n\n Another idea: We can consider the restrictions and the fact that the profit function is quadratic (which is convex). Therefore, we want to set each house as high as possible (but constrained by the restrictions).\n\n However, the restrictions are not independent. Each restriction imposes an upper bound on the entire segment. The actual height we can assign to a house at position i is the minimum of:\n   - h (the global maximum)\n   - the upper bounds from all restrictions that cover this house.\n\n But wait: is that correct? Actually, if we set each house to the minimum of h and the restrictions' upper bounds that include it, then we are satisfying all restrictions. However, note that the restrictions are about the maximum in their segment. \n\n However, consider: if we set each house to the minimum value of the restrictions that cover it (and also <=h), then the condition for each restriction is automatically satisfied because the maximum in the segment would be at most the minimum of the restrictions' upper bounds? Not exactly: \n\n Example: two restrictions: \n   Restriction 1: [1,3] with x=2\n   Restriction 2: [1,2] with x=1\n Then for the third house (if any) we only have restriction 1, so we set it to 2. But if we set the first two houses to 1 (min of the two restrictions) and the third house to 2, then the entire street has max 2 which satisfies the first restriction, but the second restriction requires the segment [1,2] to have max<=1. However, our assignment for the first two houses is 1, which satisfies the second restriction. But if we set the first two houses to 1, then the entire segment [1,3] has maximum 2 (from the third house) which is okay, but the segment [1,2] has maximum 1 which is okay.\n\n However, what if we set the third house to 2? Then the second restriction does not care about the third house. \n\n But note: the above method (taking the minimum of the restrictions that cover the house) does not work because the restriction is defined on the entire segment. For example, if we have two restrictions:\n   Restriction 1: [1,3] with x=2\n   Restriction 2: [1,2] with x=3\n\n Then the house at spot 1 must be <= min(2,3)=2, spot 2 must be <= min(2,3)=2, and spot 3 must be <=2. Then the maximum in [1,3] is 2 which is <=2, and [1,2] has maximum 2 which is <=3. So that's okay.\n\n But wait: what if we have overlapping restrictions with different constraints? Consider:\n\n   Restriction 1: [1,3] with x=2\n   Restriction 2: [2,4] with x=3\n\n Then house 1: min(2) = 2\n      house 2: min(2,3)=2\n      house 3: min(2,3)=2\n      house 4: 3 (if there is a house 4)\n\n Now, check restriction1: [1,3] has max 2 -> ok.\n restriction2: [2,4] has max max(2,2,2,3)=3 -> ok.\n\n But is it always optimal to set the house to the minimum of the restrictions that cover it? \n\n However, consider: the profit function is a^2, which is increasing and convex. Therefore, we want to set each house as high as possible. The constraint for a house i is that in every restriction j that covers i, the house i must be <= x_j. Moreover, the entire segment must have maximum <= x_j. \n\n But note: the condition for a restriction j is that the maximum over [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j. This condition is enforced by the entire segment, not just the individual houses. However, if we set each house to the minimum of the restrictions that cover it, then the entire segment for a restriction j will have no house exceeding x_j (because every house in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j). Therefore, the maximum in the segment is <= x_j. \n\n So the necessary condition for a valid assignment is that for each house i, let M_i = min{ h, x_j for all restrictions j that cover i }.\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? Yes, because then for any restriction j (which covers houses from l_j to r_j), every house in that segment is <= x_j, so the maximum is <= x_j.\n\n However, is that the best we can do? What if we set one house lower than M_i and set another house higher? But note: the profit is a^2, so we want to set each house as high as possible. And if we set a house lower than M_i, then we are not taking advantage of the full potential (unless forced by other restrictions that don't cover it? Actually, the house is constrained only by the restrictions that cover it. \n\n Therefore, we can set each house i to its maximum allowed value M_i = min(h, {x_j for all j such that i in [l_j, r_j]}) and then the profit is sum(i=1 to n) (M_i)^2.\n\n But wait: is that always true? Consider the following:\n\n Example: two restrictions that overlap but with different x's, but we cannot set a house to the minimum of the two x's if that minimum is too low? Actually, the above reasoning says that we can set each house to the minimum of the restrictions that cover it (and h). \n\n However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: Input \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n Using the above method:\n   House1: covered by restriction1 -> min(3,1) = 1\n   House2: covered by restriction2 -> min(3,3)=3\n   House3: covered by restriction3 -> min(3,2)=2\n\n Then profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14. Matches.\n\n Example 2: Input \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n   House1: no restriction (since both restrictions start at 2) -> min(10) = 10\n   House2: covered by restriction1 -> min(10,8)=8\n   House3: covered by both restrictions -> min(10,8,7)=7\n   House4: covered by restriction2 -> min(10,7)=7\n\n Then profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262. Matches.\n\n But wait: why is house1 set to 10? There is no restriction covering house1, so we set it to h=10. That's correct.\n\n However, let me think of a counterexample:\n\n Suppose we have two restrictions:\n   Restriction1: [1,2] with x=1\n   Restriction2: [1,2] with x=2\n\n Then the method sets each house to min(1,2)=1. But what if we set house1 to 1 and house2 to 2? Then the entire segment [1,2] has maximum 2, which satisfies the first restriction (which requires <=1)? No, wait: the first restriction says the tallest house in [1,2] must be <=1. So we cannot set house2 to 2 because then the maximum is 2 which violates restriction1.\n\n So the method must take the minimum of the restrictions that cover the house. In this example, for house1 and house2, we have two restrictions: one with x=1 and one with x=2. Therefore, the minimum is 1. So both houses must be 1.\n\n Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n, h, m.\n 2. For each of the m lines, read l, r, x.\n 3. For each house i (from 1 to n), compute the minimum value among:\n        h\n    and all x_j for which the restriction j covers i (i.e., l_j <= i <= r_j)\n\n 4. Then for each house i, set its height to the computed minimum value (let's call it a_i).\n 5. Compute the profit: sum(a_i^2 for i from 1 to n)\n\n However, wait: is it really that simple? Let me check with the example I just made:\n\n Example: two restrictions [1,2] with x=1 and [1,2] with x=2.\n\n   House1: min(h, 1, 2) = min(h,1,2) = min(10,1,2)=1 (if h>=1)\n   House2: same.\n\n Then profit = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2.\n\n But what if we set house1 to 1 and house2 to 1? Then the maximum in [1,2] is 1, which satisfies the restriction that requires <=1. So that's valid.\n\n What if we set house1 to 0 and house2 to 1? Then the profit is 0+1=1, which is worse.\n\n What if we set house1 to 1 and house2 to 0? Then the profit is 1+0=1.\n\n So the maximum is indeed 2.\n\n But consider: what if we have two restrictions that are conflicting in a different way?\n\n Example: \n   Restriction1: [1,2] with x=1\n   Restriction2: [2,3] with x=2\n\n Then:\n   House1: min(h, 1) = 1\n   House2: min(h, 1, 2) = 1\n   House3: min(h, 2) = 2\n\n Then the entire street: [1,1,2]. Check restriction1: [1,2] has max=1 -> ok.\n Restriction2: [2,3] has max=2 -> ok.\n\n Profit = 1^2+1^2+2^2 = 1+1+4=6.\n\n But is that the maximum? What if we set house3 to 2 and house2 to 2? Then house2=2 and house3=2: then restriction2 is satisfied (max=2). But what about restriction1? [1,2] now has max(max(1,2))=2 which violates restriction1 (which requires <=1). So we cannot set house2 to 2.\n\n Alternatively, set house2 to 1 (as above) and house3 to 2: that's valid.\n\n Therefore, the method holds.\n\n However, note: the problem says the maximum height of a house is h. We are already taking min(h, ...). \n\n So the solution is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   restrictions = []\n   for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\n   # For each house i (from 1 to n), find all restrictions that cover i.\n   # We can precompute for each house i the list of x's from the restrictions that cover i.\n\n   # Alternatively, we can create an array `min_height` of length n+1 (indexed 1..n) and initialize with h.\n   # Then for each restriction (l, r, x):\n   #   For i from l to r: \n   #        min_height[i] = min(min_height[i], x)\n\n   # But wait: what if there are multiple restrictions? Then we take the minimum x over all restrictions that cover i.\n\n   # However, note: the condition is that the house must be <= the minimum x from the covering restrictions, and also <= h. But we initialized with h, so we are effectively doing: \n   #   min_height[i] = min(h, x1, x2, ...) for the covering restrictions.\n\n   # But if we do the above, we are only considering the restrictions one by one and updating the house to the minimum x encountered so far. However, if we update the house to a lower value, then when processing a later restriction with a higher x, the min won't change. But that's okay.\n\n   # However, we must consider that the same house might be covered by multiple restrictions. We can do:\n\n   # Initialize an array `arr` of size (n+1) with value h (for indices 1 to n).\n   # For each restriction (l, r, x):\n   #   for i from l to r:\n   #       arr[i] = min(arr[i], x)\n\n   # Then the profit is sum(arr[i]**2 for i from 1 to n)\n\n   # Let me test with the example above: \n   #   Example: [1,2] with x=1 and [2,3] with x=2, and h=10.\n   #   Initially: arr[1]=10, arr[2]=10, arr[3]=10.\n   #   Process [1,2] with x=1: \n   #        arr[1] = min(10,1)=1\n   #        arr[2] = min(10,1)=1\n   #   Process [2,3] with x=2:\n   #        arr[2] = min(1,2)=1\n   #        arr[3] = min(10,2)=2\n   #   Then profit = 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 6.\n\n   # But wait: what if we have two restrictions that are non-overlapping?\n   #   Example: [1,1] with x=1, [2,2] with x=2, [3,3] with x=3.\n   #   Then arr[1]=min(10,1)=1, arr[2]=min(10,2)=2, arr[3]=min(10,3)=3.\n   #   Profit = 1+4+9=14.\n\n   # However, is there a possibility that by setting a house to a lower value we can relax the constraints for adjacent houses? \n\n   # Let me clarify: the restrictions are independent. Each restriction requires that the entire segment has maximum <= x. The way we set the houses is: each house i must be <= the minimum x from the restrictions that cover it. \n\n   # Why is that sufficient? Because if a house i is set to a value <= the minimum x from the covering restrictions, then for any restriction j that covers i, the house i is <= x_j. But what about the entire segment? The entire segment might have a house that is set to a value higher than x_j? \n\n   # No, because if a restriction j covers a set S, then for every house i in S, we set house i to <= x_j (since j is one of the restrictions covering i). Therefore, the entire segment S has every house <= x_j, so the maximum is <= x_j.\n\n   # Therefore, the assignment is valid.\n\n   # But note: what if we set a house i to a value lower than the minimum x from the covering restrictions? Then we are still satisfying the condition, but we are getting less profit. The goal is to maximize the profit, so we set each house to the maximum allowed value (which is the minimum of h and the restrictions' x's).\n\n   # Therefore, the above algorithm sets each house to the maximum allowed value (by taking the minimum of the restrictions that cover it and h). \n\n   # However, note: the problem allows us to set a house to any integer between 0 and h. So we are allowed to set it to the maximum allowed value (which is the minimum of the restrictions and h) and that gives the highest profit.\n\n   # Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   # Initialize an array for the n houses (index 0 unused for index0, we use 1-indexed)\n   arr = [h] * (n+1)   # from index 0 to n; we will use indices 1 to n.\n\n   for _ in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            continue\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x_val = int(data[2])\n        for i in range(l, r+1):\n            if arr[i] > x_val:\n                arr[i] = x_val\n\n   profit = 0\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        profit += arr[i] * arr[i]\n\n   print(profit)\n\n But wait: is it possible that the same restriction is given multiple times? The problem does not say they are distinct. However, the above loop will update the house i with the minimum x_val from all the restrictions that cover it.\n\n However, consider: what if we have two restrictions that are the same? Then we are updating twice, but the min operation doesn't hurt.\n\n But note: the above method updates the house i to the minimum x_val from any restriction that covers i, regardless of the order. \n\n But wait: what if we have two restrictions: \n        Restriction1: [1,3] with x=1\n        Restriction2: [1,3] with x=2\n\n Then initially, arr[1..3] = [h, h, h]\n        Process Restriction1: set arr[1..3] to min(h,1) -> [min(h,1), min(h,1), min(h,1)]\n        Process Restriction2: set arr[1..3] to min(current_value,2) -> [min(min(h,1),2), ...] -> if h>=2 then min(min(h,1),2)=1; if h<2 then ... but h>=x_val? Actually, the problem says x_i between 0 and h, so x_val<=h. So min(h, x_val) is x_val (if x_val<=h) or h (if x_val>h) but since x_val<=h, then it becomes x_val.\n\n But note: the input says 0<=x_i<=h, so x_val is at most h.\n\n Therefore, the above code should work.\n\n However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n   n=3, h=3, m=3.\n   arr = [3,3,3,3] (index0 unused, then indices1-3 are 3,3,3)\n\n   First restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1 -> update index1: min(3,1)=1 -> arr=[3,1,3,3]\n   Second restriction: l=2, r=2, x=3 -> update index2: min(3,3)=3 -> arr=[3,1,3,3]\n   Third restriction: l=3, r=3, x=2 -> update index3: min(3,2)=2 -> arr=[3,1,3,2]\n\n   Then profit = 3^2 (for index1? wait: wait, we are indexing from 1 to 3. Our array was built for indices 1 to n (so 1-indexed). But in the above, we updated index1, index2, index3.\n\n   Actually, we have:\n        index1: 1\n        index2: 3\n        index3: 2\n\n   Then profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4=14.\n\n   But wait: in the example, the first house is index1, second is index2, third is index3. The first restriction is [1,1] (so house1) and we set house1 to 1. Then second restriction [2,2] (house2) set to 3, and third [3,3] set to 2.\n\n   However, note: the example input uses 1-indexed and our array is 1-indexed (we are using indices 1 to n). \n\n   But wait: in the example, the second house (index2) is set to 3, but the restriction for the second house is that the tallest house in [2,2] must be at most 3. That is correct.\n\n   However, what about the entire street? The first restriction says the tallest house in [1,1] must be <=1, which is satisfied. The second restriction says [2,2] must be <=3, which is satisfied. The third restriction says [3,3] must be <=2, which is satisfied.\n\n   But note: the example output is 14.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n        n=4, h=10, m=2.\n        arr = [10,10,10,10,10] (index0 to index4, we use 1..4)\n\n        First restriction: [2,3] with x=8 -> update indices2 and 3: \n            arr[2]=min(10,8)=8, arr[3]=min(10,8)=8.\n        Second restriction: [3,4] with x=7 -> update indices3 and4:\n            arr[3]=min(8,7)=7, arr[4]=min(10,7)=7.\n\n        Then profit = 10^2 (for house1) + 8^2 (house2) + 7^2 (house3) + 7^2 (house4) = 100+64+49+49=262.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Note: the input might have empty lines? The example input is given as a list of strings, but the problem says standard input.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   But actually, the problem says \"Each of the next m lines\", so we expect m lines.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: the sample input is provided as two separate strings. But in competitive programming, we read from stdin.\n\n   Since the problem says \"standard input\", we assume the input is given line by line.\n\n   However, the example input format is:\n\n        Input: \n          3 3 3\n          1 1 1\n          2 2 3\n          3 3 2\n\n        Output: 14\n\n   So we read from stdin.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * (n+1)   # 0-indexed, we'll use indices 1 to n\n\n   for i in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x_val = int(data[2])\n        # update houses from l to r: set each to min(current value, x_val)\n        for j in range(l, r+1):\n            if arr[j] > x_val:\n                arr[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for j in range(1, n+1):\n        total += arr[j] * arr[j]\n\n   print(total)\n\n However, wait: what if a house is covered by multiple restrictions, but the minimum x_val is the same? Then we update multiple times but the result is the same.\n\n But the above code will update the same house multiple times. Since we are taking the min, and if the same x_val appears multiple times, it's redundant. But the problem does not guarantee distinct restrictions.\n\n But note: the problem says \"The i-th restriction\", so they are distinct in description. However, we don't know if the same restriction (same l, r, x) is repeated. The problem doesn't say they are distinct. \n\n But even if repeated, the min operation is idempotent for the same x_val: if we have two restrictions with the same x_val, then updating twice with the same x_val is harmless.\n\n However, the problem says the restrictions are given as m lines. We must process all.\n\n But wait: what if a house is covered by two restrictions: one with x=1 and one with x=2? Then the house gets set to 1. Then if we process the same restriction again, it will set to min(1,1)=1 (if the same restriction) or min(1,2)=1 (if a different restriction with x=2). \n\n But if we have two different restrictions: [1,1] with x=1 and [1,1] with x=2, then the house1 gets set to 1 (from the first) and then to min(1,2)=1 (from the second). That's correct.\n\n But what if the restrictions are given in reverse order? \n\n   Example: \n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x=2\n        Restriction2: [1,1] with x=1\n\n   Then initial: arr[1]=h (say 10)\n        Process restriction1: arr[1] = min(10,2)=2\n        Process restriction2: arr[1] = min(2,1)=1\n\n   Correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is robust.\n\n However, note: the problem says the restrictions are given in the input. We are processing all of them.\n\n But wait: what if a house is not covered by any restriction? Then it remains h, which is correct.\n\n One more test: no restrictions.\n\n   Input: \"3 10 0\"\n\n   Then arr = [10,10,10] (for houses 1,2,3) -> profit = 10^2*3 = 300.\n\n   But the problem says the maximum height is h=10, so yes.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h.\" and the restrictions are the only constraints. Without restrictions, we set each house to h.\n\n But note: the example input has no restrictions, so we set to h.\n\n However, the problem does not require to set the house to h if there's no restriction? Actually, we want to maximize profit. The profit is a^2, so we set each house to h (if h is the maximum allowed) to get the maximum profit.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * (n+1)   # 0-indexed, we'll use indices 1 to n\n\n   for i in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x_val = int(data[2])\n        for j in range(l, r+1):\n            if arr[j] > x_val:\n                arr[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for j in range(1, n+1):\n        total += arr[j] * arr[j]\n\n   print(total)\n\n But wait: the problem says the maximum height per house is h, and we are setting houses to at most h (because we do min with h). So we are safe.\n\n However, note: the problem says the house can be built with an integer between 0 and h. We are building with integers, and the square is taken. \n\n But what if h is negative? The problem says h>=1, so no.\n\n Given the constraints (n,h,m>=1 and <=50) we are safe.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n Example1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\" -> Output 14.\n\n Example2: \n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\" -> Output 262.\n\n Therefore, we output the code.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the input is from stdin and we must read until EOF if multiple test cases? \n\n But the problem statement says: \n        The first line contains three integers n, h, m (...)\n        Each of the next m lines ...\n\n So one test case.\n\n But the example input is given as two separate strings, but in the competition we assume one test case.\n\n But the problem says: \n        The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n        Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\n And the example input is:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n Wait, actually the example input is provided as two separate test cases? Or one?\n\n The problem says: \n        Input: \n          3 3 3\n          1 1 1\n          2 2 3\n          3 3 2\n\n        Output: 14\n\n        And then:\n\n        Input:\n          4 10 2\n          2 3 8\n          3 4 7\n\n        Output: 262\n\n So they are two separate examples. But the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives two inputs.\n\n However, in the problem statement, it's two examples. In the actual competition, there is one test case.\n\n But wait, the example input format in the problem statement is:\n\n        Input:\n          ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n This is confusing. Actually, the problem says \"Print a single integer\", meaning one test case.\n\n Therefore, we assume one test case per run.\n\n But the example input is two separate test cases? Actually, the problem statement example shows two separate inputs and two outputs.\n\n However, the problem says \"Determine the maximum profit possible.\" for the given input.\n\n So we assume the input is one test case.\n\n But wait: the example input is provided as two strings. How do we know if there are multiple test cases?\n\n The problem statement does not specify multiple test cases. It says the first line gives n, h, m and then m lines.\n\n Therefore, we read one test case.\n\n However, the problem constraints say n, m, h up to 50, so we are safe.\n\n But note: the example input format in the problem statement is:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n This is two separate test cases? Or one? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n        # Zoning Restrictions Again\n\n        You are planning to build housing on a street. ... (then the input description)\n\n        Example\n        Input\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        Output\n        ['14', '262']\n\n So they are providing two test cases in the example. But the problem says \"Print a single integer\", so for each test case we print one integer.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as a list of two strings, and the expected output is a list of two strings.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the number of test cases. The input format is:\n\n        The first line contains three integers n, h, m\n        Then m lines...\n\n So we must read until we have processed the entire input.\n\n But the problem says the first line is n, h, m and then m lines. So the total number of lines is m+1.\n\n However, the example input is given as a string that includes the whole test case. \n\n But in competitive programming, the input is given as standard input. We assume the input is one test case.\n\n But the problem statement example input is two test cases. \n\n Clarification: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the example input is two separate test cases. \n\n Actually, the example input is:\n\n        Input: \n          3 3 3\n          1 1 1\n          2 2 3\n          3 3 2\n\n        Output: 14\n\n        and \n\n        Input: \n          4 10 2\n          2 3 8\n          3 4 7\n\n        Output: 262\n\n Therefore, we must design the program to handle one test case. But the example input is two test cases.\n\n Wait, the problem statement says:\n\n        Input: \n          ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        Output: \n          ['14', '262']\n\n This is ambiguous. But the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then the problem statement. In the problem statement, the input is described as one test case.\n\n However, the example input is two test cases. \n\n But note: the example input is provided as a list of two strings. In competitive programming, the input is usually provided one test case at a time. \n\n Since the constraints are small, we assume one test case per run.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"Your task is to solve the problem above\", meaning we are to solve the problem for one test case.\n\n Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n However, the example input format in the problem statement is two test cases. \n\n To be safe, let me read the problem statement again: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the problem and then two examples.\n\n So the problem expects one test case.\n\n But the example input is two test cases. \n\n I think the problem statement is showing two separate examples. \n\n Therefore, we write the code for one test case.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"Print a single integer\", meaning one test case.\n\n However, the example input is two test cases. \n\n This is confusing. \n\n After re‐reading: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n But note: the problem says \"Input\" and then the example input is provided as two strings. \n\n Actually, the problem statement is written in a way that the example input is two separate test cases. \n\n But the problem does not specify multiple test cases. \n\n How to resolve?\n\n Since the constraints say n, m, h <= 50, and the input format is one test case, we assume one test case.\n\n But the example input is two test cases. \n\n I think the problem intended to provide two examples. \n\n In the competition, there will be one test case.\n\n Therefore, we write the code for one test case.\n\n However, if the competition provides multiple test cases, we must adjust.\n\n But the problem says: \n        The first line contains three integers n, h, m\n\n So we read the first line to get n, h, m, then m lines.\n\n This is one test case.\n\n Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n But wait: the example input is provided as two separate strings. How did they get two test cases? \n\n They might be running two separate instances of the program. \n\n However, the problem says: \"Print a single integer\", so we print one integer per test case.\n\n Since the example input is two test cases, they would run the program twice.\n\n But the problem statement example input is given as a list of two strings. \n\n I think the problem statement is just showing two examples.\n\n Therefore, we submit the code as:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * (n+1)\n\n   for i in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x_val = int(data[2])\n        for j in range(l, r",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The constraints are that each house's height must not exceed a given maximum height `h`, and for each zoning restriction, the tallest house in the specified range must not exceed a certain height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning heights to houses such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction specifies that the maximum height in a particular range of spots must be at most a given value. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the squares of the house heights.\n2. **Intuition**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the minimum value between the global maximum height `h` and the most restrictive (smallest) value from all zoning restrictions that include that house. This ensures compliance with all restrictions while allowing each house to be as tall as possible to maximize its contribution to the profit.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We initialize an array with the global maximum height `h` for each house. For each zoning restriction, we update the corresponding houses in the range to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's maximum height. This step ensures that all restrictions are satisfied. Finally, we compute the total profit by summing the squares of the final heights of all houses.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each zoning restriction once, updating each house in its range. With `n` houses and `m` restrictions, the worst-case time complexity is O(m * n), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\narr = [h] * (n + 1)\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n    for j in range(l, r + 1):\n        if arr[j] > x_val:\n            arr[j] = x_val\n\ntotal = 0\nfor j in range(1, n + 1):\n    total += arr[j] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the number of spots `n`, the global maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`. An array `arr` is initialized with `h` for each house (spots 1 to `n`).\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, we read the range `[l, r]` and the maximum allowed height `x_val`. For each house in this range, we update its height to the minimum of its current value and `x_val`, ensuring compliance with the restriction.\n3. **Profit Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, we compute the total profit by summing the squares of the final heights of all houses.\n4. **Output**: The total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures all constraints are met while maximizing the profit by leveraging the convex nature of the profit function (squares grow with height), thus prioritizing the highest allowable heights for each house.",
