    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers: A, B, C, D (with 1 <= A <= B <= C <= D <= 500000)\n\n We are to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B\n   B <= y <= C\n   C <= z <= D\n\n And the triangle is non-degenerate, meaning that for sides x, y, z (which are the sides opposite to the vertices) we must have:\n   x + y > z\n   x + z > y\n   y + z > x\n\n But note: since x <= y <= z (because x in [A, B] and y in [B, C] and z in [C, D] and since A<=B<=C<=D, we have x<=y<=z),\n then the only non-trivial condition is x+y>z. The other two conditions (x+z>y and y+z>x) are automatically satisfied because:\n   x+z >= x+y (since z>=y) and since x+y>z (the given condition) we have x+z>y (because x+z >= x+y > z >= y -> actually wait: note that z>=y so x+z >= x+y, but we need x+z>y. Since x,y,z are positive, x+z>y is always true if x+y>z? Not exactly: consider x=1, y=2, z=3: then x+y=3 which is not greater than z=3, so it fails. But note: in our ordering x<=y<=z, the condition x+y>z is the strictest.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the sides to be ordered in the triangle? But the problem states: \"non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, and z\" and the constraints are A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So the sides are fixed in order: x <= y <= z.\n\n Therefore, the only condition we need to check is x+y>z.\n\n But note: the problem says the triangle must be non-degenerate, and the standard condition is that the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third. However, when x<=y<=z, the condition x+y>z implies the other two: \n   x+z >= x+y > z >= y  => x+z>y (since x+y>z and z>=y, then x+z >= x+y > z >= y, so x+z>y)\n   Similarly, y+z >= y+x > z >= x? Actually, y+z is clearly greater than x because y>=x and z>=x, so y+z>=x+x>=x (but we need strictly greater). Actually, since x<=y<=z, then y+z >= y+y >= y+x (if x<=y) but wait, we don't know the relation between x and y? Actually, we know x<=y, so y+z >= y+y >= x+y, and since x+y>z, we have y+z>=x+y>z, and we are comparing to x: obviously y+z > x because even the smallest side is x and the other two are at least y and z, so y+z >= y+y >= y+x >= x+x >= x (and since x>=1, and y+z>=x+x>=x+1>x, so actually y+z>x is always true). \n\n Therefore, the only condition we need is x+y>z.\n\n Now, we can break the problem into:\n\n Count = 0\n For each x in [A, B]:\n   For each y in [B, C]:\n     Then we need to count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y.\n\n However, the ranges can be up to 500000, so iterating over x and y (which would be about (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) might be too slow (worst-case about 500000*500000 which is 25e10).\n\n We need a more efficient way.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We are counting the triples (x, y, z) with:\n   A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D, and x+y>z.\n\n We can fix z first? Or use two pointers?\n\n Alternatively, we can use inclusion-exclusion:\n\n Total number without the condition x+y>z: (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\n Then subtract the cases where x+y<=z.\n\n But note: we are required to count the non-degenerate ones, so we can also count the degenerate and non-degenerate separately.\n\n However, note: the condition for non-degenerate is x+y>z. So we want to count the triples (x,y,z) in the box [A,B]x[B,C]x[C,D] such that x+y>z.\n\n We can also think: for fixed x and y, we require z < x+y, and also z must be at least C and at most D.\n\n But note: we can also fix x+y.\n\n Let S = x+y, then we need z in [C, min(D, S-1)] (since z must be less than S). But note: S = x+y, and x from [A,B], y from [B,C].\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate by s = x+y, but how?\n\n Another idea: iterate over z (from C to D) and count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, and x in [A,B], y in [B,C].\n\n Then, for a fixed z, the condition is: x+y > z.\n\n Then the total count is sum_{z=C}^{D} [number of pairs (x,y) with x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and x+y>z].\n\n Now, how to compute the number of pairs (x,y) for fixed z quickly?\n\n Note: x+y>z  <=> y > z - x.\n\n For fixed x, y must be in the range [max(B, floor(z-x)+1), C] (since y must be at least B and at most C, and greater than z-x).\n\n But note: we must have y>=B and y<=min(C, z-x) is not what we want. Actually, we want y >= max(B, z-x+1) and y<=C.\n\n Then for a fixed x, the number of y is: \n   low_y = max(B, z-x+1)\n   high_y = C\n   Then the count for this x is: max(0, high_y - low_y + 1) if low_y <= high_y, else 0.\n\n Then we can iterate x from A to B and for each z, but then we iterate over z from C to D and for each x from A to B? That would be O((B-A+1)*(D-C+1)) which is about 500000*500000 worst-case, which is 25e10, too slow.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the number of pairs (x,y) for all possible sums, but note: the condition is x+y>z, and z goes from C to D.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute an array F[s] = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y = s, for s from A+B to B+C.\n\n Then the condition for a fixed z is: we need s > z, i.e., s from z+1 to B+C.\n\n Then the count for fixed z is: sum_{s=z+1}^{B+C} F[s]\n\n Then the total count is: sum_{z=C}^{D} [sum_{s=z+1}^{B+C} F[s]]\n\n But note: we cannot iterate z from C to D and then for each z iterate s from z+1 to B+C because that is O((D-C+1)*(B+C)) which is too slow.\n\n Instead, we can precompute a prefix sum for F.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute an array F for s from min_sum = A+B to max_sum = B+C (inclusive).\n    For s in [A+B, B+C]:\n        F[s] = number of x in [A, B] and y in [B, C] such that x+y = s.\n\n    How to compute F[s]?\n        For a fixed s, x can vary from max(A, s-C) to min(B, s-B) [because y=s-x must be in [B, C]]\n        So F[s] = max(0, min(B, s-B) - max(A, s-C) + 1)   [if the lower bound <= upper bound, else 0]\n\n 2. Then, let G[t] = sum_{s=t}^{B+C} F[s] for t from A+B to B+C, and 0 for t > B+C.\n    Then we can do a suffix sum for F: \n        Let H[t] = F[t] + F[t+1] + ... + F[B+C]\n\n    Then for a fixed z (from C to D), we need the sum of F[s] for s from z+1 to B+C, which is H[z+1] (if z+1 <= B+C, else 0).\n\n 3. Then the answer is: \n        ans = 0\n        for z from C to D:\n            if z+1 <= B+C:\n                ans += H[z+1]\n            else:\n                # then there's no s in [z+1, B+C] (because z+1 > B+C), so add 0.\n                pass\n\n However, note: the condition for the triangle is that z must be at least C and at most D, and we are iterating z from C to D.\n\n But wait: what if z is very large such that z+1 > B+C? Then there are no pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, so we add 0.\n\n However, note: we must ensure that the pair (x,y) exists in the given ranges, and the maximum sum is B+C, so for z >= B+C, then indeed no pair (x,y) satisfies x+y>z.\n\n But note: our z goes from C to D, and D can be as large as 500000, and B+C can be as large as 1000000 (if B and C are 500000). So we need to set our F array from A+B to B+C (which is from at least 1+1=2 to at most 1000000).\n\n But note: the condition for z: we are only considering z from C to D, and D can be up to 500000, so z+1 from C+1 to D+1 (at most 500001). But our F array is defined for s from A+B to B+C (which is at least 2 and at most 1000000). So we must define H for indices from A+B to B+C, and for indices below A+B or above B+C, we set H[index] = 0 for index > B+C.\n\n However, note: we are going to use H[z+1] for z from C to D. Since z>=C, then z+1>=C+1, and C>=B>=A, so C+1 is at least 3. But our F is defined from A+B (which might be as small as 2) to B+C (which is at least B+B, since B<=C). So we need to cover from min_index = A+B to max_index = B+C.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Determine the range for s: [s_min, s_max] = [A+B, B+C]\n\n   Step 2: Create an array F of zeros for indices from s_min to s_max (we can use dictionary or list, but note: the range is [A+B, B+C] which is at most 1000000, so we can use a list of length (B+C - A+B + 1) if we index appropriately, but we can also use an array of zeros for indices from 0 to maybe 2*B+C (to avoid negative indexing) but we know the range.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        F = [0]*(B+C+2)   # index from 0 to B+C+1, but we care from A+B to B+C.\n\n   But note: we are going to compute for s from A+B to B+C.\n\n   Step 3: For s from A+B to B+C:\n        low_x = max(A, s-C)\n        high_x = min(B, s-B)\n        if low_x <= high_x:\n            F[s] = high_x - low_x + 1\n        else:\n            F[s] = 0\n\n   Step 4: Then build H for indices from A+B to B+C (and beyond we don't need, but we need to cover from z+1 from C+1 to D+1). We can build an array H for indices from 0 to B+C (or up to D+1, but we know D<=500000, and B+C<=1000000) but we only need from A+B to B+C.\n\n   Actually, we only need H for indices from C+1 to D+1 (because z from C to D, so z+1 from C+1 to D+1). But note: if C+1 is less than A+B, then we use 0 for those indices? Actually, no: the condition for z is that z>=C, and we are counting pairs (x,y) with x+y>z. But note: the minimum sum is A+B, so if z+1 < A+B, then we should count all pairs (x,y) because even the smallest sum (A+B) is greater than z (if z < A+B-1). But wait, we defined F for s from A+B to B+C. So for s < A+B, F[s]=0, and for s > B+C, F[s]=0.\n\n   However, we built F only for [A+B, B+C]. So we can extend F to lower indices by setting F[s] = 0 for s < A+B and s > B+C.\n\n   Then, we can build H as the suffix sum from s=A+B to s=B+C, and then for indices below A+B, we set H[s] = 0 for s < A+B? Actually, we don't need to go below A+B because we are only interested in z+1 from C+1 to D+1, and C>=B>=A, so C+1>=B+1>=A+1, but note: A+B could be less than C+1? \n\n   Example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4 -> then A+B=3, and C+1=4. So we are looking at H[4] (which is the sum for s>=4). But note: our F is defined for s from 3 to 5 (since B+C=2+3=5). \n\n   Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        Let s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C.\n\n        We want H[i] = sum_{s=i}^{s_max} F[s] for i from s_min to s_max, and for i>s_max, H[i]=0.\n\n        But we are going to query for z+1 from C+1 to D+1.\n\n        We can set an array H of size (s_max+2) (index from 0 to s_max+1) and then:\n\n            for i from s_max down to s_min:\n                H[i] = F[i] + H[i+1]\n\n            for i from 0 to s_min-1: \n                H[i] = 0\n\n        Then for a given z, we use H[z+1] (if z+1 <= s_max, then we have the value, but note: our H is defined for indices from 0 to s_max, and we set H[i] for i from 0 to s_min-1 to 0, and from s_min to s_max we computed the suffix sum.\n\n        However, note: we only built F for s_min to s_max, so we can do:\n\n            H = [0]*(s_max+2)   # index 0 to s_max+1\n            # First, set F for s from s_min to s_max (as above)\n            # Then, for i from s_max down to s_min:\n            #   H[i] = F[i] + H[i+1]\n\n            But note: we also need to set H[i] for i>s_max to 0, and we have allocated up to s_max+1, so H[s_max+1]=0.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            H = [0]*(s_max+2)   # indices 0..s_max+1\n            for s in range(s_max, s_min-1, -1):\n                H[s] = H[s+1] + F[s]\n\n            Then for any index i, if i>s_max, then we use H[i]=0 (but our H is defined only up to s_max+1, so for i from 0 to s_max+1, we have H[i] for i<=s_max, and for i>s_max we don't have? Actually, we built H for indices 0 to s_max, and we set H[s_max+1]=0 (by initialization). Then for i>s_max, we can use H[i]=0.\n\n        But note: our queries are for z+1 from C+1 to D+1, and D+1 <= 500001, and s_max = B+C <= 1000000, so if D+1 > s_max, then we use H[D+1] which we set to 0 (because we built H for indices up to s_max+1, and beyond that we didn't, but we can simply say that for i>s_max, H[i]=0.\n\n        However, we built H for indices from 0 to s_max+1, so we have H[i] for i from 0 to s_max+1.\n\n        But note: we only computed F for s from s_min to s_max, and we set H for indices from s_min to s_max by the backward recurrence, and for indices below s_min we set to 0 (because initially H was zeros). \n\n        Actually, we didn't set indices below s_min to zero in the backward loop, but we initialized H as zeros. Then the backward loop starts from s_max and goes down to s_min, so indices below s_min remain 0.\n\n   Step 5: Then, for each z from C to D (both inclusive), add H[z+1] (which is the sum of F[s] for s from z+1 to s_max).\n\n   However, note: we must ensure that the pairs (x,y) are only those with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]. Our F[s] counts exactly that.\n\n   But wait: what if the same triple (x,y,z) is counted multiple times? No, because we fixed z and then counted the pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y>z.\n\n   But note: the original problem does not require ordering of the sides beyond the given constraints (x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D]). We are not changing the sides arbitrarily. The triangle sides are fixed: x, y, z. And the condition for being a triangle is x+y>z (given x<=y<=z, the other two conditions hold). So we are good.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that the sides are ordered as x<=y<=z? Actually, the input constraints say: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D, so the sides are given in non-decreasing order. So we are counting the triangles with sides (x,y,z) that satisfy the condition and the ordering.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, and z such that A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D\". So the sides are fixed: x is the smallest, then y, then z. Therefore, we don't have to worry about permutations.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n        s_min = A+B\n        s_max = B+C\n\n        F = [0]*(s_max+2)   # We'll index from 0 to s_max+1, but we are going to use indices from s_min to s_max.\n\n        # If s_min > s_max, then there are no pairs, but note A<=B<=C, so s_min = A+B <= B+B <= B+C = s_max, because B<=C -> B+B <= B+C.\n\n        # Build F for s from s_min to s_max:\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n            # For a given s, we need x in [A, B] and y = s-x in [B, C]\n            # So y = s-x must be between B and C -> x must be between s-C and s-B.\n            low_x = max(A, s-C)\n            high_x = min(B, s-B)\n            if low_x <= high_x:\n                F[s] = high_x - low_x + 1\n            else:\n                F[s] = 0\n\n        # Then build H: suffix sum array for F, from 0 to s_max+1 (we set indices above s_max to 0, and we have F[s]=0 for s>s_max)\n        # We can build an array H of length s_max+2 (so indices 0 to s_max+1) and set H[i] for i from 0 to s_max+1.\n        # We want H[i] = sum_{s=i}^{s_max} F[s]\n\n        # But note: we only need H for indices from C+1 to D+1, and these indices might be larger than s_max, then we set H[i]=0 for i>s_max.\n\n        # We can do:\n        H = [0]*(s_max+2)   # from 0 to s_max+1, and we set H[s_max+1] = 0.\n        # We'll compute from s_max down to 0.\n        # But we don't need to compute for indices below s_min? Actually, we set F for indices from s_min to s_max, and for indices outside we set F[s]=0 (if we had allocated zeros for the entire array). But we built F only for s_min to s_max, and for others we have zeros (because we did F = [0]*(s_max+2)), so that's okay.\n\n        # Actually, we built F for the entire range from 0 to s_max+1? No, we only set the values for s from s_min to s_max.

In the input, z must be in [C, D] = [2,5]. Yes, and x in [1,2], y in [2,2] (so y must be 2). Then the pairs (x,y) are (1,2) and (2,2). Then for z=3, we require x+y>3. \n          (1,2): 1+2=3 -> not >3 -> not allowed.\n          (2,2): 2+2=4>3 -> allowed.\n\n        So for z=3, we have one pair (x,y) = (2,2). Then why did we get 1 for z=3? \n\n        In our F, we built for s=3 and s=4. Then for z=3, we use H[4] (which is the sum for s>=4) -> which is 1 (from s=4). \n\n        But wait, the condition is x+y>3, so s>=4. So we should count s=4.\n\n        However, note: our method counts the pairs (x,y) by their sum s. Then for z=3, we count the pairs with s>=4. There is one such pair: (2,2) with s=4.\n\n        Then for z=2: we count s>=3. That includes s=3 and s=4. \n          s=3: (1,2) -> but note: (1,2) is valid for z=2? Condition: 1+2>2 -> 3>2 -> yes. So (1,2) is allowed for z=2. And s=4: (2,2) is also allowed for z=2: 2+2>2 -> yes.\n\n        So for z=2, we have two pairs: (1,2) and (2,2). Then we add 2.\n\n        Then for z=3: one pair (2,2) -> 1.\n\n        Then for z=4: no pair (since the maximum s is 4, and we need s>4 -> none) -> 0.\n\n        Then for z=5: 0.\n\n        So total 2+1=3.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   However, note: the above example \"1 2 2 5\" has y in [B, C] = [2,2] (only y=2). Then the pairs (x,y) are (1,2) and (2,2). \n\n   But wait, the problem says: B<=y<=C. Here B=2 and C=2, so y must be 2.\n\n   So the method is correct.\n\n   But note: the range for s is from A+B to B+C. We built F for that range. Then we built H as the suffix sum from s_min to s_max.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the triangle requires x+y>z. We are counting by the sum s=x+y. \n\n   But what if the same (x,y) appears in different s? We are counting each (x,y) exactly once (for its s).\n\n   Time complexity: \n        Building F: we iterate from s_min to s_max, which is (s_max - s_min + 1) ~ (B+C - A-B + 1) = (C-A+1) which is at most 500000, so acceptable.\n\n        Building H: we iterate from s_max down to 0, which is about s_max+1 ~ 1000000, acceptable.\n\n        Then iterating z from C to D: (D-C+1) which is at most 500000, acceptable.\n\n   But note: the constraints say A,B,C,D can be up to 500000, so s_min = A+B can be as low as 2 (if A=1, B=1) but wait, the input condition is A<=B<=C<=D, and A>=1, so the smallest A+B is 2 (if A=1, B=1). Then s_max = B+C, and B and C up to 500000, so s_max up to 1000000.\n\n   However, note: the example \"500000 500000 500000 500000\": \n        A=B=C=D=500000\n\n        Then s_min = 500000+500000 = 1000000\n        s_max = 500000+500000 = 1000000\n\n        Then F[1000000] = number of x in [500000,500000] and y in [500000,500000] such that x+y=1000000 -> only (500000,500000) -> 1.\n\n        Then H[1000001] = 0, H[1000000] = 1.\n\n        Then we iterate z from 500000 to 500000: only z=500000, then we add H[500001] (which is the sum for s>=500001) but wait, our s_min=1000000, so for s<1000000, F[s]=0. Then we built H for indices from 0 to 1000001, and for indices below 1000000, H[i]=0 (because we set F[i]=0 for i<1000000). Then H[500001] = 0.\n\n        But wait, we should be adding H[z+1] for z=500000: z+1=500001. Then we add 0.\n\n        However, we missed the case for z=500000: the condition is x+y>500000. The only pair (x,y) is (500000,500000) -> 500000+500000=1000000>500000 -> true. So we should count it.\n\n        What went wrong? \n\n        Our method: we built F for s from 1000000 to 1000000, and then built H for s from 0 to 1000001.\n\n        Then for z=500000, we need the sum for s>=500001. But our F only has a non-zero at s=1000000, so we are including s=1000000 (because 1000000>=500001) and that is 1.\n\n        But wait: our H is defined as H[i] = sum_{s=i}^{s_max} F[s]. So for i=500001, we are summing from s=500001 to 1000000. The value at s=1000000 is included. But note: we built H backwards, so:\n\n            H[1000000] = F[10000",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The key insight is recognizing that for a triangle to be non-degenerate with sides \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third side. Given the constraints \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the only condition we need to check is \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), and \\(x + y > z\\). The challenge is to efficiently compute this count without resorting to a brute-force approach, which would be computationally expensive for large input ranges.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of iterating over all possible combinations of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), we can leverage mathematical insights to optimize the solution. Specifically, for each possible \\(z\\) (from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\)), we determine the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). This transforms the problem into counting valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for each \\(z\\).\n\n3. **Efficient Counting**: \n   - **Sum Calculation**: For each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\), we precompute the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) that produce that sum. This involves checking all possible \\(x\\) values in \\([A, B]\\) and corresponding \\(y\\) values in \\([B, C]\\).\n   - **Suffix Sum Array**: Using a suffix sum array, we efficiently compute the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for each \\(z\\) by summing the counts of all sums \\(s > z\\). This allows us to answer each query in constant time after preprocessing.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The preprocessing steps involve iterating over possible sums \\(s\\) (from \\(A+B\\) to \\(B+C\\)) and building a suffix sum array, both of which are linear in the range of sums. The main loop then iterates over \\(z\\) values from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), performing constant-time lookups. Thus, the overall complexity is \\(O(B + C + D)\\), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    s_min = A + B\n    s_max = B + C\n    \n    F = [0] * (s_max + 2)\n    \n    for s_val in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n        low_x = max(A, s_val - C)\n        high_x = min(B, s_val - B)\n        if low_x <= high_x:\n            F[s_val] = high_x - low_x + 1\n    \n    H = [0] * (s_max + 3)\n    for i in range(s_max, -1, -1):\n        H[i] = F[i] + H[i + 1]\n    \n    ans = 0\n    for z_val in range(C, D + 1):\n        if z_val + 1 <= s_max:\n            ans += H[z_val + 1]\n        else:\n            if z_val + 1 <= s_max + 1:\n                ans += H[z_val + 1]\n    \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\), which define the ranges for the sides of the triangle.\n2. **Sum Range Calculation**: The minimum and maximum possible sums \\(s\\) of sides \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are calculated as \\(s_{min} = A + B\\) and \\(s_{max} = B + C\\).\n3. **Frequency Array (F)**: An array `F` is built where each entry `F[s]` holds the count of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) that sum to \\(s\\). This is done by iterating over each possible sum \\(s\\) and determining the valid range of \\(x\\) values that, when combined with \\(y = s - x\\), fall within the specified ranges.\n4. **Suffix Sum Array (H)**: The array `H` is constructed to store suffix sums of `F`, allowing quick lookup of the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for any given \\(z\\) by summing all pairs where \\(x + y > z\\).\n5. **Counting Valid Triangles**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), the solution uses the suffix sum array to count the valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy \\(x + y > z\\), accumulating the total count of valid triangles.\n6. **Output**: The total count of valid triangles is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem using mathematical insights and preprocessing, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
