Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two points: home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) that define the roads.\n\n The key observation: \n Moving from one block to another is allowed if they share a common border of nonzero length. This is essentially crossing a road.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that crossing a single road (i.e., going from one side to the other) counts as one step. But note: if we cross multiple roads at an intersection, we cannot cross all in one step? Actually, the problem says that the common border must be nonzero. Two blocks that meet at an intersection but don't share a segment (like two adjacent blocks meeting only at a point) are not connected by a step.\n\n Actually, note: the roads divide the plane into regions (blocks). Each road is an infinite line. The movement from one block to another requires crossing one or more roads. However, the step condition is that the common border must be nonzero. This implies that we can cross one road at a time, because crossing one road gives a common border (the segment of the road between two intersections) of nonzero length.\n\n But note: the problem says that we can move from one block to another in one step if the common border is nonzero. So, if two blocks share a segment (which is part of one road) then we can cross that road and the step is one.\n\n However, what if we need to cross two roads? Then we would need two steps? Actually, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the two points? But wait: \n\n Consider: We start in a block. To get to the university, we must cross every road that separates the two points? Actually, no: because the roads are linear and the two points might lie on opposite sides of several roads.\n\n Important: Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university are located in some blocks (so not on any road). The minimal steps required is actually the number of roads for which the two points lie on opposite sides.\n\n Why? Because to go from one block to the next, we must cross one road. And if two points are separated by k roads (i.e., there are k roads such that the two points lie on opposite sides), then we must cross all k roads. However, note that we can cross the roads in any order, and each crossing is one step. But wait: can we cross multiple roads at once? The problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another\" (so we move from one block to an adjacent block). Therefore, we must cross exactly one road per step.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we cross the roads in a particular order. The minimal steps is the minimal number of crossings (road boundaries) needed to get from the home block to the university block. However, observe:\n\n Each road that separates the two points must be crossed at least once. Moreover, we cannot avoid crossing a road that separates them. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, wait: is that always true? Consider two roads that are parallel. Then the two points might be separated by two parallel roads, but we have to cross both. But note: the two points are in different half-planes for both roads, so we must cross both. Similarly, if two roads are not parallel, then the two points might be separated by two non-parallel roads, and again we must cross both.\n\n But note: when we cross a road, we change the side for that road. The entire journey must change the side for every road that separates the two points.\n\n However, consider: if a road does not separate the two points (i.e., both points are on the same side), then we don't need to cross it. So the minimal steps is the number of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n How to check for a road (a, b, c): \n   For a point (x, y), the sign of (a*x + b*y + c) determines the side.\n\n But note: the equation is a*x + b*y + c = 0. We can define the side by the value (a*x + b*y + c). However, the sign depends on how we define the line. But note: the problem does not specify an orientation. However, for two points, we can compare the signs.\n\n Specifically, for a given road i:\n   Let s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   Let s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n If s1 and s2 have opposite signs (i.e., s1 * s2 < 0), then the two points lie on opposite sides of the road.\n\n Then, the answer is the count of roads for which this condition holds.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0   -> y = 0\n        1 0 0   -> x = 0\n\n   Home (1,1): \n        For y=0: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive.\n        For x=0: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive.\n\n   University (-1,-1):\n        For y=0: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative.\n        For x=0: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative.\n\n   Now, for the road y=0: home is positive, university negative -> opposite -> count 1.\n        for the road x=0: home positive, university negative -> opposite -> count 2.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0   -> x = 0\n        0 1 0   -> y = 0\n        1 1 -3  -> x+y-3=0\n\n   We already know that the first two roads give 2 separations.\n\n   Third road: x+y-3=0\n        For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative.\n        For university (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative.\n\n   Same side, so not counted.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n However, let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'] -> output 2, matches.\n Example 2: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'] -> output 2, matches.\n\n But wait, what if the expression is zero? The problem says neither home nor university lies on the road, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\n However, note: the sign could be negative or positive. We are only concerned with opposite signs.\n\n One more edge: what if the expression is negative for the home and positive for the university? Then product is negative -> opposite.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read home (x1, y1)\n   Read university (x2, y2)\n   Read n\n   For i in range(n):\n        read a, b, c\n\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   Print count.\n\n But wait: is that correct? \n\n Let me think: the product being negative means one is positive and the other negative. That is opposite.\n\n However, note: the expression a*x+b*y+c might be very large. But since the inputs are integers, we are safe.\n\n But wait: what if the expression is zero? But the problem says the points are not on the road, so s1 and s2 are nonzero. However, we must be cautious: the product might be negative even if one of them is zero? No, because if s1 is zero then the point is on the road, which is not allowed. So we are safe.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we don't have zeros.\n\n However, there is a caveat: the sign of the expression might depend on the representation of the line. But note: the equation is defined up to a scalar multiple. However, the sign of the expression (a*x+b*y+c) for a fixed line and two points is consistent for determining which side the point is on. The product will be negative if and only if they are on opposite sides.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for _ in range(n):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b, c = data[0], data[1], data[2]\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Since the points are not on the road, s1 and s2 are nonzero.\n        if (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0) or (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Alternatively, we can use the product: if s1 * s2 < 0 then opposite.\n\n However, using multiplication might lead to very large numbers (since coordinates and coefficients can be up to 1e6, so the product can be up to 1e12, which is acceptable in Python for integers, but we can also do the sign check without multiplication).\n\n But note: if one of s1 or s2 is negative and the other positive, then the product is negative. But if we use the product, we must be cautious: if one of them is negative and the other positive, then the product is negative. However, the problem says they are nonzero, so we can use either.\n\n However, there is a potential issue: overflow? The values can be as large as 1e6 * 1e6 * 3 (for a, b, c) but wait: the expression is a*x + b*y + c. The maximum absolute value for a*x is |a|*|x| <= 1e6 * 1e6 = 1e12. Similarly for b*y. Then adding c (at most 1e6) so the total absolute value is about 2e12, which is acceptable for Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the arithmetic operations on integers of this size are efficient enough for n up to 300).\n\n However, the problem does not require to avoid multiplication, so we can do:\n\n   if s1 * s2 < 0:\n\n But note: the product might be negative even if the signs are different. However, if both are positive or both negative, the product is positive.\n\n Let me write the condition clearly:\n\n   Condition: s1 and s2 have opposite signs.\n\n   This is equivalent to: s1 * s2 < 0.\n\n But wait: what if one of them is negative and the other positive? Then product negative.\n\n However, we must note: the signs of the expressions. The expression a*x+b*y+c is defined by the line. The half-plane definitions are consistent.\n\n But there's a catch: the line equation is defined by (a, b, c). The sign of the expression does not necessarily correspond to a geometric side in a fixed way? Actually, the sign of (a*x+b*y+c) defines one side, and the opposite sign defines the other. So yes, opposite signs mean opposite sides.\n\n However, let me test with a simple line: x+y=0 (so a=1, b=1, c=0). Then for (0,0) it's 0 (but not allowed). For (1,0): 1>0. For (-1,0): -1<0. So (1,0) and (-1,0) are on opposite sides.\n\n So the condition is correct.\n\n But wait: what if the line equation is multiplied by a negative constant? For example, the line x+y=0 can be written as -x-y=0. Then the expression becomes -x-y. Then for (1,0): -1 <0, and for (-1,0): 1>0. Now, (1,0) and (-1,0) are still on opposite sides because the product is (negative)*(positive) = negative.\n\n So the condition still holds.\n\n Therefore, we can safely use the product condition.\n\n However, the problem says the line is defined by aix+biy+ci=0, and ai and bi are not both zero. The sign of the expression is arbitrary, but the product condition for two points is independent of the scaling factor (if we multiply the entire equation by a positive constant, the signs remain the same; if by a negative constant, the signs flip for both points, so the product remains negative if they were opposite). Thus, the product condition is invariant to the scaling factor (as long as we consider the entire equation as given).\n\n But wait: if we multiply the equation by a negative constant, then the expression flips sign. Then for two points originally having opposite signs (s1 and s2), after flipping both signs, they are still opposite (because s1 becomes -s1 and s2 becomes -s2, so (-s1)*(-s2)=s1*s2, and if s1*s2 was negative, then (-s1)*(-s2) is positive? Wait, that breaks our condition.\n\n Actually, no: if we multiply the equation by a negative constant, then the two expressions for the two points become negative of what they were. Then the product becomes (new_s1) * (new_s2) = (-s1)*(-s2) = s1*s2. So the sign of the product does not change.\n\n Therefore, the condition s1*s2 < 0 is valid regardless of the scaling factor.\n\n So the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        expr1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        expr2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if expr1 * expr2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n   print(count)\n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Home: (1,1); University: (-1,-1); roads: [0,1,0] and [1,0,0]\n\n   Road [0,1,0]: expr1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1, expr2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> 1*(-1) = -1 -> count +=1\n   Road [1,0,0]: expr1 = 1*1+0*1+0=1, expr2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1 -> 1*(-1)=-1 -> count +=1 -> total 2.\n\n Example 2: \n   Add road [1,1,-3]: expr1 = 1*1+1*1-3 = -1, expr2=1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3=-5 -> (-1)*(-5)=5 -> not negative -> not counted.\n\n So it works.\n\n But wait: what if the product is zero? But the problem says the points are not on the road, so we don't have zeros. So we are safe.\n\n However, there's an alternative: we can avoid the product by checking the signs. This might be better if we are concerned about the magnitude of the product (though 1e12 is acceptable). But the problem says n<=300, so even 300 multiplications of numbers up to 1e12 is acceptable.\n\n I'll submit the above code.\n\n But wait: the problem statement example input is given as a list of strings. The example input is:\n\n   Example 1: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'] -> so we have to read from stdin.\n\n We are reading from stdin. The example input is provided as a string, but in reality, we read from standard input.\n\n Let me write the complete code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the example input format is:\n\n   First line: \"1 1\"\n   Second line: \"-1 -1\"\n   Third line: \"2\"\n   Then two lines: \"0 1 0\" and \"1 0 0\"\n\n So the code should work.\n\n Let me run through the example 2:\n\n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = 1, 1\n   x2, y2 = -1, -1\n   n = 3\n\n   Road1: [1,0,0] -> expr1 = 1*1+0*1+0 = 1, expr2 = 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=1.\n   Road2: [0,1,0] -> expr1=0*1+1*1+0=1, expr2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=2.\n   Road3: [1,1,-3] -> expr1=1*1+1*1-3= -1, expr2=1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3=-5 -> product=5 -> skip.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n It matches.\n\n Another test case: no roads (n=0) -> then no separation, so steps=0.\n\n But the problem says n>=1, so we don't need to worry.\n\n However, the problem says n>=1, but let me consider n=0: \n   Then no roads, so the entire plane is one block. So we don't need to cross any road -> 0 steps.\n\n But the input says n>=1, so we don't need to handle n=0.\n\n But wait, the constraints say n>=1. So we are safe.\n\n Let me try with two roads that are the same? The problem says: \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.\" So no duplicate lines.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        expr1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        expr2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if expr1 * expr2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n   print(count)\n\n However, wait: what if the product is negative but due to integer overflow? In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so no overflow. But the numbers are within 1e6 * 1e6 * 3 (which is 3e12) and that is acceptable.\n\n But wait: the coefficients a, b, c are up to 1e6, and x1,y1,x2,y2 up to 1e6. Then the maximum absolute value of expr1 is |a*x1| + |b*y1| + |c| <= 1e6 * 1e6 + 1e6 * 1e6 + 1e6 = 2e12 + 1e6, which is about 2.000001e12. This is acceptable.\n\n I think we are good.\n\n But wait: the problem says the line is defined by aix+biy+ci=0. The expression we compute is aix+b iy+ci. The condition for opposite sides is that the two points yield expressions of opposite signs.\n\n However, note: sometimes the expression might be zero even if the point is not on the road? No, because the point is not on the road, so the expression is nonzero.\n\n Therefore, we output the count.\n\n However, wait: is this really the minimum steps? \n\n Explanation: Each step moves from one block to an adjacent block (crossing one road). The entire journey from home to university requires crossing every road that separates the two points (and no others). And since we can cross one road per step, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n But note: we can cross roads in any order. However, the minimal steps is indeed the number of separating roads because we cannot avoid crossing each separating road, and we can cross one road at a time (so we need to cross each one separately).\n\n However, consider: is it possible that crossing one road might put us in a position where we can avoid crossing a subsequent road? No, because the roads are linear and the two points are fixed.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count.\n\n Let me think of a counterexample: \n\n   Suppose we have two roads that are perpendicular and the two points are separated by both. Then we must cross two roads, and we can do it in two steps.\n\n   What if we have two roads that are not perpendicular, but the two points are separated by three roads? Then we must cross three.\n\n   So the answer is the count.\n\n I think we are done.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says \"Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.\"\n\n And the step definition: moving from one block to another if the common border is nonzero.\n\n This is equivalent to crossing one road at a time.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count.\n\n But wait, let me check with a known example from the problem: \n   Example 1: two roads, both separating the two points -> 2 steps.\n\n   Example 2: two roads separating -> 2 steps.\n\n   What if one road separates and then after crossing the first road, the second road doesn't separate? Then we only cross one.\n\n   So the condition is exactly the count.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read the two points.\n   Read n.\n   For each road, check if the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n   Print the count.\n\n But wait: the problem statement example output is given as a list of strings. However, we are to read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\n I'll write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the example input is provided as:\n\n   Example 1: \n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n   Example 2:\n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n But the problem says the input is from stdin.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   roads = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        roads.append(list(map(int, input().split())))\n\n   count = 0\n   for road in roads:\n        a, b, c = road\n        expr1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        expr2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if expr1 * expr2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n However, the problem says:\n\n   Example 1: Output '2'\n   Example 2: Output '2'\n\n This matches.\n\n But wait: the example input format is two points, then n, then n lines.\n\n We are reading exactly that.\n\n I'll submit.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input is given as a list of strings. But we are reading from stdin.\n\n Final code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates the two blocks. The key observation here is that each road that separates the home and university blocks must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university are located in different blocks, meaning they lie on opposite sides of some roads.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, we can determine if the home and university lie on opposite sides by evaluating the sign of the line equation at both points. If the signs differ, the points are on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed once.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, the points lie on opposite sides, and we increment our step count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the `n` roads exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Given that `n` can be up to 300, this approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n    n = int(input())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        expr1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        expr2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if expr1 * expr2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home (`x1, y1`) and university (`x2, y2`), followed by the number of roads `n`.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road defined by coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`, the code evaluates the line equation `ax + by + c` at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Sides**: If the product of the evaluations at the two points is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the road. In this case, the road is counted as one of the steps needed to reach the university.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, crossing one road per step.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm is optimal and handles all edge cases as specified in the problem constraints.",
