A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink available: k * l milliliters.\n    - Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend? Actually, note: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n      But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n    However, note that the group has n friends and they are making toasts such that each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n    The total drink required for T toasts (by all friends) is: T * n * nl   [because each toast uses nl ml for each friend?]\n\n    But wait, let's re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. So one toast requires nl * n milliliters in total?\n    Actually, no: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", meaning for one toast, each friend must have nl ml. Therefore, one toast requires a total of n * nl ml.\n\n    Similarly, one toast requires one slice of lime (so total slices needed = T) and np grams of salt per friend? Actually, the problem says: \n        \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\"\n\n    So for one toast, each friend gets nl ml, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\n    But wait, how many slices of lime are needed for T toasts? Since each toast requires one slice per friend? Then for T toasts, each friend would have T slices? \n    However, the problem states: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\" for one toast. So for one toast, each friend gets one slice. Then for T toasts, each friend gets T slices.\n\n    But note: we have c limes, each cut into d slices, so total slices = c * d.\n\n    And for salt: each toast per friend requires np grams, so total salt needed for T toasts is T * n * np.\n\n    However, the example: \n        Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n        Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> but wait, the example says: \n            \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters, enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" \n\n    Let me clarify: \n        The example says: \n          Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 (nl) = 6 toasts? But wait, the example says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters (which is 3) for one toast\", so one toast requires 3 ml per friend, so 3 friends require 9 ml per toast.\n\n        Then the drink allows 20 / 9 ≈ 2.22 toasts. \n\n    But the example says: \n        \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n    How did they get 6 from drink? They divided by 3 (nl) without considering the number of friends? \n\n    Let me read again: \n        \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n    This means for one toast, the entire group of n friends together needs n * nl milliliters of drink.\n\n    Then the total drink available (20 ml) can support 20 // (n * nl) toasts? \n\n    But wait, the example does: 20 / 3 (nl) = 6. That 3 is the nl per friend, but then they are not multiplying by n (the number of friends) because the example uses 3 as the divisor?\n\n    Actually, note: the example says \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". Here, 3 is nl (per friend). But wait, if one toast requires one friend to have 3 ml, then for one toast, the entire group (3 friends) requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml. \n\n    The example's calculation for drink is: 20 / 3 = 6, but that doesn't match the requirement of 9 ml per toast.\n\n    Alternatively, perhaps the problem is defined differently: \n        Maybe the toast is defined for the entire group? Or maybe the drink requirement is for the entire group per toast?\n\n    Let me check the example output: \n        Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1' -> Output: 2\n\n    The example says: \n        \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n    Then they divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2. \n\n    This implies that the 6 toasts is the total toasts for the entire group? But wait, 6 toasts for the entire group? Then each friend would have 6 / 3 = 2 toasts.\n\n    But how did they get 6 from drink? \n        If one toast requires 3 ml (for the entire group?) then that doesn't match because the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", so one toast requires n * nl ml.\n\n    Alternatively, the example might be interpreting the drink requirement per toast as the entire group? Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So the entire group needs n * nl per toast.\n\n    Then the total number of toasts (for the entire group) that can be made with the drink is: floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) ) ?\n\n    But wait, the example: \n        k*l = 20, n=3, nl=3 -> 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so 2 toasts? But then the example says 6.\n\n    There's a discrepancy.\n\n    Let me read the problem statement again: \n        \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\"\n\n    And then: \"the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\n    The key is: each toast is for one round for each friend. So if they make T toasts, then each friend will have T toasts, and the requirements are:\n        Drink: T * n * nl\n        Lime: T * n * 1? But wait, the problem says \"a slice of lime\" per friend per toast. So for T toasts, each friend gets T slices, so total slices needed is T * n.\n\n    However, wait: the example input also gives c and d (the limes). They say: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". \n        How did they get 80? \n        They have c=10 limes, each cut into d=8 slices -> total slices = 10*8 = 80.\n        And each toast requires one slice per friend? Then the total toasts (for the entire group) that can be supported by limes is 80 / n? \n        Because each toast uses n slices (one per friend). So the total number of toasts (for the entire group) that can be made from limes is 80 / n? \n\n    But wait, the example says: \"The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\" — meaning they are saying 80 is the total number of slices, and each toast requires one slice (but note: the problem says \"each friend needs a slice\" per toast, so one toast requires n slices). \n\n    However, the example does not multiply by n. It just takes the total slices and then later divides by the number of friends to get the per-friend toasts.\n\n    Let me break down the example:\n\n        Total drink: 20 ml -> each toast (for the entire group) requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Then 20 / 9 = 2.22 -> 2 toasts for the entire group.\n\n        Total lime slices: 80 -> each toast (for the entire group) requires 3 slices (since there are 3 friends)? Then 80 / 3 ≈ 26.66 -> 26 toasts for the entire group.\n\n        Total salt: 100 grams -> each toast (for the entire group) requires 3 * 1 = 3 grams? Then 100 / 3 ≈ 33.33 -> 33 toasts for the entire group.\n\n        Then the limiting factor is the drink: 2 toasts for the entire group.\n\n        Then each friend makes 2 toasts (because the entire group makes 2 toasts, and each friend is in every toast).\n\n    But wait, the example says: \n        \"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n    How did they get 6 from drink? \n        They did: 20 / 3 = 6. \n\n    Now I see: they are calculating the number of toasts for the entire group by dividing the total drink by the amount per friend per toast (nl) and then not accounting for the fact that the drink is shared by n friends.\n\n    Alternatively, they are calculating the total toasts (without grouping by friend) but then dividing by the number of friends at the end.\n\n    Another interpretation: \n        Instead of thinking in terms of entire group toasts, think in terms of per-friend toasts.\n\n        Let T be the number of toasts each friend makes.\n\n        Then, the total drink consumed is T * n * nl (because each friend makes T toasts and each toast requires nl ml).\n        The total lime slices consumed is T * n (each friend makes T toasts, each toast requires one slice per friend -> so each friend uses T slices, and there are n friends -> total slices = T * n).\n        The total salt consumed is T * n * np.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... np grams of salt\" per toast. So for T toasts, each friend needs T * np grams. Then the total salt is n * (T * np) = T * n * np.\n\n        Now, the constraints are:\n            T * n * nl <= k * l   => T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n            T * n <= c * d         => T <= (c * d) / n\n            T * n * np <= p        => T <= p / (n * np)\n\n        Then the maximum T (number of toasts per friend) is the minimum of these three values (and then take the floor, because we can't make a fraction of a toast).\n\n    Let's test with the example: \n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n\n        T <= (4*5) / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> floor is 2\n        T <= (10*8) / 3 = 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> floor is 26\n        T <= 100 / (3*1) = 100/3 ≈ 33.33 -> floor is 33\n\n        Then T = 2.\n\n    This matches.\n\n    However, note: the example says \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\". \n        Where did 6 come from? \n        They did: 20 / 3 = 6 (for drink) but that was the total toasts if we didn't consider the entire group? \n\n    Actually, if we calculate the total toasts (for the entire group) from the drink: \n        Total toasts (entire group) from drink: floor( (k*l) / (nl) )? \n        But wait, the entire group toasts would be limited by: floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) ) as above, which is 2.\n\n    Alternatively, the example's 6 is the total toasts if we only considered the drink and one friend? \n        For one friend, the drink would allow 20 / 3 ≈ 6 toasts. But then we have 3 friends, so we have to divide by 3 to account for the fact that each toast requires 3 friends? \n\n    This is confusing.\n\n    Let me explain the example's way:\n\n        They calculated:\n            Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 (nl) = 6 toasts (if we were serving only one friend, then 6 toasts for that friend)\n            Limes: 80 slices -> 80 / 1 (each toast requires one slice per friend? Actually, wait: the example doesn't specify per friend or entire group) \n\n        But note: the example says \"the limes are enough for 80 toasts\", meaning if we consider one toast requires one slice (regardless of the number of friends) then 80 toasts? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\" for one toast. So one toast requires one slice per friend. \n\n        Therefore, for one toast, the entire group requires n slices. So the total toasts (for the entire group) from limes is 80 / n = 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> 26.\n\n        But wait, the example says \"the limes are enough for 80 toasts\", which is the total slices. Then they don't divide by n. \n\n        Then how do they get the per-friend toasts? \n\n        They take the minimum of the three: 6 (from drink, which is 20/3, but that 3 is per friend so 6 is the maximum toasts for one friend from drink) and 80 (from limes, which is the total slices, so if we consider each toast requires one slice per friend, then the entire group can make up to 80/(n) toasts, but wait, the example doesn't use that) and 100 (from salt, which is total grams, and each toast requires np=1 per friend, so entire group requires n*np=3 per toast, then total toasts from salt is 100/3≈33.33).\n\n        Then they divide by n (the number of friends) to get the per friend toasts.\n\n        So they did: \n            total_toasts_from_drink = (k*l) / nl   [this gives the maximum toasts for one friend?] \n            total_toasts_from_lime_slices = c*d       [this is the total slices, and then they don't divide by n?]\n            total_toasts_from_salt = p / np           [again, this is per friend?]\n\n        Then the limiting factor is the minimum of (total_toasts_from_drink, total_toasts_from_lime_slices, total_toasts_from_salt) and then divide by n.\n\n        But wait, from drink: (k*l) / nl = 20/3 ≈ 6.66 -> but wait, if one friend uses nl ml per toast, then the drink allows 20 / 3 toasts for one friend. \n        Similarly, for salt: one friend uses np grams per toast, so the salt allows 100/1 = 100 toasts for one friend.\n\n        For lime: one friend uses one slice per toast, so the total slices (80) can be used by one friend for 80 toasts? \n\n        Then the limiting factor is the minimum of (6, 80, 100) which is 6, and then since there are 3 friends, we must ensure that the entire group doesn't exceed the resources. \n\n        However, if one friend can only make 6 toasts, then the entire group (with 3 friends) would require 3 times the resources for 6 toasts. \n\n        But wait, the problem says they all drink the same amount. So we cannot let one friend make 6 toasts and another 2. \n\n        Therefore, we must find the maximum T (toasts per friend) such that:\n\n            T <= (k*l) / (n * nl)   [because the drink: total drink = k*l, and for T toasts per friend, the total drink used is T * n * nl]\n\n        But the example's method:\n\n            They computed:\n                drink_limit = (k*l) / nl   -> 20/3 ≈ 6.66\n                lime_limit = c*d             -> 80\n                salt_limit = p / np          -> 100/1 = 100\n\n            Then the total toasts (for the entire group) from drink is actually drink_limit / n? \n            Because if one friend can have T toasts, then the entire group has T*n toasts, and the drink used is T*n*nl, so T <= (k*l) / (n*nl). \n\n            But note: the example does not divide the drink_limit by n. \n\n        Alternatively, they are computing the maximum toasts per friend by:\n\n            T_drink = (k*l) // (nl * n)   [but wait, no: the example did 20/3 for drink_limit, which is not using n]\n\n        After reading the example's explanation again: \n            \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n        This 6 is the total toasts for the entire group? Then how? \n            If the entire group makes 6 toasts, then the drink used is 6 * n * nl = 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml, but we only have 20 ml. \n\n        This doesn't add up.\n\n    Let me try to reconcile:\n\n        The example says: \n            Drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n        If we interpret \"each toast\" as being for one friend, then 6 toasts for one friend would require 6 * 3 = 18 ml, which is less than 20. But then why divide by 3? \n\n        Actually, if one toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml, then 20 ml can serve one friend for 20/3 ≈ 6.66 toasts. \n\n        Then for the entire group, if they are to have the same number of toasts, we must have the same T for each friend. \n\n        However, the resources must be sufficient for all friends. \n\n        The drink needed for T toasts per friend is: T * n * nl.\n\n        The lime needed: T * n (because each friend uses T slices, and there are n friends, so total slices = T*n)\n\n        The salt needed: T * n * np.\n\n        Now, the example calculates:\n\n            T_drink = (k*l) / (nl)   [for one friend] -> 20/3 ≈ 6.66 -> meaning one friend can have 6 toasts (floor(6.66)=6) but then the entire group would need 6*3=18 ml, which is within 20.\n\n            T_lime = (c*d)   [total slices] -> 80, and then for the entire group to make T toasts, we need T * n <= 80 -> T <= 80/n = 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> so T=26 for the entire group.\n\n            T_salt = p / np = 100/1 = 100 -> for one friend, then for the entire group: T * n * np <= 100 -> T <= 100/(n*np)=100/3≈33.33.\n\n        Then the limiting factor for one friend is the minimum of (6.66, 26.66, 33.33) -> 6.66, then floor to 6.\n\n        But wait, if one friend can have 6 toasts, then the entire group (3 friends) would have 6 toasts each, and the drink required is 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml, but we only have 20 ml.\n\n        This is inconsistent.\n\n    After re‐reading the problem statement: \n        \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n        This means: \n            For one toast, one friend requires:\n                drink: nl ml\n                lime: 1 slice\n                salt: np grams\n\n        Therefore, for one friend to make T toasts, they require:\n            drink: T * nl ml\n            lime: T slices\n            salt: T * np grams\n\n        And for the entire group (n friends) to make T toasts (each friend makes T toasts), they require:\n            drink: T * n * nl ml\n            lime: T * n slices\n            salt: T * n * np grams\n\n        Then the constraints are:\n\n            T * n * nl <= k * l\n            T * n <= c * d\n            T * n * np <= p\n\n        Then T <= min( (k*l) / (n*nl), (c*d) / (n), (p) / (n*np) )\n\n        Then T is an integer (we take the floor of the minimum value).\n\n    Now, the example:\n\n        n=3, k=4, l=5 -> drink constraint: (4*5) / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> T=2\n        n=3, c=10, d=8 -> lime constraint: (10*8)/3 = 80/3 ≈26.66 -> T=26\n        n=3, p=100, np=1 -> salt constraint: 100/(3*1)≈33.33 -> T=33\n\n        Then T = floor(min(2.22, 26.66, 33.33)) = 2.\n\n    This matches the expected output.\n\n    But wait, the example's explanation said:\n\n        \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n        How does that fit? \n\n        They are calculating for one friend: 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> so one friend could make 6 toasts (if alone). But in reality, we are sharing the drink among 3 friends.\n\n        However, note: the drink is used by all friends. The entire drink is 20 ml, and if each friend makes T toasts, then the total drink used is T * 3 * 3 = 9T ml. \n\n        The example's calculation of 20/3 is the same as (k*l) / (nl) which is the drink limit if we were serving only one friend (because one friend uses nl per toast). \n\n        But in the problem, we have multiple friends. The drink must be divided. \n\n        The correct way is to consider the entire group's usage.\n\n    Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        Read the 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n\n        total_drink = k * l\n        total_lime_slices = c * d\n\n        # Constraints for T (number of toasts per friend):\n        # 1. Drink: T * n * nl <= total_drink  => T <= total_drink / (n * nl)\n        # 2. Lime: T * n <= total_lime_slices   => T <= total_lime_slices / n\n        # 3. Salt: T * n * np <= p             => T <= p / (n * np)\n\n        T1 = total_drink / (n * nl)\n        T2 = total_lime_slices / n\n        T3 = p / (n * np)\n\n        T = min(T1, T2, T3)\n\n        Then we take the floor (because T must be an integer, and we can't make a fraction of a toast) and then we take the integer part (using floor division or converting to int after flooring, but note: the problem says positive integers and the inputs are integers, but the divisions may be fractional).\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to use only whole toasts. So we take the floor of the minimum.\n\n        Example 2: \n            Input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\n            n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n            total_drink = 100*10 = 1000\n            total_lime_slices = 1*19 = 19\n\n            T1 = 1000 / (5*4) = 1000/20 = 50\n            T2 = 19 / 5 = 3.8\n            T3 = 90 / (5*3) = 90/15 = 6\n\n            T = min(50, 3.8, 6) = 3.8 -> floor to 3\n\n            Output: 3 -> matches.\n\n        Example 3:\n            Input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n            total_drink = 1000*1000 = 1000000\n            total_lime_slices = 25*23 = 575\n\n            T1 = 1000000 / (10*50) = 1000000/500 = 2000\n            T2 = 575 / 10 = 57.5\n            T3 = 1 / (10*1) = 0.1\n\n            T = min(2000, 57.5, 0.1) -> 0.1 -> floor to 0\n\n            Output: 0 -> matches.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n        We read the input, split and convert to integers.\n\n        Then compute:\n            total_drink = k * l\n            total_lime_slices = c * d\n\n        Then:\n            constraint1 = total_drink / (n * nl)\n            constraint2 = total_lime_slices / n\n            constraint3 = p / (n * np)\n\n        Then T = floor(min(constraint1, constraint2, constraint3))\n\n        But note: the constraints might be fractional, and we need to take the floor (largest integer <= the minimum).\n\n        However, we are dealing with positive integers and the problem says to output an integer.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            T = min(total_drink / (n * nl), total_lime_slices / n, p / (n * np))\n            Then take the integer part by converting to int? But wait, if the minimum is 3.8, then floor is 3, but if we do int(3.8) we get 3, but if negative we'd have issues, but here positive.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the problem says the numbers are positive and at least 1, so no negatives.\n\n        But note: the division might be non-integer, and we are to take the floor (because we can't have a fraction of a toast).\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            T = min(total_drink // (n * nl), total_lime_slices // n, p // (n * np))\n\n        But wait, the // operator is integer floor division. However, the total_drink might not be divisible by (n*nl). But the constraints are:\n\n            constraint1 = total_drink / (n * nl)   [real number]\n\n        We want the floor. Using integer floor division for the first constraint: total_drink // (n*nl) is the same as floor(total_drink/(n*nl)) if we are using positive numbers.\n\n        However, the other two:\n\n            constraint2: total_lime_slices // n is the same as floor(total_lime_slices/n) for positive numbers.\n\n            constraint3: p // (n*np) is the same as floor(p/(n*np)).\n\n        Then we can take the minimum of these three integers.\n\n        But wait, what if the division is not exact? For example, constraint1 might be 3.8 and constraint2 might be 3. Then we want 3.\n\n        However, note: the constraints are independent. We must satisfy all. So we take the floor of each and then the minimum? \n\n        Actually, no: the limiting factor is the most restrictive resource. We must take the floor of the real number minimum.\n\n        Example: \n            constraint1 = 3.8, constraint2 = 3.5 -> the real minimum is 3.5, then floor is 3. But if we take the floor of each:\n\n            constraint1_floor = 3\n            constraint2_floor = 3\n\n            Then we take min(3,3)=3.\n\n        But if we take the floor of the real minimum (3.5) we get 3.\n\n        However, what if:\n\n            constraint1 = 3.8, constraint2 = 3.4, constraint3 = 3.6\n\n            Real minimum is 3.4 -> floor is 3.\n\n            Floor of constraint1: 3, constraint2: 3, constraint3: 3 -> min=3.\n\n        This is the same.\n\n        But note: sometimes the floor of each constraint might be higher than the floor of the minimum? \n\n        Actually, no: because the minimum of the floors is the floor of the minimum? Not necessarily:\n\n            constraint1 = 3.8 -> floor=3\n            constraint2 = 4.5 -> floor=4\n            constraint3 = 3.4 -> floor=3\n\n            Then the minimum of the floors is 3.\n\n            The real minimum is 3.4, and floor(3.4)=3.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            T = min(total_drink // (n * nl), total_lime_slices // n, p // (n * np))\n\n        However, wait: integer floor division truncates toward zero for positive numbers, which is the same as floor.\n\n        But caution: the denominators (n*nl, n, n*np) are positive, so yes.\n\n        However, what if the numerator is not divisible by the denominator? \n\n            Example: total_drink = 10, n*nl=3 -> 10//3 = 3, which is floor(10/3)=3.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says the inputs are positive integers and at least 1, so we are safe.\n\n        However, there's a catch: the drink constraint: \n            total_drink = k * l (an integer) and n*nl (an integer) so the division is integer division.\n\n        But wait: the example 3: \n            Input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\n            constraint3: p // (n*np) = 1 // (10*1) = 1//10 = 0\n\n        But note: the constraint is T * n * np <= p. \n            T * 10 * 1 <= 1 -> T <= 0.1, so T must be 0.\n\n        Using integer floor division: 1//10 is 0, which is correct.\n\n        However, what if we use floating point and then floor? \n\n            T = min(1000000/(10*50), 575/10, 1/(10*1)) = min(2000, 57.5, 0.1) = 0.1 -> then floor(0.1)=0.\n\n        Both methods are acceptable.\n\n        But note: the numbers can be up to 1000, and the product (like n*nl) can be up to 1000*1000=1e6, and k*l can be up to 1000*1000=1e6, so the divisions in floating point are safe.\n\n        However, the problem says the numbers are positive and not exceeding 1000, so the maximum value for total_drink is 1e6, and n*nl is at least 1, so the maximum value for constraint1 is 1e6, which is within the range of float.\n\n        But the problem also says the numbers are at least 1, so no division by zero.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            T = min(k * l / (n * nl), c * d / n, p / (n * np))\n\n        Then take the floor: int(math.floor(T))? \n\n        But wait, if we do floating point and then floor, we have to be cautious of floating point precision.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            T = min((k * l) / (n * nl), (c * d) / n, p / (n * np))\n            result = math.floor(T)\n\n        But the problem says the numbers are integers, but the divisions may not be. We can use integer arithmetic for the floor, but the constraints might not be integers.\n\n        However, the problem says the inputs are integers, but the divisions are real numbers.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            T = min(k * l / (n * nl), c * d / n, p / (n * np))\n\n        Then we need to take the floor. But note: the minimum value might be very close to an integer due to floating point inaccuracies.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            T = min(k * l // (n * nl), c * d // n, p // (n * np))\n\n        But wait: this is integer floor division, but note: the first constraint: k * l // (n * nl) is the same as floor(k*l/(n*nl)) only if k*l is divisible by n*nl? No, it's floor division.\n\n        However, the constraints are:\n\n            T must satisfy T * n * nl <= k * l.\n\n        Using integer floor division for the first constraint: T1 = k * l // (n * nl) gives the maximum integer T such that T * (n*nl) <= k*l.\n\n        Similarly for the others.\n\n        Then the maximum T is the minimum of these three.\n\n        Example 1: \n            k*l=20, n*nl=9 -> 20//9 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \n            k*l=1000, n*nl=20 -> 1000//20 = 50 -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: \n            p=1, n*np=10 -> 1//10=0 -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: \n            c*d=575, n=10 -> 575//10=57 -> correct.\n\n        Then we take:\n\n            T = min(k * l // (n * nl), c * d // n, p // (n * np))\n\n        However, wait: the drink constraint: k * l // (n * nl) is the maximum T for drink? Yes.\n\n        But note: the drink constraint is T * n * nl <= k * l, and T is an integer. The maximum T is indeed k*l // (n*nl) (using floor division).\n\n        Similarly for the others.\n\n        But note: the lime constraint: T * n <= c * d, so T <= (c*d) // n? \n\n            (c*d) // n is the floor of (c*d)/n, but we require T * n <= c*d. \n\n            T_max = (c*d) // n? \n\n            Let x = (c*d) // n, then x = floor((c*d)/n). Then x * n <= c*d, but (x+1)*n might be > c*d.\n\n            So yes, (c*d)//n is the maximum integer T satisfying T <= (c*d)/n.\n\n        Similarly for salt: T * n * np <= p -> T <= p // (n*np) [using floor division].\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            T_drink = (k * l)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to ensure that all friends drink the same amount and that the resources (drink, lime slices, and salt) are sufficient for the desired number of toasts per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The solution involves finding the limiting factor among the three resources (drink, lime slices, and salt) that restricts the number of toasts.\n2. **Intuition**: For each friend to make T toasts, the total resources required are:\n   - **Drink**: T * n * nl (since each toast requires nl ml per friend, and there are n friends).\n   - **Lime Slices**: T * n (each friend needs one slice per toast, so n friends require n slices per toast).\n   - **Salt**: T * n * np (each toast requires np grams per friend, so n friends require n*np grams per toast).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves computing the maximum possible T for each resource constraint and then taking the minimum of these values. This ensures that all constraints are satisfied simultaneously.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves basic arithmetic operations (multiplication and division) which are constant time operations O(1). Thus, the algorithm is efficient with O(1) time and space complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    T_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    T_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    T_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    T = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n    print(T)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast respectively.\n2. **Calculating Total Resources**: \n   - **Total Drink**: Multiply the number of bottles (k) by the milliliters per bottle (l).\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Multiply the number of limes (c) by the slices per lime (d).\n3. **Determining Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts per friend is calculated by dividing the total drink by the product of the number of friends (n) and the milliliters per toast (nl), using floor division to ensure whole numbers.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts per friend is determined by dividing the total lime slices by the number of friends (n).\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts per friend is found by dividing the total salt (p) by the product of the number of friends (n) and the grams of salt per toast (np), again using floor division.\n4. **Finding the Minimum Toasts**: The solution takes the minimum value among the three constraints to ensure all resources are sufficient.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, representing the maximum number of toasts each friend can make under the given constraints.",
