He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n        f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n But note: the problem asks for the numbers n such that f(n) = m.\n\n Observation:\n   The function f(n) is non-decreasing. So, we know that if we find the smallest n0 such that f(n0) >= m and then the smallest n1 such that f(n1) >= m+1, then the numbers n with f(n)=m are the consecutive numbers from n0 to n1-1.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\". \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the range [L, R] such that for all n in [L, R], f(n) = m, and for n < L, f(n) < m, and for n >= R+1, f(n) >= m+1.\n\n 2. Actually, we can use binary search to find:\n      a. The smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Let this be L.\n      b. The smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Let this be R.\n\n    Then, the numbers n that have exactly m trailing zeros are from L to R-1.\n\n 3. But note: it is possible that there are no n with exactly m trailing zeros? Actually, the example input m=1 outputs 5,6,...,9. However, what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n 4. However, note the example: \n        Input: '1' -> Output: \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\"\n\n    So for m=1, the numbers n are from 5 to 9.\n\n    How do we compute L and R?\n\n    For m=1:\n        Find L: smallest n such that f(n) >= 1.\n            n=5: f(5)=1 -> so L=5.\n        Find R: smallest n such that f(n) >= 2.\n            n=10: f(10)=2 -> so R=10.\n\n        Then the numbers n with exactly 1 trailing zero are from 5 to 9 (because at n=10, the trailing zeros become 2).\n\n 5. But wait: what if m is very large? We must consider that the factorial function grows very fast and the numbers n might be huge.\n\n    However, note that m is at most 100000.\n\n    We can use binary search to find L and R.\n\n    How to compute f(n) for a given n?\n        We do: \n            count = 0\n            divisor = 5\n            while divisor <= n:\n                count += n // divisor\n                divisor *= 5\n\n    This is efficient because the number of divisions is about log5(n).\n\n 6. But note: n might be very large. However, we are only doing two binary searches, and the value of n we are searching for is at most around 5*m (but actually more because of higher powers). But note: the maximum n we might consider is when m=100000, so we need to set an upper bound.\n\n    The maximum n for which f(n) >= 100000: \n        We know that f(n) ~ n/4 (roughly, because 1/5 + 1/25 + ... < 1/4). So n is about 4*m. But actually, we can set an upper bound to 5*m * something? \n\n    Alternatively, we can set the high bound for binary search as 5*m*5? Actually, let's think:\n\n        We want the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n\n        We know that f(5*m) is at least m (because 5*m//5 + (5*m)//25 + ... >= m). But sometimes we might need a little more. \n\n        Actually, we can set the upper bound for the binary search as 5*m * 5 (or even 5*m + 100) but wait, sometimes m=0? no, m>=1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            low_bound = 0\n            high_bound = 5*m + 1   #",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently determining the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is primarily determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\), we use binary search. The search space is between 0 and \\( 5 \\times m \\) (a safe upper bound since \\( f(n) \\) grows with \\( n \\)). Similarly, we perform another binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\).\n\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: The valid \\( n \\) values are those between the two bounds found by the binary searches. Specifically, if \\( L \\) is the smallest \\( n \\) with \\( f(n) \\geq m \\) and \\( R \\) is the smallest \\( n \\) with \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\), then all \\( n \\) from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\) will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes in their factorial.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m = int(data[0])\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    L = high\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeroes(mid) >= m:\n            L = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    R = high\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeroes(mid) >= m + 1:\n            R = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n            \n    if L >= R:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = R - L\n        print(k)\n        nums = [str(i) for i in range(L, R)]\n        print(\" \".join(nums))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeroes(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **main()**: The main function reads the input value \\( m \\), which is the required number of trailing zeroes. It then performs two binary searches:\n   - The first search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( L \\)) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\).\n   - The second search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( R \\)) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\).\n\n3. **Output**: If no \\( n \\) exists (i.e., \\( L \\geq R \\)), it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the count of valid \\( n \\) values (from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\)) followed by the list of these values in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of valid \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zeroes function \\( f(n) \\). The solution handles large values of \\( m \\) (up to 100,000) efficiently by keeping the binary search operations logarithmic in complexity.",
