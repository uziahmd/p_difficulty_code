A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink available: k * l milliliters.\n    - Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend? Actually, note: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n      But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n    However, note that the group has n friends and they are making toasts such that each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n    The key: \n      Total drink needed for T toasts (for the whole group) is T * n * nl? \n      But wait, let's read again: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. So for T toasts, one friend needs T * nl milliliters.\n      Then the whole group of n friends needs n * T * nl milliliters.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think in terms of the entire group: \n      The total number of toasts T must satisfy: \n        Drink: T * n * nl <= k * l   => T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n        Lime: each toast requires one slice, and we have c limes each cut into d slices -> total slices = c * d, so T <= c * d\n        Salt: each toast requires np grams, so T <= p / np\n\n    Then, the maximum number of toasts per friend is T (the minimum of the above three), but note: the problem asks for \"how many toasts can each friend make?\".\n\n    However, note: if we are making T toasts, then each friend makes T toasts? Actually, the problem says they all drink the same amount. And one toast for a friend uses nl ml, one lime slice, and np grams of salt.\n\n    So the entire group makes T toasts, meaning each friend makes T toasts? Not exactly: the entire group together makes T toasts? \n\n    Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters ... to make a toast\". So if there are n friends, then for one toast per friend, the drink needed is n * nl. Therefore, the total toasts (for the whole group) is T, and then each friend makes T toasts? \n\n    Actually, wait: if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is n * t. Then the conditions become:\n\n        Drink: n * t * nl <= k * l   => t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n        Lime: n * t * 1 <= c * d      => t <= (c * d) / n\n        Salt: n * t * np <= p          => t <= p / (n * np)\n\n    But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make a toast. So one toast per friend requires those. Therefore, if each friend makes t toasts, then the total drink needed is n * t * nl.\n\n    However, the sample input: \n        Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\n        Here, n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        According to the sample explanation:\n            Overall drink: 4*5 = 20 -> toasts from drink: 20/(3*3) ? Wait no, the sample explanation says: \n            \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" -> but wait, that doesn't match because 3 is nl (per friend per toast) but then why divide by 3? \n\n        Actually, the sample explanation is breaking it down differently:\n\n            They say: \n                Drink: 20 ml, and each toast (for the entire group?) requires 3 ml per friend? That would be 3 * 3 = 9 ml per toast for the entire group? \n                But wait, the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So if there are 3 friends, then one toast (for the entire group? or per friend?) \n\n        Let me clarify the problem statement: \n            \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\n        This means: In one toast, each friend gets one unit of drink (nl ml) and one lime",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, and then determine how many toasts each friend can make based on the most restrictive resource.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Each toast requires `nl` milliliters of drink per friend, one lime slice, and `np` grams of salt per friend.\n   - The total available drink is `k * l` milliliters.\n   - The total available lime slices is `c * d`.\n   - The total available salt is `p` grams.\n   - The goal is to find the maximum number of toasts `t` such that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limit.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The number of toasts each friend can make is constrained by the most limiting resource. This is found by calculating the maximum possible toasts from each resource and taking the minimum of these values.\n   - For the drink: `t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)`\n   - For lime slices: `t <= (c * d) / n`\n   - For salt: `t <= p / (n * np)`\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Compute the maximum toasts possible from each resource.\n   - The answer is the minimum of these three values, as it ensures no resource is exceeded.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    max_toasts_from_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    max_toasts_from_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    max_toasts_from_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(max_toasts_from_drink, max_toasts_from_lime, max_toasts_from_salt)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers separated by spaces, representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast respectively.\n2. **Calculating Resources**: \n   - Total drink available is computed as `k * l`.\n   - Total lime slices available is computed as `c * d`.\n3. **Determining Maximum Toasts**: \n   - The maximum toasts from drink is calculated by dividing the total drink by the drink required per toast for all friends (`n * nl`).\n   - The maximum toasts from lime slices is determined by dividing the total lime slices by the number of friends (`n`), as each toast requires one slice per friend.\n   - The maximum toasts from salt is found by dividing the total salt by the salt required per toast for all friends (`n * np`).\n4. **Finding the Minimum**: The answer is the smallest value among the three calculated maxima, ensuring no resource is exceeded.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make under the given constraints.",
