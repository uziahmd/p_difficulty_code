Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n The idea is to find the minimum d such that the entire street [0, l] is covered by the lanterns' light.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Note that the entire street must be lit. This means:\n    - The leftmost point of the street is 0, and the rightmost is l.\n    - We can break the problem into segments between the lanterns and from the start/end to the nearest lantern.\n\n Observation:\n    We need to cover:\n        a) The gap from 0 to the first lantern: we require that the first lantern's light covers 0.\n           The distance from the first lantern (at a0) to 0 is a0. So d must be at least a0/2 for the left side?\n        b) Similarly, the last lantern must cover up to l: so d must be at least (l - last_lantern)/2.\n\n    However, we also have gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n    Actually, we can consider:\n        Let the sorted lanterns be in an array `a`.\n        We need to cover the entire interval [0, l].\n\n    The gaps we care about are:\n        - From 0 to a[0]: the required d must be at least a[0] (if we put the light from the first lantern to the left, but note: the light can extend d units to the left and right).\n        - Between consecutive lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at positions a[i] and a[i+1], the gap between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]). \n          To cover this gap, the two adjacent lanterns must provide coverage that meets in the middle. \n          The condition is that the right coverage of the left lantern (a[i] + d) must meet or exceed the next lantern's left coverage (a[i+1] - d). \n          So: a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d  => 2*d >= a[i+1] - a[i] => d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n        - From the last lantern to l: similarly, d must be at least (l - a[-1]).\n\n    Therefore, the minimum d must be at least:\n        d_min = max( a[0], (l - a[-1]), max_{i=0}^{n-2} ( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2 ) )\n\n    However, note: the entire street must be covered. The above conditions are necessary, but let's verify:\n\n    Example 1: ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0'] -> sorted: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n        a[0]=0 -> requires d>=0 (which is trivial)\n        l - a[-1] = 15-15 = 0 -> trivial\n        gaps: \n            3-0 = 3 -> d>= 1.5\n            5-3 = 2 -> d>=1\n            7-5 = 2 -> d>=1\n            9-7 = 2 -> d>=1\n            14-9 = 5 -> d>=2.5\n            15-14=1 -> d>=0.5\n        So maximum among these is 2.5 -> answer 2.5\n\n    Example 2: ['2 5\\n2 5'] -> sorted: [2,5]\n        a[0]=2 -> requires d>=2 (so half is 1? wait, no: the entire street is from 0 to 5.\n        But note: the first lantern at 2 must cover from 0 to 4 (if d=2) and the second at 5 must cover from 3 to 5 (if d=2). \n        However, note that the gap from 0 to 2 is 2, so d must be at least 2 (because the first lantern must reach 0: 2-d <= 0? Actually, the condition is that the leftmost point 0 must be within d from a0: |0-2|<=d -> d>=2. Similarly, the rightmost point 5: |5-5|=0<=d, so the limiting factor is the left side and the gap between 2 and 5.\n\n        Alternatively, consider the gaps:\n            The gap from 0 to 2: d must be at least 2 (to cover 0).\n            The gap from 2 to 5: (5-2)=3 -> d must be at least 3/2 = 1.5.\n            Then the maximum of 2 and 1.5 is 2.\n\n        But wait, with d=2: \n            First lantern: covers [0, 4] (because 2-2=0, 2+2=4)\n            Second lantern: covers [3,7] (but our street only goes to 5, so [3,5] is covered)\n            So the whole [0,5] is covered.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the entire street [0,5] must be lit.\n\n        Why did we consider the left gap as requiring d>=2? Actually, the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0. The distance from the first lantern (at 2) to 0 is 2, so the light must extend at least 2 units to the left. Hence d must be at least 2.\n\n        Similarly, for the right end: the distance from the last lantern to l (5) is 0, so no requirement from the right.\n\n        But what if we have multiple lanterns? The condition for the left end is: the first lantern must cover 0, i.e., d >= a0 (if we consider the left side) OR we can think: the leftmost point 0 must be within d from some lantern. The closest lantern on the left is the first one at a0, so we require d >= a0 (the distance from a0 to 0 is a0). Similarly, the rightmost point l must be within d from the last lantern, so d >= l - a[-1].\n\n        And for the gaps between lanterns, we require that the two adjacent lanterns together cover the entire segment. The left lantern covers up to a[i] + d, and the right lantern covers from a[i+1] - d. We require that a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d, which gives d >= (a[i+1] - a[i])/2.\n\n    Therefore, we can set:\n        candidate1 = a[0]   # because we need to cover from 0 to a0\n        candidate2 = l - a[-1]   # because we need to cover from a[-1] to l\n        candidate3 = max( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2 for i in range(n-1) )\n\n        Then answer = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n    But wait, is candidate1 really a[0]? Actually, the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a[0]. The lantern can cover 0 only if d >= a[0]. Similarly, for the right end, d >= l - a[-1]. For the gaps, d must be at least (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n    However, note that if there are multiple lanterns, the left end might be covered by a lantern that is not the first one? But we sorted the lanterns, and the first one is the smallest. The first one is the one closest to 0. Therefore, the condition for the left end is indeed that the first lantern must cover 0 (unless there is a lantern at 0, then no issue). Similarly, the last lantern is the one closest to l.\n\n    But what if the first lantern is not the only one? Actually, the entire street must be covered. The left end is 0, and the closest lantern is the first one. If we don't use the first one to cover 0, then we would need a lantern that is at most 0+d. But the first lantern is the smallest, so it is the best candidate to cover 0.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If there's only one lantern, then we must cover from 0 to l, so the lantern must be at a certain position. The required d is the maximum of:\n        #   from 0 to a0: d >= a0\n        #   from a0 to l: d >= l - a0\n        #   and then the maximum of these two.\n\n        # In general, we have three cases: left end, right end, and gaps.\n\n        # But note: the condition for the gaps is actually automatically satisfied by the two lanterns if d is large enough to cover the gaps. However, the left and right ends are separate.\n\n        # So we compute:\n        #   d_left = a[0]  # because we need to cover from 0 to a0\n        #   d_right = l - a[-1]\n        #   d_gap = 0\n        #   for i in range(n-1):\n        #       gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        #       if gap > d_gap * 2:   # Actually, we want the maximum gap/2, so we can compute the maximum gap and then divide by 2.\n        #           d_gap = gap / 2.0\n\n        # Then answer = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n\n    However, note: the example 2: [2,5] for street [0,5]:\n        d_left = 2\n        d_right = 0\n        d_gap = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n        Then max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0 -> correct.\n\n    Another example: [0, 10] (one lantern at 0, street from 0 to 10)\n        d_left = 0\n        d_right = 10\n        d_gap = 0 (no consecutive lanterns? Actually, n=1, so we don't enter the gap loop. Then we have to handle n=1 separately? Actually, the above code for gaps would not run if n==1.\n\n    Correction: if n==1, then we have only one lantern. Then we must cover from 0 to l. The lantern is at a0. Then the required d is the maximum of:\n        d_left = a0 (to cover from 0 to a0)\n        d_right = l - a0 (to cover from a0 to l)\n\n    And there are no gaps (so we don't consider any).\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        if n == 0:\n            # then we need to cover the entire street without any lantern -> but n>=1 per input, so skip.\n        else:\n            candidates = []\n            # left end\n            candidates.append(a[0])\n            # right end\n            candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n            # gaps\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                # The minimal d needed for this gap is gap/2, but note: we don't necessarily need to cover the entire gap by two adjacent lanterns? Actually, the condition is that the two adjacent lanterns must meet in the middle. So the required d for this gap is at least gap/2.\n                candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n            # Then the answer is the maximum of all candidates.\n\n    However, note: the gaps condition might not be necessary if the gap is already covered by the left/right ends? Actually, the gaps condition is independent. \n\n    But wait, what if the street has two lanterns at the same position? Then the gap is 0, and that doesn't impose a constraint.\n\n    However, the above code for gaps will work because if two lanterns are at the same point, then gap=0, and 0/2=0, which is the minimum.\n\n    But note: the condition for the gaps is that the entire street must be covered. The gaps condition ensures that the segment between two consecutive lanterns is covered. The left and right conditions ensure the ends.\n\n    However, what if the street is not connected? The gaps condition ensures that the entire street is connected. Since we have sorted the lanterns, the gaps are the distances between consecutive lanterns.\n\n    But wait: what if the lanterns are not contiguous? The gaps condition is sufficient because if the gaps are covered, then the entire street from 0 to l is covered (because we have the left end, then each gap, then the right end). \n\n    However, note: the gaps condition does not require that the entire gap is covered by the two adjacent lanterns. It requires that the two lanterns together (each providing d) cover the gap. The condition is that the right lantern's left coverage (a[i+1]-d) must not leave a gap from the left lantern's right coverage (a[i]+d). So we require a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d.\n\n    Therefore, we can use the above.\n\n    But wait: the problem says \"The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 1e-9\". We are doing floating point arithmetic, so we must be cautious.\n\n    However, we can also use a different approach: we can compute the necessary d by considering the entire coverage.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think: \n        Let d be the required value. Then the entire street [0, l] is covered if:\n            - The first lantern covers from 0 to a0+d (so we require a0+d >= 0? Actually, 0 is already nonnegative, but we require that the leftmost point 0 is covered: so we require that the first lantern's coverage (a0-d) is not necessary because we are only concerned with the positive direction? Actually, the lantern at a0 covers [a0-d, a0+d]. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 <= a0+d. Since a0>=0, the condition is that 0 <= a0+d (which is always true) and a0-d <= 0, i.e., d>=a0.\n\n        Similarly, for the last lantern: we require a[-1]+d >= l? Actually, the condition is that l is in [a[-1]-d, a[-1]+d]. Since l>=a[-1] (because the street goes from 0 to l and a[-1] is at most l), we require a[-1]+d >= l -> d>=l - a[-1].\n\n        For two consecutive lanterns at a[i] and a[i+1]: the coverage from the left lantern must extend to at least a[i+1] and the coverage from the right lantern must extend to at least a[i]. But note: we require that there is no gap. The left lantern covers up to a[i]+d, and the right lantern covers from a[i+1]-d. We require that a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d, i.e., d>= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n            d1 = a[0]   (to cover the left end)\n            d2 = l - a[-1] (to cover the right end)\n            d3 = (max_gap)/2, where max_gap is the maximum difference between consecutive lanterns.\n\n    However, note: the condition for the gaps is not just the maximum gap, but each gap must be covered. But if we set d to be at least (max_gap)/2, then every gap is covered because (max_gap)/2 is the largest required for any gap.\n\n    Therefore, the code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If there are no lanterns (n==0) then we cannot cover, but n>=1 per input.\n\n        # Check for edge: if n==0, but input says n>=1, so we ignore.\n\n        # Consider the case when n==1 separately? Actually, the above formula works for n==1: \n        #   Then we have two candidates: a0 and (l - a0). The gaps part is skipped (since range(0,0) is empty). Then we take the maximum of a0 and (l-a0). That is correct.\n\n        # But note: the condition for the left end is a0, and for the right end is l - a0. The gaps condition is absent (so we don't consider any gap). That matches.\n\n        # Now, let's write the code accordingly.\n\n        # Step 1: sort the list\n        a.sort()\n\n        # Initialize the answer to 0.0\n        # But we'll compute the three types.\n\n        # Case 1: left end\n        #   d1 = a[0]   (if a[0] is 0, then d1=0, which is okay)\n        # Case 2: right end\n        #   d2 = l - a[-1]\n\n        # Case 3: gaps\n        d_gap = 0.0\n        if n > 1:\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                # The required d for this gap is gap/2, but we are going to take the maximum required d from any gap.\n                if gap > 2 * d_gap:   # but we are going to use the maximum gap, so we can track the maximum gap.\n                    d_gap = gap / 2.0\n        else:\n            d_gap = 0.0\n\n        # But wait, the above for gaps: we are updating d_gap to the maximum gap/2. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        # Actually, we can do:\n        #   d_gap = 0.0\n        #   for i in range(n-1):\n        #       gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        #       if gap/2.0 > d_gap:\n        #           d_gap = gap/2.0\n\n        # Or even simpler: compute the maximum gap and then divide by 2.\n\n        # However, we can combine:\n\n        # Let's restructure to avoid nested condition:\n\n        candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]\n        if n > 1:\n            max_gap = 0.0\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                if gap > max_gap:\n                    max_gap = gap\n            candidates.append(max_gap / 2.0)\n\n        ans = max(candidates)\n\n        # Print the answer with 10 decimal places.\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    But wait, the example: [0, 15] (n=2, l=15, lanterns at 0 and 15)\n        Then:\n            left end: 0\n            right end: 0\n            gap: (15-0)=15 -> 15/2 = 7.5\n            ans = 7.5\n\n        However, with d=7.5, the first lantern (at 0) covers [-7.5, 7.5] -> so from 0 to 7.5, and the second lantern (at 15) covers [7.5, 22.5] -> so the entire street [0,15] is covered.\n\n        But is 7.5 the minimum? Yes, because the gap between 0 and 15 is 15, and the two lanterns must meet in the middle: each must extend 7.5 to the right and left respectively.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the entire street is from 0 to l (15). The first lantern at 0 must cover from 0 to 7.5, and the second at 15 must cover from 7.5 to 15. So the meeting point is 7.5. Therefore, 7.5 is the minimum.\n\n    But wait, the example input was: \n        Input: '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' -> output 2.5\n        Our code for that example:\n\n        n=7, l=15\n        a = sorted([15,5,3,7,9,14,0]) = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n        candidates:\n            left_end = 0\n            right_end = 15-15=0\n            gaps: \n                [3-0=3 -> 3/2=1.5, 5-3=2->1, 7-5=2->1, 9-7=2->1, 14-9=5->2.5, 15-14=1->0.5] -> maximum gap is 5, so 5/2=2.5.\n\n            ans = max(0,0,2.5)=2.5 -> correct.\n\n    However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0'\n        Output: 2.5000000000\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: '2 5\\n2 5'\n        Output: 2.0000000000\n\n    But wait, in the second example, we computed:\n        left_end = 2\n        right_end = 0\n        gaps: [5-2=3 -> 3/2=1.5]\n        ans = max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> correct.\n\n    Another example: n=1, l=10, a=[5]\n        left_end = 5\n        right_end = 5\n        gaps: none -> so candidates = [5,5] -> ans=5.0\n\n        Indeed, the lantern must cover from 0 to 10: \n            The distance from 5 to 0 is 5, and from 5 to 10 is 5. So d must be at least 5.\n\n    But wait, what if we have n=0? The problem says n>=1, so we don't worry.\n\n    However, what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street because they are too sparse? Our method accounts for the gaps.\n\n    One more: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]\n        left_end = 0\n        right_end = 0\n        gaps: [5-0=5 -> 2.5, 10-5=5 -> 2.5] -> max_gap=5, so d_gap=2.5\n        ans = 2.5\n\n        Check: \n            With d=2.5, the first lantern covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> [0,2.5] (since negative doesn't matter, and we are only concerned with [0,10]).\n            The second lantern covers [2.5, 7.5]\n            The third lantern covers [7.5,12.5] -> so [7.5,10] is covered.\n\n        The entire [0,10] is covered.\n\n    But note: the condition for the left end is 0, which is satisfied (first lantern covers 0). The condition for the right end is 0 (last lantern covers 10). The gaps are covered by the two adjacent lanterns.\n\n    However, note: the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, so the two lanterns must meet: the first lantern extends 2.5 to the right (covering up to 2.5) and the second lantern extends 2.5 to the left (covering from 2.5). Similarly for the second and third.\n\n    Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        Read n and l.\n        Read the list of n integers and sort.\n        Compute:\n            candidate1 = a[0]   # to cover from 0 to the first lantern\n            candidate2 = l - a[-1] # to cover from the last lantern to l\n            candidate3 = 0.0\n            if n > 1:\n                max_gap = 0.0\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                    if gap > max_gap:\n                        max_gap = gap\n                candidate3 = max_gap / 2.0\n\n        Then answer = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n        Format and print.\n\n    However, note: the condition for the gaps is not just the maximum gap? Actually, we must consider every gap. But if we set d to be at least the maximum gap/2, then every gap is covered because the maximum gap is the hardest to cover. So candidate3 must be at least the maximum gap/2.\n\n    Alternatively, we can compute candidate3 by taking the maximum over all gaps of (gap/2). But note: we only need to cover the largest gap, because if we set d to the maximum gap/2, then every smaller gap will be covered (since the two lanterns in a smaller gap are closer, so the same d will cover them). \n\n    However, wait: the condition for a particular gap is that d must be at least (gap)/2. So if we set d to the maximum gap/2, then every gap i satisfies d >= (gap_i)/2, so every gap is covered.\n\n    Therefore, we can compute:\n\n        candidate3 = 0.0\n        if n > 1:\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                # We are looking for the minimal d that covers the entire street. The gaps condition requires that for every gap i, d >= gap_i/2. Therefore, d must be at least the maximum over i of (gap_i/2).\n                if gap/2.0 > candidate3:\n                    candidate3 = gap/2.0\n\n    But note: the above for-loop is equivalent to:\n\n        candidate3 = max( (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.0 for i in range(n-1) )   if n>1, else 0.0\n\n    However, we can also combine:\n\n        candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]\n        if n > 1:\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                # We are effectively storing the maximum gap/2 in candidate3, but we can also consider that the gaps condition requires d to be at least the maximum gap/2, so we can compute candidate3 as the maximum gap/2.\n                # But we are building a list of candidates and then taking the max. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            candidates.append(max(a[i+1]-a[i] for i in range(n-1)) / 2.0)\n\n    But note: the maximum gap is the maximum of (a[i+1]-a[i]) for i in range(n-1). Then we divide by 2.\n\n    However, the above code for candidate3 using a for-loop is clear.\n\n    Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n    One more corner: if the street is of length 0? But l>=1.\n\n    Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If n==0, but n>=1, so we assume n>=1.\n\n        # Candidate from left end\n        candidate_left = a[0]\n        candidate_right = l - a[-1]\n\n        # Candidate from gaps\n        candidate_gap = 0.0\n        if n > 1:\n            max_gap = 0.0\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                if gap > max_gap:\n                    max_gap = gap\n            candidate_gap = max_gap / 2.0\n\n        # But wait, what if n==1? Then we don't have any gaps, but we still have candidate_left and candidate_right.\n\n        # Now, the answer is the maximum of candidate_left, candidate_right, candidate_gap (if n>1, else candidate_gap remains 0, but then we take max of candidate_left and candidate_right, which is correct).\n\n        ans = max(candidate_left, candidate_right, candidate_gap)\n\n        # However, if n==1, candidate_gap is 0.0, and then we take max(candidate_left, candidate_right, 0). But that is correct because the gaps condition is not present, and the left and right conditions are the only ones.\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    But wait: in the case n==1, we are including candidate_gap=0.0, which is safe because the left and right conditions are the only ones that matter.\n\n    However, note: the condition for the gaps is not present, but we don't need to consider gaps. The gaps candidate is 0.0, and then we take the maximum of the left and right conditions. So it's correct.\n\n    But wait, what if the entire street is covered by a single lantern? Then the left and right conditions are the same as the gaps condition? No, the gaps condition is 0, but the left and right conditions are the distances from the single lantern to the ends. So the answer is the maximum of those two.\n\n    Example: n=1, l=10, a=[5] -> candidate_left=5, candidate_right=5, candidate_gap=0 -> ans=5.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    However, there is an alternative view: the gaps condition for n==1 is not defined, so we should not include candidate_gap. But including 0.0 is harmless because 0.0 is less than or equal to the left and right conditions.\n\n    But wait, what if the lantern is at 0? Then candidate_left=0, candidate_right=10-0=10, candidate_gap=0 -> ans=10. Correct.\n\n    What if the lantern is at l? Then candidate_left=l, candidate_right=0, candidate_gap=0 -> ans=l. Correct.\n\n    What if the lantern is at 0 and l? Then n=2, a=[0,10], l=10. Then candidate_left=0, candidate_right=0, candidate_gap=(10-0)/2=5 -> ans=5. Correct.\n\n    Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        candidate_left = a[0]\n        candidate_right = l - a[-1]\n        candidate_gap = 0.0\n\n        if n > 1:\n            max_gap = 0.0\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                if gap > max_gap:\n                    max_gap = gap\n            candidate_gap = max_gap / 2.0\n\n        ans = max(candidate_left, candidate_right, candidate_gap)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    However, wait: the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0, so d>=a[0]. Similarly, the condition for the right end is d>=l - a[-1]. And the gaps condition is d>=max_gap/2. Therefore, we must satisfy all conditions, so d must be at least the maximum of these three.\n\n    But note: the gaps condition is independent and might be the most restrictive.\n\n    This matches.\n\n    However, there is a potential issue: what if the street is already fully covered by the lanterns without the gaps condition being the maximum? Our method takes the maximum of the three, which is correct.\n\n    Let's test with an example that has a very large left end and a small gap:\n\n        n=3, l=100, a=[90,91,100]\n\n        Conditions:\n            left_end = 90   (distance from 0 to 90)\n            right_end = 0\n            gaps: [91-90=1 -> 0.5, 100-91=9 -> 4.5]\n            candidate_gap = 4.5\n\n            ans = max(90,0,4.5) = 90.0\n\n        Check: with d=90, the first lantern (at 90) covers [0,180] (from 90-90=0 to 90+90=180). Then the entire street [0,100] is covered. Also, the gaps are covered because 90+90=180 which is beyond 91 and 100. But note, the condition for the left end is 90, so d must be at least 90. The gaps condition requires 4.5, which is less than 90. So 90 is the minimum.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n    But wait, consider the following: what if the lanterns are at the ends and the gap is large, but the left and right conditions are zero? \n\n        n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]\n\n        candidate_left = 0\n        candidate_right = 0\n        candidate_gap = (10-0)/2 = 5.0\n\n        ans = 5.0\n\n    Correct.\n\n    One more: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 2, 10]\n\n        candidate_left = 0\n        candidate_right = 0\n        gaps: [2-0=2 -> 1.0, 10-2=8 -> 4.0] -> candidate_gap=4.0\n        ans=4.0\n\n        Check: with d=4.0, \n            first lantern at 0: [-4,4] -> covers [0,4] (and beyond, but we only care until 10)\n            second lantern at 2: [-2,6] -> covers [0,6] (from 0 to 6)\n            third lantern at 10: [6,14] -> covers [6,10]\n\n        The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n    However, note: the gap between 0 and 2 is 2, and 4.0 is greater than 1.0 (the requirement for that gap) so it's covered. The gap between 2 and 10 is 8, and 4.0 is the requirement (exactly). So 4.0 is the minimum.\n\n    But wait: could we do with less? \n        Condition for the gap between 2 and 10: we require d>= (10-2)/2 = 4.0. So no.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the lanterns can be located at the same point. Then the gap is 0, and the condition is 0, so no problem.\n\n    Example: n=3, l=10, a=[5,5,10]\n        candidate_left = 5\n        candidate_right = 0\n        gaps: [5-5=0 -> 0, 10-5=5 -> 2.5] -> candidate_gap=2.5\n        ans = max(5,0,2.5)=5.0\n\n        Check: with d=5.0, the first lantern (at 5) covers [0,10] (from 0 to 10) so the entire street is covered.\n\n    But note: the condition for the left end is 5, so d must be at least 5. The gaps condition requires 2.5, which is less. So 5 is the minimum.\n\n    Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        candidate_left = a[0]\n        candidate_right = l - a[-1]\n        candidate_gap = 0.0\n        if n > 1:\n            max_gap = 0.0\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                if gap > max_gap:\n                    max_gap = gap\n            candidate_gap = max_gap / 2.0\n\n        ans = max(candidate_left, candidate_right, candidate_gap)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    However, wait: the problem states that the street is from 0 to l. The condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0, so the distance from the first lantern to 0 is a[0]. But what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then yes, the distance is a[0]. However, what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the condition is 0, which is acceptable.\n\n    This code is ready.\n\n    But note: the problem constraints say that the lanterns may be located at the ends, so we don't need to adjust.\n\n    Let me run the sample inputs:\n\n        Input: \"7 15\\n15 ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at specific points along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to cover the entire street from point 0 to point `l` using the minimal possible light radius `d`. The solution involves checking three main conditions:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the start of the street (point 0). The required `d` here is the distance from the first lantern to point 0.\n   - **Right End Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the end of the street (point `l`). The required `d` here is the distance from the last lantern to point `l`.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: Consecutive lanterns must be close enough so that their combined coverage bridges any gaps between them. The required `d` for each gap between consecutive lanterns is half the distance between them. The largest such value across all gaps dictates the minimal `d` needed for gap coverage.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to easily access the first and last positions and to iterate through consecutive pairs.\n   - **Max Calculation**: The solution involves calculating the maximum value among the left end distance, right end distance, and the largest gap/2 between consecutive lanterns. This ensures all segments of the street are covered.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the list of lantern positions takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of lanterns. The subsequent iteration to find the maximum gap is O(n). Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, O(n log n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    candidate_left = a[0]\n    candidate_right = l - a[-1]\n    candidate_gap = 0.0\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        max_gap = 0.0\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            if gap > max_gap:\n                max_gap = gap\n        candidate_gap = max_gap / 2.0\n        \n    ans = max(candidate_left, candidate_right, candidate_gap)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the list of lantern positions `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate processing the leftmost and rightmost positions and to check consecutive gaps.\n3. **Initial Candidates**: The initial candidates for the minimal `d` are set based on the left end (distance from the first lantern to point 0) and the right end (distance from the last lantern to point `l`).\n4. **Gap Calculation**: If there are multiple lanterns, the largest gap between consecutive lanterns is found. The required `d` to cover this gap is half the gap size.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal `d` is the maximum value among the left end distance, right end distance, and the largest gap/2. This ensures all parts of the street are illuminated.\n6. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine the minimal light radius required to illuminate the entire street, leveraging sorting and linear scans for optimal performance.",
