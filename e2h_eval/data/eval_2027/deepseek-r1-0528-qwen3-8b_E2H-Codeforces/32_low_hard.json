    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element from the array will remove either the minimum or the maximum (or somewhere in between) and then the instability is the new max minus the new min.\n\n However, note: the instability is defined as max - min of the remaining array. We are allowed to remove exactly one element.\n\n Observation:\n  After removal, the array has n-1 elements.\n\n  The instability of the resulting array can be thought of as:\n    Option 1: Remove an occurrence of the current minimum (if there are multiple, we can choose one). Then the new min might remain the same (if there's another minimum) or become the next smallest.\n    Similarly, Option 2: Remove an occurrence of the current maximum.\n\n  But note: we might also consider removing an element that is neither the min nor the max, but the goal is to minimize the instability.\n\n  However, note that the overall range of the array is determined by the min and max. Removing an element that is not the min or max does not change the min and max? Not necessarily: if we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min or the max, then the min or max changes.\n\n  Actually, the key is: the instability of the array after removal is the difference between the new maximum and the new minimum.\n\n  Let the original array be sorted: b[0] <= b[1] <= ... <= b[n-1]\n\n  Then the original min is b[0] and the original max is b[n-1].\n\n  Now, if we remove one element, we have two possibilities for the new min and max:\n\n  Possibility 1: The new min is still b[0] (if we didn't remove the first element) and the new max is b[n-1] (if we didn't remove the last element). But wait, if we remove an element from the middle, the min and max might stay the same.\n\n  However, note: the min is the smallest value. So if we remove one element, the min can only change if we remove the only occurrence of the smallest value? Actually, no: if there are duplicates, then removing one occurrence of the min doesn't change the min. Similarly for the max.\n\n  Therefore, we must consider:\n\n  Case 1: Remove an element that is the global minimum (if it appears at least once). Then the new min is the next smallest value (which is the first value that is greater than the old min). Similarly, if we remove the global maximum, the new max is the previous largest value.\n\n  But note: we can remove any element. So the idea is:\n\n  Let the sorted array be `b`.\n\n  Then, for each element in the array (each removal candidate), we can compute the instability of the remaining array. However, n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot try every element (O(n) per candidate would be O(n^2)).\n\n  Instead, we can consider:\n\n  The instability after removing an element at index i (in the sorted array) is:\n    If we remove an element, then the new array is the sorted array without the element at position i.\n\n    Then the new min = \n        if i==0, then the next smallest is b[1] (if n>1, otherwise empty which is not our case)\n        else, if i>0, then the min is still b[0] (because we removed one element that is not the smallest, unless the smallest is duplicated and we remove one copy, but then the min remains b[0] because there's still a b[0])\n\n    Similarly, the new max is:\n        if i==n-1, then the next largest is b[n-2]\n        else, the max remains b[n-1]\n\n  However, wait: what if we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min? Then the new min becomes the next smallest. Similarly for the max.\n\n  Actually, the above reasoning holds if we consider that the array may have duplicates. But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. The instability is defined as the max minus min of the entire remaining array.\n\n  Alternate approach:\n\n  Since the array is sorted, the instability after removal is:\n\n      candidate_instability(i) = max( \n          [b[k] for k in range(n) if k != i] \n      ) - min( \n          [b[k] for k in range(n) if k != i] \n      )\n\n  But note: the entire array is sorted, so the min of the remaining array is:\n      if we remove an element that is not the first element, then the min is still b[0] (unless we remove the first occurrence of the min and there are no more min? But wait: if the array is sorted, then all the min values are contiguous at the beginning. So if",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the new maximum and minimum after removing any element.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: If the array has only two elements, removing either will result in a single-element array with zero instability.\n3. **General Case**: For arrays with more than two elements, consider removing each possible candidate (from the sorted array) and compute the resulting instability. The candidates for removal are:\n   - The first element (smallest).\n   - The last element (largest).\n   - Elements between the smallest and largest that could potentially reduce the instability when removed.\n4. **Efficiency**: By sorting the array, we can directly access the smallest and largest elements. For middle elements, the instability after removal is determined by the range between the smallest element and the next largest element (or vice versa), which can be computed in constant time for each candidate.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    arr.sort()\n    min_val = arr[0]\n    max_val = arr[-1]\n    best = float('inf')\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            current_min = arr[1] if n > 1 else float('inf')\n            current_max = max_val\n            instability = current_max - current_min\n            if instability < best:\n                best = instability\n        elif i == n-1:\n            current_min = min_val\n            current_max = arr[-2] if n > 1 else float('-inf')\n            instability = current_max - current_min\n            if instability < best:\n                best = instability\n        else:\n            current_min = min_val\n            current_max = max_val\n            instability = current_max - current_min\n            if instability < best:\n                best = instability\n            # But note: we are not considering all middle elements? Actually, the instability for any middle element removal is the same as the original instability if the min and max remain unchanged.\n            # However, wait: what if the element we remove is the only occurrence of the min or max? Then the min or max changes. But our sorted array has duplicates handled naturally because min and max are taken from the entire array.\n            # Actually, the above approach is incorrect for the middle elements. We must consider that removing an element might change the min or max if it's the only occurrence. But in a sorted array, duplicates are adjacent. So if we remove an element that is not the first or last, the min remains the first element (if there are duplicates of the min) or the first non-duplicate if we remove the last occurrence of the min.

However, in a sorted array, duplicates are adjacent, so removing a middle element doesn't affect the min or max if they are duplicated.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum instability encountered during the iteration is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only the boundary elements and leverages sorting for optimal performance.
