Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of old candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour.\n   - When a candle burns out, it becomes a leftover. Also, when we use a candle, we can think of it as two parts: burning and then being recycled.\n   - Vasily can take 'b' burned candles to make a new one.\n\n Let's break down:\n   - We start by lighting up all the candles we have (both initial and those made from leftovers).\n   - We can model the process in cycles.\n\n Steps:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   While current_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += current_candles   # because we use all current candles for burning\n        Then, these current_candles will become leftovers (so we add them to the leftover count)\n        Now, we can form new_candles = leftover // b\n        Then, update leftover = leftover % b\n        Then, set current_candles = new_candles\n\n However, note that the example: \n        Input: \"4 2\"\n        Hours: \n            Start with 4 -> burn 4 hours, then we have 4 leftovers.\n            Then, from 4 leftovers, we can make 4//2 = 2 new candles, so burn 2 more hours -> total 6 so far.\n            Then, from the 2 burned candles (which are part of the leftovers from the second round) we have now 2+ (leftover from previous step was 4%2=0) but wait, we just used the 4 leftovers to make 2 candles, so now we have 2 candles and no leftovers? Actually, the leftovers from the first burning are 4, then we use 4 to make 2. Then we burn the 2, and then we have 2 burned (which are added to the leftover) and then we use those 2 to make 1 more candle.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think of the process as:\n\n        Hour 1: light 4 candles -> 4 hours, and get 4 leftovers.\n        Then, with 4 leftovers, we can make 4//2 = 2 new candles. So we have 2 candles to burn (in the next hours).\n        Then, we burn 2 candles -> 2 more hours, total 6, and we get 2 more leftovers. Now total leftovers is 0 (from previous step) + 2 = 2.\n        Then, with 2 leftovers, we can make 2//2 = 1 new candle. Burn 1 candle -> 1 more hour, total 7, and we get 1 leftover.\n        Then, we cannot make a new candle from 1 (because 1 < 2), so we stop.\n\n        So the answer is 7.\n\n        How to code?\n\n        We can do:\n\n        hours = 0\n        candles = a\n        left = 0\n\n        while candles > 0:\n            hours += candles   # we burn all current candles\n            left += candles     # these candles become leftovers after burning\n            # Now, from the leftovers, we can make new_candles = left // b\n            # And the remaining leftovers is left % b\n            new_candles = left // b\n            left = left % b\n            candles = new_candles\n\n        Then print(hours)\n\n        But let's simulate with (4,2):\n\n        Step1: candles=4, left=0\n            hours = 0+4 = 4\n            left = 0+4 = 4\n            new_candles = 4//2 = 2, left = 4%2=0 -> candles becomes 2\n\n        Step2: candles=2, left=0 (from previous step, but note: we didn't reset left, we accumulated)\n            hours = 4+2 = 6\n            left = 0+2 = 2\n            new_candles = 2//2=1, left=0 -> candles becomes 1\n\n        Step3: candles=1, left=0\n            hours = 6+1 = 7\n            left = 0+1 = 1\n            new_candles = 1//2=0, left=1 -> candles becomes 0 -> loop ends.\n\n        This gives 7. \n\n        Now the second example: \"6 3\"\n\n        Step1: candles=6, left=0\n            hours=6\n            left=6\n            new_candles=6//3=2, left=6%3=0 -> candles=2\n\n        Step2: candles=2, left=0\n            hours=8\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and recycling the leftover burned candles into new ones until it's no longer possible to form new candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of initial candles (`a`) and the number of burned candles required to make a new one (`b`).\n2. **Simulate Burning Process**: \n   - For each iteration, add the current number of candles to the total hours (since each candle burns for one hour).\n   - Update the leftover burned candles by adding the current candles (as they burn out after being used).\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made from the leftovers (leftover divided by `b`), and update the leftover count accordingly.\n   - Set the current candles to the newly formed candles for the next iteration.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are candles left to burn. Once no more candles can be formed or burned, the loop exits, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem by iteratively processing each batch of candles, converting leftovers into new candles, and summing the hours until no more candles remain.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    current_candles = a\n    leftover = 0\n    \n    while current_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += current_candles\n        leftover += current_candles\n        new_candles = leftover // b\n        leftover = leftover % b\n        current_candles = new_candles\n        \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed to make a new one).\n- **Loop**: The loop runs as long as there are candles to burn (`current_candles > 0`). In each iteration:\n  - **Total Hours Calculation**: The current number of candles is added to `total_hours` since each burns for one hour.\n  - **Leftover Update**: After burning, these candles become leftovers, which are added to the existing leftovers.\n  - **New Candles Calculation**: The leftovers are divided by `b` to determine how many new candles can be made. The remainder becomes the new leftover count.\n- **Termination**: When no more candles can be formed (i.e., `current_candles` becomes zero), the loop exits, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
