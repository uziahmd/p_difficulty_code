Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (each between 1 and 10) so we can use combinatorial methods.\n\n The problem is to check if there exists a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection) between R rebels (spaceships) and B bases such that:\n   - Each base gets one spaceship and each spaceship gets one base.\n   - The straight lines connecting the matched pairs do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" (from a base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect. Since there are R+B points, and we are drawing R+B/2 lines (if R=B) or |R-B| unmatched? Actually, we have exactly R bases? Wait, no: we have R rebels and B bases. We need to assign R rebels to B bases? But the problem states: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So actually, we require a bijection only if R == B? Or if R != B then it's impossible?\n\n Let me re-read: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This implies that the assignment must be a bijection. Therefore, we must have R = B. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\n However, the example input: \n      Input: ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n The first example has R=3, B=3 -> Yes. The second example has R=2, B=1 -> No.\n\n So the condition for existence of a perfect matching (bijection) is that R must equal B. If not, output 'No'.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\", so the matching must be from R to B and cover all. Thus, R must equal B.\n\n However, the example input format: the first line is two integers R, B. Then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n\n 2. Now we have R = B. We need to assign each rebel (point) to a base (point) with non-intersecting straight lines.\n\n How to check non-intersecting?\n\n Note: The problem does not require the matching to be in any particular order. However, the condition is that the straight lines (paths) do not intersect.\n\n Observation: In the plane, two line segments (from base i to rebel j, and from base k to rebel l) intersect if and only if the four points are in general position (no three collinear) and the two segments are crossing. But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning any two drawn connections.\n\n However, note: the entire set of points is given and no three are collinear. So we can use standard computational geometry for non-intersecting matching.\n\n But note: the problem is small (R,B <= 10). We can try to use a recursive backtracking (with permutations) but 10! is about 3.6e6 which is acceptable in Python for worst-case? However, worst-case 10! is 3628800, which might be borderline in Python if we do it naively (but 10 is the maximum and 10! is acceptable for a competition problem in many cases, especially since the constraints are low).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a known fact: In an even number of points (here 2*R points), the condition for non-intersecting matching is equivalent to the existence of a planar matching. However, note: we are allowed to choose any matching. \n\n Another idea: use the following property: if we sort the points (say, by x-coordinate) then the matching that connects the smallest x to the next smallest x, then next, etc. (like matching consecutive points) might not be the only one, but we can also consider the possibility of non-crossing matchings.\n\n However, note: we have two sets: rebels and bases. The problem does not specify which set is which. But the condition is that we are matching a set of R points (rebels) to a set of B=R points (bases). We are free to assign arbitrarily.\n\n We can consider the entire set of 2R points (R rebels and R bases). The condition is that the matching (a set of R edges) does not have any two edges cross.\n\n There is a known way: we can fix an order (like by x-coordinate) and then use the following:\n\n   Sort all 2R points by x, and then by y.\n\n   Then, we can use a greedy algorithm: for the first point (leftmost), connect it to the next available point (either base or rebel) in the set, but wait: we have two sets.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: we are allowed to assign any rebel to any base. We want to know if there is a matching (a bijection) such that the segments connecting the matched pairs do not cross.\n\n Standard approach for non-crossing matching in a set of points (when you are allowed to choose the matching) is to use the following:\n\n   - Sort the points by x (and for same x by y).\n   - Then, we can use a recursive function that considers the leftmost point and then two possibilities: either we connect it to the next available point (in the sorted order) or to the one just above or below? Actually, the classic non-crossing matching in a set of points (without color) is done by sorting and then ensuring that the matching is non-crossing by dynamic programming.\n\n However, here we have two sets: rebels and bases. But the problem does not require the points to be colored in the matching? Actually, the matching is between two distinct sets.\n\n We can combine the two sets and then require that the matching is non-crossing. But note: the problem does not specify that the two sets are distinguishable by color. However, the rebels and bases are distinct, so we must assign a rebel to a base.\n\n Idea: We can consider the entire set of 2R points (R rebels and R bases) and then we want to partition them into R pairs, where each pair consists of one rebel and one base, and the segments do not cross.\n\n But note: the condition for non-crossing is independent of the labels? Actually, no: because we must assign the rebels to bases, but the geometric condition is about the straight lines.\n\n However, the non-crossing condition is purely geometric.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If R != B, output 'No'.\n\n 2. If R == B, then we have 2R points. We need to assign each rebel to a base (so each rebel must be matched to one base, and vice versa) and the segments (edges) must not cross.\n\n How to check?\n\n We can try to use the following:\n\n   - Sort all points by x (and for same x by y). Then, we can use a recursive backtracking that matches the leftmost point (which is either a rebel or a base) to one of the available points (the other set) and then remove those two points and continue. However, we have two sets: we must ensure that we match rebels to bases.\n\n But note: the entire set has two types. We can label the points as two colors: say, 0 for rebels, 1 for bases.\n\n Then, we can use a bipartite matching in the graph where an edge exists between a rebel and a base if the segment connecting them does not cross any other segment in the matching. But wait: we don't know the matching in advance.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a known fact: the non-crossing matching in a set of points (with two colors) is possible if and only if the entire set can be matched without crossings. However, note that we have exactly R rebels and R bases.\n\n We can use the following algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Sort the points by x (and for same x by y) and label each point as rebel (0) or base (1).\n\n   Step 2: Use a recursive function that takes a list of points (with their labels) and tries to match the leftmost point (lowest x, and if tie lowest y) to one of the available points (the other color) such that the segment from the leftmost to the chosen point does not cross any other segment that will be drawn. However, this is difficult because we don't know the entire matching.\n\n But note: the non-crossing condition for the entire matching is that the matching is non-crossing. There is a well-known method to check for a non-crossing perfect matching in a set of points (with two colors) by sorting and then using a greedy matching that avoids crossing.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the matching to be drawn in a particular way. But the condition is that the straight lines (the segments) do not intersect.\n\n Another idea: use the complete bipartite graph between rebels and bases, and then remove edges that would cause a crossing when used in a matching. But how to determine which edges cause crossing?\n\n Consider: two edges (a,b) and (c,d) (where a and c are rebels, b and d are bases) cross if and only if the two segments (a-b) and (c-d) intersect. But note: the entire matching must be non-crossing. However, we are matching all points, so if we choose a matching that is non-crossing, then no two edges should cross.\n\n But the problem is: we are allowed to choose any matching. So we are looking for a perfect matching (a complete matching in the bipartite graph) that is non-crossing.\n\n How to check for non-crossing in a bipartite matching?\n\n We can use the following: \n\n   - Consider the set of rebels and bases. We can plot them in the plane.\n\n   - The non-crossing condition for two edges (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) is that they do not intersect. \n\n   - We can precompute the intersections for every pair of edges. But then we have to check that the chosen matching does not have any crossing.\n\n However, the problem is that the matching is a set of edges, and we have to check that none of the edges cross.\n\n We can use backtracking (permutation) and check for each candidate matching whether the set of edges is non-crossing.\n\n Steps for backtracking:\n\n   - We have R rebels and R bases.\n\n   - We can represent the rebels and bases as two lists.\n\n   - We'll generate all permutations of the bases (which is R! possibilities). Then, for a permutation p (which assigns the i-th rebel to the p[i]-th base), we check:\n\n        For every pair of edges (i, p[i]) and (j, p[j]) (with i < j), check if the segment from rebel_i to base_p[i] and the segment from rebel_j to base_p[j] intersect.\n\n   - If we find one permutation for which none of the edges intersect, output 'Yes'. Otherwise, after trying all, output 'No'.\n\n But note: the condition for two segments to intersect: \n\n        Two segments (A-B) and (C-D) (with A, B, C, D being points) intersect if and only if the points are interleaved: \n\n        (A.x < C.x and C.x < B.x and A.y < C.y and C.y < B.y) ... wait, that is one condition (for axis-aligned rectangles) but we are in general.\n\n        Actually, we can use the standard method: check orientation.\n\n        We can use the cross product to check if two segments intersect. However, note: the problem says no three points are collinear, so we don't have degenerate cases.\n\n        There is a standard method: two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect if and only if:\n\n          (p1, q1, p2) are counterclockwise and (p1, q1, q2) are clockwise, OR\n          (p1, q1, q2) are counterclockwise and (p1, q1, p2) are clockwise.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          orient(a, b, c) = (b.x - a.x)*(c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y)*(c.x - a.x)\n\n        Then, the segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect if:\n\n          orient(a, b, c) * orient(a, b, d) < 0 and\n          orient(c, d, a) * orient(c, d, b) < 0\n\n        However, note: the segments are defined by two endpoints, and we are checking for proper intersection (not just one endpoint inside the other segment, but a proper crossing). Also, the problem states that no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about degenerate cases.\n\n        But note: we have to check for every pair of edges (i, j) (i < j) in the matching.\n\n        However, in our backtracking, we are considering a full matching. So we have to check every pair of edges in the matching.\n\n        But note: if two edges (from the matching) share a common point, they don't cross (they meet at an endpoint). The problem says \"paths\" (from base to spaceship) and we assume that endpoints can touch? Actually, the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\". Typically, at endpoints they are allowed to meet. So we only care about proper intersections (crossings) in the interior.\n\n        Therefore, when checking two edges (a,b) and (c,d): we require that they do not share an endpoint and that they cross.\n\n        However, in our matching, each edge is from a rebel to a base. The rebels and bases are distinct. So the two edges (a,b) and (c,d) use four distinct points. So we don't have to worry about sharing an endpoint.\n\n        But wait: what if the same point appears twice? No, because we have distinct points.\n\n        So the condition for two edges (a,b) and (c,d) to intersect is:\n\n          orient(a, b, c) * orient(a, b, d) < 0 and orient(c, d, a) * orient(c, d, b) < 0\n\n        Actually, the standard method is to check:\n\n          o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n          o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n          o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n          o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n\n          Then, the segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect if o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0.\n\n        However, note: sometimes one of these conditions is not necessary because the other already implies the crossing? Actually, the two conditions are independent. But let me recall: the standard method for checking segment intersection is:\n\n          def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n              # Check if segments ab and cd intersect\n              def orient(o, a, b):\n                  return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n              o1 = orient(a, c, d)\n              o2 = orient(b, c, d)\n              o3 = orient(c, a, b)\n              o4 = orient(d, a, b)\n\n              if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                  return True\n              # Additionally, check if one of the endpoints lies on the other segment? \n              # But the problem says no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about endpoints lying on the segment (unless the segment is degenerate, which it isn't). So we can skip that part.\n\n          However, note: the above condition is standard and works for non-collinear points.\n\n        But wait: the standard method for checking two segments in the plane is:\n\n          (a,b) and (c,d) intersect if and only if one of the following is true:\n\n            (i) General case: the two segments straddle each other.\n\n          The cross product method above (using the two orientations) is standard.\n\n        However, note: the condition is that the two segments intersect if and only if the two points c and d lie on opposite sides of the line AB, and the two points a and b lie on opposite sides of the line CD.\n\n        So the condition is:\n\n          (orient(A, B, C) * orient(A, B, D) < 0) and (orient(C, D, A) * orient(C, D, B) < 0)\n\n        But note: the order of the points in the orientation function matters. The function `orient` returns a positive value for counterclockwise, negative for clockwise, and zero for collinear.\n\n        However, we can define:\n\n          def orient(a, b, c):\n              return (b[0]-a[0])*(c[1]-a[1]) - (b[1]-a[1])*(c[0]-a[0])\n\n        Then, the condition is:\n\n          if orient(a, b, c) * orient(a, b, d) < 0 and orient(c, d, a) * orient(c, d, b) < 0:\n              return True\n\n        But note: the entire set of points is given and no three are collinear, so we don't get zeros.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the matching has R edges, and we are checking every unordered pair of edges (i, j) (i < j). \n\n        Since R is at most 10, the number of pairs is C(10,2)=45, and we have R! (which is 3628800) permutations. Then for each permutation we do 45 checks, and each check requires 4 orientation calculations (each orientation is a few multiplications). \n\n        The total operations: 3628800 * 45 * 4 = about 656,999,999, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline in speed.\n\n        However, note: worst-case R=10, and 10! is 3628800, and 3628800 * 45 is about 163 million, and each check does 4 orientations (each orientation is 2 multiplications and some subtractions). This is acceptable in Pyton if we code carefully and use local variables.\n\n        But note: the input points are integers, and we are only doing integer arithmetic.\n\n        However, we can optimize by precomputing the orientations for all pairs? But that might be too heavy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a smarter way: sort the points and use a convex hull? But note: the non-crossing condition is global.\n\n        Another idea: use the fact that the matching must be non-crossing. We can use the following:\n\n          Sort the rebels and bases by x (and then y) and then use a greedy matching: match the leftmost rebel to the leftmost base? Not necessarily.\n\n        But note: the non-crossing matching in a set of two-colored points (with equal numbers) is known to be equivalent to the matching that is non-crossing in the sorted order. However, we have two sets.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Sort all 2R points by x (and then by y). Then, we can use a DP that goes from left to right and decides which base to match to the current rebel (or base) but wait, we have two sets.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n          We are going to assign rebels to bases. We can consider the entire set of 2R points and require that the matching is non-crossing. There is a known result that the non-crossing matching is unique (up to the order) if we fix the outermost points? Not exactly.\n\n        However, note: the problem is small. We'll do the backtracking over permutations.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Read R and B. They must be equal.\n\n          Then read R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n          Create two lists: \n            rebels = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]\n            bases = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]\n\n          Then, we are going to iterate over all permutations of the bases (of length R) and check if the matching (assigning rebels[i] to bases_permuted[i]) forms a set of non-crossing edges.\n\n          To check non-crossing for a matching (which is a set of edges E):\n\n            For every pair of edges (i, j) (with i < j) in the matching, check if the two edges (rebel_i, base_j) and (rebel_j, base_i) [wait, no: in our matching, we have edge from rebel_i to base_perm[i] and rebel_j to base_perm[j]].\n\n            Actually, the matching is: \n                edge0: (rebel0, base_perm[0])\n                edge1: (rebel1, base_perm[1])\n                ...\n\n            Then, for two edges (edge_i and edge_j) we check if they cross.\n\n          We need to write a helper function: `segments_intersect(a, b, c, d)` that returns True if the segments (a->b) and (c->d) intersect (properly, i.e., not at endpoints) and False otherwise.\n\n          However, note: in our matching, the edges are from rebels to bases, and the rebels and bases are distinct, so the four points are distinct.\n\n          But wait: what if the two edges share a common point? Then we have two edges that are incident to the same point. That is allowed (they meet at the endpoint). However, note: in our matching, each rebel and base is used exactly once. So the two edges (edge_i and edge_j) are between two different rebels and two different bases. Therefore, the four points are distinct.\n\n          So we can check:\n\n            if segments_intersect( (rebel_i, base_perm[i]), (rebel_j, base_perm[j]) ) returns True, then this matching is invalid.\n\n          Then, if we find one matching that has no crossing, we break and output 'Yes'. Otherwise, we try the next permutation.\n\n        But note: the matching is defined by the permutation: we are matching the i-th rebel (in the original order) to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\n        However, we are not forced to keep the original order of the rebels. We could also consider the rebels sorted by x. But note: the problem does not specify an order. The condition is about the geometric arrangement.\n\n        Important: The condition for non-crossing is independent of the labeling. However, we must assign the rebels to bases arbitrarily.\n\n        But note: the rebels and bases are given as two separate sets. We must use the given coordinates.\n\n        However, the backtracking we are doing (over permutations of bases) is fixed: we are matching the rebels in the order they are given to the bases in the permutation. But what if we change the order of the rebels? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require to preserve the order of the rebels. We can also permute the rebels? \n\n        But note: the problem does not specify an order for the rebels. We are free to assign any rebel to any base.\n\n        However, the condition for non-crossing is geometric. The matching is a set of edges. The edges are undirected in terms of non-crossing? Actually, we are drawing directed edges from base to rebel? The problem says \"from a base to its assigned spaceship\", so the direction is base to rebel. But the segment is the same.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify the direction. The condition is about the straight path (so the segment is undirected).\n\n        However, the matching is a bijection from rebels to bases, so we can fix the rebels in a particular order (for instance, by their x-coordinate) and then try to assign bases to them.\n\n        But wait: what if we don't fix the order of the rebels? Then we are effectively considering all bijections. But the condition for non-crossing depends on the geometric positions.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the order of the rebels. We can sort the rebels by x (and then y) to reduce the symmetry.\n\n        Actually, we can fix the order of the rebels arbitrarily. Let us sort the rebels by x (and then y). Then, we consider all permutations of bases (which is R! again). But note: the non-crossing condition is independent of the labeling of the rebels? \n\n        However, the condition is: the entire set of edges (which are the matching) must not cross. The labeling of the rebels and bases does not matter, but the coordinates do.\n\n        But note: if we sort the rebels, then we are effectively fixing the order of the rebels. Then, we are checking: is there a permutation of the bases (matching the sorted rebels to the bases) such that the matching is non-crossing.\n\n        However, the problem does not require the rebels to be in any particular order. But note: the condition for non-crossing is geometric and the rebels are fixed in the plane.\n\n        Therefore, we can sort the rebels (and leave the bases unsorted) and then consider permutations of bases. This is valid because we are allowed to assign any base to any rebel.\n\n        But wait: is sorting the rebels arbitrary? Actually, the matching is a set of edges, and the non-crossing condition is symmetric. However, we can also sort the bases by x and then consider the matching as a permutation of the sorted bases. But note: the problem does not require the bases to be sorted either.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Read R and B (must be equal).\n          Step 2: Read the rebels and bases.\n\n          Step 3: Sort the rebels by x (and then by y) to have a fixed order.\n\n          Step 4: Generate all permutations of bases (which is R! permutations).\n\n          Step 5: For each permutation, form a matching: the i-th rebel (in sorted order) is matched to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\n          Step 6: Check for the matching: for every pair of edges (i, j) (with i < j) in the matching, check if the two edges (from sorted_rebels[i] to base_perm[i] and sorted_rebels[j] to base_perm[j]) intersect.\n\n          Step 7: If we find one matching without crossing, output 'Yes' and break.\n\n          Step 8: If none found, output 'No'.\n\n        Why is this valid? Because the condition for non-crossing is geometric and independent of the labeling. By sorting the rebels, we are just fixing an order for the rebels. The bases are then assigned arbitrarily. And we are checking all possible assignments.\n\n        However, note: we are not considering all possible matchings? Actually, we are: because a matching is a bijection from rebels to bases. By sorting the rebels, we are fixing the order of the rebels, and then we assign the bases in a permutation. This covers all bijections.\n\n        Example: \n            Rebels: [A, B, C] (after sorting: A, B, C)\n            Bases: [X, Y, Z]\n\n            Then, the permutation [X, Y, Z] means: A->X, B->Y, C->Z.\n            The permutation [X, Z, Y] means: A->X, B->Z, C->Y.\n\n            And so on.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Implementation details:\n\n          We need to define the `segments_intersect(a, b, c, d)` function.\n\n          How to compute orientation?\n\n          Let me define:\n\n            def orient(a, b, c):\n                # Returns the cross product value: (bx - ax)*(cy - ay) - (by - ay)*(cx - ax)\n                ax, ay = a\n                bx, by = b\n                cx, cy = c\n                return (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)\n\n          Then, two segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect if:\n\n            o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n            o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n            o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n            o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n\n            if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n\n        However, note: the segments are defined by two endpoints, and the condition above is sufficient.\n\n        But wait: what if one of the orientations is zero? According to the problem, no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Let's test with two segments that cross.\n\n        Example: \n            Segment 1: from (0,0) to (2,2)\n            Segment 2: from (0,2) to (2,0)\n\n        For segment1 and segment2:\n\n            o1 = orient((0,0),(2,2),(0,2)) = (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 2*2 - 2*0 = 4\n            o2 = orient((0,0),(2,2),(2,0)) = (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) = 0 - 4 = -4\n            o1 * o2 = 4 * (-4) = -16 < 0 -> first condition holds.\n\n            o3 = orient((0,2),(2,0),(0,0)) = (2-0)*(0-2) - (0-2)*(0-0) = 2*(-2) - (-2)*0 = -4\n            o4 = orient((0,2),(2,0),(2,2)) = (2-0)*(2-2) - (0-2)*(2-0) = 0 - (-2)*2 = 4\n            o3 * o4 = (-4)*4 = -16 < 0 -> second condition holds.\n\n            So returns True.\n\n        Example: two segments that do not cross.\n\n            Segment1: (0,0) to (0,2)\n            Segment2: (0,1) to (1,1)\n\n            Check segment1 and segment2:\n\n            o1 = orient((0,0),(0,2),(0,1)) = (0-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 0 - 0 = 0 -> but wait, three points are collinear? The problem says no three points are collinear. So we don't have to consider this.\n\n        Therefore, we assume no three points are collinear.\n\n        Code structure:\n\n          import itertools\n\n          def main():\n              data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n              if not data: \n                  print(\"No\")\n                  return\n\n              # Parse first two integers: R and B\n              r = int(data[0]);

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between R Rebel spaceships and B bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assigning bases to spaceships and verifying if any permutation results in non-intersecting segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a bijection (perfect matching) between R spaceships and B bases where no two connecting segments intersect. Given that R and B must be equal for a perfect matching to exist, we first check if R equals B. If not, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n\n2. **Geometric Intersection Check**: For each possible permutation of base assignments to spaceships, we need to ensure that no two segments cross. This involves using the cross product to determine the orientation of points and checking if the segments intersect based on their orientations.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a backtracking approach where we generate all permutations of base assignments to the sorted list of spaceships. For each permutation, we check all pairs of segments to see if they intersect. If any permutation satisfies the non-intersecting condition, we return \"Yes\"; otherwise, after checking all permutations, we return \"No\".\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's complexity is dominated by generating all permutations of bases (R! permutations) and checking each permutation against all pairs of segments (O(R^2) checks per permutation). Given R ≤ 10, the maximum number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800, which is manageable for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    def orient(o, p1, p2):\n        ox, oy = o\n        px, py = p1\n        qx, qy = p2\n        return (qx - ox) * (py - oy) - (qy - oy) * (px - ox)\n    \n    o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n    \n    return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    r = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    if r != b:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    rebels = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(r):\n        x = int(data[index])\n        y = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for i in range(b):\n        x = int(data[index])\n        y = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    rebels_sorted = sorted(rebels, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))\n    \n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        edges = [(rebels_sorted[i], perm[i]) for i in range(r)]\n        valid = True\n        n = len(edges)\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                a, b = edges[i]\n                c, d = edges[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print('Yes' if found else 'No')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Initial Check**: If R and B are not equal, the solution immediately outputs \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Sorting Spaceships**: The spaceships are sorted by their x and y coordinates to establish a fixed order for permutation generation.\n4. **Permutation Generation**: All permutations of base assignments are generated. For each permutation, the algorithm checks if the segments connecting spaceships to their assigned bases intersect.\n5. **Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the cross product to determine if two segments cross by checking the orientation of their endpoints.\n6. **Result Determination**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting segments, the solution outputs \"Yes\"; otherwise, after all permutations are checked, it outputs \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments while leveraging geometric properties to ensure correctness.",
