The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given a number of test cases. For each test case, an integer `n` (from 1 to 10^18) is provided.\n\n We need to determine if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that a snowflake graph with `n` vertices can be constructed.\n\n The snowflake construction:\n   Step 0: Start with one vertex (the center).\n   Step 1: Add k new vertices connected to the center (so now we have 1 + k vertices).\n   Then, at each subsequent step, every vertex that currently has degree 1 (i.e., leaf nodes) will be connected to k new vertices.\n\n However, note that the problem says:\n   \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n But note: the example for k=4 is the smallest possible, meaning we do the first expansion (step 1) and then the second expansion (step 2) at least.\n\n However, reading the problem again: \n   - Initially: 1 vertex.\n   - Then, the center is connected to k new ones (so now we have 1 + k).\n   - Then, the condition says: each vertex with degree 1 (which are the k leaves) must be expanded (each gets k new neighbors). \n\n But wait: when we expand a leaf, we are connecting k new vertices to it. However, note that in the next step, the center node still has degree k (not 1) so it doesn't get expanded again? Actually, the rule says: \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) get expanded.\n\n So the process is:\n\n   Level 0: 1 node (center)\n   Level 1: k nodes attached to the center -> total nodes = 1 + k\n   Level 2: each of the k leaves from level1 adds k new nodes -> total nodes = 1 + k + k*k\n   Level 3: each leaf from level2 (which are k*k nodes) adds k new nodes -> total nodes = 1 + k + k*k + k*k*k\n\n In general, after `m` expansions (with m>=1 meaning we do the initial expansion and at least one expansion for the leaves, but note the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we must have at least two steps: step1 and step2? Actually, the problem says: \"Then, ... This step should be done at least once.\" and the step is \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" and this step is done at least once. \n\n But note: the first expansion (from the center) is separate. The problem says:\n   Rule 1: Start with one vertex.\n   Rule 2: Then, the center is connected to k new ones (this is the first expansion, and note k>1).\n   Rule 3: Then, \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (the leaves) is expanded (at least once). \n\n So actually, the entire process must have at least two expansions: the first expansion (from the center) and then at least one expansion from the leaves.\n\n Therefore, the minimal snowflake (for a given k) has at least two layers (levels 0,1,2) and the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we stop at two layers. We can have more layers. So the general formula for a snowflake with `m` layers (where m>=2) is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m\n\n However, note that the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\" (meaning the leaf expansion step is done at least once). So the minimal number of layers is 2 (from the center, then one expansion of the leaves). But we can have more.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the snowflake as having a central node and then layers. The total number of nodes is:\n\n   n = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... )   [but wait, that would be a star-like expansion?]\n\n Actually, the expansion is done per leaf. Each leaf at layer i is replaced by a star of k edges (so adding k-1 new nodes? Actually, no: the leaf already exists, and we add k new nodes connected to it. So the leaf becomes a node of degree k+1 (one edge to the parent and k edges to children). \n\n But the total number of nodes is:\n\n   Layer0: 1\n   Layer1: k\n   Layer2: k * (k-1) ? No, because the rule says: each leaf (from the previous layer) is connected to k new nodes. However, note: the center was not a leaf in the first expansion? Actually, after the first expansion, the center has degree k and the leaves have degree 1.\n\n Then, when we expand a leaf (at layer1), we add k new nodes. But note: the leaf originally had one edge (to the center) and then we add k edges from that leaf to k new nodes. So the leaf now has degree k+1, and the new nodes are leaves (degree 1). \n\n Then, the next expansion (if we do one more) would take each leaf from layer2 (which are k*k nodes) and add k new nodes for each.\n\n So the total number of nodes is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m\n\n for some m>=2 (because we must do the leaf expansion at least once, so at least two layers beyond the center? Actually, the center is layer0, then layer1 is the first expansion, and layer2 is the second expansion (leaf expansion). So we require m>=2.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the leaf expansion step (which is the same as the rule for adding new vertices) is performed at least once. That means we have at least two layers (layer0, layer1, and layer2). But wait, the center is layer0, then the first expansion (from center) is layer1, and the second expansion (from the leaves of layer1) is layer2. So the minimal n is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the maximum layers, so we can have any number of layers (m>=2).\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the existence of a snowflake with exactly n vertices for some k>1 and some m>=2.\n\n Therefore, we are looking for an integer k>1 and an integer m>=2 such that:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m\n\n The sum of the geometric series:\n\n   S(m) = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n So we require:\n\n   (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1) = n\n\n Since k>1 and m>=2, we have:\n\n   Let t = m+1, then t>=3 (because m>=2) and we have:\n\n        n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)\n\n How to check for a given n?\n\n Note: n can be as large as 10^18, and t (the exponent) is at least 3 and can be very large (but note k>=2, so even for k=2, the exponents grow quickly: 2^60 is about 1e18, so t is at most around 60 for k=2). However, k can be very large too (but note that if k is large, then even for t=3, k^3 must be <= n, so k <= n**(1/3)).\n\n We cannot iterate over all k and t because n is up to 10^18.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Notice that the equation:\n\n        n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)\n\n can be rewritten as:\n\n        n*(k-1) = k^t - 1\n\n Rearranged:\n\n        k^t = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n Now, note that t>=3 and k>=2.\n\n However, we can also consider breaking down the problem:\n\n Case 1: n < 7 -> then NO. Why?\n   Minimal n is for k=2 and m=2: n = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\n   Let's check the minimal values:\n     k=2, m=2: n = 7\n     k=3, m=2: n = 1+3+9 = 13\n\n   But wait, what about m=3 for k=2? n = 15 (1+2+4+8) -> 15.\n\n   Actually, the minimal n is 7.\n\n   Therefore, for n<7, we output \"NO\".\n\n Case 2: n >= 7.\n\n We need to check if there exists integers k>=2 and t>=3 such that:\n\n        n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)\n\n But note: the problem also allows different k for different n? And we are only asked if there exists ANY k>1 (and any m>=2) for which the equation holds.\n\n Another observation: we can fix the exponent t (the number of terms, or the power) and then solve for k.\n\n However, note: t is the exponent in k^t, and t>=3.\n\n But note: the expression (k^t - 1)/(k-1) is the sum of the geometric series. We can also consider that the series has t terms (from k^0 to k^(t-1)), so actually:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(t-1) = (k^t - 1)/(k-1)\n\n So t is the number of terms (which is the layer index m+1, but note: the original problem's m is the number of expansions, so the last term is k^m, and the exponent is m+1). Actually, the equation above uses t as the exponent (so the highest power is t, and we have t terms: from k^0 to k^(t-1)).\n\n But wait, in our derivation we set t = m+1, so the highest power is k^m, and we have m+1 terms. However, the equation is written as:\n\n        n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)\n\n with t = m+1.\n\n However, the problem requires m>=2, so t>=3.\n\n So we can iterate over t from 3 up to a limit. What is the maximum t? Since k>=2, then:\n\n        n = (k^t - 1)/(k-1) >= (2^t - 1)/1\n\n        => 2^t - 1 <= n\n\n        => t <= log2(n+1)\n\n Since n<=10^18, then t_max is about floor(log2(10^18)) + 1, which is about 60.\n\n So we can iterate t from 3 to about 60 (or 61) and for each t, try to find an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n        k^t = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n Rearranged:\n\n        k^t = n*k - n + 1\n\n        => k^t - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n This is a polynomial equation in k. Since k must be an integer>=2, we can try to solve for k by considering that k is roughly the t-th root of n (because k^t is about n*(k-1) and k-1 is about k for large k, so k^t ~ n*k => k^(t-1) ~ n).\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(t-1)\n\n        => n = k^t/(k-1) - 1/(k-1)   [almost, but not exactly] \n\n But note: we have an equation that is easier to check by iterating over t and then solving for k.\n\n Steps for a fixed t:\n\n        We know: n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        Then, k^t = n*(k-1) + 1.\n\n        We can rearrange to: k^t = n*k - n + 1.\n\n        We can also consider: k^t - n*k + (n-1) = 0.\n\n        Since k is an integer, we can try to solve for k by noting that k is the base and t is fixed. But note: k must be at least 2.\n\n        However, note: k^t grows very fast. So for fixed t, k is roughly the t-th root of n*k. We can use binary search for k? But n can be as large as 10^18, and t is small (up to 60) but k might be large.\n\n        Alternatively, we can solve for k by:\n\n          k^t = n*k - n + 1\n\n        => k^(t-1) = n - (n-1)/k\n\n        But this is not linear.\n\n        Since t is fixed and k must be an integer, we can rearrange to:\n\n          k^t - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        And note that k must divide (n-1) + something? Actually, from the equation:\n\n          k^t = n*k - (n-1)\n\n        => k divides (n-1) because k divides the left side and the right side is n*k - (n-1). But wait, k divides n*k, so k must divide (n-1) for the equation to hold? Not necessarily, because we are subtracting (n-1) and then the equation is k^t = n*k - (n-1). But note: the equation is not linear.\n\n        However, note: we can express k as a divisor of (n-1) + something? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n          k^t - 1 = n*(k-1)\n\n          => (k^t - 1) is divisible by (k-1) and equals n.\n\n        But we already know that.\n\n        Instead, we can consider: for fixed t, we can try to find k such that k^t is approximately n*k (since n is the sum, and for large k the dominant term is k^(t-1) because the sum is dominated by the last term). Actually, the last term k^(t-1) is about n, so k is about n^(1/(t-1)).\n\n        Actually, from the equation:\n\n          n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1) ≈ k^(t-1)   [since the sum of geometric series is dominated by the last term]\n\n        So k ≈ n^(1/(t-1))\n\n        Therefore, we can compute k0 = floor(n**(1/(t-1))) and then check a few integers around k0.\n\n        However, note: the equation is:\n\n          k^t = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n        We can iterate over k from, say, max(2, floor(n**(1/t)) ) to ...? But note: k^(t) must be about n*k, so k^(t-1) ≈ n. So k is about n**(1/(t-1)).\n\n        Steps for fixed t:\n\n          Let k_low = 2\n          Let k_high = None\n\n          Actually, we can set k_min = 2 and k_max = n (but n is huge). Instead, note that k must satisfy:\n\n          k^t = n*k - n + 1\n\n          => k^(t-1) = n - (n-1)/k\n\n          Since k>=2, then (n-1)/k < n/2, so k^(t-1) < n + 1.\n\n          Therefore, k < (n+1)**(1/(t-1)) + 1.\n\n        So we can set:\n\n          k_min = 2\n          k_max = int(round((n+1)**(1/(t-1)))) + 1   (but careful: rounding might be off, and also note that k must be integer)\n\n        However, we don't want to iterate from 2 to k_max because k_max might be large (for t=3, k_max ~ n**(1/2) which is about 10^9 for n=10^18, which is too many to iterate).\n\n        Alternative: we can use the fact that k must be an integer and solve:\n\n          k^t = n*k - n + 1\n\n        for k by checking the candidate k0 = floor(n**(1/(t-1))) and then check k0, k0-1, k0+1, etc.\n\n        But note: the equation is k^t = n*k - n + 1.\n\n        We can rearrange:\n\n          k^t - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        However, we can also consider: since k must divide (n-1) in some way? Actually, from the equation:\n\n          k^t ≡ 1 (mod k)   [because k^t mod k = 0, and then n*k - n + 1 mod k = (-n+1) mod k?] \n\n        Actually, modulo k:\n\n          k^t mod k = 0\n          n*k mod k = 0\n          n-1 mod k = ?\n\n        From the equation: k^t = n*k - n + 1, then:\n\n          n*k - n + 1 ≡ 0 (mod k)   =>  -n + 1 ≡ 0 (mod k)   => n ≡ 1 (mod k)\n\n        So k must divide (n-1). Therefore, k is a divisor of (n-1) (with k>=2) and k>=2.\n\n        This gives us a way to iterate over divisors of (n-1) for each t? But wait, t is fixed and we are iterating t from 3 to about 60, and n can be up to 10^18, so factoring n-1 (which is about 10^18) for each test case (and up to 10^4 test cases) is too expensive.\n\n        However, note: we are iterating t from 3 to 60, and for each t we are going to look for divisors of (n-1) that are at least 2 and satisfy the equation. But the equation is k^t = n*k - n + 1, and we have the condition that k divides (n-1). So we can factor (n-1) once for each test case, and then for each divisor k (>=2) of (n-1) and for each t from 3 to 60, check if:\n\n          (k^t - 1) // (k-1) == n\n\n        But note: the equation is:\n\n          n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        However, we must be cautious because (k^t - 1) might not be divisible by (k-1) if k==1, but k>=2 so it is.\n\n        But the problem: the number of divisors of (n-1) can be large (like hundreds or thousands) but 10^4 test cases, and each n-1 up to 10^18, and then for each divisor we iterate t from 3 to 60 (which is 58 iterations per divisor) and compute k^t (which is big numbers, but k is a divisor of n-1, so k <= n-1, and we are only doing 58 exponentiations per divisor, and the divisors are the factors of n-1). However, worst-case n-1 is a highly composite number and the number of divisors can be about O(sqrt(n)) which for n=10^18 is 10^9, which is too many.\n\n        So we need a better approach.\n\n        Let me reexamine: the equation k^t = n*k - n + 1, and we know k divides (n-1). Therefore, k is a divisor of (n-1). But note: n can be very large (10^18) and we are only allowed to do 10^4 test cases. Factorizing numbers up to 10^18 for each test case is not feasible (unless we use advanced factorization, which is too slow for 10^4 test cases).\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid iterating over divisors.\n\n        Alternative approach:\n\n        Since t is small (from 3 to 60) and n is fixed, we can use the following:\n\n        We know that k must be at least 2 and at most about n**(1/(t-1)). We can compute k0 = floor(n**(1/(t-1))) and then check a few integers around k0 (like k0-2, k0-1, k0, k0+1, k0+2) because the equation is very sensitive.\n\n        Why? Because from the equation:\n\n          n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1) ≈ k^(t-1)\n\n        So k is approximately n**(1/(t-1)).\n\n        Steps for fixed t:\n\n          Let k_approx = round(n**(1/(t-1)))   [but careful: exponentiation of float might lose precision for n=10^18 and t-1=59, but we can use logarithms?]\n\n        However, we can use:\n\n          k_min = max(2, floor(n**(1/(t-1))) - 2)\n          k_max = ceil(n**(1/(t-1))) + 2\n\n        Then iterate k from k_min to k_max and check if k^t == n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        But wait: k^t might be very large (even for k=2 and t=60, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is acceptable in Python for integers, but we have to do this for each t (60) and for each test case? And we have up to 10^4 test cases? Then 10^4 * 60 * (number of k candidates) which could be 10^4 * 60 * 5 = 3e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: the exponentiation k^t for k up to maybe 10^9 (if n=10^18 and t=3, then k_approx = (10^18)^(1/2)=10^9, and then we iterate from 10^9-2 to 10^9+2 -> 5 numbers, so that's acceptable for t=3. But for t=60, k_approx = (10^18)**(1/59) which is about 10^(18/59) ~ 10^(0.305) ~ around 2 (because 2^59 is about 5e17, which is less than 10^18, so k_approx might be about 2). So the range is small.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: for t=3, k_approx = n**(1/2) which is about 10^9, and then we do 5 exponentiations (each exponentiation for t=3 is just k*k*k, which is acceptable for k up to 10^9? The cube of 10^9 is 10^27, which is too big for integers? Actually, 10^27 is a very big integer and might be slow.\n\n        But note: n is given and we are only testing 5 values of k for each t. However, for t=3 and k=10^9, k^3 is 10^27, which is a very big integer. But we are only doing 5 * 60 = 300 such exponentiations per test case. But 10^4 test cases * 300 = 3e6 exponentiations, each with exponents up to 60 (so 60 multiplications) and base k which can be as large as 10^9. The total operations would be 3e6 * 60 = 180e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline? But note: the base k is about 10^9 for t=3, but for t>=4, the base k is much smaller (since k_approx = n**(1/(t-1)) and n=10^18, so for t=4: k_approx = 10^9, but wait: 10^9^3 = 10^27 which is too big. Actually, we are solving k^t = n*k - n + 1, and for k=10^9 and t=3, k^3 = 10^27, but n is 10^18, so n*k = 10^27, so 10^27 is about the same as k^3. Then we can compare without computing the full big integers? \n\n        However, we must compute k^t and n*k and then check if k^t == n*k - n + 1. But if k^t is too big, we might run into performance or memory issues.\n\n        We can use logarithms to check the orders of magnitude? But we need exact integer equality.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the equation:\n\n          k^t = n*k - n + 1\n\n        and check if k^t is too big. If k^t > n*k (which is n*k) then we can break early? But note: k^t might be equal to n*k - n + 1.\n\n        However, we are only checking a few k around k_approx, and k_approx is chosen so that k^t is about n*k (because k_approx = n**(1/(t-1)) and then k^t = (n**(1/(t-1)))^t = n^(t/(t-1)) = n^(1 + 1/(t-1)) = n * n**(1/(t-1)) which is about n * k_approx. But wait, that doesn't match: we are using k_approx = n**(1/(t-1)), so k_approx^(t) = n**(t/(t-1)) = n * n**(1/(t-1)) = n * k_approx, and the equation requires k^t = n*k - n + 1, so n*k is about n*k_approx = n * n**(1/(t-1)) = n^(t/(t-1)), which is greater than n (if t/(t-1)>1) and matches the growth.\n\n        But note: k_approx is chosen as the real number root, then we are testing integers around that. The exponentiation for k_approx (a float) is not exact, but we are testing integers.\n\n        However, the problem: for t=3 and k=10^9, we are computing (10^9)^3 which is 10^27, which is a big integer but Python can handle integers of arbitrary size (though it may be slower). But 10^27 is 1000 bits, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait, we have 10^4 test cases, and for each test case we iterate t from 3 to 60 (about 58 values) and for each t we try 5 values of k. So 10^4 * 58 * 5 = 2.9e6 exponentiations. Each exponentiation for exponent t (which is from 3 to 60) and base k (which can be as large as 10^9 for t=3, but for t>=4 the base k is much smaller because n**(1/(t-1)) for t=4 is (10^18)**(1/3) ~ 10^6, and for t=5: 10^18**(1/4) ~ 10^4.5, etc. \n\n        But the exponentiation for base k and exponent t: the maximum base we'll see is about 10^9 (for t=3) and exponent 3, so that's 10^27, which is acceptable? But we have 2.9e6 such exponentiations, and each exponentiation for base=10^9 and exponent=3 is one multiplication (k*k*k) of three numbers of 30 digits, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n        However, we must be cautious: for t=60, the base k_approx = n**(1/59) is about 2 (since 2^59 ~ 5e17, and 3^59 is astronomical). So for t=60, we are only testing k around 2, so the exponentiation is 2^60 which is about 1e18, which is acceptable.\n\n        The problem is for t=3: the base k can be up to 10^9, and we do 2.9e6 * (for t=3: 5 bases) and for each base we do 3 multiplications (for exponent 3). So the total number of multiplications for t=3 is 2.9e6 * 5 * 3 = 43.5e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: we are iterating t from 3 to 60, and for each t we do 5 exponentiations. The exponentiation for exponent t requires t-2 multiplications (using pow(base, t) is efficient because it uses exponentiation by squaring? Actually, the built-in pow with integers is efficient, but for base as large as 10^9 and exponent 60, we are doing about 60 multiplications? Actually, exponentiation by squaring does O(log(t)) multiplications, so for t=60, log2(60) is about 6, so 6 multiplications. \n\n        However, note: we are not using pow, we can use pow(k, t) which is efficient.\n\n        Steps for one test case:\n\n          if n < 7: return \"NO\"\n\n          Otherwise, for t in range(3, 61):   # t from 3 to 60 inclusive\n            k_approx = round(n**(1/(t-1)))   # but this might not be precise for large n\n\n          But wait: n is up to 10^18, and we are taking the (t-1)-th root. For t-1=2, we are taking square root of 10^18 which is 10^9, which is an integer. But for t-1=3, cube root of 10^18 is 10^6. But for non-integer exponents, the floating point might not represent it exactly.\n\n          Example: n=13, t=3: then k_approx = 13**(1/2) ~ 3.605, then we round to 4, then check k=2,3,4,5,6? \n\n          But note: we must check the equation: (k^t - 1) // (k-1) == n.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            k0 = int(round(n**(1/(t-1))))\n            Then check k0, k0-1, k0-2, k0+1, k0+2.\n\n          But we must avoid duplicates and ensure k>=2.\n\n        However, note: the equation k^t = n*k - n + 1 might hold for k that is not exactly the root? So we must check the integers around the real root.\n\n        But the function f(k) = (k^t - 1) / (k-1) is increasing for k>1, so there is at most one integer k that satisfies the equation for fixed t.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          For t from 3 to 60:\n            k_low = max(2, int(round(n**(1/(t-1)))) - 2)\n            k_high = int(round(n**(1/(t-1)))) + 2\n\n            Then iterate k from k_low to k_high, and check if k^t == n*k - n + 1.\n\n            If found, then we break and output \"YES\".\n\n          If none found, then output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait: what if the equation holds for a k that is not near the approximation? Actually, the equation:\n\n          k^t = n*k - n + 1\n\n          => k^t / k = n - (n-1)/k   [not helpful]\n\n          But from the geometric series, we know that k is approximately the base of the series, and the series has t terms, so k^(t-1) is about the last term and the total n is about k^(t-1). Therefore, k is about n**(1/(t-1)).\n\n        However, there is a caveat: the equation is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(t-1)\n\n          The largest term is k^(t-1), so k^(t-1) <= n <= t * k^(t-1)\n\n          => k^(t-1) <= n <= t * k^(t-1)\n\n          => k <= n**(1/(t-1)) * t**(1/(t-1))\n\n        But we are using k_approx = n**(1/(t-1)), so we are covering the main part.\n\n        But note: the equation must hold exactly.\n\n        However, there is one more possibility: sometimes the equation might hold for two different t? But we break as soon as we find one.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"exists some k>1 and some m>=2\", so we only need one representation.\n\n        However, there is a special case: what if n is a perfect power and also fits the equation for multiple t? Then we break early.\n\n        But note: we are iterating t from 3 to 60. We might find the same k for two different t? Actually, no, because if k is fixed then the series is fixed and the value of t (number of terms) is fixed.\n\n        However, we are iterating t independently. But if we find one k and one t that satisfies, we output \"YES\".\n\n        But note: the equation for a fixed k and varying t: the value of n would be different. So no, we are checking for fixed t.\n\n        However, note: the equation is:\n\n          n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        For fixed k, the value of n is determined by t. And for fixed n, k must be the base.\n\n        But we are iterating t and then k. So if we find one (t,k) that works, we break.\n\n        But wait: what if n is 1? Then we skip because n>=7. But n=1: the minimal n is 7.\n\n        Example: n=13 -> YES (k=3, t=3: (3^3-1)/(3-1)=26/2=13)\n\n        n=15 -> YES (k=2, t=4: (2^4-1)/(2-1)=15)\n\n        n=7 -> YES (k=2, t=3: (2^3-1)/(2-1)=7)\n\n        n=8 -> NO? Let's check: \n          t=3: k_approx = 8**(1/2)=2.828 -> k=1 to 5 (but k>=2). Check k=2: (2^3-1)//1 = 7 !=8. k=3: (3^3-1)//2 = 26//2=13 !=8. k=4: (4^3-1)//3=63//3=21. k=1 not allowed. \n          t=4: k_approx=8**(1/3)=~2. Then check k=2: (2^4-1)//1=15 !=8. k=3: (3^4-1)//2=80//2=40. \n          t=5: k_approx=8**(1/4)=~1.68 -> k=2: (2^5-1)//1=31. \n          ... until t=60: no. So 8 is NO.\n\n        But wait, what about n=1? We skip because n<7. Similarly, n=2,3,4,5,6 -> NO.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that the snowflake must have at least two expansions (so at least three layers: center, layer1, layer2). Therefore, n must be at least 7.\n\n        But wait: the example input includes 1,2,3,6,13,15,255,10101,10000000",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a central vertex, followed by layers of vertices each connected to \\( k \\) new vertices, where \\( k > 1 \\). The construction must include at least two expansions (layers beyond the initial central vertex).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the total number of vertices \\( n \\) in the snowflake graph must satisfy the equation \\( n = \\frac{k^t - 1}{k - 1} \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\) and exponent \\( t \\geq 3 \\). This equation represents the sum of a geometric series with \\( t \\) terms.\n2. **Insight**: For each test case, we check if there exists any integer \\( k \\geq 2 \\) and \\( t \\geq 3 \\) such that the above equation holds. Given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we limit \\( t \\) to a maximum of 60 (since \\( 2^{60} \\) exceeds \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each \\( t \\) from 3 to 60, compute an approximate value of \\( k \\) as the \\( (t-1) \\)-th root of \\( n \\). Then, check integers around this approximation to see if they satisfy the equation \\( k^t = n \\cdot k - n + 1 \\).\n4. **Optimization**: By leveraging the geometric series property and limiting the search range for \\( k \\) around the computed approximation, we efficiently determine the existence of valid \\( (k, t) \\) pairs without exhaustive search.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t_cases = int(data[0])\n    out_lines = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(t_cases):\n        n_val = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        \n        if n_val < 7:\n            out_lines.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        for exp in range(3, 61):\n            try:\n                k_approx = n_val**(1/(exp-1))\n            except:\n                break\n                \n            start = max(2, int(k_approx) - 2)\n            end = int(k_approx) + 2\n            k_candidates = set()\n            for cand in range(start, end + 1):\n                if cand >= 2:\n                    k_candidates.add(cand)\n                    \n            for k in k_candidates:\n                try:\n                    lhs = pow(k, exp)\n                    rhs = n_val * k - n_val + 1\n                    if lhs == rhs:\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                except:\n                    continue\n                    \n            if found:\n                break\n                \n        out_lines.append(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n            \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: If \\( n \\) is less than 7, it immediately outputs \"NO\" since the smallest valid snowflake has 7 vertices.\n3. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible exponent \\( t \\) (from 3 to 60), the code calculates an approximate base \\( k \\) using the \\( (t-1) \\)-th root of \\( n \\).
