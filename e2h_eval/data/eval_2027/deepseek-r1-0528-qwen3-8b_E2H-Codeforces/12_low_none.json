The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are moving in a circular ring road (clockwise) with n houses.\n We start at house 1 and we have m tasks, each requiring to be at house a_i (the i-th task's house).\n Since the ringroad is circular and clockwise, we can only move clockwise. However, note that we can also consider the possibility of moving from a higher house to a lower one by going around the circle.\n\n But note: the problem says that initially Xenia is at house 1, and then she must complete tasks in order (so for task i, she must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i).\n\n The key observation: \n We are allowed to break down the journey from one task location to the next. Since we can only move clockwise, if we are at house x and need to go to house y, then:\n\n Option 1: If y >= x, then we can move directly: (y - x) steps.\n Option 2: If y < x, then we have to go from x to the end (n) and then wrap around from 1 to y: (n - x + y) steps.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to simulate every step, but to compute the minimum time to complete all tasks.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n and m.\n 2. Read the list of m integers (the task locations).\n\n We start at house 1. Then we go from task 0 to task 1, then task 1 to task 2, etc.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house\", so we don't need to move if the next task is in the same house.\n\n However, the tasks might not be given in sorted order (and they are not necessarily increasing). We must consider the circular nature.\n\n Approach:\n Let current = 1 (starting point)\n total_time = 0\n\n For each task location a in the list of tasks:\n   Let d = the distance from current to a (considering the circularity)\n\n   How to calculate the distance?\n     If a >= current: then distance = a - current\n     Else: distance = n - current + a\n\n   Then add this distance to total_time, and set current = a.\n\n But wait: is that correct? Let's test with the example.\n\n Example 1: Input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n   Start at 1.\n   First task: 3 -> since 3>=1: distance = 3-1 = 2. total_time=2, current=3.\n   Second task: 2 -> since 2<3: distance = 4-3+2 = 3. total_time=5, current=2.\n   Third task: 3 -> since 3>=2: distance = 3-2 = 1. total_time=6.\n\n   Output: 6 -> matches.\n\n Example 2: Input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n   n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n\n   Start at 1.\n   First task: 2 -> 2>=1: distance=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n   Second task: 3 -> 3>=2: distance=1, total_time=2, current=3.\n   Third task: 3 -> no movement, distance=0, total_time=2.\n\n   Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n However, wait: the example input was given as two examples, and the second example input is \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" and output is 2.\n\n But note: the example input string in the problem statement is provided as two separate strings: \n   ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n So the code should work for both.\n\n But note: what if we have a long list of tasks? We are doing a single pass, which is O(m), and m can be up to 10^5, which is acceptable.\n\n However, let me check the example where the tasks are not in the order of the circle.\n\n Example: n=5, tasks = [5, 1] (two tasks)\n   Start at 1.\n   First task: 5 -> 5>=1: distance=4, current=5, total_time=4.\n   Second task: 1 -> 1<5: distance=5-5+1 = 1, total_time=5.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: from 5 to 1: we have to go 5->1 (which is one step because the ring has 5 houses: 5->1 is one step? Actually, the ring is 1,2,3,4,5 and then back to ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks, given that she starts at house 1 and moves only clockwise along a circular ring road. The key insight is that moving from one house to another in a clockwise direction can be calculated by considering the direct distance or the wrap-around distance if the target house is behind her current position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by reading the input values, which include the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Tracking Position and Time**: Initialize the starting position as house 1 and the total time as 0.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each task location:\n   - If the task location is ahead of the current position (i.e., greater than or equal to the current house), the distance is simply the difference between the task location and the current position.\n   - If the task location is behind (i.e., less than the current house), the distance is calculated by moving from the current position to the end of the ring road and then wrapping around from the start to the task location.\n4. **Update Position and Time**: Add the calculated distance to the total time and update the current position to the task location.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += (a - current)\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current + a)\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for the number of houses `n` and tasks `m`, followed by the list of task locations.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location, the code checks if it is ahead of or behind the current position. If ahead, the distance is the difference between the task location and the current position. If behind, the distance is the sum of the remaining houses from the current position to the end of the ring and the houses from the start to the task location.\n- **Update and Output**: The calculated distance is added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the task location. After processing all tasks, the total time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ring road and ensures optimal performance with a linear pass through the tasks, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.",
