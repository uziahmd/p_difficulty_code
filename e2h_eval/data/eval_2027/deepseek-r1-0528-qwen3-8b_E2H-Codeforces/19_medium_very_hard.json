The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an undirected tree with n nodes (districts) and n-1 edges. The fan count for a district i is 2^i (so higher districts have more fans). We need to remove k districts (so we keep n-k districts). Conditions:\n 1. The remaining districts must be connected (i.e., form a connected subgraph).\n 2. The total fan count (sum of 2^i for the remaining districts) should be maximized.\n\n Observation: Since 2^i grows exponentially, we prefer to keep districts with higher numbers (i.e., higher i) as long as we can form a connected subgraph.\n\n However, note that the problem requires removing exactly k districts, and the remaining must form a connected graph.\n\n Important: The entire original graph is a tree. The condition that the remaining districts form a connected graph means that they must form a connected subtree (since the original is a tree).\n\n Approach:\n We want to maximize the total fan count. Since 2^i is increasing with i, we would like to keep the largest (largest numbers) possible set of districts that forms a connected subgraph.\n\n But note: We cannot arbitrarily choose the largest numbers because connectivity must be maintained.\n\n Another observation: In a tree, if we want a connected subgraph (which is a tree itself) then the set of nodes must include all the nodes on the unique path between any two kept nodes. Therefore, the entire kept set must form a connected subtree.\n\n However, we are allowed to remove k nodes (so we keep n-k). We wish to maximize the sum of 2^i.\n\n Let's think greedily: We would like to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. But note: if we remove some low-numbered districts, we might break connectivity.\n\n Alternate approach: \n  - We know that the entire nation is a tree. We are going to remove k districts (and keep n-k). The kept set must be connected.\n\n What is the best connected set? Note: The fan value 2^i is so that higher i gives more value. So we want to keep the highest numbered districts.\n\n However, we cannot keep an arbitrary set of high-numbered districts because they must form a connected subtree.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the kept set must be connected. Therefore, it must be a subtree (in the tree) that includes a set of nodes.\n\n 2. We can consider: which connected subtrees of size (n-k) have the maximum sum? \n\n But note: n can be up to 10^6, so we cannot iterate over all subtrees.\n\n Insight: Since the fan value increases with the district number, we want to keep the largest (by district number) n-k districts. However, if these largest n-k districts do not form a connected subtree, we might have to drop some high ones and include some lower ones to maintain connectivity.\n\n However, note: the entire set of the largest n-k districts (by node label) may not be connected. \n\n How to check connectivity in a tree? We can use the concept of \"lowest common ancestor\" or simply by rooting the tree and then checking?\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: \n   We want to remove k districts. We can also think: we wish to keep the set S of n-k districts that has the maximum total fan value and is connected.\n\n Since the fan value is fixed per district, we wish to keep the highest-value districts (i.e., the highest-numbered ones). \n\n But note: the fan value is 2^i, so the highest-numbered district (n) is the most valuable, then n-1, etc.\n\n However, the problem does not require the kept set to be contiguous in the tree. It just needs to be connected.\n\n So, we wish to choose the n-k highest-numbered districts such that they form a connected subtree.\n\n But wait: what if the n-k highest-numbered districts are not connected? Then we have to remove some of them and include some lower ones to connect them. However, including a lower one might break our goal of maximizing the sum.\n\n Actually, we can reframe: We are going to remove k districts. We wish to remove the smallest set (in terms of fan value) that breaks the graph into components that don't contain too many high-value nodes? \n\n Alternatively, we can think: which nodes must be kept to connect the high-value nodes?\n\n Another idea: \n   Step 1: Consider the entire set of districts. We wish to remove k districts. The kept set must be connected.\n\n   We know that the connected kept set must include a set of nodes that forms a connected subgraph.\n\n   We want to maximize the sum. So we start from the highest-value nodes and try to keep as many as possible.\n\n   However, we must ensure that the kept set is connected.\n\n   We can use a two-step process:\n     a. Mark the top n-k districts (by their number) as initially kept, and the rest as removed.\n     b. Then, check if the kept set is connected. If it is, then we are done (we remove the other k districts).\n     c. Otherwise, we have to adjust: we need to add some low-value nodes (which we originally removed) and remove some high-value nodes (from the kept set) to maintain the count of n-k and connectivity.\n\n But note: we cannot exceed n-k kept nodes. So if the initial kept set (the top n-k) is not connected, we have to fix the connectivity by swapping some nodes: remove a high-value node (that we are keeping) and add a low-value node (that we are removing) to connect the disconnected components.\n\n However, we are only allowed to remove k nodes, and we are keeping exactly n-k. We started by keeping the top n-k. Then we have to make sure the kept set is connected.\n\n But how to fix? We can use a strategy similar to finding bridges or articulation points? Or use the following:\n\n   We can use a union-find or DFS to check connectivity of the kept set (the top n-k) in the original tree. But note: the kept set is defined by node labels (we keep the nodes with labels from (n-k+1) to n? Not exactly: the nodes are labeled 1 to n, but we want the top n-k by label, so we keep the nodes with the largest labels, i.e., the set {n-k+1, n-k+2, ..., n} }.\n\n However, wait: the nodes are labeled arbitrarily? Actually, the input doesn't specify that the districts are labeled in order of the tree structure. The labels are just identifiers. The fan value depends on the label: 2^label. So we care about the numeric label (not the position in the tree).\n\n But note: the input gives the edges. The labels are from 1 to n.\n\n Example: In the first sample, n=6, k=3 -> keep 3 districts. The top 3 by label: [4,5,6] (since 4>3>2>1). But the example output removes [1,3,4] so keeps [2,5,6]. Why is [2,5,6] chosen?\n\n Let's compute the fan value for the example:\n   Option1: [4,5,6]: 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 16+32+64 = 112.\n   Option2: [2,5,6]: 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4+32+64 = 100.\n\n Why is 112 not the answer? Because [4,5,6] is not connected. The original tree is:\n\n   Edges: [2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3]\n\n   The nodes 4,5,6: \n        4 is connected to 2, 5 is connected to 6, 6 is connected to 2. But 4 is not directly connected to 5 or 6 without going through 2. However, 2 is not kept. So we need to see if there's a path in the kept set [4,5,6]? \n        The kept set must form a connected graph. The edges that exist in the kept set: \n          Only edge 5-6 (if we consider the original edges, but note the entire graph is a tree. The kept set [4,5,6] uses the edges (4-2) is broken because 2 is removed, so we cannot use that edge. Similarly, (5-6) is kept. But 4 is not connected to 5 or 6 because the only connection from 4 is to 2 (removed) and from 5 to 6 and from 6 to 2 (removed). So [4,5,6] is not connected.\n\n Therefore, we cannot keep [4,5,6] because they are not connected.\n\n So the algorithm:\n\n  We wish to keep n-k districts (the highest by label) and if that set is connected, we output the removal list (the k smallest labels). Otherwise, we have to remove some high-value nodes and include some low-value nodes to connect the graph.\n\n How to fix?\n\n  We can consider: We start with the set of the n-k highest-labeled nodes. Then we check if they form a connected component in the original tree. If yes, we are done.\n\n  If not, then we have to merge the connected components (each being a maximal connected subgraph of the kept set). To merge two components, we must either:\n      - Add a node (from the removed set) that connects them, and then we can remove one of the high-value nodes (from the kept set) to maintain the total count (n-k). But note: we are only allowed to remove k nodes (so we keep n-k). We started by keeping the top n-k. Now we are going to replace some kept nodes (high-value) with removed nodes (low-value) until the kept set is connected.\n\n  However, note: when we add a node, we are effectively increasing the kept set beyond n-k? No, because we are replacing: we remove one kept node and add one removed node (so the total kept remains n-k).\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      Step 1: Keep the top n-k nodes (by label) and check if they form a connected component.\n\n      Step 2: If they are connected, then we output the removal set (all the nodes not in the top n-k, i.e., the k smallest labels).\n\n      Step 3: If they are not connected, then we have to fix the connectivity by replacing some high-value nodes (from the kept set) with low-value nodes (from the removed set) until the kept set becomes connected.\n\n  How to find the minimal set of replacements?\n\n  Note: We want to maximize the total fan value, so we want to remove as few high-value nodes as possible and add as few low-value nodes as possible. But we are forced to maintain connectivity.\n\n  Alternatively, we can think: what is the minimum number of low-value nodes we need to add (and hence remove high-value nodes) so that the kept set (now being the top n-k minus some and plus some) becomes connected?\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to remove exactly k nodes (so we keep exactly n-k). And we started by keeping the top n-k. Then we are going to swap s nodes (remove s high-value nodes and add s low-value nodes) until the kept set is connected. We wish to minimize the loss in fan value (or maximize the final sum) so we want to do as few swaps as necessary and swap the least valuable high-value nodes for the most valuable (in terms of fan value) low-value nodes? Actually, no: we want to keep the high-value nodes as much as possible.\n\n  But note: the fan value of a kept node is fixed. We are comparing: if we remove a high-value node (say with value 2^a) and add a low-value node (say with value 2^b), then the change is (2^b - 2^a). We want to minimize the decrease, so we want to remove the smallest possible high-value node and add the largest possible low-value node? \n\n  However, the problem requires to output the removed districts (the k districts). So if we start by keeping the top n-k, and then we swap some, then the removal set will be the k smallest labels and then we have to add back the ones we swapped out? Actually, no: the removal set is the set of k nodes we remove. Initially, we remove the k smallest. Then we decide to swap: meaning we remove one more (to add a node we didn't remove) but wait, no: we are allowed to remove exactly k. So we must end up with k removals.\n\n  Let me clarify:\n\n    Initially, we are going to remove the k smallest. But if that set of kept (the top n-k) is not connected, then we have to change some removals: we will remove some high-value nodes (which were originally kept) and instead remove some low-value nodes (which were originally not kept) and add the high-value nodes back? Actually, no: we are only allowed to remove k nodes. \n\n    We are starting with the set of kept nodes: T = {n-k+1, n-k+2, ..., n}. Then we find that T is not connected. We need to add some edges to connect T. How? By including some nodes from outside T (which are the nodes 1 to n-k). But including a node from outside T means we are effectively reducing the kept set from T to T without some nodes, and then adding the new node. But note: we are keeping exactly n-k nodes. So if we add a node from outside, we must remove one node from T.\n\n    The goal is to achieve connectivity with exactly n-k nodes, and we wish to maximize the total fan value.\n\n    We can use a greedy method: while the kept set is not connected, we look for the best swap: remove the smallest (in terms of fan value) node in T that is part of a disconnected component, and add the largest (in terms of fan value) node from the complement that can connect two components.\n\n    However, note: the entire graph is a tree. The kept set T is a set of nodes. The complement is the set R (the k smallest). We are allowed to swap one node from T with one node from R.\n\n    But how to determine which nodes to swap? We need to know which nodes in T are critical for connectivity? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n      We can build the induced subgraph of T and check the connected components. Then, we need to connect these components by adding nodes from R.\n\n      Each time we add a node from R, we can connect multiple components if that node is adjacent to nodes in multiple components. But note: we are swapping: we remove one node from T and add one node from R. So we are effectively replacing a node in T with a node in R.\n\n      We wish to maximize the total fan value. The change is: \n          delta = (value of added node) - (value of removed node)\n\n      We want to minimize the loss (maximize the change) so we want to remove a node with large value (so that we subtract a large number) and add a node with small value (so that we add a small number) -> this is bad. Alternatively, we want to remove a node with small value (so we subtract little) and add a node with large value (so we add a lot). But note: the added node is from R, which are the smallest labels, so they have small fan values. The removed node is from T, which are the largest, so they have large fan values. \n\n      Actually, we are forced to add a node from R (which has small fan value) and remove a node from T (which has large fan value). So the swap always decreases the total fan value. Therefore, we wish to do as few swaps as possible and swap the least valuable (i.e., smallest fan value) nodes from T and the most valuable (i.e., largest fan value) nodes from R.\n\n      But wait: the nodes in R are the smallest labels, so they have the smallest fan values (because 2^i is increasing with i). The nodes in T are the largest labels, so they have the largest fan values.\n\n      However, note: the fan value is 2^i, and i is the district number. The district numbers are from 1 to n. The set R (the k smallest) are the districts 1 to k. The set T (the n-k largest) are the districts n-k+1 to n.\n\n      Therefore, the smallest fan value in R is 2^1, and the largest fan value in R is 2^k. The smallest fan value in T is 2^(n-k+1) and the largest is 2^n.\n\n      When we swap, we remove a node from T (with value at least 2^(n-k+1)) and add a node from R (with value at most 2^k). Since n-k+1 >= k+1 (because n>=2k? not necessarily) but note: n-k+1 is the smallest in T and k is the largest in R. Since n>=k+1, and we are removing k nodes, then n-k+1 = n - (k-1) which is larger than k (if n>k, which it is). So 2^(n-k+1) > 2^k (because n-k+1 > k, since n >= 2k+1? Actually, we don't know the relation between n and k).\n\n      Example: n=6, k=3: then n-k+1 = 4, and k=3 -> 4>3, so indeed 2^4 > 2^3.\n\n      Therefore, swapping a node from T (at least 2^(n-k+1)) with a node from R (at most 2^k) will always decrease the total fan value. So we want to minimize the damage: remove the node in T with the smallest fan value (i.e., the smallest label in T, because fan value increases with label) and add the node in R with the largest fan value (i.e., the largest label in R, which is k).\n\n      However, we must also consider the connectivity: we can only swap nodes that help connecting the components.\n\n  Steps for swapping:\n\n      Step 1: Identify the connected components of the kept set T (initially the top n-k nodes).\n\n      Step 2: We wish to connect these components. We can use edges that go through nodes in R (the removed set). But note: we are allowed to use any edge in the original tree. However, to connect two components, we must use an edge that has one endpoint in one component and the other endpoint in another component or in R.\n\n      Actually, we are going to swap: remove one node from T and add one node from R. This swap can connect multiple components if the added node is adjacent to multiple components (via edges that go through nodes in T? Actually, the entire graph is the original tree, so the edges are fixed).\n\n      However, the induced subgraph of T is missing some edges. We can use edges that connect T to R and edges within R, but note: we are only swapping one node. After swapping, the new node (from R) will be present and can connect to its neighbors (which are in T or R). But we are removing one node from T, so we must consider the entire graph.\n\n      Alternatively, we can consider: we want to use a node from R that is adjacent to two different components of T (or even more). Then swapping that node (from R) for a node from T (the one that is blocking the connection? Actually, we don't remove the node from T that is adjacent to the R node, but we remove an arbitrary node from T. However, we can choose which node to remove.\n\n      Actually, we can choose which node from T to remove. We wish to remove a node that is not necessary for the connectivity and then add the R node that can connect two components.\n\n      How to choose the node from T to remove? We can remove a node that is in one of the components that is adjacent to the R node we are adding. But note: we are free to choose which T node to remove.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          For each node x in R (which we can potentially add), consider the effect: adding x would connect which components of T? Then we can remove a node y from T that is in the same component as x's neighbors (but actually, we remove y arbitrarily, and then the connectivity of T without y is already known). \n\n      However, note: we are going to swap: remove y and add x. Then the new set is T \\ {y} ∪ {x}. The connectivity of the new set depends on x and the removal of y.\n\n      We wish to connect the components. The node x will connect the components that are adjacent to x (through edges that are still present, i.e., edges from x to T). Then, after adding x, we break the set T \\ {y} by removing y. We must ensure that the entire set (T \\ {y} ∪ {x}) is connected.\n\n      This seems complicated.\n\n  Alternate Insight:\n\n      Since the entire graph is a tree, the kept set must be a connected subtree. The entire set of the top n-k nodes (by label) is not connected, so we need to connect them by including some lower nodes.\n\n      We can use the following idea: \n\n        We know that the set of kept nodes must form a connected subtree. Therefore, the kept set must include all the nodes on the unique paths between the high-value nodes.\n\n        However, we cannot include all the nodes because that would be too many (we can only keep n-k). Therefore, we must choose a connected subtree that contains as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\n        This is equivalent to: find a connected subtree of n-k nodes that maximizes the sum of 2^i.\n\n        We can use a dynamic programming on trees? But n up to 10^6.\n\n  Another Insight: \n\n      Since the fan value is exponential, the highest-value node is the most important. We must keep the highest-value node (node n) if we are to get the highest possible sum. Then, the second highest (node n-1) if possible, etc.\n\n      So we can use a greedy algorithm that starts from the highest node and then extends the tree by including adjacent nodes.\n\n      However, note: the connectivity condition.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        We know we must keep node n (the highest) because if we don't, then we can never get 2^n, and any alternative set that doesn't have n will have a maximum value of 2^(n-1) which is less than 2^n. Similarly, we would like to keep node n-1, etc.\n\n        But sometimes we cannot keep both n and n-1 if they are in different branches and we don't have enough nodes to connect them.\n\n      We can use a strategy:\n\n        Let T be the set of nodes we wish to keep. We start with T = {n, n-1, n-2, ..., n-k+1}. Then we check if T is connected. If not, we consider: what is the minimum number of swaps (removing one node from T and adding one node from the complement) to make T connected?\n\n        We can use a DSU-like method to find the connected components of T. Then, we need to connect these components. Each swap (adding a node from R) can connect multiple components if the added node is adjacent to multiple components.\n\n        How to choose the node from R to add? We want to connect as many components as possible. Then, we want to minimize the loss (swap the smallest fan value node from T, i.e., the smallest label in T, because fan value increases with label).\n\n        Algorithm for swapping:\n\n          Step 1: Build the induced subgraph of T and find connected components.\n\n          Step 2: For each node in R (the set of removed nodes, i.e., the k smallest), we can check how many components it connects. We can precompute for each node in R the set of components that are adjacent to it (via edges that go from the node to T). \n\n          However, note: the entire graph is a tree, so the edges incident to a node x in R are fixed. We can traverse the neighbors of x (in the original tree) that are in T. Then, the node x will connect all the components that are adjacent to these neighbors.\n\n          Step 3: We wish to choose a node x in R that connects the maximum number of components (so we reduce the number of components the most). Then, we remove the node in T with the smallest fan value (i.e., the smallest label in T) because we want to minimize the loss.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to do multiple swaps. We need to do swaps until the kept set is connected.\n\n          However, note: we are only allowed to remove k nodes (so we keep n-k). We started with T (n-k nodes) and we are going to swap s nodes (each swap: remove one from T and add one from R). The total kept remains n-k.\n\n          We wish to do as few swaps as possible. Each swap reduces the number of components by at most the number of components that the added node connects (minus one, because adding a node can connect multiple components into one). \n\n          We can simulate:\n\n            Let C0 be the initial number of components in T.\n\n            We wish to reduce the number of components to 1.\n\n            Each swap: we choose a node x in R that connects the current set of components (via its edges to T). Then, we remove a node y from T (which is not critical for the current connectivity? Actually, we are free to remove any node from T, but we want to minimize the fan value loss, so we remove the smallest fan value node in T).\n\n            However, note: when we remove a node, we break the set T further. But wait, we are swapping: we remove y and add x. So the set becomes T without y and with x.\n\n            The connectivity of the new set depends on x and the removal of y. But we are choosing y arbitrarily. We wish to choose y such that the connectivity of the new set is improved as much as possible.\n\n          Alternatively, we can consider: we are going to do a sequence of swaps. In each swap, we choose the node x in R that connects the most components (from the current state of T without the removed nodes so far). Then, we remove the node y in T that has the smallest fan value (i.e., the smallest label) and is not critical for the connectivity (but actually, we don't care about y's role in connectivity because we are removing it anyway).\n\n          However, we must ensure that the set T without y and with x is connected. But note: if we remove y, we might break connectivity. But we are swapping: we remove y and add x. The connectivity is determined by the entire set.\n\n          We can use a union-find for the induced subgraph of T. Then, for each node x in R, we can check the components of its neighbors (in T) and then the union-find would tell us how many components it connects.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Precomputation:\n              - Build the tree.\n              - Mark the set T (nodes from n-k+1 to n) and R (the others).\n\n            Step 1: Check if T is connected (using union-find or BFS on the induced subgraph). If connected, output R (the k smallest nodes).\n\n            Step 2: Otherwise, we need to do swaps.\n\n            We will maintain:\n              - A union-find structure for the current kept set (initially T).\n              - A set of the removed set R (the k smallest).\n\n            Then, we wish to perform a series of swaps (each swap: remove one node from T and add one node from R) until the kept set is connected.\n\n            But note: we are only allowed to remove k nodes. We started by removing the k smallest (so we kept T). Then we are going to swap: meaning we remove one more node from T and add one node from R? Actually, no: we are only allowed to remove k nodes in total. We started by removing k nodes (the smallest). Then we are going to change some removals: we will remove one less from the small ones and one more from the large ones. \n\n            Actually, the total removals is k. Initially, we have removed the k smallest. Then, we are going to remove one node from T (which was originally kept) and add back one node from R (which was originally removed) to the kept set. But note: we are not increasing the kept set. We are just changing which nodes are removed.\n\n            So the removal set is fixed in size (k). We are going to choose a set of k nodes to remove. We started with the set of the k smallest. Then we are going to swap one node (from the kept set) with one node (from the removed set) to fix the connectivity.\n\n            We wish to do as few swaps as possible (because each swap changes the removal set). But note: we are allowed to remove exactly k nodes, so we must end up with k removals.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              removal_set = set(range(1, n-k+1))   # the k smallest\n\n            Then, we wish to modify removal_set by swapping one node from removal_set with one node from kept_set (the top n-k) such that the connectivity of the kept_set without the swapped-out node and with the swapped-in node is improved.\n\n            But note: the kept_set is the complement of removal_set. Initially, kept_set = set(range(n-k+1, n+1))\n\n            We can do a while loop:\n\n              While the kept_set is not connected:\n\n                Find the node x in removal_set that, when added, would connect the most components (i.e., the node x that has the most neighbors in the current kept_set).\n\n                Then, remove the node y from kept_set that has the smallest fan value (i.e., the smallest label) and add x to kept_set (and remove x from removal_set).\n\n                Then, update the connectivity of kept_set.\n\n            But note: the kept_set changes, so we need to update the union-find structure.\n\n            However, the total number of swaps is at most k (which is up to 10^6) and each union-find operation is nearly O(1). But we have to consider: we are going to do at most k swaps, and for each swap we need to check every node in removal_set (which has k nodes) to find the one that connects the most components. That would be O(k^2) which is too slow for k up to 10^6.\n\n            We need a better way.\n\n            Instead, we can precompute for each node in R (the removal_set) the number of components it would connect (if we were to add it) in the current kept_set. Then, we choose the one that connects the most.\n\n            But note: the current kept_set is changing (as we remove nodes). So we need to update the neighbor information.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a priority queue for the nodes in R, where the key is the number of components they connect (initially computed for the full T). Then, as we remove nodes from T, the number of components that a node in R connects might change.\n\n            However, the connectivity of R nodes to T changes as T changes.\n\n            This seems very heavy.\n\n  Another Insight: \n\n      We know that the entire graph is a tree. There is a unique path between any two nodes.\n\n      We wish to keep the top n-k nodes (by label). If they are not connected, then we must connect them by adding nodes from R. The minimal set of nodes from R required to connect T is called a Steiner set.\n\n      But note: we are allowed to swap, so we are effectively looking for a connected subtree of n-k nodes that contains as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\n      We can use a technique: \n\n        We start from the highest node (n) and then include all the necessary nodes to connect the next highest, etc.\n\n        However, we wish to keep n-k nodes. \n\n      We can use a DFS/BFS that starts from the highest node and then extends to the next highest, but we are constrained by the count.\n\n  Known fact: In a tree, the minimum number of nodes needed to connect a set of nodes is the set of nodes that form a Steiner tree. But we are constrained by the count (n-k) and we wish to maximize the sum.\n\n  After reading the sample outputs and examples, note:\n\n      Example 1: n=6, k=3 -> removal set {1,3,4}. The kept set {2,5,6} is connected.\n\n      Example 2: ['8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5'], output ['1 3 4 5']\n\n      In the second example, we keep {4,5,6,7,8}? Wait, n=8, k=4 -> keep 4 nodes. The top 4 by label: {5,6,7,8}. But the output removal set is {1,3,4,5}. So kept set is {2,6,7,8}. \n\n      Why is the kept set {2,6,7,8}? \n\n      Let's check connectivity for {5,6,7,8}: \n          The edges: \n            2-6, 2-7, 7-8, 1-2, 3-1, 2-4, 7-5.\n\n          The node 5 is connected to 7 (edge 7-5). The node 6 is connected to 2, and 2 is connected to 7 (via edge 2-7) and 7 to 5 and 8. Node 8 is connected to 7. So {5,6,7,8} is connected? \n\n          But wait, node 5 is connected to 7, and 7 is connected to 2 and 8, and 2 is connected to 6. So yes, {5,6,7,8} is connected. Then why is the answer removing {1,3,4,5} (so keeping {2,6,7,8})?\n\n      Let's compute the fan value for the two options:\n\n        Option1: {5,6,7,8}: 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 = 32+64+128+256 = 480.\n        Option2: {2,6,7,8}: 2^2 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 = 4+64+128+256 = 452.\n\n      Why did they choose option2? \n\n      Note: the problem says: \"He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans\". \n\n      Option1 has a higher total (480 vs 452). \n\n      But wait, the example output is '1 3 4 5', so they are keeping {2,6,7,8}. \n\n      Why is {5,6,7,8} not the answer? \n\n      Let me read the example input again: \n\n        Input: \"8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5\"\n\n      The edges are:\n        2-6, 2-7, 7-8, 1-2, 3-1, 2-4, 7-5.\n\n      Is {5,6,7,8} connected in the original tree? \n\n        Node 5 is connected to 7 (edge exists).\n        Node 6 is connected to 2, and 2 is connected to 7 (edge 2-7 exists), so 6->2->7->5 and 7->8.\n        So yes, connected.\n\n      Then why isn't the answer the removal set of the 4 smallest: {1,2,3,4}? But wait, the example output is '1 3 4 5'. \n\n      The removal set is not the 4 smallest! \n\n      The example output removal set is {1,3,4,5}. \n\n      But note: the fan value of {5,6,7,8} is 480, and the fan value of {2,6,7,8} is 452. \n\n      Why is {5,6,7,8} not chosen? \n\n      Let me check: the president wants to remove k contestants. He wishes to maximize the total fans. \n\n      The fan value is 2^i for district i.\n\n      In the input, the districts are labeled from 1 to 8. \n\n      The set {5,6,7,8} is the top 4 by label, so the fan value is 2^5+2^6+2^7+2^8 = 32+64+128+256 = 480.\n\n      The set {2,6,7,8} is not the top 4 by label: the top 4 by label are 5,6,7,8. \n\n      But wait, the problem says: the fan value is 2^i, and i is the district number. \n\n      Why would they remove district 5 (which has fan value 32) and keep district 2 (which has fan value 4) and drop the total by 28? \n\n      Unless the set {5,6,7,8} is not valid for some reason? \n\n      Let me check connectivity of {5,6,7,8}:\n\n        Nodes: 5,6,7,8.\n\n        Edges in the original tree that are between these nodes:\n         ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts (contestants) should be removed from a tree-structured network such that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph and the total fan value of the remaining contestants is maximized. The fan value for each district is given by \\(2^i\\), where \\(i\\) is the district number, making higher-numbered districts more valuable.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves a tree structure where each district is a node, and edges represent connections between them. The goal is to remove exactly \\(k\\) districts such that the remaining \\(n-k\\) districts form a connected subtree with the highest possible sum of fan values. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute more to the total fan value, so we should prioritize keeping them if possible.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: We start by considering the top \\(n-k\\) districts (highest numbers) as the initial kept set. We then check if this set forms a connected subtree in the original tree.\n\n3. **Connectivity Check**: Using a Union-Find data structure, we determine if the initial kept set is connected. If it is, we output the smallest \\(k\\) districts (those not in the kept set).\n\n4. **Handling Disconnected Sets**: If the initial kept set is not connected, we need to modify it by swapping some districts from the kept set with those from the removed set (the smallest \\(k\\) districts). The swaps are performed in a way that maximizes the fan value while ensuring connectivity:\n   - For each district in the removed set, determine how many connected components it can link together when added to the current kept set.\n   - Prioritize swapping districts that connect the most components, thereby reducing the number of disconnected parts efficiently.\n   - The district to be removed from the kept set is chosen based on the smallest fan value (lowest district number) to minimize the loss in total fan value.\n\n5. **Termination**: The process continues until the kept set becomes connected, ensuring the solution meets the problem's requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000000)\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n
