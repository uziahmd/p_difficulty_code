He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string only contains 'a', 'b', 'c'\n Steps:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends 'c' so there might be no 'c'? Actually, the problem says C appends some number of 'c' (which could be zero? But note: \"equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\", so if there is no 'a' or 'b' then we cannot have a valid c? However, the initial condition says that after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some number of 'c'. So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and then some 'c' (but note: the number of 'c' can be zero? Let's read: C appends some number of letters 'c'. The word \"some\" might imply at least one, but the problem also says \"It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both\". However, the example input does not have an empty string.\n\n But note: the problem says \"A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'\" -> so at least one 'a'. Then B appends some number of 'b' (so at least one 'b'? Actually, the problem says \"they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\", meaning after B. Then C appends some number of 'c' (could be zero? The problem says \"appends some number\", which typically in programming problems means nonnegative including zero). However, note that if C appends zero 'c', then the condition for the number of 'c' (which is 0) must equal the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. Since the string after B has at least one 'a' and one 'b', then 0 would not equal the count of 'a' or 'b' (unless the counts were zero, but they are not). So the condition requires that the number of 'c' is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b' (or both). \n\n However, note the process:\n   - The string must be split into three parts: \n        [all 'a's] (from A) \n        then [some 'b's] (from B)\n        then [some 'c's] (from C)\n\n But what if the string has mixed order? For example, if we see an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c', that breaks the pattern. Similarly, if we see a 'b' after a 'c', that breaks.\n\n Conditions for the string:\n   a. The string must start with zero or more 'a's, then zero or more 'b's, then zero or more 'c's. However, note the problem says:\n        - A gives a string of only 'a's.\n        - B appends some 'b's at the end.\n        - C appends some 'c's at the end.\n\n   Therefore, the string should be in non-decreasing order of the characters? Actually, the characters are fixed: 'a' < 'b' < 'c'. So the string must be in the form:\n        [a...a][b...b][c...c]\n\n   But wait: the problem does not say that the entire string must have only these transitions. It says:\n        - A: only 'a's (so the beginning part is all 'a')\n        - B: appends 'b's at the end (so after the 'a's, we have 'b's)\n        - C: appends 'c's at the end (so after the 'b's, we have 'c's)\n\n   So the entire string must be in three contiguous blocks: first block 'a', second block 'b', third block 'c'. There should be no mixing.\n\n 2. Additionally, the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (or both).\n\n However, note the example: \n      Input: 'aabc' -> YES\n\n Let's break down 'aabc':\n      Count of 'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 1.\n      Condition: number of 'c' (1) is equal to the number of 'a'? (2) -> no. Equal to the number of 'b'? (1) -> yes.\n\n  But wait, the example input includes 'aabc' and expects YES.\n\n  However, the example also includes 'bbacc' and expects NO.\n\n  Why is 'bbacc' NO?\n      Let's check the structure: \n          The string is \"bbacc\": \n          It starts with two 'b's, then two 'a's? That is not the expected order.\n\n  So the order must be: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n  Steps for solution:\n\n  Step 1: Check the order.\n      We expect:\n          - The string should be divided into three segments: [a's], [b's], [c's] (each segment can be empty? But note: \n            - After A and B, there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b'. However, C may append zero 'c's. But wait, the problem says C appends some number (which might be zero). But then the condition about the number of 'c' (zero) must equal the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. And the number of 'a' and 'b' are positive. So zero won't match. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'? Actually, no: because the problem says \"C appends some number\", which might be zero. However, the condition requires that the number of 'c' (which is zero) must be equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. Since the numbers of 'a' and 'b' are positive, zero is not equal to them. So unless the string has no 'a' or no 'b', which it doesn't (because after B we have at least one 'a' and one 'b'), then having zero 'c' is invalid.\n\n      But wait, the problem states that the string after B (so without C) must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some number of 'c'. Then the total string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and possibly zero or more 'c'. However, the condition for the number of 'c' is that it must be equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' (in the entire string? Or in the string before C appends?).\n\n      Let me clarify: when C appends, he appends based on the current string (after B). The problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\" (at the time of appending?).\n\n      The problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n      The \"in the string\" here refers to the string at the time of appending, which is the string after B (so without the appended 'c's). Therefore, let n_a = count of 'a' (which is the same as the original from A), and n_b = count of 'b' (which is the original from B). Then the number of 'c' appended is either n_a or n_b.\n\n      Therefore, the total number of 'c' in the final string is either n_a or n_b.\n\n      Also note: the entire string must have the form: [a's][b's][c's].\n\n  Step 2: So we can do:\n\n      - Traverse the string and split it into segments of consecutive same characters, but note the order must be 'a', then 'b', then 'c'. So we can check:\n\n        Let i=0\n        While i < len(S) and S[i]=='a': i++\n        Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='b': i++\n        Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='c': i++\n\n        If we don't reach the end, then the order is broken -> return \"NO\"\n\n      But note: what if there are no 'a's? Then we start with 'b' or 'c'. According to the problem, after A and B, there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'a'. Similarly, there must be at least one 'b' (from B). So we cannot skip the 'a' and 'b' segments.\n\n      However, what if the string has no 'c'? Then the last segment is empty. But our traversal will just stop at the last non-empty segment.\n\n      We need to ensure:\n          - The string is divided into three contiguous blocks: first block of 'a's (at least one), second block of 'b's (at least one), and then optionally a third block of 'c's (which can be zero? but note: the condition for the number of 'c' must hold, and if the third block is zero then the number of 'c' is 0, which must be equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' (from the string at the time of appending). However, the string at the time of appending (before adding 'c') has n_a and n_b, so if n_a==0 or n_b==0 then we cannot have zero 'c' because the condition requires the number of 'c' to be n_a or n_b (which are positive). But note: the problem says after B (so the string at that time has at least one 'a' and one 'b'). Therefore, the number of 'c' (0) must equal either n_a (which is at least 1) or n_b (which is at least 1). This is impossible. Hence, if the third block is empty (i.e., no 'c'), then we must have 0 == n_a or 0 == n_b, but n_a>=1 and n_b>=1, so no. Therefore, the third block must be non-empty? Not necessarily: because the condition is on the appended number of 'c', which is n_a or n_b, and if we append, say, n_a 'c's, then the third block is non-empty. But wait: the problem says C appends some number (so he may choose to append n_a or n_b). However, the condition is that the number of 'c' (the entire appended part) must be either n_a or n_b. But note: the entire string after C appends has the same n_a (because A didn't change) and n_b (because B didn't change) as before, and then the appended 'c's are exactly n_a or n_b. \n\n      However, the problem does not specify that the entire string's 'c' count is the same as the appended 'c's. Actually, the appended 'c's are the only 'c's, because the original string (after B) has no 'c's.\n\n      So the total number of 'c' is the number appended by C, which is either n_a or n_b.\n\n      Therefore, the condition is: \n          total_c = n_a   OR   total_c = n_b\n\n      And the string must be in the form: [a...a][b...b][c...c] (with the [c...] being the appended ones, so they are all at the end).\n\n  Step 3: Algorithm:\n\n      Let s = input string.\n\n      First, check the order:\n\n          i = 0\n          # Read all 'a's\n          while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n              i += 1\n\n          # Then read all 'b's\n          while i < len(s) and s[i]=='b':\n              i += 1\n\n          # Then read all 'c's\n          while i < len(s) and s[i]=='c':\n              i += 1\n\n          If i != len(s): then the string has a character that breaks the order -> return \"NO\"\n\n      Now, we must also check that we had at least one 'a' and at least one 'b' (so the first two segments are non-empty). But note: the problem says after B, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So if the first segment (a's) is empty, then we have no 'a' -> invalid. Similarly, if the second segment (b's) is empty, then we have no 'b' -> invalid.\n\n      However, what if the string is \"ab\"? Then we have one 'a' and one 'b', then we break the while for 'c' and i becomes 2 (end of string). Then we check the condition for 'c': the total_c = 0. Then 0 must be equal to n_a (which is 1) or n_b (which is 1). 0 != 1 and 0 != 1 -> invalid. But wait, the problem says C appends some number of 'c'. In this case, the string after B is \"ab\", then C appends 0 'c's? But the problem says \"C appends some number\", and the condition is that the number of 'c' is either n_a (1) or n_b (1). So 0 is not allowed. Therefore, we must have at least one 'c'? Actually, no: because C could choose to append 1 'c' (which is either n_a or n_b). But in the above algorithm, we did not consider that we can have a non-empty third block.\n\n      Correction: The condition for the number of 'c' is that the total number of 'c' (which is the length of the third block) must be either the number of 'a' (which is the first block) or the number of 'b' (which is the second block). \n\n      So let:\n          n_a = count of 'a' (first block)\n          n_b = count of 'b' (second block)\n          n_c = count of 'c' (third block)\n\n      Then we require: n_c == n_a OR n_c == n_b.\n\n      But note: the entire string is built as:\n          Original from A and B: n_a + n_b (and no 'c') and then C appends n_c (which is either n_a or n_b) 'c's.\n\n      Therefore, the condition is independent of the order? Actually, no: the order must be as above.\n\n      However, there's a catch: what if the string has a different order? Our order check ensures that we have the three contiguous blocks.\n\n      Example: \n          s = \"aaabccc\": \n          n_a = 3, n_b = 1, n_c = 3 -> condition: 3==3 (n_a) -> YES.\n\n          s = \"aabc\":\n          n_a = 2, n_b = 1, n_c = 1 -> condition: 1==1 (n_b) -> YES.\n\n          s = \"bbacc\": \n          Order: \n            Start with 'b' -> breaks the first while (which expects 'a') -> so we break the order -> NO.\n\n      But wait, what if the string starts with 'a', then 'b', then 'a'? Then our order check fails because after the first two blocks we get to the third block and then we see an 'a'. But the problem says the entire string must be [a...][b...][c...]. So any letter other than 'c' after the 'b's is invalid.\n\n      However, what if the string has no 'c'? Then the third block is empty. Then we have:\n          n_c = 0, and we require 0 == n_a or 0 == n_b. But n_a>=1 and n_b>=1 -> fails.\n\n      Therefore, the third block must be non-empty? Not necessarily: if n_a==0 or n_b==0, then 0 would satisfy, but the problem states that after B there is at least one 'a' and one 'b', so n_a>=1 and n_b>=1. So the third block must be non-empty? Actually, no: because the condition for the number of 'c' is that it must be n_a or n_b (both positive). So we must have n_c >=1. Therefore, the third block must be non-empty.\n\n      But wait: what if the string is \"aaa\" (without any 'b')? Then our order check will fail because after reading the 'a's, we try to read 'b' and find nothing, then we try to read 'c' and find nothing. Then we break because i remains 0 and then we check i==len(s)? Actually, we break the first while and then the second while and then the third while, and then i==len(s). But then we check the condition: the second segment (b) is empty -> which violates the condition that after B there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So we must also enforce that the first two segments are non-empty.\n\n      Therefore, we must check that the first segment (a) is non-empty and the second segment (b) is non-empty.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        1. Check the entire string is in the form of three contiguous blocks (a*, b*, c*).\n        2. Check that the first block is non-empty (at least one 'a').\n        3. Check that the second block is non-empty (at least one 'b').\n        4. The third block can be empty? But condition requires the number of 'c' (which is the length of the third block) to be either the first block's length or the second block's length. Since the first block and second block are non-empty, the third block must be non-empty and equal to one of the two counts? Actually, the third block's length must be either the first block's length or the second block's length.\n\n      However, note: the third block's length is the total number of 'c's. And the condition is that the number of 'c' (the total) must be equal to the number of 'a' (the first block) or the number of 'b' (the second block). \n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          n_a = count of 'a' (from the first block)\n          n_b = count of 'b' (from the second block)\n          n_c = count of 'c' (from the third block)\n\n          if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n      But wait: what if the string is \"aaaabbbbcccc\" and the counts are:\n          n_a = 4, n_b = 4, n_c = 4 -> then 4==4 (both) -> valid.\n\n      However, what if the string is \"aaaabbbc\" (then n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=1). Then 1 !=4 and 1!=3 -> invalid.\n\n      But note: the condition is that the number of 'c' (which is 1) must be equal to the number of 'a' (4) or the number of 'b' (3) in the string at the time of appending (which is the string after B). The string after B has 4 'a' and 3 'b'. So the condition is 1 == 4 or 1==3 -> false.\n\n      So the above condition is correct.\n\n  Step 4: However, there's a caveat: what if the string has multiple runs of the same character? Our order check only allows one contiguous run of 'a', then one of 'b', then one of 'c'. But the problem says the entire string is built by:\n\n        A: only 'a's (so one contiguous block)\n        B: appends some 'b's (so one contiguous block at the end)\n        C: appends some 'c's (so one contiguous block at the end)\n\n      Therefore, the entire string must be three contiguous blocks.\n\n  Step 5: Code:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n\n      # If the string is empty, then we cannot have at least one 'a' and one 'b' -> NO.\n      if s == \"\":\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Check the order: we expect a sequence of 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\n      i = 0\n      # Read all 'a's\n      n_a = 0\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n          n_a += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      # If we didn't find at least one 'a', then it's invalid.\n      if n_a == 0:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Read all 'b's\n      n_b = 0\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='b':\n          n_b += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      # If we didn't find at least one 'b', then it's invalid.\n      if n_b == 0:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Read all 'c's\n      n_c = 0\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='c':\n          n_c += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      # Now, we must have traversed the whole string?\n      if i != len(s):\n          # There are remaining characters that are not 'c', but we broke the order.\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Now check the condition for the number of 'c'\n      if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But wait: what if the string has no 'c'? Then n_c=0, and then we check: 0 == n_a? (n_a>=1) -> no. 0 == n_b? (n_b>=1) -> no. Then we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n  However, consider the example: \n        s = \"aaaabbbbcccc\": \n        n_a=4, n_b=4, n_c=4 -> 4==4 -> YES.\n\n  Another example: \n        s = \"aabbcc\": \n        n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=2 -> YES.\n\n  But wait, the problem says that the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (in the string at the time of appending). The string at the time of appending (before adding the 'c's) is \"aabb\", so the counts of 'a' and 'b' are 2 and 2. Then C appends 2 'c's (which is either 2 or 2). So condition holds.\n\n  However, what if the string is \"aabbc\": \n        n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=1 -> 1==2? no, 1==2? no -> NO.\n\n  But wait, the problem says C appends a number of 'c' that is either the number of 'a' (which is 2) or the number of 'b' (which is 2). So he must append 2, not 1. Therefore, \"aabbc\" is invalid.\n\n  One more edge: \n        What if the string is \"abc\"? \n        n_a=1, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> YES.\n\n  But note: the problem says that after B, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends 1 'c' (which is the same as n_a=1 or n_b=1). So valid.\n\n  However, consider a string that does not follow the contiguous blocks: \n        Example: \"acb\": \n        First we read 'a' (n_a=1), then we try to read 'b' but next is 'c' -> so the second while breaks. Then we read the 'b'? Actually, no: we break at the 'c' and then the third while reads the 'c' and then the 'b' is left. Then we check i==len(s)? i=2, but the string is \"acb\" (length=3) -> so we haven't read the entire string. Then we output \"NO\".\n\n  Another example: \"ba\": \n        First while: s[0]=='b' -> fails, so n_a=0 -> we output \"NO\".\n\n  But wait, the problem states that the string must have been built by A, B, and C. A gives a string of 'a's, so the string must start with 'a'. Therefore, any string that does not start with 'a' is invalid.\n\n  However, what if the string is \"ac\": \n        First while: read 'a' -> n_a=1, then i=1. Then second while: s[1]=='c' -> not 'b', so n_b=0 -> then we break and output \"NO\".\n\n  This meets the requirement.\n\n  But wait: what if the string is \"aab\"? \n        n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=0 -> condition: 0==2 or 0==1 -> false -> NO.\n\n  And indeed, C must append either 2 or 1 'c's. But he appended 0, which is not allowed.\n\n  However, note the problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" The word \"some\" in many contexts implies at least one, but the problem statement also says \"It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of 'a' and to the number of 'b' at the same time.\" This does not necessarily imply that the number must be positive, but the condition is that the appended number must be either n_a or n_b. And if n_a and n_b are positive, then the appended number is positive. But note: the problem does not explicitly say that the appended number must be positive, so we assume that \"some\" means at least one? Actually, the problem says \"some number\", and in programming problems, \"some\" often includes zero. However, the condition for the number of 'c' is that it must be n_a or n_b. And if n_a or n_b is zero, then zero is allowed. But note: the problem states that after B, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So n_a>=1 and n_b>=1. Therefore, the appended number (which is n_a or n_b) is at least 1. So the third block must be non-empty and its length must be either n_a or n_b.\n\n  Therefore, our code is:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n\n      i = 0\n      n_a = 0\n      # Read all 'a's\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n          n_a += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      if n_a == 0:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      n_b = 0\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='b':\n          n_b += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      if n_b == 0:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      n_c = 0\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='c':\n          n_c += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      if i != len(s):\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  Let me test with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> \n          n_a=3, n_b=1, n_c=3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n      Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> \n          First char is 'b', so n_a=0 -> NO.\n\n      Example 3: \"aabc\" -> \n          n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n  But wait, the example input provided was:\n        ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n  Expected output: ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n  Our code produces:\n        \"aaabccc\": YES\n        \"bbacc\": NO\n        \"aabc\": YES\n\n  However, note: the example input also includes \"aabc\", which we have verified.\n\n  But wait, what if the string is \"aaccc\"? \n        n_a=2, n_b=0 -> wait, we break at the first while: we read two 'a's, then the next is 'c'. Then the second while: we try to read 'b' but there is none, so n_b=0 -> then we output \"NO\".\n\n  This is correct because after B, there must be at least one 'b'. So the string \"aaccc\" is invalid.\n\n  Another example: \"abbccc\": \n        n_a=1, n_b=2, n_c=3 -> condition: 3==1? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n  But wait, the condition is that the number of 'c' (3) must be equal to the number of 'a' (1) OR the number of 'b' (2). So 3 !=1 and 3!=2 -> NO.\n\n  However, consider \"abbcc\": \n        n_a=1, n_b=2, n_c=2 -> condition: 2==1? no, 2==2? yes -> YES.\n\n  But note: the string \"abbcc\" is built as:\n        A: \"a\"\n        B: appends 2 'b's -> \"abb\"\n        Then C: must append either 1 (n_a) or 2 (n_b) 'c's. He appended 2, so valid.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      if s == \"\":\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      i = 0\n      n_a = 0\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n          n_a += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      if n_a == 0:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      n_b = 0\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='b':\n          n_b += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      if n_b == 0:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      n_c = 0\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='c':\n          n_c += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      if i != len(s):\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  However, wait: the problem does not specify that the entire string must have only the letters 'a','b','c'. But the input guarantee says it only consists of these.\n\n  We are good.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"The first and only line consists of a string S (1<=|S|<=5000).\"\n\n  We are reading one line.\n\n  Let me test with a string that has multiple segments of same letter? For example, \"aaabbaaaccc\": \n        Our code reads:\n          First while: reads the first three 'a's -> n_a=3, then i=3.\n          Second while: reads two 'b's -> n_b=2, then i=5.\n          Third while: reads three 'c's -> n_c=3, then i=8 (which is the end). Then condition: 3==3 (n_a) -> YES.\n\n  But wait, the string \"aaabbaaaccc\" is not built according to the process: \n        A gives a string of 'a's (say \"aaa\")\n        Then B appends two 'b's -> \"aaabb\"\n        Then C appends three 'c's -> \"aaabbbccc\", but wait, the given string is \"aaabbaaaccc\", which has two segments of 'a' separated by 'b's. \n\n  This breaks the condition: the entire string must be [a...][b...][c...]. In \"aaabbaaaccc\", after the first three 'a's and two 'b's, we have three 'a's again. But our order check would break at the fourth character: \n        The string: \n          index0: 'a' -> read\n          index1: 'a' -> read\n          index2: 'a' -> read\n          index3: 'b' -> now we are in the second while, so we read two 'b's (index3 and index4)\n          index5: 'a' -> now we are in the third while (which expects 'c') and 'a' is not 'c', so we break.\n\n  Therefore, we output \"NO\" for \"aaabbaaaccc\".\n\n  This is correct because the string must have contiguous blocks: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. So \"aaabbaaaccc\" is not contiguous in the sense that after the first set of 'a's and then 'b's, we get 'a's again. That is not allowed.\n\n  Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n  However, note: the problem does not require that the entire string must have only three distinct contiguous blocks? Actually, the process is:\n\n        A: only 'a's (so the entire first part is 'a')\n        B: appends 'b's (so the entire second part is 'b')\n        C: appends 'c's (so the entire third part is 'c')\n\n  Therefore, the entire string is three contiguous blocks.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      if s == \"\":\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      i = 0\n      n_a = 0\n      # Read all consecutive 'a's\n      while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'a':\n          n_a += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      if n_a == 0:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      n_b = 0\n      # Read all consecutive 'b's\n      while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'b':\n          n_b += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      if n_b == 0:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      n_c = 0\n      # Read all consecutive 'c's\n      while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'c':\n          n_c += 1\n          i += 1\n\n      # Check if we have processed the entire string\n      if i != len(s):\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Check the condition on the number of 'c'\n      if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  Let me run the provided examples:\n\n      Example: \"aaabccc\" -> YES\n      Example: \"bbacc\" -> NO\n      Example: \"aabc\" -> YES\n\n  All pass.\n\n  But wait: what if the string is \"abb\"? \n        n_a=1, n_b=2, n_c=0 -> condition: 0==1? no, 0==2? no -> NO.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  What if the string is \"accc\"? \n        n_a=1, then the next is 'c'. Then we break the second while (n_b=0) -> NO.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  One more: \"aaaabbbbcccc\" -> YES.\n\n  I think we are good.\n\n  However, note: the problem says that after B, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Our code already checks that the first two blocks are non-empty (n_a>=1 and n_b>=1). And the entire string is built by A, B, and C. So we are covering the conditions.\n\n  Submit the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three friends: A, B, and C. Friend A starts with a string of 'a's, friend B appends some 'b's to the end, and friend C appends a number of 'c's equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string at the time of appending. The final string must adhere to the order where all 'a's come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must be divided into three contiguous blocks: one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and then zero or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the order, count the number of 'a's (n_a), 'b's (n_b), and 'c's (n_c) in their respective blocks.\n3. **Validate Condition**: The number of 'c's (n_c) must be equal to either the number of 'a's (n_a) or the number of 'b's (n_b). If this condition is met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    if s == \"\":\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    i = 0\n    n_a = 0\n    while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'a':\n        n_a += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    if n_a == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    n_b = 0\n    while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'b':\n        n_b += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    if n_b == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    n_c = 0\n    while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'c':\n        n_c += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    if i != len(s):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input string and checks if it is empty, in which case it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n2. **Reading 'a's**: The code counts consecutive 'a's at the beginning of the string. If there are no 'a's, it outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Reading 'b's**: The code then counts consecutive 'b's following the 'a's. If there are no 'b's, it outputs \"NO\".\n4. **Reading 'c's**: The code counts consecutive 'c's that follow the 'b's. If the entire string isn't processed after reading 'c's, it outputs \"NO\".\n5. **Condition Check**: Finally, the code checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If so, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the structural and numerical conditions required for the string to be valid according to the problem's specifications.",
