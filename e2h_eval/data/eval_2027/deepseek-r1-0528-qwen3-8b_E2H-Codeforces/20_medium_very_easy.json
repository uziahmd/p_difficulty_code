For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given n, k, f.\n\n We have to assign a value c_s for every binary string s of length from 1 to n (note: the problem says \"from 1 to n\", so we consider all non-empty binary strings up to length n).\n\n Then, we are to count the number of assignments (each c_s in [0, k]) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\n What is a beautiful multiset?\n   For every binary string t (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix must be <= c_t.\n\n How to think about the multiset?\n\n Note: The multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. However, note that the condition must hold for every prefix (even those of length < n). \n\n But observe: A string of length n has prefixes of all lengths from 1 to n. \n\n Condition for a multiset M (multiset of strings of length n) to be beautiful:\n   For every string t (binary, length L, 1<=L<=n): \n        (# of strings in M that start with t) <= c_t.\n\n However, note that if a string is in the multiset, say \"abc\", then it contributes to the counts of all its prefixes: \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\".\n\n Now, what is the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset for a fixed assignment {c_s}?\n\n Consider building the multiset. We can think greedily: we can include at most c_t copies for each prefix t? But note: including a string of length n uses up one copy for each of its prefixes.\n\n However, note: the condition is that for every prefix t, the total count of strings that have t as prefix (i.e., the entire multiset) must not exceed c_t.\n\n Let F(t) = the number of strings in M that have t as prefix.\n\n Then, for the string t, we require F(t) <= c_t.\n\n Also, note that if we have a string s (of length n) that starts with t, then it contributes 1 to F(t). Moreover, note that F(t) is the sum over all strings s in M that start with t.\n\n But also, for two different strings s and s' that start with t, they might have different next characters. However, the condition must hold for every prefix.\n\n How to maximize |M|?\n\n We can use a tree structure. Consider a complete binary tree of depth n (with leaves being the strings of length n). Each node at depth L corresponds to a prefix of length L.\n\n Then, the condition for a node t is that the total number of leaves in the subtree rooted at t (but note: our multiset is a multiset of leaves) must be <= c_t.\n\n However, wait: the multiset can have duplicates. Actually, the multiset can contain multiple copies of the same string (so duplicates). Then, the condition for a node t is that the total count of leaves (counting multiplicity) in the subtree of t is <= c_t.\n\n Then, the maximum multiset size is the minimum over all nodes t of c_t, but wait: no, because the root node (string \"\") is not considered? \n\n Wait, the problem states: for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So the root (empty string) is not included. But note: the condition applies for every prefix of the strings in the multiset. However, the condition must hold for every s (which is any binary string of length from 1 to n). \n\n But note: the multiset contains strings of length n. The prefixes we consider are from length 1 to n. So the condition for the empty string is not included.\n\n However, note that the condition for a prefix t (say of length L) is independent of the other conditions. The entire multiset is constrained by the minimum c_t that appears in the chain of prefixes of the strings we choose? \n\n Actually, consider: a string s of length n has n prefixes: s[0:1], s[0:2], ... , s[0:n]. Therefore, the entire multiset M is constrained by the condition that for every prefix t (of any length from 1 to n) that appears in the set of prefixes of the strings in M, the total count of strings having t as prefix is <= c_t.\n\n But note: the condition must hold for every t (every binary string of length from 1 to n). Even if a particular t does not appear as a prefix of any string in M, then F(t)=0, which is always <= c_t.\n\n Now, how to assign c_s to maximize the multiset? \n\n We can use the following: the multiset M can have at most min_{t: t is a prefix of some string in M} c_t, but wait, actually the multiset is built from the leaves, and the condition on an internal node t (with depth L) is that the entire subtree (the 2^(n-L) leaves) must satisfy that the total count of leaves (with multiplicity) is <= c_t.\n\n However, note that the same leaf (string) is counted in all its ancestors. So the condition for the root (if we were to consider the empty string) would be the total multiset size, but we don't have the condition for the empty string.\n\n Actually, the root condition is not there. So the constraints are independent per node? \n\n But note: the condition for a node t is the total number of leaves (counting multiplicity) in the subtree rooted at t (including t) must be <= c_t.\n\n However, the entire multiset is built from the leaves (each leaf is a string of length n). Each leaf is contained in the subtrees of all its prefixes. Therefore, if we let x_i be the multiplicity (number of copies) of the leaf i (the string of length n corresponding to that leaf), then the condition for a node t (with depth L, and hence corresponding to a string u) is:\n\n   Sum_{leaf i such that the prefix of i is u} x_i <= c_{u}\n\n And the total multiset size is Sum_i x_i.\n\n Now, what is the maximum multiset size? It is the maximum value T such that there exists an assignment of multiplicities {x_i} (nonnegative integers) satisfying:\n\n   For every node u (prefix string) of length L (from 1 to n): \n        Sum_{i: i starts with u} x_i <= c_u\n\n And we want the maximum T = Sum_i x_i, and then we require that the maximum T is exactly f.\n\n But note: the condition must hold for every prefix. This is similar to a system of linear constraints. The maximum T is the minimum over all nodes u of c_u? Not exactly, because the same leaf is constrained by multiple nodes.\n\n Actually, we can use the following: the entire multiset is constrained by the root (if we had a condition for the empty string) but we don't. However, note: the condition for the empty string (if present) would be the total T, but here we don't have the empty string. \n\n Alternatively, we can use a greedy assignment: we can assign multiplicities to the leaves arbitrarily as long as for every node u, the sum of the leaves in its subtree is <= c_u.\n\n Then, the maximum T is the minimum value among the c_u's? No, because the same leaf is shared by many constraints. \n\n Actually, the maximum multiset size T is limited by the constraints from the deepest nodes (leaves). But note: the constraints for a node u are independent of the others? \n\n Another way: consider the constraints form a tree. The constraint for a node u is the sum of the leaves in the subtree (the entire subtree) must be <= c_u. \n\n Then, the maximum T is the minimum value of c_u over all u? Not necessarily, because the leaves are shared. \n\n However, note: we can set the multiplicities arbitrarily. The condition for the root (if we considered the empty string) would be T <= c_{\"\"}. But we don't have that. \n\n Without the root, we can set T arbitrarily high as long as the constraints on the leaves are satisfied? Actually, no: consider two leaves that share a common prefix. \n\n Example: n=2, two leaves: \"00\" and \"01\". The constraints are:\n   For prefix \"0\": x_{00} + x_{01} <= c_0.\n   For prefix \"00\": x_{00} <= c_{00}.\n   For prefix \"01\": x_{01} <= c_{01}.\n   For prefix \"1\": x_{10}+x_{11} <= c_1, etc.\n\n The maximum T (for n=2) is the minimum between c_0 and the sum of the constraints for the two halves? Actually, we can set:\n\n   x_{00} <= min(c_0, c_{00})\n   x_{01} <= min(c_0, c_{01})\n\n Then the total T for the left branch is x_{00}+x_{01} <= min(c_0, c_{00}) + min(c_0, c_{01})\n\n But note: the condition for \"0\" is x_{00}+x_{01} <= c_0, so we cannot exceed c_0. Also, we cannot exceed c_{00} for \"00\", and similarly for \"01\".\n\n In fact, the maximum T is the minimum over all nodes u of the value c_u, but wait: no, because a node u at depth L is constrained by the leaves in its subtree. Actually, the maximum T is bounded by the constraints from the entire tree.\n\n However, note: we can assign multiplicities arbitrarily to the leaves. The constraint for the root (if we had it) would be the entire T. But without the root, the constraints are only on the prefixes. \n\n Actually, the maximum T is the minimum value of c_u over all u? Let me test with n=1:\n\n   Only two strings: \"0\" and \"1\". Conditions: \n        For \"0\": x_0 <= c_0\n        For \"1\": x_1 <= c_1\n        There is no root condition.\n\n   Then, the maximum T is x_0+x_1, and we can set x_0 up to c_0 and x_1 up to c_1, so T_max = c_0+c_1? But wait, no: the condition for the root (if we had it) would be the entire T, but we don't. \n\n However, note: the problem says the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. For n=1, the strings are \"0\" and \"1\". The conditions are for the strings \"0\" and \"1\", and also for every string of length 1 (so only these two). There is no condition for the empty string.\n\n But wait: the condition for the string \"0\" is that the number of strings in the multiset that have \"0\" as a prefix is <= c_0. Similarly for \"1\". \n\n However, note: the multiset consists of strings of length 1. So a string \"0\" is in the multiset and has prefix \"0\". Similarly, \"1\" has prefix \"1\". \n\n But note: the condition for the empty string is not required, so there is no condition that the total multiset size (which is the number of strings) is bounded by a single c_\"\". \n\n However, note: the condition for the string \"0\" (which is a string of length 1) is that the number of strings in the multiset that have \"0\" as prefix is <= c_0. Since the only string that has \"0\" as prefix is \"0\" itself (because we are considering strings of length 1, so the prefix must be exactly the whole string or a proper prefix? Actually, the problem says \"prefix\", and a string of length 1 has the entire string as a prefix and also the empty string is not considered. But note: the problem considers every binary string of length from 1 to n. So for n=1, we have two strings: \"0\" and \"1\". \n\n In the example above, the multiset M can have at most c_0 copies of \"0\" and c_1 copies of \"1\", and there is no condition that ties them together. So the maximum T is c_0 + c_1.\n\n But wait, the problem says: the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. \n\n So for n=1, the maximum T is c_0 + c_1, and we require that the maximum T is f.\n\n Then, we need to count the number of assignments (c_0, c_1) in [0,k]x[0,k] such that c_0+c_1 = f.\n\n However, note: the example input: \n   Input: \"1 42 2\" -> Output: 3.\n\n Let's check: n=1, k=42, f=2.\n\n Then, we require c_0+c_1 = 2.\n\n The pairs (c_0, c_1) are:\n   (0,2): 0+2=2 -> valid.\n   (1,1): 1+1=2 -> valid.\n   (2,0): 2+0=2 -> valid.\n\n So there are 3 ways.\n\n But wait, the example output is 3.\n\n However, in the example note, they said: \n      \"c_0 = 0, c_1 = 2\" -> multiset {1,1} (which is two ones) -> but wait, the multiset {1,1} has two ones. Then the condition for \"0\": there are 0 strings that start with \"0\", which is <= c_0=0 -> holds. Condition for \"1\": there are 2 strings that start with \"1\", which is <= c_1=2 -> holds. So it's valid.\n\n      Similarly, (c_0=1, c_1=1): multiset {0,1} (one 0 and one 1) -> condition for \"0\": 1<=1, for \"1\":1<=1 -> holds.\n\n      (c_0=2, c_1=0): multiset {0,0} -> condition for \"0\": 2<=2, condition for \"1\": 0<=0 -> holds.\n\n So indeed, the maximum T is f=2, and we have 3 ways.\n\n But note: the example also includes the case where the multiset is {1} (then T=1) and {0} (T=1) and {0,0} (T=2) and {1,1} (T=2). However, the problem asks for the maximum T being exactly f.\n\n Now, what is the general rule?\n\n We have a complete binary tree of depth n. Each leaf is a string of length n. Each node (prefix) has a constraint: the total multiplicity of the leaves in its subtree must be <= c_{node}.\n\n The entire multiset is the sum of the multiplicities of the leaves.\n\n The maximum T is the maximum value such that there exists a nonnegative integer assignment x_i (for each leaf i) satisfying:\n\n   For each node u: Sum_{leaves i in the subtree of u} x_i <= c_u.\n\n And we require that the maximum T is exactly f.\n\n How to compute the maximum T for a fixed assignment {c_u}? \n\n We can use a greedy algorithm from the leaves to the root. However, note that the constraints are nested: the constraint for a node u is the sum of the leaves in its subtree. \n\n Alternatively, we can use a min-cut like argument: the maximum T is the minimum value of c_u over all u? No, because the root constraint (if we had one) would be the entire T, but we don't have the root. \n\n Actually, we can use the following: the maximum T is the minimum value of c_u over all u? \n\n Let me test with n=2:\n\n   Leaves: 4: \"00\",\"01\",\"10\",\"11\"\n\n   Constraints:\n      For \"0\": x0+x1 <= c_0   (where x0 = count of \"00\", x1 = count of \"01\")\n      For \"1\": x2+x3 <= c_1   (x2=\"10\", x3=\"11\")\n      For \"00\": x0 <= c_{00}\n      For \"01\": x1 <= c_{01}\n      For \"10\": x2 <= c_{10}\n      For \"11\": x3 <= c_{11}\n\n   Then, the maximum T is x0+x1+x2+x3.\n\n   We can set:\n        x0 <= min(c_0, c_{00})\n        x1 <= min(c_0, c_{01})\n        x2 <= min(c_1, c_{10})\n        x3 <= min(c_1, c_{11})\n\n   Then the maximum T is: min(c_0, c_{00}) + min(c_0, c_{01}) + min(c_1, c_{10}) + min(c_1, c_{11])\n\n   But note: the condition for \"0\" requires x0+x1 <= c_0, and we have set x0<=c_{00} and x1<=c_{01}, but the condition for \"0\" is independent of the conditions for \"00\" and \"01\". \n\n   Actually, we can set x0 = min(c_0, c_{00}), x1 = min(c_0, c_{01}) - x0? No, because the condition for \"0\" is x0+x1<=c_0.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set:\n        x0 = min(c_0, c_{00})\n        x1 = min(c_0 - x0, c_{01])\n        Then, similarly for the other side.\n\n   But note: we want to maximize the total T.\n\n   We can set:\n        x0 = min(c_0, c_{00})\n        x1 = min(c_0 - x0, c_{01])\n        x2 = min(c_1, c_{10])\n        x3 = min(c_1 - x2, c_{11])   ??? \n\n   However, wait: the condition for \"1\" is x2+x3<=c_1, so we can set x2 = min(c_1, c_{10]), and then x3 = min(c_1 - x2, c_{11]).\n\n   Then the total T = x0+x1+x2+x3.\n\n   But note: the condition for \"0\" is satisfied because x0+x1 <= c_0 (by construction: x0 <= c_0, and x1 <= c_0 - x0). Similarly for \"1\".\n\n   However, is this the maximum? \n\n   Alternatively, we can set:\n        x0 = min(c_0, c_{00})\n        x1 = min(c_0, c_{01})   but wait, then the condition for \"0\" might fail if x0+x1 > c_0.\n\n   So the correct way is to set the entire subtree from the root down.\n\n   Actually, we can use the following: the entire multiset is constrained by the root (if we had a root) and then by the children. But without the root, we are free to set the left and right branches independently? \n\n   However, note: the condition for the root (if we had one) would be the entire T, but we don't have the root. So the left and right branches are independent? \n\n   Actually, the conditions for the root (empty string) is not present, so the conditions for the two children (\"0\" and \"1\") are separate. Then the total T is the sum of the left branch and the right branch.\n\n   The left branch: \n        Condition for \"0\": x0+x1 <= c_0.\n        Conditions for \"00\": x0 <= c_{00}, for \"01\": x1 <= c_{01}.\n\n        Then the maximum for the left branch is: \n            We want to maximize x0+x1 subject to x0<=c_{00}, x1<=c_{01}, and x0+x1<=c_0.\n\n            The maximum is min(c_0, c_{00}+c_{01])? \n\n        But wait, no: because the constraint for the root (if we had one) is the entire T, but we don't. However, we are allowed to use the entire capacity of the left branch as long as the condition for \"0\" is satisfied. \n\n        Actually, the maximum for the left branch is the minimum between c_0 and the sum of the capacities of the two leaves? \n\n        However, note: the leaves are independent, but the condition for \"0\" is the sum. So the maximum for the left branch is min(c_0, c_{00}+c_{01])? \n\n        But wait, we can set x0 = min(c_{00}, c_0) and then set x1 = min(c_{01}, c_0 - x0). Then the left branch total is min(c_{00}, c_0) + min(c_{01}, c_0 - min(c_{00}, c_0)).\n\n        Alternatively, we can set the entire left branch to be the minimum between c_0 and the sum of the capacities of the two leaves? \n\n        Actually, the left branch is a complete binary tree of depth 2. The maximum multiplicity we can assign is the minimum between c_0 (the root) and the capacities of the leaves? \n\n        However, note: we can assign more than c_{00} to a leaf? No, because the condition for the leaf \"00\" is x0<=c_{00}. Similarly, we cannot assign more than c_0 to the entire left branch.\n\n        So the maximum for the left branch is the minimum of c_0 and the sum of the capacities of the leaves? No, because the leaves are independent, but the condition for the root (if present) is the entire left branch, and the conditions for the leaves are independent. \n\n        Actually, the maximum for the left branch is the minimum of c_0 and the maximum value that satisfies the leaf constraints? \n\n        But note: we can set x0 arbitrarily as long as x0<=c_{00} and x1 arbitrarily as long as x1<=c_{01}, and the only constraint is x0+x1<=c_0.\n\n        Then the maximum is min(c_0, c_{00}+c_{01])? \n\n        Let me test: \n            If c_0 = 5, c_{00}=3, c_{01}=4 -> then the maximum is min(5, 3+4)=5.\n            But can we achieve 5? We set x0=3, x1=2 -> then 3+2=5, and 3<=3, 2<=4 -> yes.\n\n            If c_0 = 5, c_{00}=3, c_{01}=2 -> then the maximum is min(5, 5)=5? But we set x0=3, x1=2 -> 5, and 3<=3, 2<=2 -> yes.\n\n            If c_0=5, c_{00}=3, c_{01}=2, then the maximum is 5.\n\n            But note: the condition for the leaves is independent, and the condition for the root is the sum. So the maximum for the left branch is the minimum of c_0 and the total of the leaves' capacities? \n\n        However, wait: the condition for the leaves is that x0<=c_{00} and x1<=c_{01}. The condition for the root is x0+x1<=c_0. \n\n        Then, the maximum T_left = min(c_0, c_{00}+c_{01]) is not correct because we cannot break the leaf constraints arbitrarily. \n\n        Actually, the maximum T_left is the minimum between c_0 and the sum of the leaf capacities? \n\n        Let me try: \n            c_0=5, c_{00}=3, c_{01}=2 -> then the maximum is min(5, 5)=5. Correct.\n\n            But what if c_0=5, c_{00}=10, c_{01}=10 -> then the maximum is min(5, 20)=5.\n\n            What if c_0=10, c_{00}=3, c_{01}=2 -> then the maximum is min(10, 5)=5.\n\n        So yes, the maximum for the left branch is min(c_0, c_{00}+c_{01]).\n\n        Similarly, the right branch: min(c_1, c_{10}+c_{11]).\n\n        Then the total maximum T = min(c_0, c_{00}+c_{01]) + min(c_1, c_{10}+c_{11]).\n\n        Then, for the entire tree, we can generalize:\n\n        For a node u (prefix string) of length L (and depth L, so the subtree has depth n-L), the maximum total multiplicity for the subtree rooted at u is:\n\n            Let T(u) = min(c_u, sum_{v in the last level of the subtree} T(v))\n\n        But wait, the entire subtree of u is a complete binary tree of depth n-L (if we consider the leaves are at depth n). \n\n        However, note: the leaves are at depth n. The node u is at depth L, so the subtree has depth n-L, meaning the leaves are at depth n (relative to the whole tree). \n\n        But the condition for u is the total multiplicity of the leaves in the subtree of u must be <= c_u. And the leaves in the subtree of u are 2^(n-L) in number.\n\n        Then, we can define:\n\n            Let F(u) = the maximum total multiplicity we can assign to the subtree of u.\n\n            Then, F(u) = min( c_u, \n                              F(left_child(u)) + F(right_child(u))   )   ?\n\n        But wait, the condition for u is the total multiplicity of the leaves in the subtree (which is the entire multiset of the leaves) must be <= c_u. And the leaves are divided into two parts: left child and right child.\n\n        However, the left child and right child are independent? Actually, the condition for u is the entire subtree, so the total multiplicity is the sum of the multiplicities of the leaves in the left part and the right part.\n\n        But note: the conditions for the children are independent and the entire subtree is the union of the two children's subtrees.\n\n        Then, the maximum for the subtree of u is the minimum between c_u and the sum of the maximums of the two children's subtrees.\n\n        However, wait: the children's conditions are independent. Actually, the condition for the left child is that the total multiplicity of the leaves in the left child's subtree is <= c_{left}, and similarly for the right. But then the condition for u is the sum of the two. \n\n        Then, the maximum for u is the minimum between c_u and (F(left) + F(right))? \n\n        But note: the definition of F(left) is the maximum total multiplicity we can assign to the left child's subtree, which already takes into account the condition for the left child and all deeper nodes. \n\n        Then, recursively:\n\n          F(u) = min( c_u, F(left_child(u)) + F(right_child(u)) )\n\n        Then, the total maximum T is F(root)? But note: the root is the empty string? \n\n        However, the problem does not have the condition for the empty string. But note: the entire multiset is the root's subtree (if we consider the root as the empty string). \n\n        But wait, the problem says: the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. The root condition (if present) would be the entire multiset. \n\n        However, we don't have the condition for the empty string. But the problem conditions are for every string from length 1 to n. \n\n        Actually, the root (empty string) is not considered. Then, the entire multiset is the entire tree, but without the root condition, we can set the root condition arbitrarily high? \n\n        But note: the conditions for the root (if we had one) would be the entire multiset, but we don't. However, the conditions for the direct children of the root are:\n\n            For the first character '0': the total multiplicity of the left subtree must be <= c_0.\n            Similarly for '1'.\n\n        And the root condition is absent.\n\n        Then, the maximum multiset size is the sum of the maximums for the two children? \n\n        But wait, the entire multiset is the entire tree. And the conditions for the root are absent, so we are free to set the entire tree as long as the conditions for the direct children are satisfied.\n\n        Then, the maximum T is F('0') + F('1'), where F('0') and F('1') are computed with the above recurrence, but without the root condition.\n\n        However, the recurrence for the root's children:\n\n            F('0') = min(c_0, F('00') + F('01'))\n            F('1') = min(c_1, F('10') + F('11'))\n\n        Then, T = F('0') + F('1').\n\n        Now, for n=1:\n\n            The root has two direct children: \"0\" and \"1\". Then:\n\n            F('0') = min(c_0, F('00')+F('01')) -> but wait, for n=1, the string \"0\" is of length 1, so the subtree of \"0\" has no further children? \n\n        Actually, we should define the tree properly. The tree has depth n, and the leaves are at depth n. For n=1, the leaves are the nodes of depth 1. \n\n        Then, the node \"0\" (at depth 1) is a leaf. Similarly for \"1\". \n\n        Then, for a leaf node u (depth n), F(u) = min(c_u, 0 + 0) ? But wait, the leaf node's condition is that the multiplicity of the leaf (which is the entire string) must be <= c_u. \n\n        However, note: the leaf node's condition is the entire multiset of leaves in its subtree (which is just itself). \n\n        Then, for a leaf u, we can assign up to c_u copies. \n\n        But the condition for the parent of u (which is at depth n-1) is the sum of the two children (if any) must be <= c_{parent}. \n\n        However, for n=1, the parent is the root (empty string) which is not considered. Then, the condition for the leaf node itself is the only constraint.\n\n        But note: the problem conditions are for every binary string of length from 1 to n. So for n=1, the conditions are for the two leaves (each of length 1). \n\n        Then, the maximum multiset size is the sum of the multiplicities of the two leaves, and the condition for each leaf is that the multiplicity is <= c_leaf. \n\n        Then, T = min(k, ...) but wait, we are assigning the c_s arbitrarily in [0,k] and then the maximum T is the minimum between c_0 and c_1? No, because the two leaves are independent. \n\n        Actually, for n=1, the maximum T is c_0 + c_1.\n\n        But according to the recurrence above, we didn't use the root condition. How do we incorporate the root condition? \n\n        We don't have the root condition. Then, the maximum T is the sum of the maximums for the two children, but the children are leaves. \n\n        For a leaf node (depth n): F(u) = c_u (because the subtree has one leaf, and the condition is that the multiplicity of that leaf is <= c_u, so the maximum multiplicity for that leaf is c_u, and the parent condition (if any) might limit it further).\n\n        Then, for the parent of a leaf (depth n-1): \n            F(u) = min(c_u, F(left)+F(right))\n\n        For n=2, the root is the empty string (not considered). Then, the direct children (depth1) are the two nodes \"0\" and \"1\". Then, the maximum T is F(\"0\") + F(\"1\").\n\n        For \"0\" (depth1, not a leaf because n=2, so depth1 is not the last): \n            F(\"0\") = min(c_0, F(\"00\") + F(\"01\"))\n\n        For \"00\" (depth2, leaf): F(\"00\") = c_{00}\n        Similarly, F(\"01\") = c_{01}\n\n        Then, F(\"0\") = min(c_0, c_{00}+c_{01})\n\n        Similarly, F(\"1\") = min(c_1, c_{10}+c_{11])\n\n        Then, T = min(c_0, c_{00}+c_{01]) + min(c_1, c_{10}+c_{11])\n\n        For n=1, we don't have the two children of the root, because the root is not considered. Then, we must adjust: \n\n        Actually, the problem states: consider all binary strings of length from 1 to n. \n\n        The tree has nodes for every binary string of length from 1 to n. \n\n        Then, the root (empty string) is not included. The direct children of the root (which are the strings of length 1) are included. \n\n        Then, the recurrence for a node u (which is a string of length L, 1<=L<n) is:\n\n            F(u) = min(c_u, F(u+'0') + F(u+'1'))\n\n        For a leaf node (length n): F(u) = c_u   (since the condition for the leaf is that the multiplicity is <= c_u, and we are maximizing the multiplicity, so we can set it to c_u)\n\n        But wait, the leaf node's condition is independent, and the parent condition (if the leaf is at depth n, then the parent is at depth n-1) might have a condition that the entire leaf's multiplicity is included in the parent's constraint. \n\n        However, the leaf node's condition is that the multiplicity of the leaf is <= c_{leaf}. The parent condition (if present) is the sum of the two leaves. \n\n        Then, the leaf node's F(u) should be the maximum multiplicity we can assign to the leaf, which is c_u, but then the parent will take the minimum between c_parent and the sum of the two leaves.\n\n        Then, the recurrence is:\n\n            For a node u (prefix, length L, 1<=L<=n):\n                If L == n: \n                    F(u) = c_u\n                Else:\n                    F(u) = min(c_u, F(u+'0') + F(u+'1'))\n\n        Then, the maximum multiset size T is the sum over the two direct children of the root (if we had the root) but we don't have the root. \n\n        However, note: the problem conditions are for every prefix. The root (empty string) is not considered, so we don't have a condition that ties the entire multiset. \n\n        But wait: the entire multiset is the set of leaves. The condition for the direct children of the root (the strings of length 1) is that the total multiplicity of the leaves in their subtree is <= c_{direct}. \n\n        Then, the maximum T is the sum of the F values of the two direct children (the two strings of length 1). \n\n        However, note: the direct children are of length 1, and they are not leaves if n>1. \n\n        Example for n=1:\n\n            The nodes: only the two leaves (strings \"0\" and \"1\"). Then, for each leaf, F(u)=c_u.\n\n            Then, the maximum T = F(\"0\") + F(\"1\") = c_0 + c_1.\n\n        Example for n=2:\n\n            The nodes: \n                \"0\", \"1\" (length1, not leaves)\n                \"00\",\"01\",\"10\",\"11\" (leaves)\n\n            Then, \n                F(\"00\") = c_{00}\n                F(\"01\") = c_{01}\n                F(\"0\") = min(c_0, F(\"00\")+F(\"01\")) = min(c_0, c_{00}+c_{01})\n                Similarly for \"1\".\n\n            Then, T = F(\"0\") + F(\"1\")\n\n        Example for n=3:\n\n            We have to go down to the leaves (length3). \n\n        Then, the maximum T is defined by:\n\n            T = F(\"0\") + F(\"1\")\n\n            where F(\"0\") = min(c_0, F(\"00\") + F(\"01\"))\n            and F(\"00\") = min(c_{00}, F(\"000\")+F(\"001\"))\n            and F(\"000\") = c_{000}, F(\"001\") = c_{001}\n\n        So, in general,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign integers \\( c_s \\) for every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). A beautiful multiset is defined as a multiset of binary strings of length exactly \\( n \\) where for every binary string \\( t \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\), the number of strings in the multiset that have \\( t \\) as a prefix does not exceed \\( c_t \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset depends on the constraints imposed by the \\( c_s \\) values. For each node in a binary tree (where nodes represent prefixes of strings of length up to \\( n \\)), the maximum multiplicity of its subtree's leaves is constrained by the minimum of its own \\( c_s \\) and the sum of the maximum multiplicities of its children's subtrees.\n\n2. **Tree Representation**: We model the problem using a complete binary tree of depth \\( n \\), where each node represents a prefix. The leaves are the binary strings of length \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: For each node, we compute the maximum multiplicity (F(u)) that can be assigned to its subtree. The recurrence relation is:\n   - If the node is a leaf (length \\( n \\)), \\( F(u) = c_u \\).\n   - Otherwise, \\( F(u) = \\min(c_u, F(\\text{left child}) + F(\\text{right child})) \\).\n\n4. **Counting Valid Assignments**: We need to count all assignments of \\( c_s \\) values (each between 0 and \\( k \\)) such that the computed maximum multiset size \\( T = F(\\text{root}) \\) (sum of the two children of the root) equals \\( f \\). This involves iterating over all possible \\( c_s \\) values and using combinatorial mathematics to count valid configurations efficiently.\n\n5. **Modulo Handling**: Since the result can be very large, all calculations are done modulo \\( 998244353 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    f = int(data[2])\n    \n    total_nodes = (1 << (n + 1)) -

 with the given input constraints and the problem's complexity. \n\nHowever, due to the complexity and length of the solution, it is clear that the initial approach was too verbose and not suitable for production code. The intended solution likely involves combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming to count the valid configurations efficiently, but the provided code is incomplete and contains redundant calculations.\n\nGiven the constraints and the example inputs, a more efficient and correct approach would be needed, but the above code does not provide a complete solution. \n\n### Final Answer\nThe solution involves counting the number of ways to assign integers \\( c_s \\) for every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). The approach uses a tree structure to model the problem and dynamic programming to compute the maximum multiset size for given \\( c_s \\) values. However, the provided code is incomplete and contains redundant calculations, and a full implementation was not completed in the thought process.\n\nFor a complete and efficient solution, one would need to implement the tree-based DP and use combinatorial methods to count the valid configurations, ensuring to handle the modulo arithmetic correctly. Given the complexity, the final code might require further development and optimization.",

 with the given input constraints and the problem's complexity. \n\nHowever, due to the complexity and length of the solution, it is clear that the initial approach was too verbose and not suitable for production code. The intended solution likely involves combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming to count the valid configurations efficiently, but the provided code is incomplete and contains redundant calculations.\n\nGiven the constraints and the example inputs, a more efficient and correct approach would be needed, but the above code does not provide a complete solution. \n\n### Final Answer\nThe solution involves counting the number of ways to assign integers \\( c_s \\) for every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). The approach uses a tree structure to model the problem and dynamic programming to compute the maximum multiset size for given \\( c_s \\) values. However, the provided code is incomplete and contains redundant calculations, and a full implementation was not completed in the thought process.\n\nFor a complete and efficient solution, one would need to implement the tree-based DP and use combinatorial methods to count the valid configurations, ensuring to handle the modulo arithmetic correctly. Given the complexity, the final code might require further development and optimization.",
