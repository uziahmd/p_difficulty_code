After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: first line has n and m, then n lines with m characters (each row is a string of m digits)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines (each line is a string of m digits) and store them in a list.\n\n We need to determine for each subject the highest mark. Then, for each student, if there exists at least one subject where they have the highest mark (and note: if multiple students have the same highest mark, then they are all best in that subject), then the student is successful.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"successful\" if there exists a subject he is the best at.\n\n Approach:\n For each subject j (column j):\n   Let max_mark[j] = maximum digit in column j (converted to integer or just compare as char since '1' to '9' are ordered)\n\n But note: we have to consider the entire group.\n\n Then, for each student i (row i) and for each subject j (column j):\n   If the student's mark in subject j is equal to max_mark[j], then this student is best at subject j.\n\n However, wait: if two students both have the maximum mark in a subject, then they are both best in that subject.\n\n So, for a student to be successful, we need to check: for any subject j, is his mark equal to max_mark[j]?\n\n But note: what if a student has the maximum mark in one subject and not in others? Then he is successful.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we cannot require that the student is the only one with that maximum. The definition says: \"best at some subject\" if there is no student who got a higher mark. So if multiple have the same maximum, they are all best.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Step 1: Read n and m.\n Step 2: Read the n strings (each of length m).\n\n Step 3: For each column j (from 0 to m-1):\n          max_mark[j] = maximum character in the j-th column (since the characters are digits and order is the same as integers)\n\n Step 4: For each student i (each row in the list):\n          successful = False\n          for each subject j (each column in the row):\n              if the mark (at [i][j]) equals max_mark[j]:\n                  successful = True; break inner loop.\n\n          Then count this student if successful.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   We have 3 students and 3 subjects.\n\n   Mark matrix:\n      Student0: ['2','2','3']\n      Student1: ['2','3','2']\n      Student2: ['1','1','2']\n\n   For subject0: max is '3' (from student1's first mark? Actually wait: \n        subject0: [ '2','2','1'] -> max is '2'? Actually no: \n        Let me reindex: the input is given as three rows of 3 characters.\n\n        The columns are:\n          col0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n          col1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n          col2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n        So wait, actually the example input is:\n\n          ['3 3', '223', '232', '112'] \n\n        So the first row is \"223\", second \"232\", third \"112\".\n\n        Columns:\n          col0: \"223\" -> ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n          col1: \"232\" -> ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n          col2: \"112\" -> ['3','2','2'] -> wait, no: the third row is \"112\", so the third column from the three rows is: \n                row0: '3', row1: '2', row2: '2'. So max is '3'\n\n        Correction: the example input is:\n\n          n=3, m=3\n          Row0: \"223\"\n          Row1: \"232\"\n          Row2: \"112\"\n\n        Then the columns are:\n          col0: [ '2','2','1'] -> max '2'\n          col1: [ '2','3','1'] -> max '3'\n          col2: [ '3','2','2'] -> max '3'\n\n        Now, for each student:\n\n        Student0: \"223\": \n            col0: '2' == max_col0 ('2') -> yes, so successful.\n\n        Student1: \"232\":\n            col0: '",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves analyzing a gradebook where each student's marks across multiple subjects are given. For each subject, we need to find the highest mark achieved by any student. A student is successful if they have the highest mark in at least one subject.\n2. **Intuition**: For each subject, identify the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they have this maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Read the input values for the number of students (n) and subjects (m).\n   - Read the gradebook data, which consists of n strings each of length m.\n   - For each subject (column), determine the highest mark.\n   - For each student (row), check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If yes, increment the count of successful students.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves iterating over each student and each subject once. The time complexity is O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n and m are up to 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    gradebook = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        gradebook.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_vals = [int(gradebook[i][j]) for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks[j] = max(col_vals)\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if int(gradebook[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count_successful += 1\n            \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first line contains the number of students (n) and subjects (m). The subsequent lines contain the gradebook data.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by examining all student entries for that subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, we check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple iteration and comparison operations.",
