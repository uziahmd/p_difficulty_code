Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals .\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the maximum value of function f(x) for all .\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n### Output\n['3', '27']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements (which is also the length of the binary string for m)\n   an array a of n integers (a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1})\n   a string s of length n (without spaces) which is the binary representation of m (with no leading zeros, but note: the string might be given in big-endian? Actually, the problem says: \"the third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1 — the binary representation of number m\"\n\n However, note: the example input is given as:\n      ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n For the first example: \n        n=2, array a = [3,8], and the binary string is \"10\" (which is m=2)\n\n But note: the function f(x) is defined by the bits set in x. The i-th bit (from the least significant?) or most significant?\n\n In the example: \n        n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011) -> then f(11)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n How are the bits aligned?\n The problem says: \"where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n And note: the array a has n elements, and the binary representation of m has n digits.\n\n Important: the index i in the bit representation of x corresponds to the i-th position. But how is the index defined?\n\n Since the array a has indices from 0 to n-1, and the binary string for m is given as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}, we must align the bits.\n\n Let's look at the example: \n        Input: n=5, array [17, 0, 10, 2, 1] and binary string \"11010\"\n\n Here, the binary string \"11010\" has 5 digits. The problem says m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0?\n\n But wait: the example says m = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11. However, the string is \"11010\", so:\n\n        s0='1', s1='1', s2='0', s3='1', s4='0'\n\n Then m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+2 = 26? \n\n But wait, the example says: \"the maximum value of function equals f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27\"\n\n And note: the example says m=11 (in the note). However, the provided input is \"11010\" for m.\n\n Let me re-read: the third line is a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1 — the binary representation of number m.\n\n The example input is: \n        \"5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010\"\n\n So the problem states that m is represented by a binary string of length n, with the first character being the most significant? \n\n But wait: the example says m=11, and the example input gives \"11010\". Then 11 in binary is '1011' (which is 4 digits) but n=5, so we have 5 digits.\n\n Actually, the example says: \"Number m equals .\", and then in the example they wrote: \"m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\", so m=11.\n\n How do we get 11 from \"11010\"? \n\n Let's break down the example: \n        n=5, so the positions are from 0 to 4 (for the bits) and the array a has 5 elements.\n\n The function f(x) uses the bits of x to pick indices. The i-th bit of x (if present) then adds a_i.\n\n But note: the example says: \"if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23)\", so the bit indexing is 0-indexed from the least significant",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements in array \\( a \\) at positions where the binary representation of \\( x \\) has a 1 bit. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Binary Representation Handling**: The input provides the binary representation of \\( m \\) as a string of length \\( n \\). Each character in this string corresponds to a bit in \\( m \\), with the first character being the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n2. **Bitwise Comparison**: We compare each bit of \\( x \\) (from the least significant bit, LSB, to the most significant bit, MSB) with the corresponding bit in \\( m \\). However, since the binary string provided is in big-endian format (MSB first), we need to process the bits from right to left (LSB to MSB).\n\n3. **Greedy Selection**: For each bit position, if setting the bit in \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\), we include the corresponding element from the array \\( a \\) in the sum. If setting the bit would exceed \\( m \\), we skip it, but we must ensure that subsequent bits do not violate the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\n4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: While processing each bit, we keep track of whether the current selection (bits processed so far) is strictly less than \\( m \\). If it is, we can freely choose subsequent bits without exceeding \\( m \\). Otherwise, we must adhere strictly to the bits specified in \\( m \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total = 0\n    power = 1\n    strict_less = True\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):\n        if not strict_less:\n            bit_val = 0\n            if s[i] == '1':\n                bit_val = 1 << (len(s) - 1 - i)\n            total += bit_val\n            continue\n        \n        if s[i] == '1':\n            bit_val = 1 << (len(s) - 1 - i)\n            if total + bit_val <= m:\n                total += bit_val\n            else:\n                pass\n        else:\n            bit_val = 0\n            if total < m:\n                strict_less = False\n            else:\n                pass\n    \n    result = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if total & (1 << i):\n            result += a[i]\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize `total` to keep track of the integer value of \\( x \\) being constructed and `strict_less` to determine if the current selection of bits is strictly less than \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Processing Bits**: We iterate over each bit in the binary string from right to left (LSB to MSB). For each bit:\n   - If we are still in the strict less phase, we check if setting the current bit (if it's '1') does not exceed \\( m \\). If it doesn't, we add its value to `total`; otherwise, we skip it.\n   - If setting the bit would exceed \\( m \\), we mark `strict_less` as false, meaning subsequent bits must exactly match those in \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all bits, we compute the result by summing elements of \\( a \\) at positions where the corresponding bit in \\( x \\) (constructed from `total`) is set.\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the constraints to find the maximum \\( f(x) \\) by leveraging bitwise operations and greedy selection, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
