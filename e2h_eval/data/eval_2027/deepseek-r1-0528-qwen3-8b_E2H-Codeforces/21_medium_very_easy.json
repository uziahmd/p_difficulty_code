The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are only allowed to use a key j on a chest i if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes with even numbers and odd numbers.\n   Keys with even numbers and odd numbers.\n\n The condition for matching is:\n   - An even chest must be matched with an odd key (since even + odd = odd).\n   - An odd chest must be matched with an even key (since odd + even = odd).\n\n However, note that if we have two even keys and two odd chests, we can use the even keys only on the odd chests, but if we have more odd chests than even keys, then we cannot open all odd chests. Similarly, if we have more even chests than odd keys, we cannot open all even chests.\n\n But wait: there are two independent bipartite graphs? Actually, the problem becomes:\n\n   Graph 1: Even chests (E_c) can only be matched with Odd keys (O_k)\n   Graph 2: Odd chests (O_c) can only be matched with Even keys (E_k)\n\n Then the total maximum matching is the sum of the maximum matching in these two bipartite graphs.\n\n However, note that in each bipartite graph, we are just matching two sets. Since the matching is constrained by the sizes of the two sets, the maximum matching for a bipartite graph between set A and set B is the minimum of the two set sizes? Not exactly, because we are allowed to assign arbitrarily (each node in A can connect to any node in B, but we don't have multiple edges). Actually, the matching is limited by the smaller of the two sets.\n\n But wait, consider: \n   In the first bipartite graph (even chests and odd keys): the maximum matching is min(|E_c|, |O_k|)\n   In the second bipartite graph (odd chests and even keys): the maximum matching is min(|O_c|, |E_k|)\n\n However, is that correct? Actually, yes, because we are allowed to use each key at most once and each chest at most once, and the conditions are independent. So we can take as many as the minimum of the two set sizes for each graph.\n\n But wait, let me test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        n=5, m=4\n        Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> \n            even: [14,6,2] -> 3 even chests\n            odd: [9,11] -> 2 odd chests\n\n        Keys: [8,4,7,20] ->\n            even: [8,4,20] -> 3 even keys\n            odd: [7] -> 1 odd key\n\n   Then according to the above:\n        Matching from even chests (3) to odd keys (1): min(3,1)=1\n        Matching from odd chests (2) to even keys (3): min(2,3)=2\n        Total: 1+2=3 -> which matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \n        n=5, m=1\n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even (5 even chests, 0 odd)\n        Keys: [5] -> odd (0 even, 1 odd)\n\n   Then:\n        Matching from even chests (5) to odd keys (1): min(5,1)=1\n        Matching from odd chests (0) to even keys (0): min(0,0)=0\n        Total: 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input:\n        n=1, m=4\n        Chest: [10] -> even (1 even, 0 odd)\n        Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even (4 even, 0 odd)\n\n   Then:\n        Matching from even chests (1) to odd keys (0): min(1,0)=0\n        Matching from odd chests (0) to even keys (4): min(0,4)=0\n        Total: 0 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n   Step 2: Read the list of n integers for the chests.\n   Step 3: Read the list of m integers for the keys.\n\n   Step 4: Separate the chests into two lists: \n        even_chests = [x for x in a if x % 2 == 0]\n        odd_chests = [x for x in a if x % 2 != 0]\n\n   Step 5: Separate the keys into two lists:\n        even_keys = [x for x in b if x % 2 == 0]\n        odd_keys = [x for x in b if x % 2 != 0]\n\n   Step 6: \n        matching1 = min(len(even_chests), len(odd_keys))   # even_chests require odd_keys\n        matching2 = min(len(odd_chests), len(even_keys))    # odd_chests require even_keys\n\n   Step 7: Print matching1 + matching2\n\n However, wait: is there any restriction that a key or chest cannot be used twice? We are already considering the entire sets and the condition is that one key per chest and vice versa. This method is standard for bipartite matching when the graph is complete (any node in set A can connect to any node in set B). \n\n But note: the problem does not require the same key to be used twice, and we are counting the total number of keys and chests in each set. Since we are not tracking individual nodes, but just the counts, this works because the condition is independent of the actual values (only parity matters). \n\n However, note: the condition is defined by the parity. So if we have an even chest, it requires an odd key. And we don't care about the specific key as long as there is one available. Similarly for odd chests and even keys.\n\n Therefore, the code is straightforward.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each pair (chest and key) meets the condition where their sum is odd. This means even-numbered chests must be paired with odd-numbered keys, and odd-numbered chests must be paired with even-numbered keys.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting how many even and odd-numbered chests and keys are available. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the count of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the count of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Separating the chests into even and odd groups based on their numbers.\n   - Separating the keys into even and odd groups similarly.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible matches for each group (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = sum(1 for x in chests if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = sum(1 for x in keys if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    matching1 = min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n    matching2 = min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    \n    print(matching1 + matching2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the number of chests (n) and keys (m). The next n values are the chest numbers, followed by m key numbers.\n2. **Categorizing Chests and Keys**: The chests and keys are categorized into even and odd counts based on their numerical values. For example, all even numbers in the chest list contribute to `even_chests`, and the rest are counted as `odd_chests`.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The maximum number of matches for even chests is the smaller of `even_chests` and `odd_keys`. Similarly, the matches for odd chests is the smaller of `odd_chests` and `even_keys`. The total matches are the sum of these two values.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the sum of the two maximum matches calculated.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without explicitly checking each possible pair, thus optimizing both time and space complexity.",
