The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are only concerned with the parity (even or odd) of the numbers.\n Condition: a_i + b_j is odd => one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can split the chests and keys into two groups:\n   - Chestes with even numbers (E_c)\n   - Chestes with odd numbers (O_c)\n\n Similarly for keys:\n   - Keys with even numbers (E_k)\n   - Keys with odd numbers (O_k)\n\n Then, an even chest can be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can be opened by an even key.\n\n But note: one key can be used only once and one chest only once.\n\n So we have two independent bipartite matching problems? Actually, we can think of it as:\n\n We need to assign keys to chests such that:\n   - Each even chest must be matched with an odd key.\n   - Each odd chest must be matched with an even key.\n\n However, note that the same key cannot be used twice and the same chest cannot be opened twice.\n\n Since the condition for even and odd are independent, we can consider:\n\n Let:\n   e_c = number of even chests\n   o_c = number of odd chests\n\n   e_k = number of even keys\n   o_k = number of odd keys\n\n Then, the maximum matching we can get is limited by:\n\n For even chests: they require odd keys. The maximum number of even chests we can open is min(e_c, o_k).\n For odd chests: they require even keys. The maximum number of odd chests we can open is min(o_c, e_k).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use each key only once. But the two sets of requirements (even chests needing odd keys and odd chests needing even keys) do not share keys.\n\n Therefore, the total maximum chests we can open is:\n\n   min(e_c, o_k) + min(o_c, e_k)\n\n But wait: what if there are overlapping constraints? Actually, the two conditions are independent because:\n\n - The even chests only use odd keys, and the odd chests only use even keys. There is no overlap in key usage between the two.\n\n However, note: the total available odd keys are o_k, and we use some for even chests and none for odd chests. Similarly, even keys are only used for odd chests.\n\n But the catch: the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint, so we can use the odd keys for even chests without affecting the even keys for odd chests.\n\n However, we must also note that the total number of keys we use is the sum of the two min operations, and we are constrained by the counts of keys and chests.\n\n But is this formula correct?\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> parities: [odd, even, even, even, odd] \n        -> e_c = 3, o_c = 2\n   keys = [8,4,7,20] -> parities: [even, even, odd, even] -> e_k = 3, o_k = 1\n\n   Then, even chests (3) can use odd keys (1) -> min(3,1)=1\n         odd chests (2) can use even keys (3) -> min(2,3)=2\n   Total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=5, m=1, chests = [2,4,6,8,10] (all even) -> e_c=5, o_c=0\n   keys = [5] (odd) -> e_k=0, o_k=1\n   Then, even chests: min(5,1)=1, odd chests: min(0,0)=0 -> total 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: n=1, m=4, chests=[10] (even) -> e_c=1, o_c=0\n   keys=[20,30,40,50] (all even) -> e_k=4, o_k=0\n   Then, even chests: min(1,0)=0, odd chests: min(0,4)=0 -> total 0 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the even and odd numbers in the chests and keys, then compute:\n\n   result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Steps:\n   Read n, m.\n   Read the list of n integers for chests.\n   Read the list of m integers for keys.\n\n   Count:\n      even_chests = count of a_i % 2 == 0\n      odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n      even_keys = count of b_j % 2 == 0\n      odd_keys = m - even_keys\n\n   Then, result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n But wait: let me check with the example: \n   Example: chests = [9,14,6,2,11] -> even_chests = 3, odd_chests=2; keys=[8,4,7,20] -> even_keys=3, odd_keys=1 -> 3+2? No, wait: \n        even_chests (3) uses odd_keys (1) -> 1\n        odd_chests (2) uses even_keys (3) -> 2\n        total 3.\n\n However, what if we have more keys than needed? We are limited by the minimum of the required keys and available keys.\n\n But note: the two types of keys are being used independently. The odd keys are only used for even_chests, and even keys for odd_chests.\n\n So the above calculation is correct.\n\n However, there is a potential issue: the problem says one key can be used at most once. Our counting does account for that because we are using the available keys from their respective groups.\n\n Let me test with another example:\n\n   Example: \n        Chests: [2,4,6] (all even) -> even_chests=3, odd_chests=0\n        Keys: [1,3,5] (all odd) -> even_keys=0, odd_keys=3\n        Then, even_chests: min(3,3)=3, odd_chests: min(0,0)=0 -> total 3.\n\n   Example: \n        Chests: [1,3,5] (all odd) -> even_chests=0, odd_chests=3\n        Keys: [2,4,6] (all even) -> even_keys=3, odd_keys=0\n        Then, even_chests: min(0,0)=0, odd_chests: min(3,3)=3 -> total 3.\n\n   Example: \n        Chests: [1,3,5] (all odd) -> even_chests=0, odd_chests=3\n        Keys: [2,4] (two even) -> even_keys=2, odd_keys=0\n        Then, even_chests: min(0,0)=0, odd_chests: min(3,2)=2 -> total 2.\n\n   Example: \n        Chests: [1,3,5] (all odd) -> even_chests=0, odd_chests=3\n        Keys: [1,3] (two odd) -> even_keys=0, odd_keys=2\n        Then, even_chests: min(0,2)=0, odd_chests: min(3,0)=0 -> total 0.\n\n This makes sense because for odd chests we need even keys, but we don't have any.\n\n Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n Code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight revolves around the parity (even or odd) of the numbers on the chests and keys. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The condition for a key to open a chest is that the sum of their numbers must be odd. This translates to one being even and the other being odd. Therefore, even-numbered chests can only be opened by odd-numbered keys, and vice versa.\n2. **Intuition**: By categorizing the chests and keys into even and odd groups, we can independently calculate how many chests can be opened from each group. The solution involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys.\n   - The maximum number of even chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of even chests and odd keys.\n   - The maximum number of odd chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm efficiently counts the relevant categories and applies simple arithmetic to determine the result, leveraging the fact that the two conditions (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys) are independent of each other.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves linear scans of the input lists to count even and odd numbers, resulting in an O(n + m) time complexity, which is optimal for the given constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n            \n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n            \n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the number of chests (n) and keys (m).\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Chests**: The code iterates through the list of chest numbers, counting how many are even. The remaining chests are implicitly odd.\n3. **Counting Even and Odd Keys**: Similarly, the code counts even and odd keys from the provided list.\n4. **Calculating Result**: The result is computed by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys (for even chests requiring odd keys) and the minimum of odd chests and even keys (for odd chests requiring even keys). The sum of these two minima gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, providing the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
