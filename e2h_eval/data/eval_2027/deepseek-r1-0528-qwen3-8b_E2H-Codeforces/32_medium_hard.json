    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing an element from the array will remove either the minimum or the maximum (or both) from the current min and max.\n\n However, note that the instability is defined as (max - min). If we remove one element, the new min or max might change.\n\n Approach:\n 1. Sort the array.\n 2. The idea is that we can consider removing one of the elements. Then the instability would be the difference between the maximum of the remaining elements and the minimum of the remaining elements.\n\n But note: if we remove an element that is not the global min or max, then the min and max of the entire array remain the same? Actually, no: if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max are still the same. However, if we remove the only min or the only max, then the min or max changes.\n\n Therefore, we have two types of removals:\n\n   a) Removing an element that is the current minimum (if there are multiple mins, then after removal the next smallest becomes the min)\n   b) Removing an element that is the current maximum (if there are multiple maxes, then after removal the next largest becomes the max)\n\n Also, we can remove an element in the middle. But note: removing an element from the middle doesn't change the overall min and max, so the instability remains the same as the original array.\n\n However, wait: what if we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min or the only occurrence of the max? Then the min or max changes.\n\n But note: if there are duplicates, then even if we remove one occurrence of the min, the min might not change because there are other min values.\n\n So, we can think:\n\n Let the sorted array be `b`.\n Then the original instability is `b[n-1] - b[0]`.\n\n Now, if we remove one element, the resulting array has two possibilities for min and max:\n\n Possibility 1: The min remains `b[0]` and the max becomes `b[n-1]` (if we remove an element that is not the max). But if we remove the max, then the max becomes `b[n-2]`. Similarly, if we remove the min, the min becomes `b[1]`.\n\n However, we can also remove an element that is neither the min nor the max, then the min and max remain the same.\n\n But note: the problem allows us to remove exactly one element. We want the minimum instability.\n\n How can we compute the answer?\n\n We can consider the following:\n\n Option 1: Remove the first element (min) -> then the new min is `b[1]` and the max is `b[n-1]`, so instability = `b[n-1] - b[1]`\n Option 2: Remove the last element (max) -> then the new max is `b[n-2]` and the min is `b[0]`, so instability = `b[n-2] - b[0]`\n Option 3: Remove an element from the middle? Actually, we can also consider the possibility that the best removal is somewhere in the middle? \n\n But note: if we remove an element that is not the first or last, then the min and max do not change, so the instability remains `b[n-1]-b[0]`. However, sometimes it might be beneficial to remove an element that is not the first or last if the array has duplicates and the goal is to reduce the range? Actually, no: because the min and max are fixed by the entire array. Removing an interior element doesn't change the min and max.\n\n However, wait: what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4] and we remove 2? Then the array becomes [1,3,4] -> instability 4-1=3, same as original. But if we remove the first element, then [2,3,4] -> 4-2=2, which is better.\n\n So, we don't need to consider interior removals because they don't change the instability. We only need to consider removals at the ends? Actually, no: because sometimes we might have an array like [1, 2, 100, 101] and removing the 100 might not help, but removing the 2 might help? Actually, let's see:\n\n Original: min=1, max=101 -> instability 100.\n\n Remove 2: [1,100,101] -> min=1, max=101 -> still 100.\n Remove 1: [2,100,101] -> min=2, max=101 -> 99.\n Remove 100: [1,2,101] -> min=1, max=101 -> 100.\n Remove 101: [1,2,100] -> min=1, max=100 -> 99.\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is the second smallest? Then the min doesn't change (if there's still a 1) but the max might change? Actually, in this example, the max didn't change until we removed 101. \n\n However, consider: [1, 1, 2, 100, 101]. Then if we remove one of the 1's, the min becomes 1 (because there's still a 1) and the max remains 101. So the instability is 100. But if we remove the 101, then the array becomes [1,1,2,100] -> instability 100-1=99. \n\n Alternatively, what if we remove the 100? Then the array becomes [1,1,2,101] -> instability 101-1=100.\n\n So we see that sometimes removing an element that is not the min or max can lead to a larger instability? Actually, no: because we are trying to minimize the instability. In this case, removing the 101 gives 99, which is better than 100.\n\n But note: we cannot remove an arbitrary element arbitrarily without checking the effect on the entire range.\n\n Actually, the key observation is: the min and max of the entire array are fixed. The only way to reduce the instability is to remove either the current min or the current max, OR if we remove an element that is part of the \"extreme\" set (like the min or the max) then the range might shrink.\n\n However, note: if we remove an element that is not the current min or current max, the min and max remain the same. Therefore, the instability does not change.\n\n But wait: what if the array has duplicate minima? Then even if we remove one min, the min doesn't change (because there are other minima). Similarly for maxima.\n\n So the strategy:\n\n 1. Sort the array.\n 2. Consider candidate removals: \n    a) Remove the first element (then the new instability is `arr[-1] - arr[1]`)\n    b) Remove the last element (then the new instability is `arr[-2] - arr[0]`)\n    c) Additionally, we must consider the possibility of removing an element that is the only occurrence of the min or the only occurrence of the max, but note: if there are duplicates, then removing one min won't change the min.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove exactly one element. The problem does not require removing an end element. But as argued, removing an interior element does not change the min and max, so the instability remains the original.\n\n Therefore, the minimal instability must be achieved by either:\n\n   candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]   [removing the first element]\n   candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]   [removing the last element]\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min (but not the first occurrence) and there are multiple min? Then the instability remains the same. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max (but not the last occurrence) and there are multiple max, then the instability remains the same.\n\n However, we can generalize:\n\n For each distinct value, we can consider removals that remove one occurrence and then recalc the min and max. But that would be O(n) and n can be up to 10^5.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since the array is sorted, the min is at index0 and the max at index n-1.\n\n We note that the instability after removal is:\n\n   If we remove an element that is the only min (i.e., the first element is the only occurrence of the min), then the new min is the next element (if any). Similarly for the max.\n\n But note: we don't know if the min is repeated. We can use:\n\n   candidate = min( \n        arr[-1] - arr[1],   # if we remove the first occurrence of the min (the very first element) then the min becomes arr[1]\n        arr[-2] - arr[0]     # if we remove the last occurrence of the max then the max becomes arr[-2]\n   )\n\n However, what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then the instability is the original (arr[-1]-arr[0]), but we are already considering two candidates that might be lower.\n\n But wait: what if we remove an element that is the first occurrence of the min, but there is another min? Then the min doesn't change, so the instability is still the same as the original. Similarly for max.\n\n Therefore, we must consider:\n\n   Let the original min = arr[0], original max = arr[-1].\n\n   The instability after removal is the maximum of the remaining numbers minus the minimum of the remaining numbers.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n      candidate1: remove the first element (which is the min) -> then the new min is arr[1] (if exists) and the max is arr[-1] (if the removed element wasn't the only max, but actually if we remove the min, the max remains unless we remove the max too, but we are only removing one element). However, if the array has only two elements, then removing one leaves one element, then the instability is 0.\n\n   Actually, we can consider:\n\n   For i in range(n):\n        Create a new array without the i-th element (but we don't want to do that for each i because n can be 10^5).\n\n   We need an efficient way.\n\n   Insight: The min and max of the entire array are fixed. The removal of one element may:\n\n        - Remove the current min, then the new min is the next smallest (which is the first element if there are duplicates, or the next distinct element).\n        - Remove the current max, then the new max is the next largest.\n\n   But note: the array is sorted. So:\n\n        Without loss of generality, if we remove an element at index i, then:\n\n        - The new min is arr[0] if i != 0, otherwise arr[1].\n        - The new max is arr[-1] if i != n-1, otherwise arr[-2].\n\n   However, that is not true: if we remove an element that is not the first or last, then the min and max remain the same. But if we remove an element that is the first, then the min becomes arr[1] (if n>=2). Similarly, if we remove the last, then the max becomes arr[-2].\n\n   Therefore, the instability after removing index i is:\n\n        If i == 0: instability = arr[-1] - (arr[1] if n>=2 else arr[0])   [But if n==1, we don't have to consider because n>=2 by input]\n        If i == n-1: instability = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n        Otherwise: instability = arr[-1] - arr[0]\n\n   But wait: what if we remove an element that is the first and the last? That is, if the array has two elements, then removing the first element leaves one element, so the instability is 0. But our formula for i==0 would be arr[-1] - arr[1] -> but then arr[1] is the last element (index1) which is the same as the element at index0? Actually, for two-element array [a0, a1] (sorted):\n\n        Removing a0: then the array is [a1] -> instability = a1 - a1 = 0.\n        Removing a1: then the array is [a0] -> instability = a0 - a0 = 0.\n\n   So in the two-element array, we must set:\n\n        candidate1 = a1 - a1 = 0 (if we remove the first element, the remaining element is a1, so min and max are a1)\n        candidate2 = a0 - a0 = 0 (if we remove the last element, the remaining element is a0)\n\n   But our formula for i==0: arr[-1] - arr[1] = a1 - a1 = 0, which is correct.\n\n   Similarly, i==n-1: arr[-2] - arr[0] = a0 - a0 = 0.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute for every removal? But n can be up to 10^5, and we have 10^5 candidates. Then we take the minimum instability over all removals.\n\n   However, note: we don't need to iterate over every removal. Because:\n\n        - Removing an element that is not the first or last leaves the instability unchanged (so we don't care about those because we are looking for minimum, and the ones that change the instability are only the removals at the ends? Actually, no: what if the array is [1,2,3,4,100000]? Then removing an interior element (like 2) doesn't change the min and max, so the instability is 99999. But if we remove the last element, the instability becomes 4-1=3, which is much better.\n\n   But wait, we can also remove the first element: then the array becomes [2,3,4,100000] -> instability 99998, which is worse than removing the last element (3). So we are interested in the removals that change the min or max.\n\n   However, note: the removal of an element might change the min or the max, but if we remove an element that is not the first or last, it doesn't change the min or max. But in the above example, removing the last element changed the max from 100000 to 4, which is a big reduction.\n\n   But what if we remove an element that is the min but not the first occurrence? Then the min remains the same, so the instability doesn't change.\n\n   Therefore, we should consider:\n\n        candidate1: remove the first element (if there is at least one element after the first) -> then the new instability = arr[-1] - arr[1] (if n>=2, then arr[1] exists)\n        candidate2: remove the last element -> then the new instability = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n\n        And also, what if we remove an element that is the first occurrence of the min and there are duplicates of the min? Then the min doesn't change, so the instability remains the same. Similarly for max.\n\n   But note: we don't have to consider duplicates because if there are duplicates, then removing one min doesn't change the min. So the instability remains the same as the original.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal instability must be the minimum between:\n\n        candidate1: arr[-1] - arr[1]   [if we remove the first element, and if the first element is the only min, then the min changes; if there are multiple mins, then the min remains arr[0] so the instability is arr[-1]-arr[0] (same as original). But wait, if we remove the first element and the array has duplicates, then the min doesn't change. So the instability is the same as the original. Then why consider candidate1? Because if we remove the first element and the min doesn't change, then the instability is the same as the original. But if we remove the first element and the min changes, then we get a candidate.\n\n   Actually, we must consider every removal that might change the min or max. But note: the removal of an element that is the first occurrence of the min (and the min is unique) changes the min. Similarly for the max.\n\n   However, we can also consider: the instability after removal is the maximum value in the remaining array minus the minimum value in the remaining array.\n\n   We can precompute:\n\n        Let b = sorted(a)\n\n        Then the original min = b[0], original max = b[-1]\n\n        Now, if we remove an element, the new min is:\n            If we remove b[0] and there is no other b[0] (i.e., the first element is unique) then the new min is the next distinct number? Actually, no: the next smallest element is b[1]. But if b[0] is duplicated, then even if we remove one occurrence, the min remains b[0] (because there's still at least one b[0] left).\n\n        Similarly, the new max is b[-2] if we remove the last element and the last element is unique, otherwise it remains b[-1].\n\n   But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We are not forced to remove an end element. However, if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the min and max remain the same. So the instability is the same as the original.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n        candidate1: if we remove the first element, then instability = b[-1] - (b[1] if the first element is unique? Actually, no: we always remove the first element and then the new min is the smallest element in the remaining array. The remaining array's min is the minimum of the rest. Since the array is sorted, the first element is gone, so the new min is b[1] (if the array has at least two elements). But wait, what if the first element is duplicated? Then the min is still b[0] (because there are other b[0]'s) and the max is b[-1]. So the instability remains the same.\n\n        Actually, we can break down:\n\n            When we remove an element at position i, the new min is:\n                If i==0, then the new min is b[1] (because the array is sorted, and we removed the smallest element, and the next smallest is b[1]).\n                But if there are duplicates, then even if we remove the first element, the min might still be b[0] (if there is another b[0] at index>=1). However, if we remove the first element and there is another b[0] at index1, then the new min is still b[0]. \n\n        Therefore, the new min is:\n            If we remove an element at index i, then the new min is:\n                min_remaining = b[i] > b[0] ? b[0] : (if we remove the first element, then the next element is b[1], but if there is a duplicate of b[0] then the min remains b[0])\n\n        This complicates.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n        The instability after removal is:\n\n            instability = max(remaining) - min(remaining)\n\n        We can precompute:\n\n            Let left_min[i] = the minimum value in the array from index i to the end (but actually we can use the fact that the array is sorted: the min of the entire array without the i-th element is the smallest element that is not at i? Actually, because the array is sorted, the min of the entire array without the i-th element is:\n\n                If i==0, then the min is b[1] (if n>1) but wait, if there are duplicates, then the min is still b[0] if there is at least one more b[0] (i.e., if b[1]==b[0]). \n\n        Similarly, the max of the array without the i-th element is:\n\n                If i==n-1, then the max is b[n-2] (if n>1) but if there are duplicates, then the max is still b[n-1] if there is at least one more b[n-1].\n\n   We can do:\n\n        For each index i, the new min is:\n            if i == 0: \n                min_remaining = b[1] if n==1? no, n>=2. But wait, if n==1, but n>=2 so we skip.\n                Actually, if we remove the first element, the next min is the smallest element in the rest. Since the array is sorted, the rest starts at b[1]. But if there are duplicates, then the min is b[0] (if there's at least one b[0] left). However, if we remove the first element, then the rest includes b[1] (which is >= b[0]). The min of the rest is the smallest element in the rest, which is b[0] if there's any b[0] left (i.e., if b[1]==b[0] then min_remaining = b[0]; else min_remaining = b[1]).\n\n        Similarly, for the max: \n            if i == n-1: \n                max_remaining = b[n-2] if there is no duplicate of b[n-1] at index n-2? Actually, the max of the rest is the maximum element in the rest, which is b[n-2] if b[n-2] >= b[n-1]? No, because the array is sorted, so b[n-2] <= b[n-1]. The max_remaining is b[n-1] if there is another b[n-1] (i.e., if b[n-2]==b[n-1]) then the max is still b[n-1]. Otherwise, the max is b[n-2].\n\n   This becomes messy.\n\n   Another approach: since the array is sorted, we can consider the following:\n\n        The overall instability of the entire array is M = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n        Now, when we remove an element, the new instability is:\n\n            If we remove an element that is not the global min and not the global max, then the instability remains M.\n\n            If we remove the global min (only if it is the only occurrence of the min), then the new min becomes the next smallest, which is the first element that is greater than b[0]. But note: if there are duplicates, then the min doesn't change.\n\n            Similarly, if we remove the global max (only if it is the only occurrence of the max), then the new max becomes the previous largest.\n\n        Therefore, we can consider:\n\n            candidate1 = M   (if we remove an element that is not the unique min or not the unique max, then instability remains M)\n\n            candidate2 = (if the first element is the only min) then instability = b[-1] - b[1]   (because min becomes b[1])\n            candidate3 = (if the last element is the only max) then instability = b[-2] - b[0]   (because max becomes b[-2])\n\n        But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min (unique) and the max (unique)? Then we get both changes. But we are only removing one element.\n\n        However, note: we are only removing one element. So we can only change one end.\n\n        But here's the catch: we are allowed to remove one element. We can choose which one. We are not forced to remove the min or the max.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n            M (if we remove an element that is not the unique min and not the unique max, or if we remove an element that is the min but duplicated, or the max but duplicated, then we get M or maybe less? Actually, no: if we remove an element that is the min and duplicated, then the min remains the same, so the instability is M. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max and duplicated, then the instability is M. \n\n            But if we remove an element that is the min and unique, then the instability becomes b[-1]-b[1] (which is less than M, because b[1] >= b[0] so M = b[-1]-b[0] >= b[-1]-b[1]). Similarly, if we remove the unique max, then the instability becomes b[-2]-b[0] (which is less than M).\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = b[-1] - b[1]   (if we remove the first element and the first element is the only min? Actually, we don't know if the first element is the only min. We can check: if b[1] > b[0] then the first element is the only min. Otherwise, if b[1]==b[0], then there are duplicates and the min doesn't change.\n\n        But wait, we don't need to check uniqueness for the entire array, because the array is sorted. The condition for the min to change when we remove the first element is that the next element is greater than the first. Similarly, the condition for the max to change when we remove the last element is that the previous element is less than the last.\n\n        However, we can also consider removals that are not the first or last but might help? Actually, no, because removing an interior element doesn't change the min and max.\n\n        But wait: what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4] and we remove 3? Then the array becomes [1,2,4] -> min=1, max=4, instability=3, same as the original (4-1=3). So no change.\n\n        However, consider an array where the min and max are not at the ends? They are sorted, so the min is at the beginning and max at the end.\n\n        Therefore, the solution:\n\n            Let b = sorted(a)\n            Let M = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n            candidate1 = M   (if we remove an element that doesn't change the min or max)\n\n            candidate2 = b[-1] - b[1]   (if we remove the first element and the min changes, i.e., if b[0] < b[1])\n            candidate3 = b[-2] - b[0]    (if we remove the last element and the max changes, i.e., if b[-1] > b[-2])\n\n            But wait: what if we remove an element that is the first element and there are duplicates? Then the min doesn't change, so candidate2 is not valid. Similarly, if we remove the last element and there are duplicates, then candidate3 is not valid.\n\n        However, we don't know if the first element is duplicated. We can check:\n\n            Condition for candidate2: we can remove the first element and the new min is b[1] (which is greater than b[0]) only if the first element is strictly less than the second. Similarly, for candidate3: we can remove the last element and the new max is b[-2] only if the last element is strictly greater than the second last.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to remove any element. Even if we remove an element that is not the first, we might get the same effect? Actually, no: because the min and max are defined by the entire array, and the sorted array has the min at the beginning and max at the end.\n\n        However, there's a catch: we are not restricted to remove the first or last element. But we have argued that removing an interior element doesn't change the min and max. But wait, what if the array is [1, 1, 100, 100] and we remove one of the 100's? Then the max becomes 100 (still) because there's another 100. But if we remove a 1, then the min remains 1 because there are other 1's. So no change.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n            candidate2 (if applicable) and candidate3 (if applicable) and M (if no change) and also consider that we might remove an element that is not the first or last and get no change (so M is always a candidate).\n\n        But note: we can also remove an element that is the min (not necessarily the first occurrence) and if there are multiple mins, then the min doesn't change, so the instability is M. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max and there are multiple maxes, then the instability is M.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            candidate_list = []\n\n            candidate_list.append(M)   # because we can remove an element that doesn't change the min and max\n\n            # Candidate: remove an element that is the first occurrence of the min (and the min is unique) -> then instability becomes b[-1]-b[1]\n            if b[0] < b[1]:\n                candidate_list.append(b[-1] - b[1])\n\n            # Candidate: remove an element that is the last occurrence of the max (and the max is unique) -> then instability becomes b[-2]-b[0]\n            if b[-1] > b[-2]:\n                candidate_list.append(b[-2] - b[0])\n\n        Then the answer is the minimum of candidate_list.\n\n        Let's test with examples:\n\n        Example 1: [1,3,3,7] (n=4)\n\n            b = [1,3,3,7]\n            M = 7-1 = 6\n\n            Condition for candidate2: b[0] < b[1] -> 1<3 -> True, candidate2 = 7-3 = 4\n            Condition for candidate3: b[-1] > b[-2] -> 7>3 -> True, candidate3 = 3-1 = 2\n\n            Then candidate_list = [6,4,2] -> min=2 -> matches.\n\n        Example 2: [1,100000] (n=2)\n\n            b = [1,100000]\n            M = 100000-1 = 99999\n\n            Condition for candidate2: 1<100000 -> True, candidate2 = 100000-100000 = 0\n            Condition for candidate3: 100000>1 -> True, candidate3 = 1-1 = 0\n\n            Then candidate_list = [99999,0,0] -> min=0 -> matches.\n\n        Example 3: [1,2,3,4] (n=4)\n\n            b = [1,2,3,4]\n            M = 4-1=3\n\n            candidate2: 1<2 -> True, candidate2 = 4-2=2\n            candidate3: 4>3 -> True, candidate3 = 3-1=2\n\n            Then candidate_list = [3,2,2] -> min=2.\n\n            But what is the answer for [1,2,3,4]? \n                Removing the first element: [2,3,4] -> 4-2=2.\n                Removing the last element: [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2.\n                Removing an interior element (say 2): [1,3,4] -> 4-1=3 -> worse.\n                Removing an interior element (say 3): [1,2,4] -> 4-1=3 -> worse.\n\n            So 2 is the answer.\n\n        Example 4: [1,1,2,3,3] (n=5)\n\n            b = [1,1,2,3,3]\n            M = 3-1=2\n\n            candidate2: condition: b[0] < b[1] -> 1<1?

The problem states n>=2.\n\n            print(min(candidates))\n\n        However, wait: what if we have an array with two elements and they are equal? \n\n            Example: [5,5] (n=2)\n\n            M = 5-5=0\n\n            candidate2: 5<5 -> False -> skip.\n            candidate3: 5>5 -> False -> skip.\n\n            Then candidates=[0] -> output 0. Correct.\n\n        But what if the array is [5,5,5] (n=3)?\n\n            M = 5-5=0\n\n            candidate2: 5<5 -> False -> skip.\n            candidate3: 5>5 -> False -> skip.\n\n            Then output 0.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, consider: [1,2,3,4,5] (n=5)\n\n            M = 5-1=4\n\n            candidate2: 1<2 -> True, candidate2 = 5-2=3\n            candidate3: 5>4 -> True, candidate3 = 4-1=3\n\n            Then min(candidates)=3.\n\n            Check: \n                Remove first: [2,3,4,5] -> 5-2=3.\n                Remove last: [1,2,3,4] -> 4-1=3.\n\n            Correct.\n\n        But wait: is there a possibility that removing an element that is not the first or last could yield a lower instability? \n\n            In [1,2,3,4,5]: \n                Removing the first or last gives 3.\n                Removing an interior element, say 3: [1,2,4,5] -> 5-1=4 -> worse.\n                Removing 2: [1,3,4,5] -> 5-1=4 -> worse.\n\n            So no.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n            Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n            Step 2: Sort the list.\n            Step 3: Compute M = a[-1] - a[0]\n            Step 4: Initialize candidates with M.\n            Step 5: If n>=2 and a[0] < a[1], then add a[-1]-a[1]\n            Step 6: If n>=2 and a[-1] > a[-2], then add a[-2]-a[0]\n            Step 7: Print the minimum of candidates.\n\n        However, note: what if the array has more than two elements and the first two are equal? Then we cannot remove the first element to change the min? Actually, if the first two are equal, then the min is not unique. Then removing the first element doesn't change the min. Similarly, if the last two are equal, then removing the last element doesn't change the max.\n\n        But wait, our conditions are:\n\n            candidate2 is only added if a[0] < a[1] (strictly less). Similarly, candidate3 if a[-1] > a[-2] (strictly greater). \n\n        This condition is correct because:\n\n            For candidate2: we can only get a change in the min if",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in easily identifying the current minimum and maximum elements.\n2. **Calculate Original Instability**: The initial instability is the difference between the last (maximum) and first (minimum) elements of the sorted array.\n3. **Evaluate Candidates for Minimum Instability**:\n   - **Candidate 1**: Remove the first element (if it's the unique minimum). The new instability is the difference between the last element and the second element.\n   - **Candidate 2**: Remove the last element (if it's the unique maximum). The new instability is the difference between the second last element and the first element.\n4. **Determine Minimum Instability**: The answer is the smallest value among the original instability and the two candidate values (if applicable).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    M = a[-1] - a[0]\n    \n    candidates = [M]\n    \n    if n >= 2 and a[0] < a[1]:\n        candidates.append(a[-1] - a[1])\n        \n    if n >= 2 and a[-1] > a[-2]:\n        candidates.append(a[-2] - a[0])\n        \n    print(min(candidates))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n3. **Original Instability Calculation**: The initial instability (`M`) is computed as the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.\n4. **Candidate Evaluation**:\n   - If the first element is strictly less than the second, removing it reduces the instability to the difference between the last element and the second element.\n   - If the last element is strictly greater than the second last, removing it reduces the instability to the difference between the second last element and the first element.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the original instability and the two candidate values (if they exist) is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to considering only the critical elements (first and last) in the sorted array, leveraging sorting to simplify the identification of potential reductions in instability. The solution handles all edge cases, including arrays with duplicate elements or all elements being the same.",
