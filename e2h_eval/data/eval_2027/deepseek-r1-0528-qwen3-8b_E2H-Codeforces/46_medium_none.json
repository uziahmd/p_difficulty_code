    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. So we can have a subsegment that is almost strictly increasing.\n\n Approach:\n We cannot try every subsegment (n^2) because n can be up to 10^5.\n\n Idea: \n We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n 1. Precompute arrays for strictly increasing sequences without any changes and with one change.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to change one number anywhere in the subsegment.\n\n Let's consider:\n\n - Without any change, we can have a contiguous strictly increasing subsegment. But we can also fix one element to merge two increasing segments.\n\n Steps:\n\n Step 1: Precompute two arrays:\n   left[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without any change)\n   right[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment starting exactly at i (without any change)\n\n Then, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: The entire subsegment is already strictly increasing. Then answer = n.\n\n Option 2: We are allowed one change. Then we can potentially merge two increasing subsegments by fixing the element in between.\n\n But note: we can also have a segment that is strictly increasing except for one element which we can fix.\n\n Actually, we can consider each index i as the candidate for the change. Then we look for the longest subsegment that includes i and such that if we remove the effect of a_i (or change it) then the entire subsegment is strictly increasing.\n\n However, note that we are only allowed one change. So the entire subsegment must be strictly increasing except for at most one element which we fix.\n\n We can do:\n\n Let L[i] = length of increasing sequence ending at i (without change)\n Let R[i] = length of increasing sequence starting at i (without change)\n\n Then, when considering changing a_i, we can form a subsegment that spans from the start of an increasing segment to the end of another, but we must fix a_i. How?\n\n Consider: \n   We want to combine two increasing segments: [l, ..., i-1] and [i+1, ..., r] but we require that the entire segment [l, r] becomes strictly increasing after fixing a_i.\n\n Conditions for merging:\n   The segment [l, i-1] is increasing, and [i+1, r] is increasing.\n\n   Additionally, we require:\n     a_{i-1} < (new value at i) and (new value at i) < a_{i+1}\n\n But note: we can choose the new value arbitrarily. Therefore, we can set the new value to be anything between a_{i-1} and a_{i+1} (if they exist) or extend without bound if one side doesn't exist.\n\n However, if we don't have both sides, then we just take the adjacent side.\n\n But note: we can also have a segment that is entirely on one side? Actually, the problem allows us to change one number, so we can also consider segments that are already increasing and then we change one element to make the entire segment increasing? But wait, if the entire segment is already increasing, then we don't need to change, so we can get the same result by not using the change. However, sometimes we can extend an increasing segment by one change.\n\n Actually, we can consider three cases for the change at index i:\n\n Case 1: The subsegment does not include i? Then we are not using the change. But we are allowed to use the change, so we might consider segments that are broken and fixed.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"at most one\", so we can also not use the change. But the goal is to find the longest subsegment that is strictly increasing with at most one change.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can consider:\n\n   candidate1: the longest increasing contiguous segment (without any change) -> max_length_so_far\n\n   candidate2: for each i, the possibility of having a segment that has a_i changed and merges two increasing segments.\n\n   candidate3: for each i, the possibility of having a segment that has a_i changed and is still increasing (but not necessarily merging two existing increasing segments, but maybe the entire segment is built around i).\n\n But note: we are allowed to change one element. So we can also consider:\n\n   Option A: The entire segment is increasing without the change, then we have candidate from the increasing contiguous segment.\n\n   Option B: The entire segment is increasing if we change one element. \n\n How to compute candidate2 and candidate3 without O(n^2)?\n\n Let L[i] = length of increasing subsegment ending at i (without change). This is standard: \n   L[0] = 1\n   for i from 1 to n-1: \n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            L[i] = L[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            L[i] = 1\n\n Similarly, R[i] = length of increasing subsegment starting at i (without change).\n   R[n-1] = 1\n   for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            R[i] = R[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            R[i] = 1\n\n Then, we can consider:\n\n   For an index i (the one we change), the candidate length from the left part and right part is:\n\n   If i is at the boundary (either leftmost or rightmost) then we can only use one side.\n\n   Otherwise, we require that the left part (ending at i-1) and the right part (starting at i+1) can be connected by a change at i.\n\n   Condition: the last element of the left part (a[i-1]) must be less than the first element of the right part (a[i+1]). Then we can set a[i] to be a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1]. \n\n   Then the total length would be: L[i-1] + 1 (for the changed element) + R[i+1]\n\n   But wait: what if we don't have a left part or right part? \n\n   Also, what if the left part or right part is empty? Then we adjust.\n\n   However, there is a catch: what if we change an element that is in the middle of two increasing parts, but the two parts are not adjacent? Actually, we are considering the immediate neighbors.\n\n   But note: the entire segment we are forming must be strictly increasing. The condition is that the entire segment from the start of the left part to the end of the right part is strictly increasing, and we are only allowed to change one element (at i). \n\n   However, the left part and the right part are already strictly increasing, and if we set a[i] to be between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if both exist) then the entire segment will be strictly increasing.\n\n   But what if one of the sides is missing?\n\n   Example: i=0 (first element). Then we can only extend to the right. The condition is that we set a[0] to be less than a[1] (if we want to include at least two elements). Then the length is 1 (from the changed element) + R[1] (the increasing sequence starting at index1). But wait, we could also set the changed element to be very small so that the entire segment from 0 to R[1] is increasing? Actually, no, because we are forced to set a[0] to be less than a[1] to include the next element. But if we don't have a next element, then we can have just the element at 0.\n\n   Similarly, for i=n-1 (last element): we can only extend to the left.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to change one element. So we can also consider segments that are entirely on one side, but that is already covered by the increasing contiguous segments (without change). But wait, what if we change an element that is in the middle of an increasing segment? Then we break the segment? Actually, we are allowed to change one element to fix the segment. \n\n   Actually, the problem does not require the entire subsegment to be contiguous in the original array? No, it is contiguous. But we are considering contiguous subsegments.\n\n   Another idea: We can also consider that the change might fix a dip in the middle of a longer increasing sequence. But note: our left and right arrays are computed without any change. So if we have an increasing sequence that has a dip at i, then we can fix that one dip and the entire segment becomes increasing.\n\n   However, note: the entire segment must be strictly increasing. \n\n   Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] \n        Without change, the entire segment is not increasing. But if we change the 2 to 3, then we get [1,3,3,4] -> not strictly increasing. Or change to 2.5? Then [1,3,2.5,4] -> 3 < 2.5 is false. \n\n   Actually, we require strictly increasing. So the condition for merging is that a[i-1] < a[i+1] (so that we can set a[i] to a value between them). \n\n   But note: even if we have a[i-1] < a[i+1], the entire segment from the beginning of the left part to the end of the right part must be strictly increasing? Actually, no, because we are only changing one element. The left part and the right part are increasing by themselves, but we are inserting one element at position i. The condition for the entire segment is:\n\n        ... , a[i-1], (changed value), a[i+1], ...\n\n        We require a[i-1] < (changed value) < a[i+1] and also the left part (from the start to i-1) is increasing and the right part (from i+1 to the end) is increasing.\n\n   But note: the left part and the right part are independent. The entire segment must be strictly increasing. Since we are inserting one element, the connections are:\n\n        [left part] must end with a[i-1] (if left part exists) and then the changed value must be greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1] (if right part exists). And the left part is increasing and the right part is increasing.\n\n   However, what if we have more than one violation? Actually, we are only allowed one change. So we can only fix one violation. In fact, the entire subsegment must be increasing except for one element (which we fix). But note: the entire subsegment might have multiple violations, but we are allowed to fix one. Actually, we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily. So we can fix one violation, but if there are two separate violations, then we cannot fix both.\n\n   However, note: we are considering a contiguous subsegment. We can fix one element and the rest must be increasing. So the entire contiguous subsegment must be increasing except for one element (which we fix). \n\n   How to check for a given contiguous subsegment whether we can fix it with one change? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   Let dp[i] be the maximum length of a strictly increasing subsegment ending at i, allowing at most one change (and the change can be anywhere in the segment, but we are building from left to right). But note: the change can be anywhere, so we cannot simply do a DP that only considers the current element and the previous.\n\n   We need to consider:\n\n        Option 1: The segment does not use a change: then we can use the standard increasing condition.\n\n        Option 2: The segment uses one change. Then we must account for one violation.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Let f(i, changes) = the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at i with at most 'changes' changes.\n\n   But n is 10^5 and we are allowed one change. Then we can have two states: 0 changes and 1 change.\n\n        f0[i] = length of strictly increasing ending at i with 0 changes (so far)\n        f1[i] = length of strictly increasing ending at i with 1 change (so far)\n\n   Transition:\n\n        For 0 changes (f0[i]):\n            if i==0: f0[0]=1, f1[0]=1\n            else:\n                if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                    f0[i] = f0[i-1] + 1\n                    f1[i] = f1[i-1] + 1   # because if we have 0 changes so far, then we don't use the change here, but we can carry the state from 0 to i.\n                else:\n                    f0[i] = 1\n                    # for f1[i]: we can consider that we use one change to fix the condition. But note: we can use the change at any point, not necessarily at i.\n\n        However, the above simple DP does not account for the change being used earlier.\n\n        Actually, we need to consider that we can use the change at any element. So:\n\n        For f0[i]:\n            if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                f0[i] = f0[i-1] + 1\n            else:\n                f0[i] = 1\n\n        For f1[i]:\n            if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                # Then we don't need to use the change at i, so we can take the state from f0[i-1] and f1[i-1]?\n                # Actually, we can continue the chain from either state.\n                f1[i] = max(f0[i-1], f1[i-1]) + 1   # because we don't use the change at i, so we can extend the chain from the previous state (whether it was changed or not) but then we are not using the change at i, so we must have been increasing until i.\n            else:\n                # We can use the change at i to fix the condition. Then we reset the chain to 1? But wait, we can also consider that the change was used earlier, so we don't necessarily reset.\n\n                Actually, we can consider: we are allowed to use the change at any element. So if we use the change at i, then we can set a[i] to any value. But we must ensure the chain is increasing. However, we don't know the previous value. \n\n                But note: we are building the chain from left to right. The condition for the chain ending at i is that the previous element (if we didn't use the change at i) must be less than the new value. But since we are allowed to set a[i] arbitrarily, we can set it to be greater than the previous element (if we are in a chain that ended at i-1) and also we can set it to be greater than the element at i-2 if we skipped i-1? Actually, no: the chain must be contiguous.\n\n                Actually, the chain ending at i must be contiguous. The condition for including i is that the element at i-1 (if we didn't skip it) must be less than the new value. But we are allowed to change one element (which we are now doing at i). However, we can also consider that we might have already used the change somewhere else, so we are not allowed to change again.\n\n                The correct way:\n\n                We have two states:\n\n                  f0[i] = length of strictly increasing segment ending at i with 0 changes so far.\n\n                  f1[i] = length of strictly increasing segment ending at i with exactly 1 change so far.\n\n                Then:\n\n                  f0[i] = \n                    if i==0: 1\n                    else: \n                        if a[i] > a[i-1]: f0[i] = f0[i-1] + 1\n                        else: 1\n\n                  For f1[i]:\n                    We have two possibilities:\n                    1. We use the change at i: then we can set a[i] to any value. But we must satisfy the condition that the previous element (if we are extending) is less than the new value. However, we don't know the previous element if we skipped some? Actually, we are building the chain from left to right.\n\n                    We can consider:\n\n                      Option A: We did not use the change at i, then we require a[i] > a[i-1] and we can extend the chain from the previous state (either f0[i-1] or f1[i-1] if we already used the change). But wait, if we didn't use the change at i, then we are not fixing the condition at i, so the condition must hold: a[i] > a[i-1]. Then we can extend the chain from the previous element.\n\n                      Option B: We use the change at i. Then we can set a[i] to any value. But note: we can set it to be greater than the previous element (if we are including the previous element) OR we can break the chain and start a new one? Actually, we can always set a[i] to be greater than the previous element, but wait: what if the chain we are extending has a gap? Actually, we are building the chain from left to right. The condition for the chain ending at i is that the element before i must be less than the new a[i]. However, if we skip i-1 (because we used the change at i, but we are not skipping i-1) then we are still considering the immediate left element.\n\n                    Actually, we must consider: the change can be used to fix a dip, but we can also use it to extend an increasing chain even if the immediate left element is too small? \n\n                    But note: we are building the chain from left to right. The condition for the chain ending at i is that the element at i-1 must be less than a[i] (if we don't use a change at i) OR if we use a change at i, then we can set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1] (to extend) OR we can set it to be greater than a[i-2] if we skip i-1? \n\n                    However, the chain must be contiguous. The change is applied to one element, and then we require the entire contiguous segment to be strictly increasing.\n\n                    The standard solution for this problem is known and uses the following:\n\n                    Let L[i] and R[i] as defined above.\n\n                    Then, for each i from 0 to n-1, we consider:\n\n                      candidate = 1  (at least the element i itself)\n\n                      If i>=1 and i<=n-2: \n                         if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                             candidate = L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1]\n                         else:\n                             # we can still form a segment that uses i as the changed element, but we cannot merge the two sides, so we can only extend one side.\n                             candidate = max(L[i-1], R[i+1]) + 1   # but wait, we can also extend one side arbitrarily? Actually, no: because if a[i-1] >= a[i+1], then we cannot set a[i] to be both greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1] (since that requires a[i-1] < a[i+1]). But we can set a[i] arbitrarily. However, if a[i-1] >= a[i+1], then we cannot merge the two sides. Then the best we can do is to extend the longest of the two sides (if any) and the element i.\n\n                      But wait, what if we don't have both sides? Then:\n\n                      For the boundaries:\n                         Left boundary (i=0): candidate = 1 + R[1]   (if n>1) but wait, we are allowed to set a[0] arbitrarily, so we can set it to be less than a[1] (if n>1) then we get 2 elements. But if n==1, then candidate=1.\n\n                      Similarly, right boundary (i=n-1): candidate = 1 + L[n-2]\n\n                    However, note: the above candidate for the middle index i is:\n\n                         candidate_i = 1\n                         if i>=1 and i<=n-2:\n                             if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                                 candidate_i = L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1]\n                             else:\n                                 candidate_i = max(L[i-1], R[i+1]) + 1\n\n                         But also, we can have a segment that is entirely on the left (without the right) or entirely on the right (without the left). But note: the above candidate for the middle index i already considers the entire left part (L[i-1]) and the entire right part (R[i+1]).\n\n                    However, wait: is that correct? \n\n                    Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] \n                    i=2 (0-indexed, so the 3rd element, which is 2) -> then we check a[1]=3 and a[3]=4 -> 3<4 -> true, so candidate_i = L[1] + 1 + R[3]\n\n                    What is L[1]? \n                       a0=1, a1=3 -> L[1]=2 (since 1<3 -> L[1]=L[0]+1=2)\n                    What is R[3]?\n                       a3=4, then R[3]=1 (because we are at the last element, so R[3]=1) OR wait, let me compute R properly:\n\n                    Actually, for R: \n                       R[3] = 1 (if we start at index3, then the increasing sequence starting at index3 is just [4])\n                    Then candidate_i = 2+1+1 = 4.\n\n                    The entire array is of length 4, and we are saying the answer is 4. But wait, the example input was:\n\n                    Input: 6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6 -> output 5\n\n                    Our example [1,3,2,4] should be fixed to [1,3, something,4] and the something must be between 3 and 4, say 3.5, then [1,3,3.5,4] is strictly increasing. So the entire segment of length 4 is fixed.\n\n                    But note: the example [1,3,2,4] has length 4, so the candidate for i=2 (0-indexed) is 4.\n\n                    Now, what about the entire array? We must consider all indices. \n\n                    However, we must also consider the possibility that the entire array is increasing without any change. Then we don't need to use the change. But in [1,3,2,4] the entire array is not increasing (because 3>2). So we must use the change.\n\n                    But note: the problem says \"at most one\", so we can also consider segments that are increasing without change.\n\n                    We must combine:\n\n                    Step 1: Find the maximum value of:\n                         candidate0 = max(L)   [without any change]\n                         candidate1 = max(over all i: candidate_i)   [with one change]\n\n                    Then the answer is max(candidate0, candidate1)\n\n                    However, candidate0 might be larger than candidate1? Actually, no: because if we have an increasing segment, then we don't need to change, and that segment is already strictly increasing. But note: the candidate0 is the length of the longest contiguous increasing segment without change. But candidate1 might be a segment that is broken and then fixed, and that broken segment might be longer than the contiguous increasing segment.\n\n                    Example: [1,2,5,3,4] \n                    Without change: the increasing contiguous segments are [1,2,5] (length3) and [3,4] (length2). So candidate0=3.\n\n                    With change: consider i=3 (the element 3) -> then we can set a[3]=4 (if we set to 4, then [2,5,4] is not increasing. Alternatively, set a[3]= something between 5 and 4? But 5>4, so we cannot set a number between 5 and 4. So we cannot merge [1,2,5] and [3,4] by changing the 3. \n\n                    But wait, we can change the 5? \n\n                    Consider i=2 (the element 5): \n                         Check a[1]=2 and a[3]=3 -> 2<3 -> true, so candidate_i = L[1] + 1 + R[3] = (L[1]: [1,2] -> 2) + 1 + (R[3]: [3,4] -> 2) = 2+1+2=5.\n\n                    So the entire array becomes [1,2, (changed 5 to something between 2 and 3, say 2.5), 3,4] -> [1,2,2.5,3,4] -> strictly increasing. So candidate1=5.\n\n                    Therefore, we must consider all indices.\n\n                    However, the above candidate_i for index i (0-indexed) is:\n\n                      candidate_i = 1  (minimum length)\n                      if i>=1 and i<=n-2:\n                         if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                             candidate_i = L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1]\n                         else:\n                             candidate_i = max(L[i-1], R[i+1]) + 1\n\n                    But wait, what if the segment we form is not the entire array? We are allowed to take any contiguous subsegment. The above candidate_i considers a contiguous segment that goes from (i - L[i-1]) to (i + R[i+1]), but actually we are taking the entire left increasing segment ending at i-1 and the entire right increasing segment starting at i+1. However, we are allowed to take a subsegment that does not necessarily extend to the entire left and right? \n\n                    Actually, the problem is: we are allowed to change one element, and we want the longest contiguous subsegment that is strictly increasing after the change.\n\n                    The above candidate_i for a middle index i assumes that we take the entire left increasing segment (that ends at i-1) and the entire right increasing segment (that starts at i+1). But what if we don't take the entire left or right? \n\n                    Example: [10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and we are considering the change at the element 1 (which is at index1). Then the left part: [10] and the right part: [2,3,...,10] (length 9). Then candidate_i = L[0] (which is 1) + 1 + R[2] (which is 8) -> 1+1+8=10. That is the entire array.\n\n                    But what if we have: [1, 100, 2, 3, 4] and we consider the change at index1 (value 100). Then the left part: [1] (L[0]=1) and the right part: [2,3,4] (R[2]=3). Then candidate_i = 1+1+3=5. But the entire array is [1,100,2,3,4] and after changing 100 to, say, 1.5, we get [1,1.5,2,3,4] which is increasing. So the entire array is fixed. However, what if we don't want the entire array? Actually, we are maximizing the length.\n\n                    But note: the problem says contiguous subsegment. So the candidate_i we are computing is the entire contiguous subsegment from (i - L[i-1]) to (i + R[i+1]) (if we merge) or from (i - L[i-1]) to i (if we don't merge the right) or from i to (i + R[i+1]) (if we don't merge the left). \n\n                    However, we must consider that the change is applied at i, and the entire subsegment must be strictly increasing.\n\n                    But note: the left part (ending at i-1) is increasing, and the right part (starting at i+1) is increasing. When we merge, we require that the last element of the left part (a[i-1]) is less than the first element of the right part (a[i+1]) so that we can set a[i] to be between them.\n\n                    However, what if the left part is not the entire contiguous increasing sequence to the left? Actually, our L[i-1] is defined as the length of the increasing sequence ending at i-1. So the segment from (i-1 - L[i-1]+1) to i-1 is increasing. Similarly for R[i+1].\n\n                    But note: the entire segment we are forming is from (i - L[i-1]) to (i + R[i+1]). But wait, the left part is from (i-L[i-1]) to i-1, and the right part is from i+1 to (i+R[i+1]). Then the entire segment is (i-L[i-1]) to (i+R[i+1]). \n\n                    However, is that contiguous? Yes, because we are replacing the element at i, so the indices are consecutive.\n\n                    But wait: we are only allowed to change one element. The entire segment we are forming must be contiguous. And we are considering the entire contiguous block from (i-L[i-1]) to (i+R[i+1]). \n\n                    However, there is a catch: the change is only at i. The rest of the elements are fixed. So the condition for the entire segment is:\n\n                      For j from (i-L[i-1]) to i-1: the segment is increasing (by definition of L[i-1]).\n                      Then we set a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if both exist) and then the segment from i to i+R[i+1]-1 is increasing (by definition of R[i+1]).\n\n                    But note: the entire segment must be strictly increasing. The connection between i-1 and i is: a[i-1] < (new a[i]). The connection between i and i+1 is: (new a[i]) < a[i+1]. And then the rest is increasing.\n\n                    However, what if the left part and the right part are not adjacent in the original array? They are adjacent in the array because we are taking contiguous indices. The index i is between i-1 and i+1.\n\n                    So the algorithm:\n\n                    Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n\n                    Step 2: Precompute L and R.\n\n                    Step 3: Initialize ans = 1 (at least one element)\n\n                    Step 4: \n                         candidate0 = max(L)   # without any change\n\n                    Step 5: For each index i from 0 to n-1:\n\n                         candidate = 1   (the element at i alone)\n\n                         If n==1: then we break.\n\n                         If i==0: \n                            if n>=2:\n                                candidate = 1 + R[1]   # because we can set a[0] to be less than a[1] (so we extend to the right) but wait, we are allowed to change one element. However, we can also consider not changing and then the segment [0] is already increasing. But we are considering the change at i=0. Actually, we are allowed to change at most one, so we can also not change. But candidate0 already considered the increasing without change. \n\n                         However, note: we are trying to find the maximum contiguous subsegment that is strictly increasing with at most one change. We are considering the change at i. But we might get a longer segment by not using the change? \n\n                         Actually, we are going to consider:\n\n                         Without change: candidate0 = max(L) (which is the longest increasing contiguous segment)\n\n                         With one change: we consider for each i the candidate_i as above.\n\n                         Then the answer is max(candidate0, candidate1) where candidate1 is the maximum candidate_i over i.\n\n                    But wait: what if we have a contiguous increasing segment that is broken by one element, and that broken element is fixed, but the broken segment is longer than the contiguous increasing segment without change? Then candidate0 might be less than candidate1.\n\n                    However, note: we are allowed to use the change, so we can form a segment that is longer than the contiguous increasing segment without change.\n\n                    But note: the candidate0 is the maximum contiguous increasing segment without change. When we use the change, we are forming a segment that may include non-increasing parts (one violation) and then fixed. \n\n                    However, the above candidate_i for a middle index i is:\n\n                         candidate_i = 1\n                         if i>=1 and i<=n-2:\n                             if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                                 candidate_i = L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1]\n                             else:\n                                 candidate_i = max(L[i-1], R[i+1]) + 1\n\n                    But wait, what if we don't use the entire left and right? \n\n                    Actually, we are forced to use the entire left and right because:\n\n                      The left part is defined as the longest increasing segment ending at i-1. Similarly for the right.\n\n                    However, note: we are allowed to take any contiguous subsegment. But the condition for merging is that the entire left part (as defined by L[i-1]) and the entire right part (as defined by R[i+1]) must be included? \n\n                    Actually, no: we can take a part of the left part or the right part. But then we must adjust the condition. \n\n                    Example: [10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and we are considering the change at index1 (value 1). Then the left part is [10] (so L[0]=1) and the right part is [2,3,...,10] (so R[1]=10). Then candidate_i = 1+1+10=12. But note: the entire array is 11 elements. \n\n                    Wait, indices: \n                         a0=10, a1=1, a2=2, ... a10=10.\n\n                    Then the segment from a0 to a10 is 11 elements. But our candidate_i = 12? That's impossible.\n\n                    Correction: the left part ending at i-1 (which is index0) has length L[0]=1, so the segment from index0 to index0. The right part starting at i+1 (index2) has length R[1] (for the element at index2) but wait, we defined R for index i: the increasing sequence starting at i.\n\n                    Actually, we defined:\n                         R[i] = length of increasing sequence starting at i.\n\n                    For i=1 (the element 1) we don't use R[1] for the right part? Actually, we defined R for the starting index. But in our candidate_i for i (the change at i) we use R[i+1] (the increasing sequence starting at i+1). \n\n                    Then the segment we are forming is from (i - L[i-1] + 1) to (i + R[i+1] - 1) ? \n\n                    Actually, the left part ending at i-1 has length L[i-1] = k, meaning the segment from (i-1 - k + 1) to i-1 is increasing. Then the right part starting at i+1 has length R[i+1] = m, meaning from i+1 to i+1+m-1 is increasing.\n\n                    Then the entire segment is from (i-1 - k + 1) to (i+1+m-1). The length is k + 1 + m.\n\n                    In the example: \n                         i=1 (the element 1)\n                         k = L[0] = 1 (so the left part covers index0 to index0)\n                         m = R[2] = 9 (because from index2 to index10, there are 9 elements: 2 to 10) -> wait, let's compute R for the example:\n\n                    We need to compute R for the entire array [10,1,2,...,10] (11 elements)\n\n                    R[10] (last element) = 1\n                    R[9] (second last) = 1 (because a[9]=9, a[10]=10 -> 9<10 -> R[9]=R[10]+1=2? Actually, we define R backwards:\n\n                    Let me define R[i] for i from n-2 down to 0:\n\n                    R[i] = 1 if a[i] >= a[i+1]\n                    else R[i] = R[i+1] + 1\n\n                    For the example [10,1,2,...,10] (n=11):\n\n                    a = [10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n\n                    Compute R from the end:\n\n                    R[9] = 1 (because a[9]=9, a[10]=10 -> 9<10 -> then R[9]=R[10]+1=1+1=2? Actually, we should define:\n\n                    Standard for R: \n                      R[i] = 1\n                      for i from n-2 down to 0:\n                          if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n                              R[i] = R[i+1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of a sequence where we can change at most one element to make the entire subsegment strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible subsegments by leveraging precomputed arrays that track increasing sequences from both ends of the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Array (L)**: This array stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at each index without any changes.\n   - **Right Array (R)**: This array stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment starting at each index without any changes.\n\n2. **Initial Maximum Length**:\n   - The initial maximum length is the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes, which is the maximum value in the left array.\n\n3. **Check for Single Change**:\n   - For each element in the array, consider it as the element to be changed. The goal is to merge the longest increasing subsegment ending before this element and the longest increasing subsegment starting after this element, provided they can be merged by adjusting the current element.\n   - If the previous and next elements exist and the previous element is less than the next element, the merged length is the sum of the left subsegment length, 1 (for the changed element), and the right subsegment length.\n   - If the previous or next element does not exist, the length is simply the maximum of the left or right subsegment lengths plus one.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**:\n   - The result is the maximum value between the initial maximum length (without any changes) and the best length obtained by considering a single change at any element.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    L = [1] * n\n    R = [1] * n\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            L[i] = L[i-1] + 1\n            \n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            R[i] = R[i+1] + 1\n            \n    ans = max(max(L), 1)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        candidate = 1\n        if i >= 1 and i <= n-2:\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                candidate = L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1]\n            else:\n                candidate = max(L[i-1], R[i+1]) + 1\n        elif i == 0:\n            candidate = 1 + R[i+1]\n        else:\n            candidate = 1 + L[i-1]\n            \n        if candidate > ans:\n            ans = candidate\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the sequence has only one element, the answer is trivially 1 since no changes are needed.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: The `L` array is computed by iterating from left to right, storing the length of increasing subsegments ending at each index. The `R` array is computed similarly by iterating from right to left.\n4. **Initial Maximum**: The initial maximum length is the longest increasing subsegment without any changes, found by taking the maximum value in the `L` array.\n5. **Single Change Check**: For each element, the algorithm checks if changing it allows merging adjacent increasing subsegments. The candidate length is calculated based on whether the previous and next elements can form a valid strictly increasing sequence when the current element is adjusted.\n6. **Result Output**: The maximum value between the initial maximum and the best candidate length from the single change check is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios by leveraging precomputed subsegment lengths, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
