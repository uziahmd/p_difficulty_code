Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all the letters must be the same (the same letter for the entire diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, and that letter is different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output 'NO'\n\n   Example 2:\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw    -> Output 'YES'\n\n   Example 3:\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpe    -> Output 'NO'\n\n Let's analyze:\n\n In example 1: \n   The diagonals are:\n     Main diagonal: ['x', 'o', 's', 'o', 'x'] -> not all same (has 'x','o','s') -> so fails condition 1.\n\n But wait, the example output is 'NO'. However, let's read the problem again: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n So we have two diagonals: the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n\n Actually, in example 1, the main diagonal has:\n   row0: index0 -> 'x'\n   row1: index1 -> 'o'\n   row2: index2 -> 's'\n   row3: index3 -> 'o'\n   row4: index4 -> 'x'\n\n This is not all the same. Therefore, the condition fails.\n\n Example 2: \n   n=3\n   grid = \n        ['w','s','w']\n        ['s','w','s']\n        ['w','s','w']\n\n   Main diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> same.\n   Anti-diagonal: \n        row0: last element 'w'\n        row1: middle element 'w'\n        row2: first element 'w' -> same.\n\n   Now, check the non-diagonal squares: \n        (0,1): 's'\n        (1,0): 's'\n        (1,2): 's'\n        (2,1): 's'\n\n   All non-diagonal squares are 's', and that is different from 'w'. So it should be YES.\n\n Example 3:\n   n=3\n   grid = \n        ['x','p','x']\n        ['p','x','p']\n        ['x','p','e']   -> Wait, the last element is 'e'? \n\n   Actually, the example input is: \n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpe\n\n   So the grid is:\n        ['x','p','x']\n        ['p','x','p']\n        ['x','p','e']\n\n   The diagonals:\n        Main diagonal: [grid[0][0]='x', grid[1][1]='x', grid[2][2]='e'] -> not all same.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"on both diagonals\" meaning the entire diagonal must be the same letter.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not specify that the two diagonals must have the same letter? \n   Let me reread: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". \n\n   This means each diagonal must be a constant letter, but the two diagonals can be different letters?\n\n   However, condition 2: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n   This implies that the two diagonals might have different letters? But then what is the common letter for non-diagonals? It must be different from both?\n\n   But wait, example 2 had both diagonals as 'w'. In example 3, the main diagonal is not even constant.\n\n   However, let's check the example 3: \n        The problem states output is 'NO'.\n\n   But note: the example 3 has the anti-diagonal: \n        row0: last element 'x'\n        row1: middle element 'x'\n        row2: first element 'x'\n\n   So the anti-diagonal is constant 'x'. But the main diagonal is ['x','x','e'] which is not constant.\n\n   Therefore, the condition for the diagonals fails.\n\n   However, there is another possibility: the problem requires that both diagonals are the same letter? \n\n   Let me check the example 2: both diagonals are 'w'. \n\n   The problem statement says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms an \"X\" according to specific conditions.

It ensures all elements on these diagonals are the same letter.\n3. **Checking Non-Diagonal Elements**: After verifying the diagonals, the code checks all other elements to ensure they are the same letter and different from the diagonal letters.\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are met, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions to determine if the grid forms an \"X\" by leveraging nested loops to traverse the grid and validate the specified criteria.",
