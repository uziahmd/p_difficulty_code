The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are moving in a circular ring road (clockwise) with n houses.\n We start at house 1 and we have m tasks, each requiring to be at house a_i (with the condition that we must complete tasks in order).\n\n Since the ringroad is circular and one-way (clockwise), we can only move from house i to house i+1 (with house n+1 being house 1).\n\n However, note: the problem does not require us to go through the entire circle necessarily. We can break the journey by going from a higher house number back to lower ones by wrapping around.\n\n Important observation: The movement is clockwise so from house x to house y:\n   If y >= x, then the distance is y - x.\n   If y < x, then we go from x to n, then wrap to 1 and then to y. But note: the ringroad is circular. Actually, we can also think of the houses as arranged in a circle, so the direct way is to go from x to y without passing the same point twice.\n\n But note: since we are only allowed to move clockwise, to go from x to y when y < x, we have to go from x to x+1, then x+2, ... until n, then 1, then 2, ... until y. The total distance is (n - x + 1) + (y - 1) = n - x + y.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the entire circle as having a linear representation by duplicating the houses (or by considering modulo arithmetic). However, note that we are allowed to break the journey and we are starting at 1.\n\n However, note: we must do the tasks in order. So the path is:\n\n Start at 1, then go to a1, then from a1 to a2, then from a2 to a3, etc.\n\n But note: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" gives 6.\n\n Steps for the example: \n   Start at 1.\n   Then go to 3: from 1 to 3 -> 2 steps (1->2->3).\n   Then from 3 to 2: Since 2 < 3, we must go 3->4->1->2. That's 3 steps (because from 3 to 4 is 1, 4 to 1 is 1 (but wait, actually the ringroad has n=4, so from 3 to 4: 1 step, then from 4 to 1 is the next step, then 1 to 2: another step. So 3 steps).\n   Then from 2 to 3: 1 step (2->3).\n\n Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n How to compute from a current position x to next task y?\n   If y >= x: then steps = y - x\n   If y < x: then steps = (n - x) + y   [because from x to n: n-x steps, then from 1 to y: y steps? Actually, no: from x to n is (n - x) steps, then from n to 1 is 1 step? But wait, in the example from 3 to 2: \n        n=4, x=3, y=2: \n        Option: (n - x) + y = (4-3) + 2 = 1+2 = 3, which matches.\n\n However, note: the movement from x to y when y < x is not exactly (n - x) + y. Let me break it down:\n\n   From house 3 to house 2 in a ring of 4 houses (houses 1,2,3,4) moving clockwise:\n\n   Step 1: 3 -> 4 (1 step)\n   Step 2: 4 -> 1 (2nd step, because 4 to 1 is the next clockwise, so we count 4->1 as one step? Actually, the problem says moving from a house to a neighboring one takes one unit. So from 4, the next house is 1 (since it's a ring). Therefore, from 4 to 1 is one step.\n\n   Then from 1 to 2 is one more step.\n\n   So total steps: 3.\n\n   So the formula: (n - x) + y doesn't work if we break it as (n-x) steps from x to n, then from n to 1 is one step, and then from 1 to y is (y-1) steps? \n\n   Actually, the entire wrap-around from x to y (when y < x) is:\n\n      From x to n: (n - x) steps, then from n to 1 is 1 step, then from 1 to y is (y - 1) steps? \n\n   Then total steps = (n - x) + 1 + (y - 1) = n - x + y.\n\n   But wait: the step from n to 1 is included in the ring. In our calculation above, we did:\n\n        x to n: n-x steps\n        then from n to 1: 1 step (so n-x+1)\n        then from 1 to y: y-1 steps (because we are at 1 and need to get to y, and we move clockwise: 1->2->...->y: that's y-1 steps)\n\n   Then total = (n-x) + 1 + (y-1) = n - x + y.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the entire circle as having a total length of n, and the clockwise distance from x to y is:\n\n        distance = (y - x) % n   but if negative, we adjust.\n\n   Actually, the distance from x to y in a clockwise ring of n houses is:\n\n        If y >= x: d = y - x\n        Else: d = n - x + y\n\n   But note: (y-x) % n would be negative when y < x, so we do: (y - x + n) % n? Let's check:\n\n        When y>=x: (y-x+n) % n = (y-x) % n, but if y-x is positive and less than n, then (y-x+n) % n = y-x (if y-x < n). But if y-x is negative, then (y-x+n) % n = y-x+n.\n\n   However, we don't want modulo reduction for the entire circle? Because we are only moving clockwise and the entire circle is n, so the minimal clockwise steps from x to y is:\n\n        d = (y - x) % n\n        But if (y-x) is negative, then we add n and then take modulo? Actually, we don't need modulo because we are just counting the steps. We can use:\n\n        if y >= x:\n            d = y - x\n        else:\n            d = n - x + y\n\n   Alternatively, we can write: d = (y - x) if y>=x else (n - (x - y))\n\n   But note: the example from 3 to 2: (2-3) is negative, so we do n - (3-2) = 4-1=3.\n\n   So we can also write: d = (y - x) if y>=x else (n - (x-y))\n\n   However, note: x-y is positive when y < x, so n - (x-y) is the same as n - x + y.\n\n   So both formulas are equivalent.\n\n Approach:\n\n   We start at house 1 (current = 1). Then we process the list of tasks [a1, a2, ..., am].\n\n   For the first task: we are at 1, and we need to go to a0 (the first element). Then update current = a0.\n\n   Then for the next task: from a0 to a1, then update current = a1, and so on.\n\n   The total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks (including the first one from house 1 to the first task).\n\n   However, note the condition: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". This means that the tasks must be done in order, and the movement from the previous task to the next is the key.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        total_time = 0\n        current = 1\n\n        For each task in the list of m tasks:\n            if task >= current:\n                steps = task - current\n            else:\n                steps = n - current + task\n\n            total_time += steps\n            current = task\n\n   Let's test with the example: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n        Start: current = 1, task=3 -> 3>=1 -> steps=2, total_time=2, current=3.\n        Next: task=2 -> 2<3 -> steps=4-3+2=3, total_time=5, current=2.\n        Next: task=3 -> 3>=2 -> steps=1, total_time=6.\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   But wait, what if we have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house?\n\n        Example: [2,2,2] with n=4.\n\n        Start: current=1, task=2 -> steps=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n        Then: task=2 -> steps=0, total_time=1, current=2.\n        Then: task=2 -> steps=0, total_time=1.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\"\n\n   Another example: [1,1,1] with n=4.\n\n        Start: current=1, task=1 -> steps=0, total_time=0, current=1.\n        Then: task=1 -> steps=0, total_time=0.\n        Then: task=1 -> steps=0, total_time=0.\n\n   Also correct.\n\n   But wait, what if we have a task that requires going from 1 to n? \n\n        Example: n=5, tasks=[5,1,2]\n\n        Start: current=1, task=5: 5>=1 -> steps=4, total_time=4, current=5.\n        Then: task=1: 1<5 -> steps=5-5+1=1, total_time=5, current=1.\n        Then: task=2: 2>=1 -> steps=1, total_time=6.\n\n   Let me verify the moves:\n\n        Start at 1.\n        Move from 1 to 5: 1->2,2->3,3->4,4->5 -> 4 steps.\n        Then from 5 to 1: 5->1 (one step, because 5 is followed by 1 in the ring) -> 1 step.\n        Then from 1 to 2: 1->2 -> 1 step.\n\n        Total: 4+1+1 = 6.\n\n   So the formula holds.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5, so we must do this in O(m). Our solution is O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if the tasks are given in an order that sometimes requires a long jump and sometimes a short one? Our method is sequential and adds the steps from the last task to the current one.\n\n   Example: [1, n, 1, n, ...] \n\n        n=4, tasks=[1,4,1,4]\n\n        Start: current=1, task=1 -> 0 steps, current=1.\n        Then: task=4 -> 3 steps, total_time=3, current=4.\n        Then: task=1 -> 1 step (4->1: 1 step), total_time=4, current=1.\n        Then: task=4 -> 3 steps, total_time=7.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem statement says that initially she is at house 1. The first task might not be at house 1.\n\n   But the above example [1,4,1,4] starts with 1, so the first task is at 1 (so we don't move). Then we move from 1 to 4, then from 4 to 1, then from 1 to 4.\n\n   What if the first task is not 1? \n\n        Example: n=4, tasks=[2,3,4,1]\n\n        Start: current=1, task=2 -> 1 step, total_time=1, current=2.\n        Then: task=3 -> 1 step, total_time=2, current=3.\n        Then: task=4 -> 1 step, total_time=3, current=4.\n        Then: task=1 -> 1 step (from 4 to 1), total_time=4.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"she needs to complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that the tasks are in increasing index order? But the houses can be arbitrary.\n\n   We are processing the tasks in the given order.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply read the list and process sequentially.\n\n   Code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        n = int(data[0])\n        m = int(data[1])\n        # The next m integers\n        tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for t in tasks:\n            if t >= current:\n                total_time += t - current\n            else:\n                total_time += n - current + t\n            current = t\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n        n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n        total_time = 0, current=1\n        t=3: 3>=1 -> add 2, current=3 -> total_time=2\n        t=2: 2<3 -> add 4-3+2 = 3, total_time=5, current=2\n        t=3: 3>=2 -> add 1, total_time=6 -> output 6.\n\n   Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n        n=4, tasks=[2,3,3]\n        t=2: 2>=1 -> add 1, total_time=1, current=2.\n        t=3: 3>=2 -> add 1, total_time=2, current=3.\n        t=3: 3>=3 -> add 0, total_time=2.\n\n   The second example input was given as \"4 3\\n2 3 3\", and the expected output is 2.\n\n   However, the example input string was written as two examples: \n        Input: ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n        Output: ['6', '2']\n\n   So our code produces 6 and 2 for these inputs.\n\n   But wait, the example input format in the problem statement was:\n\n        Input:\n          4 3\n          3 2 3\n\n        Output:\n          6\n\n        and\n\n        Input:\n          4 3\n          2 3 3\n\n        Output:\n          2\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note that the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. Our calculation is for clockwise movement only.\n\n   There is one more consideration: the entire ringroad is circular, but we are only moving clockwise. The problem does not allow counter-clockwise movement.\n\n   Therefore, the above solution should be correct.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5, and the numbers are positive and within [1, n]. We are using a simple loop and arithmetic operations, so it's efficient.\n\n   Let me run the code with the sample inputs to be sure.\n\n   Sample 1: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> Output: 6\n\n   Sample 2:\n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> Output: 2\n\n   However, wait! The example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" is processed as:\n\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 2 -> from 1 to 2: 1 step.\n        Second task: 3 -> from 2 to 3: 1 step.\n        Third task: 3 -> no step.\n\n        Total: 1+1 = 2.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   But note: there is an alternative interpretation: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\", meaning that the tasks must be done in order, but the movement from the initial location (house 1) to the first task is required, and then from the first task to the second, etc.\n\n   This is exactly what we are doing.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is circular and we are only allowed to move clockwise. Our calculation for the wrap-around (when t < current) uses the clockwise path.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   Let me test with a larger example: n=10**5, and m=10**5, with alternating high and low.\n\n        Example: tasks = [10**5] * 50000 + [1] * 50000\n\n        Then the first half: from 1 to 10**5: 99999 steps, then stay at 10**5 for 49999 times (each time 0 steps) -> but wait, the first half is 50000 tasks: the first is 10**5, then the next 49999 are 10**5 (so no movement). Then the next 50000 tasks are 1.\n\n        Then from 10**5 to 1: n - 10**5 + 1 = 100000 - 100000 + 1 = 1 step.\n\n        Then from 1 to 1 for 49999 times: 0 steps.\n\n        Total time = 99999 (first move) + 1 (last move) = 100000.\n\n        Now, if we do:\n\n            n=100000\n            tasks = [100000] * 50000   (including the first one) and then [1] * 50000.\n\n            But note: the first task is 100000, then the next 49999 are 100000 (so no additional steps). Then the next 50000 tasks are 1.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Start at 1.\n\n                For the first task (100000): 100000>=1 -> steps=99999, current=100000.\n\n                Then for the next 49999 tasks (all 100000): each requires 100000>=100000 -> steps=0.\n\n                Then for the first task of the second part: 1 < 100000 -> steps=100000-100000+1=1.\n\n                Then for the remaining 49999 tasks (all 1): 1>=1 -> steps=0.\n\n                Total = 99999 + 1 = 100000.\n\n        This seems correct.\n\n   Another test: n=10, tasks=[1,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2]\n\n        Start at 1.\n\n        1: 0 steps -> current=1.\n        10: 10>=1 -> 9 steps -> current=10, total=9.\n        9: 9<10 -> steps=10-10+9=9? Wait: 10-10+9 = 9, but actually from 10 to 9: \n            In a ring of 10: from 10 to 9: we go 10->1 (1 step), then 1->2->...->9: 8 steps? \n            Actually, the clockwise movement from 10 to 9 is: 10->1 (1 step) and then 1->2->...->9 (8 steps) -> total 9 steps.\n\n        Then 8: from 9 to 8: 8<9 -> steps=10-9+8=9, total=9+9=18.\n        Then 7: 10-8+7=9, total=27.\n        Then 6: 10-7+6=9, total=36.\n        Then 5: 10-6+5=9, total=45.\n        Then 4: 10-5+4=9, total=54.\n        Then 3: 10-4+3=9, total=63.\n        Then 2: 10-3+2=9, total=72.\n\n        Alternatively, we can see that from 1 to 10 is 9 steps, then from 10 to 2 (via the entire wrap) is 9 steps for each step down by 1.\n\n        But wait, the entire list of tasks is: [1,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2]\n\n        The total time is 9 (for 1->10) and then 9 steps for each of the 8 remaining tasks (from 10 to 9, 9 to 8, ... until 3 to 2) -> 9 + 9*8 = 9 + 72 = 81.\n\n        However, our calculation above for the second task (9) was 9, then 9 for 8, then 9 for 7, ... so 9 (first move) + 9*8 = 81.\n\n        Why did I get 72 above? Because I broke down the steps incorrectly.\n\n        Let me recalc:\n\n            Start: 1\n            First task: 10 -> 9 steps (total=9, current=10)\n            Second task: 9 -> 9 steps (total=18, current=9)\n            Third task: 8 -> 9 steps (total=27, current=8)\n            Fourth task: 7 -> 9 steps (total=36, current=7)\n            Fifth task: 6 -> 9 steps (total=45, current=6)\n            Sixth task: 5 -> 9 steps (total=54, current=5)\n            Seventh task: 4 -> 9 steps (total=63, current=4)\n            Eighth task: 3 -> 9 steps (total=72, current=3)\n            Ninth task: 2 -> 9 steps (total=81, current=2)\n\n        So the total is 81.\n\n        But wait, the example I wrote: tasks = [1,10,9,8,...,2] has 10 tasks.\n\n        The first task is 1 (at the beginning we are at 1, so 0 steps). Then the next 9 tasks are 10,9,8,...,2.\n\n        So the steps are:\n\n            task0: 1 -> 0\n            task1: 10 -> 9\n            task2: 9 -> 9\n            task3: 8 -> 9\n            task4: 7 -> 9\n            task5: 6 -> 9\n            task6: 5 -> 9\n            task7: 4 -> 9\n            task8: 3 -> 9\n            task9: 2 -> 9\n\n        Total: 0 + 9*9 = 81.\n\n        But wait, the first task is 1, which we already are at, so the first movement is from 1 to 1 (0) and then from 1 to 10 (9). Then from 10 to 9 (9), etc.\n\n        The list of tasks is [1,10,9,8,...,2] (10 elements). The first element is 1, so we are already at 1. Then we have to do 9 more tasks.\n\n        The code:\n\n            n=10\n            tasks = [1,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2]\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            t=1: 1>=1 -> steps=0, total_time=0, current=1.\n            t=10: 10>=1 -> steps=9, total_time=9, current=10.\n            t=9: 9<10 -> steps=10-10+9=9, total_time=18, current=9.\n            t=8: 8<9 -> steps=10-9+8=9, total_time=27, current=8.\n            ... until the last task.\n\n        So yes, 9*9=81.\n\n        However, note: the example input was [1,10,9,8,...,2] but the problem says the tasks must be done in order. This is the order.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   One more corner: n=2, m=1, task=[1]\n\n        total_time=0.\n\n   n=2, m=1, task=[2]\n\n        steps=2-1=1.\n\n   n=2, m=2, tasks=[2,1]\n\n        Start: 1 to 2: 1 step, then 2 to 1: n-2+1=2-2+1=1 step. Total=2.\n\n   n=2, m=2, tasks=[1,2] -> 0 (from 1 to 1) + (2-1)=1 -> total=1.\n\n   n=2, m=2, tasks=[2,2] -> 1 (from 1 to 2) + 0 = 1.\n\n   All correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            m = int(data[1])\n            tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n            \n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            \n            for t in tasks:\n                if t >= current:\n                    total_time += t - current\n                else:\n                    total_time += n - current + t\n                current = t\n                \n            print(total_time)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> 6\n   Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> 2\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is circular and we are only allowed to move clockwise. Our formula for the wrap-around is correct.\n\n   We are good to go.\n\n   But wait, let me check the wrap-around again with n=3, from 3 to 1:\n\n        According to the formula: n - current + t = 3-3+1=1. \n        Steps: 3->1: in a ring of 3, clockwise: 3->1 is one step? \n        The ring: 1->2->3->1. So from 3, next is 1. So indeed 1 step.\n\n   Similarly, from 3 to 2: 3->1->2: two steps? But wait, the formula: n - current + t = 3-3+2=2.\n\n        Steps: 3->1 (1 step), then 1->2 (another step) -> 2 steps.\n\n   So the formula is correct.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   However, note that the problem constraints are large, but our algorithm is O(m) and uses basic arithmetic, so it's efficient.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ring road in a clockwise direction. The ring road has `n` houses numbered from 1 to `n`, and Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete tasks in the given order. Moving from one house to an adjacent house takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Read the input values for the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of tasks.\n2. **Tracking Position and Time**: Start from house 1 (initial position) and initialize the total time to 0.\n3. **Processing Each Task**: For each task, determine the shortest clockwise path from the current house to the task's house:\n   - If the task's house is greater than or equal to the current house, the steps needed are simply the difference between the task's house and the current house.\n   - If the task's house is less than the current house, the steps needed are calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ring (house `n`) and then from house 1 to the task's house. This is computed as `(n - current_house + task_house)`.\n4. **Update Position and Time**: After processing each task, update the current house to the task's house and add the computed steps to the total time.\n5. **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for t in tasks:\n        if t >= current:\n            total_time += t - current\n        else:\n            total_time += n - current + t\n        current = t\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for `n` (number of houses), `m` (number of tasks), and the list of tasks.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task, the code checks if the task's house is ahead of or behind the current house in the clockwise direction. If it's ahead, the steps are the direct difference. If it's behind, the steps involve moving around the circular end of the ring.\n- **Updating Position**: After each task, the current house is updated to the task's house, ensuring subsequent tasks are processed from the correct starting point.\n- **Output**: The total time accumulated from all movements is printed, which represents the minimal time Xenia needs to complete all tasks in order.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular nature of the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic to compute movement steps, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
