    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a simpler approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to check for each possible substring length (from the maximum possible down) whether there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. If the string length is n, then the maximum possible duplicate substring length is floor(n/2) but actually we can have duplicates even when overlapping, so we consider from n-1 down to 1 (but note: if we find one duplicate at length L, then we can output L and break? Actually, we want the longest, so we start from the largest possible and go downwards until we find one that has at least two occurrences.)\n\n However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and occurrences can overlap.\n\n But note: the entire string might be the same character, then the longest substring that appears twice could be the whole string if it appears twice? Actually, no: in \"zzz\", the substring \"zz\" appears twice (at positions 0 and 1). So the answer for \"zzz\" is 2.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let s be the input string.\n\n We can iterate over possible lengths from the maximum (which is len(s)) down to 1, but note: if we take a substring of length L, then we can have at most (n - L + 1) starting positions. We need at least two distinct occurrences (they can overlap, so they don't have to be non-overlapping). \n\n However, note: if we have two identical substrings that are adjacent, that's okay. But also, if the string is \"aaa\", then:\n   length 3: \"aaa\" appears once -> not valid.\n   length 2: \"aa\" appears twice (starting at index0 and index1) -> valid, so answer 2.\n\n But wait, the example input includes 'ababa' -> output 3. \n   In \"ababa\": \n        substring \"aba\" appears twice: at index0 and index2.\n\n So we can do:\n\n For L in range(n, 0, -1):\n   Create a set (or dictionary) of all substrings of length L.\n   If the set has less than the total number of substrings (i.e., we found at least one duplicate), then we output L and break.\n\n However, note: the set will tell us if there's at least one substring that appears more than once? Actually, we just need to know if there's at least one substring that appears at least twice.\n\n But wait: if we have two different substrings of the same length, that doesn't matter. We are checking for duplicates.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a dictionary to count the frequency, but we don't need the exact counts, only if any substring appears at least twice.\n\n However, the problem: what if two different substrings of the same length are the same? Then we have a duplicate.\n\n But we are using a set for uniqueness. Actually, we can do:\n\n   seen = {}\n   for start index i from 0 to n-L:\n        substring = s[i:i+L]\n        if substring in seen:\n            then we found a duplicate -> output L and break out of everything.\n        else:\n            seen[substring] = True\n\n But wait, this only checks for the first occurrence. Actually, we are iterating from the largest L. We want to check all substrings of length L and see if any appears at least twice.\n\n Actually, we don't need to break on the first duplicate because we are going from large to small. We can check for each L: if there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: if we use a set, we cannot easily check for duplicates without storing counts. Alternatively, we can store the first occurrence and then if we see the same substring again, then we have a duplicate.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n   for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        found_duplicate = False\n        # We'll use a dictionary to count or just a set for seen substrings, but we must record which ones we've seen and if we see a substring again, then duplicate.\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                found_duplicate = True\n                break\n            else:\n                seen.add(substr)\n        if found_duplicate:\n            print(L)\n            exit(0)\n\n But wait, what if we have two different substrings that are the same? Then we break. This is correct.\n\n However, we must consider: if we break at the first duplicate, then we are returning the first duplicate we find for the current L. That is the substring of length L that appears twice. And since we are going from large to small, we return the largest L for which there is a duplicate.\n\n But note: what if for a given L, there are multiple duplicates? We break as soon as we find one, which is acceptable because we just need to know that there is at least one duplicate.\n\n However, the above code breaks the inner loop as soon as a duplicate is found, then we output L and exit.\n\n But wait: what if for a given L, we don't break in the inner loop? Then we move to the next L.\n\n Example: \"abcd\"\n   n=4, we check L=4: substrings: \"abcd\" -> set initially empty, then add \"abcd\". Then no duplicate -> move to L=3.\n   L=3: substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> both are new -> no duplicate.\n   L=2: substrings: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicates.\n   L=1: substrings: 'a','b','c','d' -> no duplicates -> then we output nothing? But the problem says output 0 for \"abcd\".\n\n So we must output 0 if no duplicate is found.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        duplicate_found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                duplicate_found = True\n                break\n            seen.add(substr)\n        if duplicate_found:\n            print(L)\n            return   # or break out and then after the loop we would output 0, but we break here.\n\n   Then if we finish the loop without finding any duplicate, we output 0.\n\n However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we can safely output 0.\n\n But wait: what if the string has two same characters? For example, \"aa\": \n   n=2, L=2: substring \"aa\" -> no duplicate (only one occurrence) -> then L=1: substrings are \"a\" (at index0 and index1). \n   When i=0: add \"a\"; i=1: \"a\" is already in the set -> duplicate found, so output 1.\n\n But the expected for \"aa\" should be 1? Actually, the problem says: longest substring that appears at least twice. \n   In \"aa\", the substring \"a\" appears twice (overlapping allowed). So 1 is correct.\n\n However, the sample input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> outputs [0, 3, 2]\n\n Let's test with \"zzz\":\n   n=3, L=3: substring \"zzz\" -> only one occurrence -> no duplicate.\n   L=2: substrings: \n        i=0: \"zz\" -> add\n        i=1: \"zz\" -> already present -> duplicate found -> output 2.\n\n So that matches.\n\n But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\"? \n   We are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice. \n   Example: \"aaa\" in \"aabbcc\" is not present. But note: \"aa\" appears twice (in the two 'a's and then the two 'b's and two 'c's) so the longest would be 2? \n   However, what about \"a\" -> appears 3 times, but we are looking for the longest. \n   But note: the substring \"aa\" is longer than \"a\", so the answer should be 2.\n\n But wait, is there a substring of length 3 that appears twice? \n   \"aab\", \"abb\", \"bbc\", \"bcc\", \"cca\" (wait, the string is \"aabbcc\")\n   Let me list all substrings of length 3: \n        \"aab\", \"abb\", \"bcc\" -> none repeated.\n\n   So the answer for \"aabbcc\" is 2.\n\n However, note: the substring \"bb\" is of length 2 and appears twice (at indices 2 and 3). Also \"aa\" at indices 0 and 1, and \"cc\" at indices 4 and 5. So we have three distinct substrings of length 2 that appear twice. But we are looking for the longest, and 2 is the maximum.\n\n Another example: \"abababa\"\n   What is the answer? \n   We are going from L=7 down to 1.\n\n   L=7: \"abababa\" -> only one occurrence -> no.\n   L=6: \"ababab\", \"bababa\" -> no duplicates.\n   L=5: \"ababa\", \"babama\" (wait, no) -> let me break down:\n        \"ababa\" at index0 and index2? \n        Actually, at index0: \"ababa\", at index2: \"ababa\" (because from index2: s[2:7] -> 'ababa') -> so duplicate found, so output 5.\n\n   But wait, is there a substring of length 5? Yes, and it appears twice.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the substring can be met at least twice. The substring \"ababa\" appears twice (overlapping is allowed). \n\n   But wait, the example input does not include this, but according to the problem, we output 5.\n\n   However, let me check the example: \"ababa\" (the second sample) outputs 3. Why?\n        In \"ababa\", the substring \"aba\" appears twice: at index0 and index2. And also \"bab\" appears twice: at index1 and index3? \n        Actually, \"aba\" is at index0: \"aba\", index2: \"aba\" (from index2: \"aba\" in \"ababa\" -> s[2:5] is \"aba\"). \n        And \"bab\": s[1:4] is \"bab\", and s[3:6] is \"bab\" (if we consider 0-indexed: \n            s = \"ababa\"\n            substring \"aba\": [0:3] and [2:5] -> yes, two occurrences.\n            substring \"bab\": [1:4] and [3:6] -> but the string length is 5, so [3:6] is beyond? Actually, from index3 to index5 (exclusive) is \"ba\", not \"bab\". \n\n        Correction: \n            s = \"ababa\"\n            indices: \n                0: a\n                1: b\n                2: a\n                3: b\n                4: a\n\n            Substring \"aba\" (length 3): \n                starting at 0: \"aba\" (indices0-2)\n                starting at 2: \"aba\" (indices2-4) -> valid.\n\n            Substring \"bab\" (length 3):\n                starting at 1: \"bab\" (indices1-3)\n                starting at 3: \"bab\" (indices3-5) -> but index5 is beyond the string (since string length is 5, last index is 4). So actually, the substring starting at index3 is \"ba\" (if we take 3 to 6, but 6 is beyond, so we take 3 to 5: \"ba\")? \n\n            Actually, our substring extraction: s[i:i+L] goes from i to i+L (exclusive). So for i=3 and L=3: s[3:6] -> but the string only has indices 0 to 4, so s[3:6] is \"ba\" (only two characters). \n\n            Therefore, \"bab\" does not appear twice. \n\n            So why the sample output for \"ababa\" is 3? Because the substring \"aba\" (which is length 3) appears twice.\n\n            Now, for \"abababa\": \n                We have \"ababa\" (length 5) appearing twice? \n                Actually, in \"abababa\", let's break it down: \n                    s = \"abababa\" (length 7)\n                    substring \"ababa\" (length5) at index0: \"ababa\", index2: \"ababa\" (from index2: s[2:7] is \"ababa\") -> so two occurrences.\n\n            Therefore, the answer for \"abababa\" is 5.\n\n   But wait, the example input was \"ababa\", not \"abababa\". The sample input says:\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n        Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   So for \"ababa\" (n=5) the answer is 3.\n\n   Our algorithm for \"ababa\":\n        n=5, we check L from 5 down to 1.\n\n        L=5: substring \"ababa\" -> only one occurrence -> no.\n        L=4: substrings: \n            \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicates.\n        L=3: \n            \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\", \"bab\" -> wait, let me list:\n                i=0: \"aba\"\n                i=1: \"bab\"\n                i=2: \"aba\" -> found duplicate \"aba\" (already seen) -> output 3.\n\n   So that matches.\n\n   However, note: in the example \"ababa\", the substring \"aba\" appears twice (at index0 and index2). \n\n   Therefore, the code above should work.\n\n   But wait: the above code for \"ababa\" at L=3: \n        i=0: \"aba\" -> add to set.\n        i=1: \"bab\" -> add to set.\n        i=2: \"aba\" -> found in set -> break and output 3.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   One more edge: empty string? The problem states non-empty, so we don't worry.\n\n   However, note: the substring extraction: we are using s[i:i+L]. This is safe because i+L is at most n (so we don't go out of bounds).\n\n   But what if the substring is long and we are at the end? The code uses range(0, n-L+1) so i goes from 0 to n-L (inclusive). So i+L is from L to n, which is within the string.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n   Steps:\n     s = input().strip()   [But note: the input is the first line containing the string. The problem says: The first input line contains the string.]\n\n     Actually, the example input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but that is just examples. The actual input is one string per run.\n\n     We can do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n     Then, n = len(s)\n\n     Then, for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          found = False\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  found = True\n                  break\n              seen.add(substr)\n          if found:\n              print(L)\n              exit(0)\n\n     After the loop, if no duplicate was found, print(0)\n\n   However, we can structure the code without an explicit exit(0) by using a flag.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string is of length 1, then maximum duplicate substring length is 0 (unless there are two same characters, but then n=1: two same characters? Actually, if the string is \"aa\", then n=2, so we consider that case above).\n        # We'll iterate from n down to 1.\n\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            duplicate_found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    duplicate_found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if duplicate_found:\n                ans = L\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n   But wait, we break as soon as we find a duplicate at a given L, and then output that L. Then we break the outer loop.\n\n   However, if we don't break, then we continue to smaller L until we find one. But we want the largest L, so we start from the largest and break when we find one.\n\n   This is efficient because we are going from the largest to smallest and the first duplicate we find is the answer.\n\n   But note: what if there are two different duplicate substrings at the same length? We don't care, we break at the first duplicate we find.\n\n   This is acceptable because we are only concerned with the existence of at least one duplicate substring of that length.\n\n   Let me test with \"aaa\": \n        n=3, L=3: \"aaa\" -> set initially empty, add \"aaa\", no duplicate -> next L=2.\n        L=2: \n            i=0: \"aa\" -> add\n            i=1: \"aa\" -> duplicate found -> output 2.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   However, note: the substring \"aa\" appears twice, but also the substring \"a\" appears three times. But we are breaking at L=2 because we found a duplicate, and 2 is larger than 1, so we output 2.\n\n   This is the desired behavior.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string length is 0, but problem says non-empty, so skip.\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            duplicate_found = False\n            # Generate all substrings of length L\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    duplicate_found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if duplicate_found:\n                ans = L\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"abcd\" -> output 0. Correct.\n   Example 2: \"ababa\" -> output 3. Correct.\n   Example 3: \"zzz\" -> output 2. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\" (as discussed above) -> output 2. Correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string length doesn't exceed 100. The above algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst-case (if we check each L and for each L we check up to n-L+1 substrings). The maximum n is 100, so the worst-case is about 100*100 = 10000, which is acceptable.\n\n   But we can optimize by breaking early for larger L. Actually, we are already starting from the largest L, so we break as soon as we find a duplicate.\n\n   One more edge: the string \"a\" (n=1). Then we check L=1: \n        substrings: \"a\" (only one) -> no duplicate -> then we output 0. Correct.\n\n   Another edge: \"aa\" (n=2). Then we check L=2: substring \"aa\" -> no duplicate (only one occurrence). Then L=1: \n        substrings: \"a\" (at i=0) and then i=1: \"a\" -> duplicate -> output 1. Correct.\n\n   Another edge: \"aba\" (n=3). \n        L=3: \"aba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=2: \n            i=0: \"ab\"\n            i=1: \"ba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=1: \n            i=0: \"a\"\n            i=1: \"b\" -> no duplicate (then i=2: \"a\" -> but wait, we break the loop for L=1 at i=0 and i=1, then i=2: \"a\" is added and then no duplicate until we finish. Actually, we break the inner loop only when we find a duplicate. So for L=1:\n                i=0: \"a\" -> add\n                i=1: \"b\" -> add\n                i=2: \"a\" -> found in seen (because \"a\" is already in the set) -> duplicate found -> output 1.\n\n        So the answer for \"aba\" is 1.\n\n   But wait, is that correct? The substring \"a\" appears twice (at index0 and index2). So yes, the answer should be 1.\n\n   However, note that the substring \"a\" is the same as the substring at index0 and index2, so two occurrences. Therefore, 1 is correct.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"b\" appears only once. However, we don't require every substring to appear twice, we require at least one substring (any) to appear at least twice.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"longest substring\", and 1 is the longest because we didn't find any duplicate for L=2 or L=3.\n\n   So we output 1.\n\n   But wait, the example \"zzz\" has two 'z's in a row and then two overlapping 'zz'? Actually, we found the substring \"zz\" (length2) which is longer than 1, so we output 2.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me write the final code.\n\n   Note: The problem reads from standard input.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        ans = 0\n        # We'll iterate L from n down to 1\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found_dup = False\n            # Iterate over all starting indices for substring of length L\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    found_dup = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found_dup:\n                ans = L\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n   However, we can avoid the inner loop if we note that for a fixed L, the number of distinct substrings is at most (n-L+1). But the set operations are O(L) for each substring (because comparing strings of length L) and the total number of substrings is (n-L+1). \n\n   But worst-case, the set might have many strings, but n<=100, so maximum L is 100 and the number of substrings for L=100 is 1, for L=99 is 2, etc. So the total operations for one L is about (n-L+1) * (cost of set insertion and lookup). The set insertion and lookup for strings of length L is O(L) in the worst-case (comparing two strings of length L). But note: the set uses hashing, so average O(L) per operation. \n\n   However, worst-case the string might be very repetitive, but n is only 100, so worst-case total operations is about:\n\n        For L from 100 down to 1: \n            For each L, we do (n-L+1) * (average cost of set operation) and the set operation is O(L) for each substring.\n\n        The total operations: sum_{L=1}^{100} (100 - L + 1) * (L) \n\n        But note: we break at the first duplicate we find. So in the best-case we break early.\n\n   But worst-case (no duplicate) we do the whole thing. The worst-case is when the string has all distinct substrings (like \"abcd...\", but actually even if the string is random, we might not break early). \n\n   The worst-case time is O(n^2 * L) where L is the current length and n is the string length. But note: the total length of all substrings we process is about O(n^3) because for each L we process (n-L+1) substrings and each substring has length L, and the set operations are O(L) for each substring.\n\n   However, n is at most 100, so the worst-case total operations is:\n\n        For L from 1 to 100: \n            Number of substrings = (n - L + 1) \n            Each substring takes O(L) for set operations (hashing and comparison).\n\n        Total operations: sum_{L=1}^{100} (100 - L + 1) * L\n\n        = sum_{L=1}^{100} (101 - L) * L\n        = sum_{L=1}^{100} (101L - L^2)\n\n        = 101 * (100*101//2) - (100*101*201)//6\n\n        But wait, we are not doing for all L from 1 to 100 necessarily. We break from the top (largest L) first, so we only do the inner loop for L from n down to 1 until we find a duplicate.\n\n        But worst-case (no duplicate) we do all L from n down to 1.\n\n        The worst-case total operations is the same.\n\n        Let me compute the sum for L from 1 to 100:\n\n        Sum_{L=1}^{100} (101L - L^2) = 101 * (sum_{L=1}^{100} L) - (sum_{L=1}^{100} L^2)\n\n        = 101 * (100*101//2) - (100*101*201//6)\n\n        = 101 * 5050 - (100*101*201)//6\n\n        = 510050 - (338350)   [because 100*101*201 = 2030100, then 2030100//6 = 338350]\n\n        = 510050 - 338350 = 171700\n\n        But note: each substring operation (set insertion and lookup) is O(L) (because the string length is L). However, the set operations (hashing) for a string of length L is O(L) because we have to compare the entire string in the worst-case (if there are hash collisions). \n\n        So the total operations is about 171700 * (average L)? \n\n        Actually, no: for a fixed L, we are doing (n-L+1) substrings, each of length L, and each set operation (lookup and insertion) is O(L). \n\n        Therefore, the total operations for a fixed L is (n-L+1)*L.\n\n        And we are summing for L from 1 to 100: (100-L+1)*L, which is (101-L)*L, as above.\n\n        So the total operations is about 171700, which is acceptable for n=100.\n\n   However, note: the set operations might involve string comparisons that are O(L) in the worst-case (if the hash doesn't help, but in practice the set uses hashing and then compares only when hashes collide). But worst-case, the set might do full comparisons for each element, and we are storing (n-L+1) elements, so worst-case the set operations might be O(n^2 * L) for a fixed L? Actually, the set insertion and lookup for one string is O(size of the set * cost of comparing strings) in the worst-case? \n\n   But the set uses a hash table, and the average insertion and lookup is O(L) per operation (because the hash function for a string of length L takes O(L) and then we do one probe). However, worst-case the hash table might have many collisions and then we do linear probing, but the set size is (n-L+1) which is at most 100. So the worst-case for set operations for one L is O((n-L+1)*L) which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait, the set operations for one substring: \n        We compute the hash of the substring (O(L)), then we look at the bucket (constant time), then we might have to compare the substring with the existing strings in the bucket (each comparison is O(L)). \n\n   However, the total number of set operations is (n-L+1) for each L, and the total over all L is 171700, and each set operation is O(L). Therefore, the overall worst-case time is O(171700 * (average L))?\n\n   Actually, we are doing for each L separately, and the set operations for a fixed L are (n-L+1) * (cost per set operation). The cost per set operation is O(L) (for the hash computation and then possibly a few comparisons, but the hash computation is O(L)).\n\n   Therefore, the total operations is the sum_{L=1}^{100} (n-L+1) * L, which we computed as 171700.\n\n   But note: the constant factors: each set operation does O(L) work, so the total work is the sum_{L=1}^{100} (n-L+1) * L, which is 171700. \n\n   However, wait: for each substring, we do two things: \n        - Compute the hash (O(L))\n        - Then if there's a hash collision, we do a string comparison (worst-case O(L))\n\n   But the set operations are built-in and optimized. Since n is only 100, we don't need to worry.\n\n   Let me run the code for a worst-case string (all distinct characters, so no duplicate) and n=100.\n\n   But worst-case no duplicate, so we do all L from 100 down to 1.\n\n   The total operations is about 171700, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string consists of lower-case Latin letters, and the length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found_dup = False\n            # Iterate through all starting indices for substrings of length L\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    found_dup = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found_dup:\n                ans = L\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n   Let me test with the examples again.\n\n   Example: \"abcd\" -> 0. Correct.\n   Example: \"ababa\" -> 3. Correct.\n   Example: \"zzz\" -> 2. Correct.\n\n   Example: \"a\" -> 0. Correct.\n   Example: \"aa\" -> 1. Correct.\n\n   Example: \"aba\" -> 1. Correct.\n\n   Example: \"aabbcc\" -> 2. Correct.\n\n   Example: \"abababa\" -> 5. Correct.\n\n   Example: \"aaa\" -> 2. Correct.\n\n   Example: \"aaaa\" -> \n        n=4, \n        L=4: \"aaaa\" -> no duplicate (only one occurrence) -> no.\n        L=3: \n            \"aaa\" (at i=0), then \"aaa\" (at i=1) -> duplicate -> output 3.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"aaa\" in \"aaaa\" appears three times? Actually, the problem says \"at least twice\", so 3 is the length and it appears twice (at i=0 and i=1). So output 3.\n\n   However, note: the substring \"aaa\" at i=0 and i=1 is two occurrences. Then we output 3.\n\n   But wait, is there a substring of length 4? No, because the entire string is \"aaaa\", and the substring \"aaaa\" is only one. Then we check L=3, and we break.\n\n   So the code outputs 3 for \"aaaa\".\n\n   But wait, is there a substring of length 3 that appears twice? Yes, \"aaa\" at index0 and index1.\n\n   So the answer is 3.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"longest\", so we are returning the largest L for which there is a duplicate. And 3 is the largest.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n   However, note: the problem statement says the input is one string. We read one string.\n\n   Let me run the code on the sample inputs.\n\n   Sample input: \n        abcd -> 0\n        ababa -> 3\n        zzz -> 2\n\n   We can also test with multiple test cases? The problem says the first input line contains the string. So we assume one string per run.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list of strings. In competitive programming, we read one string.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Code submitted.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, and the solution must efficiently handle all edge cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters (substring) that occurs at least twice in the input string. The key observation here is that substrings can overlap, which means we don't need to consider non-overlapping occurrences only.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings from the longest to the shortest. For each possible substring length, we examine all substrings of that length and check if any of them appear more than once. The first such length found during this process will be the answer since we are checking from the largest to the smallest substring length.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a brute-force approach but optimized by starting from the largest possible substring length and moving downwards. For each length, we use a set to keep track of seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return the current length as the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each possible substring length from the string's length down to 1. For each length, it processes up to \\(O(n)\\) substrings, each of length \\(L\\). The worst-case time complexity is \\(O(n^3)\\), but given the constraint \\(n \\leq 100\\), this is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit(0)\n\nans = 0\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    found_dup = False\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            found_dup = True\n            break\n        seen.add(substr)\n    if found_dup:\n        ans = L\n        break\n\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string is empty (though the problem guarantees it's non-empty), the output is 0.\n3. **Iterating Over Substring Lengths**: The loop starts from the full string length down to 1. For each length \\(L\\), it checks all possible substrings of that length.\n4. **Tracking Seen Substrings**: A set is used to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is found in the set during processing, it means the substring appears at least twice, and the current length \\(L\\) is recorded as the answer.\n5. **Output Result**: Once the largest valid length is found, the loop breaks, and the result is printed. If no duplicates are found after checking all lengths, the result remains 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination upon finding the longest valid substring, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
