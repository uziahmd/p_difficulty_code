He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and then 2n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1). There are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n We know that the actual string s of length n must have as its prefixes and suffixes exactly these 2n-2 strings, but we don't know which are prefix and which are suffix.\n\n Conditions:\n - The answer must be a string of length 2n-2 containing 'P' and 'S' with equal numbers (so n-1 of each).\n - The i-th character is 'P' if the i-th input string is a prefix, and 'S' otherwise.\n\n However, note: There might be multiple valid answers. But we are guaranteed that there is at least one string of length n that is consistent.\n\n Approach:\n\n Observation: The problem states that there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let A[k] be the set of two strings of length k.\n\n What do we know?\n   The full string s of length n must start with some prefix of length n-1 and end with some suffix of length n-1.\n   Moreover, the entire set of proper prefixes (all lengths 1 to n-1) and proper suffixes (all lengths 1 to n-1) are given.\n\n How can we assign labels?\n\n Idea: \n   Since the full string s has a fixed structure, the first n-1 characters (the prefix of length n-1) and the last n-1 characters (the suffix of length n-1) must match in the overlapping part (if any). \n\n However, note: the two strings of length n-1: one must be the prefix and one must be the suffix. But wait, what if the two strings of length n-1 are actually the same? Then the string s must be that string repeated? Not necessarily.\n\n Actually, consider: the entire string s must be such that:\n   s[0:n-1] = P_{n-1} (prefix of length n-1)\n   s[1:n] = S_{n-1} (suffix of length n-1)\n\n Then, for the middle part (if n>=3) we have:\n   s[0] = s[0] (from the prefix of length 1 and the prefix of length n-1) and also s[n-1] = s[n] (wait, let me index from 0 to n-1).\n\n Actually, more precisely:\n   s[0] must equal the first character of the prefix of length n-1 and also the last character of the suffix of length n-1? Not directly.\n\n But note: the entire string s must be consistent with all the given prefixes and suffixes. \n\n However, note that the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\".\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We know that the set of all proper prefixes and suffixes of s are given. Therefore, the full string s must satisfy that:\n   For each length k from 1 to n-1, the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must be defined, and they are two different strings (unless n==2, then two strings of length 1, which might be same? but note: example 3: n=2, and the two strings are \"a\" and \"c\", so they are different).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Group the input by length. There are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n 2. We need to assign one of the two strings of length k as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n 3. However, the assignment must be such that the entire string s (of length n) is consistent. How?\n\n    Let s = x0 x1 ... x_{n-1}\n\n    Then, for a given length k, the prefix of length k is s[0:k] and the suffix of length k is s[n-k: n].\n\n    Now, consider two consecutive conditions: for k and k+1.\n\n    For the prefix of length k: we have s[0:k] = p_k\n    For the prefix of length k+1: we have s[0:k+1] = p_{k+1}\n\n    Similarly, for the suffix of length k: we have s[n-k: n] = s_k\n    For the suffix of length k+1: we have s[n-k-1: n] = s_{k+1}   [Wait, no: the suffix of length k+1 is s[n-(k+1):n] = s[n-k-1:n] ]\n\n    But note: the condition that the string s must be consistent with all the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\n    However, we don't know which one",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings and their relationships to deduce the correct labeling (either 'P' for prefix or 'S' for suffix) for each input string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: The input consists of `2n-2` strings, with exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`. We first group these strings by their lengths.\n2. **Identify Overlapping Constraints**: For the unknown string `s` of length `n`, the prefix of length `k` must start with the prefix of length `k-1`, and the suffix of length `k` must end with the suffix of length `k-1`. This creates constraints that help in determining which strings can be prefixes and which can be suffixes.\n3. **Determine Labels**: Using the constraints derived from overlapping parts of prefixes and suffixes, we label each string as either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix). Specifically, for each length `k`, the string that matches the expected continuation of the previous prefix or suffix is labeled accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    total_strings = 2 * n - 2\n    strings = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(total_strings):\n        strings.append(data[index].strip())\n        index += 1\n\n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        k = len(s)\n        if k not in groups:\n            groups[k] = []\n        groups[k].append(s)\n    \n    result = []\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        if k == n-1:\n            p_str, s_str = groups[k]\n            # We don't know which is which yet, but we can use the fact that the entire string must be consistent.\n            # However, note: there might be multiple possibilities, but the problem guarantees at least one string exists.\n            # But wait, how do we decide? Actually, we can look at the next step: the full string must have a prefix and a suffix of length n-1.\n            # However, we cannot directly compare with other lengths because k is n-1. Instead, we can use the following:\n            # The two strings of length n-1: one will be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n            # There's no immediate constraint from a shorter length here, so we need to look at the entire string consistency?\n            # But note: the problem doesn't require constructing the string, only labeling the given ones.\n            # The example: n=2, then we have two strings of length 1. Then we have two choices: either the first is prefix and the second suffix, or vice versa.\n            # However, the problem says: \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n            # So we can arbitrarily choose one, but we must ensure that the counts are equal (n-1 of each).\n            # But wait, there might be more constraints from the fact that the entire string must exist. However, the problem guarantees that there is at least one string consistent with the given set.\n            # Therefore, we can assign arbitrarily for the last length, but we must consider the entire assignment must be consistent.\n            # However, note: the problem does not require us to output the full string, only the labels. And the labels must have exactly n-1 'P's and n-1 'S's.\n            # Since we have two strings of each length, and for each length we must assign one as 'P' and one as 'S', we can do:\n            # But wait, what about the constraint between different lengths? \n            # Actually, the key insight is that the prefix of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1, and similarly for suffixes.\n            # For k from 1 to n-2, we can use this to determine the labels. For k = n-1, we have no such constraint, so we can assign arbitrarily, but we must ensure that the entire assignment is balanced (equal number of 'P' and 'S').\n            # However, since the total number of strings is 2n-2, and we have n-1 of each label, we can assign the last group arbitrarily and adjust the count if necessary.\n            # But note: the example input for n=2: \n            #   Input: ['2', 'a', 'c']\n            #   Output: ['PS'] or ['SP'].\n            # How do we decide? The problem says: \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n            # Therefore, we can process all lengths except the last one (n-1) first, then handle the last one by ensuring the total counts are correct.\n            # But wait, the example n=3:\n            #   Input: ['3', 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a']\n            #   Output: 'PPSS' or 'SPSP', etc.\n            # Let's reexamine: the two strings of length 1: ['a', 'a'] -> both are the same. So they must be assigned one as prefix and one as suffix.\n            # Similarly, for length 2: ['aa', 'a'] -> wait, actually the example input was: \n            #   Input: \n            #       3\n            #       a\n            #       aa\n            #       aa\n            #       a\n            #   So the groups are:\n            #       length 1: ['a', 'a']\n            #       length 2: ['aa', 'a']   -> but wait, the example input says there are exactly two strings of each length. Here, length 2 has two strings: 'aa' and 'a'? Actually, the example input is provided as:\n            #           3\n            #           a\n            #           aa\n            #           aa\n            #           a\n            #       This means there are four strings: two of length 1 and two of length 2. But the example input says: \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\".\n            #       In the example, the two strings of length 2 are 'aa' and 'a'. But note: the string of length 2 must be a substring of the full string of length 3. And the full string must be \"aaa\" (since the example says the only string is \"aaa\").\n            #\n            #       Now, the prefixes and suffixes of \"aaa\" are:\n            #           length1: \"a\", \"a\"\n            #           length2: \"aa\", \"aa\" (but wait, the suffix of length 2 is \"aa\"? Actually, the suffix of length 2 of \"aaa\" is \"aa\" (from index 1 to 3). However, the input has two strings of length2: 'aa' and 'a'. So this contradicts.\n            #\n            #       Let me check the example again: the example input is given as:\n            #           Input: ['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n            #       The third example is n=2: \n            #           Input: \n            #               2\n            #               a\n            #               c\n            #           Output: 'PS'\n            #\n            #       So the example n=3 is actually: \n            #           Input: \n            #               3\n            #               a\n            #               aa\n            #               aa\n            #               a\n            #           But wait, the example output is \"PPSS\", meaning the first two strings are labeled 'P' and the last two 'S'. But the first string is 'a' (length1), the second and third are 'aa' and 'a' (length2). \n            #\n            #       Actually, the example input format is: \n            #           The first line is n, then 2n-2 lines of strings.\n            #       For n=3, there are 4 strings. The example input provided is: \n            #           3\n            #           a\n            #           aa\n            #           aa\n            #           a\n            #       This means the two strings of length1 are the two 'a's, and the two strings of length2 are 'aa' and 'a'. But note: the string 'a' of length2 is not a valid prefix or suffix of a string of length3? Actually, it can be a suffix (if the full string ends with 'a') but then the prefix of length2 must be 'aa' or something else. \n            #\n            #       Let me clarify with the example: the example says the only string is \"aaa\". The proper prefixes and suffixes of \"aaa\" are:\n            #           Prefixes: \"a\", \"aa\"\n            #           Suffixes: \"a\", \"aa\"\n            #       So the given strings should be two 'a's and two 'aa's. But the input has two 'a's and one 'aa' and one 'a'. This is inconsistent.\n            #\n            #       Wait, the example input is: \n            #           \"3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na\"\n            #       So the four strings are: \n            #           [ 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a' ]\n            #       This means: \n            #           length1: two strings: 'a' and 'a'\n            #           length2: two strings: 'aa' and 'aa'\n            #       I see, the example input was miswritten in the note above. The correct input for n=3 is four strings: two of length1 and two of length2, but the two of length2 are both 'aa'.\n            #\n            #       Therefore, the example input for n=3 should be:\n            #           3\n            #           a\n            #           a\n            #           aa\n            #           aa\n            #\n            #       Then the solution would be:\n            #           The two strings of length1 must be labeled one 'P' and one 'S'. The two strings of length2 must be labeled one 'P' and one 'S'. \n            #           But note: the prefix of length2 must start with the prefix of length1. Similarly, the suffix of length2 must end with the suffix of length1.\n            #\n            #       However, the problem states: \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\". So the input will always be consistent.\n            #\n            #       Given the complexity, let's simplify the approach:\n            #       We know that the full string `s` must satisfy:\n            #           s[0:k] = prefix_k (one of the two strings of length k)\n            #           s[n-k:n] = suffix_k (the other string of length k)\n            #       Additionally, for k from 1 to n-2, the prefix of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1, and the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       Therefore, for each length k (from 1 to n-2), we can determine which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix by checking the overlap with the previous length.\n            #\n            #       Steps:\n            #         1. For k from 1 to n-2 (inclusive):\n            #             - The two strings of length k are `A` and `B`.\n            #             - The two strings of length k-1 are `X` (prefix) and `Y` (suffix). But note: we already know one of them is the prefix and the other is the suffix for k-1.\n            #             - The prefix of length k must be `X + char` where `char` is the next character (which must match the corresponding part of the suffix of length k-1? Not exactly).\n            #         2. Actually, consider the prefix of length k: it must start with the prefix of length k-1. So the prefix of length k must begin with the string chosen as the prefix of length k-1.\n            #         3. Similarly, the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       Therefore, for a given k (>=2 and <= n-1), the two candidates for the prefix of length k must be:\n            #           candidate1 = prefix_{k-1} + char1\n            #           candidate2 = prefix_{k-1} + char2\n            #       But wait, we don't know the next character. Alternatively, we can look at the suffix of length k-1: the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       However, note: the full string `s` is fixed. The prefix of length k is the first k characters, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters. The prefix of length k-1 is the first k-1 characters, and the suffix of length k-1 is the last k-1 characters.\n            #       Therefore, the prefix of length k must be the prefix of length k-1 plus the next character (which is the k-th character). Similarly, the suffix of length k must be the (n-k)-th character (from the beginning) followed by the suffix of length k-1? Not exactly: the suffix of length k is the substring from index n-k to the end, which must end with the suffix of length k-1. That means the first character of the suffix of length k (at position n-k) must be the same as the first character of the suffix of length k-1 (which is the last character of the full string minus (k-1) characters)? Not necessarily the same as the first character of the suffix of length k-1, but the entire suffix of length k-1 must appear at the end of the suffix of length k.\n            #\n            #       Actually, the suffix of length k is the last k characters. The suffix of length k-1 is the last k-1 characters. Therefore, the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1. So the last k-1 characters of the suffix of length k must be the suffix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       Similarly, the prefix of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       Therefore, for each k (from 2 to n-1):\n            #           - One of the two strings of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1 (which we already determined).\n            #           - The other must end with the suffix of length k-1 (which we already determined).\n            #\n            #       But wait, what if both conditions are satisfied by one string? Or neither? The problem guarantees that there is at least one string consistent, so we can use this to determine the labels.\n            #\n            #       Algorithm for k from 2 to n-1:\n            #           Let A and B be the two strings of length k.\n            #           Let P_prev be the prefix of length k-1 (already determined) and S_prev be the suffix of length k-1 (already determined).\n            #           Check if A starts with P_prev and B ends with S_prev. Then, if one of them satisfies one condition, we can assign the other one to the opposite.\n            #           However, note: the prefix of length k must be the one that starts with P_prev, and the suffix must be the one that ends with S_prev. But these could be the same string? Only if the string of length k is both a continuation of the prefix and ends with the suffix. But in general, they are distinct.\n            #\n            #       Example for n=3, k=2:\n            #           Strings of length2: ['aa', 'aa'] (in the corrected example).\n            #           Prefix of length1: say we have two strings of length1: ['a','a']. We need to assign one as prefix and one as suffix. But which one?\n            #           For length1, we don't have constraints from previous lengths (since k-1=0 doesn't exist). So we can assign arbitrarily, but we must ensure the entire assignment is consistent.\n            #           However, note: the full string must be \"aaa\". Therefore, the prefix of length1 must be 'a' and the suffix of length1 must be 'a'. Then for length2, both strings are 'aa'. Now, the prefix of length2 must start with the prefix of length1 ('a'), which both do. Similarly, the suffix of length2 must end with the suffix of length1 ('a'), which both do. So both strings of length2 satisfy both conditions. Then how to assign?\n            #\n            #       In this case, we can assign one as prefix and one as suffix arbitrarily, but we must maintain the balance of counts (n-1 of each). Since we have two strings of length2, we assign one as 'P' and one as 'S'.\n            #\n            #       Therefore, the plan is:\n            #         - For lengths from 1 to n-1, we will assign one string as prefix and one as suffix.\n            #         - For each length k (starting from 1), we can use the constraints from the previous length (if k > 1) to determine the labels. If k==1, we can assign arbitrarily.\n            #         - For k>=2, we use the fact that the prefix of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1, and the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n            #         - If a string of length k starts with the prefix of length k-1, then it must be the prefix (unless there's a conflict). Similarly, if it ends with the suffix of length k-1, then it must be the suffix.\n            #         - But note: a string might satisfy both conditions. In that case, we can assign it as either, but then we must assign the other string as the remaining label.\n            #         - However, the problem allows any valid answer. So we can assign the string that satisfies the prefix condition as prefix, and the other as suffix, unless the other string also satisfies the suffix condition. In that case, we can assign arbitrarily, but we must ensure that the total counts are correct.\n            #\n            #       Implementation:\n            #         Step 1: Read n and the strings.\n            #         Step 2: Group strings by length.\n            #         Step 3: Initialize an empty list for results.\n            #         Step 4: For k from 1 to n-1:\n            #             - If k==1, then we have two strings. We can assign one arbitrarily as 'P' and the other as 'S'. But note: we need to remember which one is the prefix and which is the suffix for the next lengths.\n            #             - However, we must also consider that the assignment for k=1 might affect the assignment for k=2. Therefore, we cannot assign arbitrarily without considering future constraints.\n            #\n            #       This becomes complex. Let's try a different approach:\n            #         We know that the full string `s` of length n must have:\n            #           s[0:n-1] = prefix_{n-1}\n            #           s[1:n] = suffix_{n-1}\n            #         Also, for each length k, the prefix of length k is s[0:k] and the suffix of length k is s[n-k:n].\n            #         Moreover, the prefix of length k must be the prefix of length k-1 plus the next character, and the suffix of length k must be the previous character plus the suffix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       Another idea: \n            #         The full string `s` can be constructed by aligning the given prefixes and suffixes. But note, we don't know which is which.\n            #         However, the problem does not require constructing `s`, only labeling the given strings.\n            #\n            #       Insight:\n            #         Consider the shortest strings first. For length 1, there are two strings. One must be the prefix and one the suffix. But the full string `s` must start and end with these characters. \n            #         For length 2, the prefix must start with the length1 prefix, and the suffix must end with the length1 suffix.\n            #         Therefore, for length 2, the two strings are candidates: one must start with the length1 prefix, and the other must end with the length1 suffix.\n            #         But what if the two strings of length2 are the same? Then we need to assign one as prefix and one as suffix arbitrarily, but then we must ensure that the prefix condition (starts with length1 prefix) and suffix condition (ends with length1 suffix) hold for the appropriate one.\n            #\n            #       Given the complexity, let's break down the solution into steps:\n\n            #       Step 1: Group the strings by length.\n            #       Step 2: For each length k from 1 to n-1, we have two strings.\n            #       Step 3: We will determine the labels for the strings of length k based on the labels of length k-1 (if k>1). For k==1, we can assign arbitrarily, but we must keep track of which string is the prefix and which is the suffix for the next lengths.\n            #       Step 4: However, we don't know the actual string `s`, so we need to ensure that the assignment is consistent with the existence of `s`.\n\n            #       Alternative simpler approach (since n<=100 and the strings are short):\n            #         Since the total number of strings is small (at most 198 for n=100), we can try to find a consistent assignment by checking all possibilities? But 2^(2n-2) is too many.\n\n            #       Another idea: \n            #         Let's assume we can determine the full string `s` by combining the given prefixes and suffixes. But we don't know which is which.\n\n            #       Observation:\n            #         The full string `s` must be such that its prefix of length k is one of the given strings of length k, and its suffix of length k is the other given string of length k.\n            #         Moreover, the prefix of length k must be the first k characters of `s`, and the suffix of length k must be the last k characters.\n\n            #       We can try to build `s` by assuming one of the strings of length n-1 is the prefix and the other is the suffix, then check if the built string matches the given prefixes and suffixes for all lengths.\n\n            #       However, the problem says there might be multiple valid answers, and we only need to output one.\n\n            #       Steps for building `s`:\n            #         - Let `s` be unknown.\n            #         - The prefix of length n-1 is one of the two strings of length n-1, and the suffix of length n-1 is the other.\n            #         - Then, the full string `s` must be: prefix_{n-1} + (last character of suffix_{n-1})? No, because the prefix_{n-1} is the first n-1 characters, and the suffix_{n-1} is the last n-1 characters. They overlap in the middle n-2 characters.\n            #         - Actually, s = prefix_{n-1} + c, where c is the last character of the suffix_{n-1}? But then the last n-1 characters would be the last n-1 characters of prefix_{n-1} concatenated with c, but that is not necessarily the suffix_{n-1}.\n            #\n            #       Let me denote:\n            #         Let P = prefix_{n-1} = s[0:n-1]\n            #         Let S = suffix_{n-1} = s[1:n]\n            #         Then, s = P + (S[-1])? But then S should be s[1:n] = P[1:] + S[-1]. \n            #         But note: s[0:n-1] = P, and s[1:n] = S. Then, the character at position 0 is P[0], and the character at position n-1 is S[-1]. The character at position n-1 must also be the last character of P, i.e., P[-1] = S[-1]? Not necessarily.\n            #\n            #       Example: n=3, P=\"ab\", S=\"bc\". Then s must be \"abc\". Indeed, P=\"ab\", S=\"bc\", and the last character of P is 'b' which is the first character of S.\n            #\n            #       In general, for a string `s` of length n, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1] and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n]. Therefore, the last character of the prefix (n-1) is s[n-2], and the first character of the suffix (n-1) is s[1]. These are not necessarily the same.\n            #\n            #       Actually, the relationship is:\n            #         s[0] = P[0]\n            #         s[1] = P[1] = S[0]\n            #         s[2] = P[2] (if n-1>=3) and also S[1]\n            #         ...\n            #         s[n-2] = P[n-2] = S[n-3]\n            #         s[n-1] = S[n-2]\n            #\n            #       This implies that for all i from 0 to n-2, s[i] = P[i] and s[i] = S[i] for i from 1 to n-2. Therefore, the characters from index 1 to n-2 must match between the prefix and suffix of length n-1.\n            #\n            #       So the two strings of length n-1 must agree on the overlapping part (i.e., the first n-2 characters of the suffix must equal the last n-2 characters of the prefix). \n            #\n            #       Therefore, to determine the two strings of length n-1, we can check which pair (A, B) of the two given strings of length n-1 satisfies A[i] == B[i] for i from 1 to n-2 (if we consider A as the prefix and B as the suffix, then the overlapping part is A[1:] and B[:-1]).\n            #\n            #       Similarly, for the other lengths, we can use the fact that the prefix of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1 and the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n\n            #       Revised plan:\n            #         1. Group the strings by length.\n            #         2. For k from n-1 down to 1:\n            #             - For the current length k, we have two strings: X and Y.\n            #             - If k == n-1:\n            #                 - We need to choose one as the prefix and the other as the suffix.\n            #                 - The condition: the overlapping part (the first n-2 characters of the suffix must equal the last n-2 characters of the prefix) must hold.\n            #                 - Specifically, if we choose X as prefix and Y as suffix, then X[1:] must equal Y[:-1].\n            #                 - If that holds, then we assign X as 'P' and Y as 'S'. Otherwise, we assign Y as 'P' and X as 'S'.\n            #             - If k < n-1:\n            #                 - We have two strings: A and B.\n            #                 - We already know the prefix and suffix of length k+1.\n            #                 - The prefix of length k must be the prefix of length k+1[0:k].\n            #                 - Similarly, the suffix of length k must be the suffix of length k+1[1:].\n            #                 - But note: the given strings of length k might not be the exact prefixes/suffixes of the full string. However, the problem guarantees that there exists a string `s` of length n that is consistent.\n            #                 - Actually, we can derive the prefix of length k from the known prefix of length k+1: it must be the first k characters of the prefix of length k+1.\n            #                 - Similarly, the suffix of length k must be the last k characters of the suffix of length k+1.\n            #                 - But wait, the suffix of length k+1 is the last k+1 characters. The suffix of length k is the last k characters, which is indeed the last k characters of the suffix of length k+1.\n            #\n            #       However, note: the given strings of length k are not necessarily the prefixes/suffixes of the full string `s` in the order of increasing length. But we are allowed to assign arbitrarily.\n\n            #       But let's reframe: \n            #         We are given two strings for each length. We need to assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n            #         The catch: the assignment must be such that the entire string `s` exists.\n\n            #       Given the time, I propose the following greedy method:\n\n            #         Step 1: Start with length = n-1. There are two strings. Check if one of them is the prefix and the other is the suffix by verifying the overlapping condition (X[1:] == Y[:-1] for X as prefix and Y as suffix). If yes, assign X as 'P' and Y as 'S'. Otherwise, assign Y as 'P' and X as 'S'. (Note: there is always a solution due to the problem's guarantee.)\n            #         Step 2: Move to length = n-2. We now know the prefix and suffix of length n-1. The two strings of length n-2 must be:\n            #                 - The prefix of length n-2 must be the first n-2 characters of the prefix of length n-1.\n            #                 - The suffix of length n-2 must be the last n-2 characters of the suffix of length n-1.\n            #         Step 3: But wait, the given strings of length n-2 might not be exactly these. However, the problem guarantees that the given strings are indeed the prefixes and suffixes of some string `s` of length n.\n\n            #       But note: the prefixes and suffixes of `s` are defined uniquely for each length. So the prefix of length n-2 is the first n-2 characters of the prefix of length n-1, and the suffix of length n-2 is the last n-2 characters of the suffix of length n-1.\n\n            #       Therefore, for each length k (from n-1 down to 1), we can determine the correct string for the prefix and suffix by:\n            #         - For k = n-1: use the overlapping condition.\n            #         - For k < n-1: \n            #             prefix_k = prefix_{k+1}[0:k]   (if the prefix_{k+1} is already determined)\n            #             suffix_k = suffix_{k+1}[1:k+1]   (if the suffix_{k+1} is already determined)\n\n            #       However, we are given two strings for length k. One of them must be the prefix_k and the other must be the suffix_k.\n\n            #       But wait, the given strings might not include the exact substrings? \n\n            #       Let's test with n=3, k=1 (after having determined the strings for length2):\n            #         Suppose we have determined:\n            #           prefix_{2} = \"aa\", suffix_{2} = \"aa\"\n            #         Then, the full string `s` is \"aaa\".\n            #         The prefix of length1 should be \"a\", and the suffix of length1 should be \"a\".\n            #         But the given strings for length1 are two \"a\"s.

So it works.\n\n            #       But what if the full string is \"abac\" (n=4)? \n            #         prefix3 = \"aba\", suffix3 = \"bac\"\n            #         Then, prefix2 = \"ab\", which is the first 2 of \"aba\".\n            #         suffix2 = \"ac\", which is the last 2 of \"bac\" -> \"ac\" is indeed the last 2 of \"bac\".\n\n            #       So the method is sound.\n\n            #       Steps summary:\n\n            #         1. Group the strings by length.\n            #         2. Initialize two dictionaries: prefix_dict and suffix_dict.\n            #         3. Start from length = n-1 and go down to 1.\n            #         4. For each length k:\n            #             if k == n-1:\n            #                 Given two strings A and B.\n            #                 If A[1:] == B[:-1]: then A is prefix, B is suffix.\n            #                 Else if B[1:] == A[:-1]: then B is prefix, A is suffix.\n            #                 Else: assign arbitrarily (though the problem guarantee ensures one of the first two will hold).\n            #             else:\n            #                 candidate_prefix = prefix_dict[k+1][:k]\n            #                 candidate_suffix = suffix_dict[k+1][1:1+k]\n            #                 The two strings for length k are C and D.\n            #                 Then, assign candidate_prefix to be the prefix (if present) and candidate_suffix to be the suffix (if present). \n            #                 But note: the two given strings are exactly candidate_prefix and candidate_suffix? Not necessarily, but the problem guarantees that there is a string `s` of length n, so these candidates must be among the given strings.\n\n            #         5. Once we have determined the prefix and suffix for each length, we can output the result in the order of the input strings.\n\n            #       But wait, the input order is arbitrary. We need to output a string of 'P' and 'S' in the order of the input.\n\n            #       How to map back to the input order?\n\n            #         We can store the input strings along with their index.\n\n            #       Let's modify the grouping: instead of just storing the strings, store (string, original_index) and also record the length.\n\n            #       Steps:\n\n            #         1. Read n.\n            #         2. Read the next 2n-2 lines, keeping track of the original index (from 0 to 2n-3).\n            #         3. Group by length, but also store the index.\n            #         4. For each length from n-1 down to 1, determine the prefix and suffix.\n            #         5. Then, for each input string (by its original index), output 'P' if it was determined to be a prefix, 'S' if a suffix.\n\n            #       However, note: the problem does not specify the order of the input strings beyond the first integer. The output must be a string of length 2n-2 with the i-th character corresponding to the i-th input string.\n\n            #       Implementation:\n\n            #         Let's create an array `result_chars` of length (2n-2) initially filled with None.\n\n            #         We'll group the input strings by length, and for each length, we'll have a list of tuples (string, index).\n\n            #         Then, for k from n-1 down to 1:\n            #             Let L = groups[k]  (list of two tuples)\n            #             If k == n-1:\n            #                 (A, idx_A), (B, idx_B) = L\n            #                 if A[1:] == B[:-1]:\n            #                     prefix_dict[k] = A\n            #                     suffix_dict[k] = B\n            #                     result_chars[idx_A] = 'P'\n            #                     result_chars[idx_B] = 'S'\n            #                 elif B[1:] == A[:-1]:\n            #                     prefix_dict[k] = B\n            #                     suffix_dict[k] = A\n            #                     result_chars[idx_A] = 'S'\n            #                     result_chars[idx_B] = 'P'\n            #                 else:\n            #                     # Fallback: assign arbitrarily\n            #                     prefix_dict[k] = A\n            #                     suffix_dict[k] = B\n            #                     result_chars[idx_A] = 'P'\n            #                     result_chars[idx_B] = 'S'\n            #             else:\n            #                 # k < n-1\n            #                 # Get the candidate_prefix from prefix_dict[k+1] (which is a string)\n            #                 cand_prefix = prefix_dict[k+1][:k]\n            #                 cand_suffix = suffix_dict[k+1][1:1+k]\n            #                 # Now, the two strings for length k are cand_prefix and cand_suffix? \n            #                 # But the given strings might be in any order.\n            #                 # We need to find which string is cand_prefix and which is cand_suffix.\n            #                 found_prefix = None\n            #                 found_suffix = None\n            #                 for (str_val, idx_val) in L:\n            #                     if str_val == cand_prefix:\n            #                         found_prefix = (str_val, idx_val)\n            #                     if str_val == cand_suffix:\n            #                         found_suffix = (str_val, idx_val)\n            #                 if found_prefix and found_suffix:\n            #                     # But note: cand_prefix and cand_suffix should be distinct.\n            #                     if found_prefix[0] == cand_prefix and found_suffix[0] == cand_suffix:\n            #                         result_chars[found_prefix[1]] = 'P'\n            #                         result_chars[found_suffix[1]] = 'S'\n            #                     else:\n            #                         # This should not happen if the candidate computation is correct.\n            #                         # But if they are the same, then assign arbitrarily.\n            #                         result_chars[L[0][1]] = 'P'\n            #                         result_chars[L[1][1]] = 'S'\n            #                 else:\n            #                     # Fallback: assign arbitrarily\n            #                     result_chars[L[0][1]] = 'P'\n            #                     result_chars[L[1][1]] = 'S'\n\n            #         6.

In this labeling, the string 'a' appears twice: once as a prefix (at index3) and once as a suffix (at index0). But the problem does not require that each occurrence is labeled uniquely. It only requires that there exists a string `s` (which is \"aaa\") that has these as its prefixes and suffixes. \n            #           However, note: the input has two 'a's and two 'aa's.

We then look at the two strings of length1 and assign one arbitrarily as 'P' and the other as 'S'. \n\n            #         But the problem allows any valid answer. We can change the assignment for length1 arbitrarily as long as one is 'P' and one is 'S'. \n\n            #         However, our algorithm currently uses the order in the group (which is the order of appearance in the input for that length). We can modify the algorithm to not favor the first occurrence.\n\n            #         In the fallback for length1 (or any length), when both candidates are the same string, we can choose either occurrence to be 'P' and the other 'S'. \n\n            #         We can do:\n\n            #           In the else branch for k<n-1, after computing cand_prefix and cand_suffix, if the group has two identical strings, then we can assign arbitrarily. But we must ensure that the counts are correct.\n\n            #         However, note: the problem does not require a specific assignment. Any assignment that results in n-1 'P's and n-1 'S's is acceptable.\n\n            #         Therefore, we can simply assign the two strings of length1 arbitrarily: one 'P' and one 'S', regardless of the candidate computation. But wait, the candidate computation is crucial for the higher lengths.\n\n            #         Actually, the candidates for lower lengths are derived from the higher lengths. Therefore, for k<n-1, we must assign the candidates correctly. Only for k=n-1 we have no higher length to base on.\n\n            #         So for k=n-1, we use the overlapping condition. For k<n-1, we use the candidates from k+1.\n\n            #         In the example n=3, the candidates for k=1 are 'a' and 'a'. These are the only two possibilities. We must assign one of the two 'a's to 'P' and the other to 'S'. \n\n            #         The choice we make affects the output order. \n\n            #         To produce different outputs, we can change the order in which we process the two strings in the group for length1.\n\n            #         But note: the group for length1 is built from the input order. We can sort the group by index to ensure consistent ordering.\n\n            #         Alternatively, we can note that the input order is fixed, and we are required to output the answer in the input order.\n\n            #         Therefore, we must assign the labels to the input strings in the order they appear.\n\n            #         Since the problem allows any valid answer, we can choose any assignment that is consistent. \n\n            #         But our current algorithm for k<n-1 is:\n\n            #           cand_prefix = ... \n            #           cand_suffix = ...\n            #           Then, we iterate over the list L (which is the group for length k) and look for cand_prefix and cand_suffix.\n\n            #         The list L is built in the order of appearance in the input. \n\n            #         In the example n=3, the input order for length1 is ['a','a'] (first occurrence and fourth occurrence). \n\n            #         We can change the algorithm to not rely on the order in the group for k<n-1. Instead, we can determine the candidate strings from the higher length and then assign the labels to the input strings by matching the candidate strings.\n\n            #         But note: the candidate strings must be among the given strings. \n\n            #         In the example, cand_prefix and cand_suffix are both 'a'. The group for length1 has two 'a's. We can assign the first occurrence of 'a' (which is the first string in the input) to 'P' and the second occurrence (the fourth string) to 'S', or vice versa.\n\n            #         To allow flexibility, we can do:\n\n            #           For k from n-1 down to 1:\n            #             if k == n-1: use the overlapping condition.\n            #             else:\n            #                 cand_prefix = ... \n            #                 cand_suffix = ...\n            #                 # Now, the two given strings for length k are cand_prefix and cand_suffix (possibly in any order).\n            #                 # We need to assign the label 'P' to the string that is cand_prefix and 'S' to the string that is cand_suffix.\n            #                 # But if cand_prefix == cand_suffix, then we have two identical strings, and we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n            #         However, the problem guarantee ensures that there is a string `s` of length n, so the candidates must be among the given strings. But the given strings might be the same.\n\n            #         We can implement the assignment for k<n-1 as follows:\n\n            #             Let the two strings in the group for length k be L = [(s1, idx1), (s2, idx2)]\n            #             If cand_prefix == cand_suffix:\n            #                 Then, we can assign the first string in L as 'P' and the second as 'S', or vice versa. \n            #                 But to be consistent with our candidate, note that cand_prefix is the prefix and cand_suffix is the suffix. Since they are the same, we can assign arbitrarily.\n            #                 However, we must ensure that the total number of 'P' and 'S' is n-1 each.\n            #             Else:\n            #                 Assign the string that equals cand_prefix to 'P', and the other to 'S'.\n\n            #         But wait, if cand_prefix != cand_suffix, then the two given strings must be cand_prefix and cand_suffix. \n\n            #         This is true because the prefix of length k is uniquely determined by the prefix of length k+1, and the suffix of length k is uniquely determined by the suffix of length k+1.\n\n            #         Therefore, we can do:\n\n            #           if cand_prefix == cand_suffix:\n            #               # Then we have two identical strings, so we can assign the first occurrence to 'P' and the second to 'S'\n            #               # But the group L might have the two strings in any order.\n            #               # We need to assign one 'P' and one 'S'. We can do:\n            #               #   Look at the first string in L and assign it 'P', the second 'S'. \n            #               #   But then, if the full string `s` is to be consistent, it doesn't matter which one is which.\n            #               #   However, the candidate is the same string, so both are the prefix and the suffix? But no, the prefix and suffix are the same string, but they are different positions in the full string.\n            #               #   Example: n=3, k=1, cand_prefix = 'a', cand_suffix = 'a'. The full string has two 'a's: one at the beginning and one at the end.\n            #               #   The two given 'a's are the same, but they appear in different positions in the input.\n            #               #   We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n            #               #   Since the problem allows any valid answer, we can assign the first occurrence in the input (lowest index) to 'P' and the second to 'S'.\n            #               result_chars[L[0][1]] = 'P'\n            #               result_chars[L[1][1]] = 'S'\n            #           else:\n            #               # Find the index of cand_prefix and cand_suffix in L.\n            #               for (s_val, idx_val) in L:\n            #                   if s_val == cand_prefix:\n            #                       result_chars[idx_val] = 'P'\n            #                   if s_val == cand_suffix:\n            #                       result_chars[idx_val] = 'S'\n\n            #         But note: cand_prefix and cand_suffix might be the same string, then the above else part won't work because we would set both to 'P' and 'S' for the same string. \n\n            #         Therefore, we must separate the two cases.\n\n            #         Let's refactor:\n\n            #           if cand_prefix == cand_suffix:\n            #               # Then there are two identical strings in the group.\n            #               # We can assign the first occurrence to 'P' and the second to 'S'.\n            #               if L[0][0] == cand_prefix:  # both are the same\n            #                   result_chars[L[0][1]] = 'P'\n            #                   result_chars[L[1][1]] = 'S'\n            #               else:\n            #                   # This should not happen because cand_prefix is the same as cand_suffix and the group contains two identical strings.\n            #                   result_chars[L[0][1]] = 'S'\n            #                   result_chars[L[1][1]] = 'P'\n            #           else:\n            #               # Two different candidate strings.\n            #               # There should be two strings in L: cand_prefix and cand_suffix.\n            #               # But what if one of them is not in L?

But the suffix of length k should be the last k characters of the suffix of length k+1, which is suffix_dict[k+1][1:] if we consider that the suffix of length k+1 is the last k+1 characters. \n\nActually, the suffix of length k+1 is the last k+1 characters. The suffix of length k is the last k characters, which is indeed the last k characters of the suffix of length k+1. \n\nBut in our code, we did: \n   cand_suffix = suffix_dict[k+1][-k:]\n\nThis is equivalent to taking the substring from len(suffix_dict[k+1]) - k to the end. \n\nFor example, if suffix_dict[k+1] is \"abc\" (length4), then k=2, cand_suffix = \"bc\". \n\nBut the last k characters of \"abc\" is indeed \"bc\". \n\nHowever, the suffix of length k+1 is the last k+1 characters, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters, which is the same as the last k characters of the suffix of length k+1.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nLet's hope it passes all tests.\n\nNote: The problem says the input strings are given in arbitrary order, and we are grouping by length. The candidate computation relies on the previously determined prefix and suffix for length k+1. We are processing from high to low, so k+1 is always processed before k.\n\nWe'll submit the code.\n",

Not exactly).\n            #         2. Actually, consider the prefix of length k: it must start with the prefix of length k-1. So the prefix of length k must begin with the string chosen as the prefix of length k-1.\n            #         3. Similarly, the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       Therefore, for a given k (>=2 and <= n-1), the two candidates for the prefix of length k must be:\n            #           candidate1 = prefix_{k-1} + char1\n            #           candidate2 = prefix_{k-1} + char2\n            #       But wait, we don't know the next character. Alternatively, we can look at the suffix of length k-1: the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       However, note: the full string `s` is fixed. The prefix of length k is the first k characters, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters. The prefix of length k-1 is the first k-1 characters, and the suffix of length k-1 is the last k-1 characters.\n            #       Therefore, the prefix of length k must be the prefix of length k-1 plus the next character (which is the k-th character). Similarly, the suffix of length k must be the (n-k)-th character (from the beginning) followed by the suffix of length k-1? Not exactly: the suffix of length k is the substring from index n-k to the end, which must end with the suffix of length k-1. That means the first character of the suffix of length k (at position n-k) must be the same as the first character of the suffix of length k-1 (which is the last character of the full string minus (k-1) characters)? Not necessarily the same as the first character of the suffix of length k-1, but the entire suffix of length k-1 must appear at the end of the suffix of length k.\n            #\n            #       Actually, the suffix of length k is the last k characters. The suffix of length k-1 is the last k-1 characters. Therefore, the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1. So the last k-1 characters of the suffix of length k must be the suffix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       Similarly, the prefix of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       Therefore, for each k (from 2 to n-1):\n            #           - One of the two strings of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1 (which we already determined).\n            #           - The other must end with the suffix of length k-1 (which we already determined).\n            #\n            #       But wait, what if both conditions are satisfied by one string? Or neither? The problem guarantees that there is at least one string consistent, so we can use this to determine the labels.\n            #\n            #       Algorithm for k from 2 to n-1:\n            #           Let A and B be the two strings of length k.\n            #           Let P_prev be the prefix of length k-1 (already determined) and S_prev be the suffix of length k-1 (already determined).\n            #           Check if A starts with P_prev and B ends with S_prev. Then, if one of them satisfies one condition, we can assign the other one to the opposite.\n            #           However, note: the prefix of length k must be the one that starts with P_prev, and the suffix must be the one that ends with S_prev. But these could be the same string? Only if the string of length k is both a continuation of the prefix and ends with the suffix. But in general, they are distinct.\n            #\n            #       Example for n=3, k=2:\n            #           Strings of length2: ['aa', 'aa'] (in the corrected example).\n            #           Prefix of length1: say we have two strings of length1: ['a','a']. We need to assign one as prefix and one as suffix. But which one?\n            #           For length1, we don't have constraints from previous lengths (since k-1=0 doesn't exist). So we can assign arbitrarily, but we must ensure the entire assignment is consistent.\n            #           However, note: the full string must be \"aaa\". Therefore, the prefix of length1 must be 'a' and the suffix of length1 must be 'a'. Then for length2, both strings are 'aa'. Now, the prefix of length2 must start with the prefix of length1 ('a'), which both do. Similarly, the suffix of length2 must end with the suffix of length1 ('a'), which both do. So both strings of length2 satisfy both conditions. Then how to assign?\n            #\n            #       In this case, we can assign one as prefix and one as suffix arbitrarily, but we must maintain the balance of counts (n-1 of each). Since we have two strings of length2, we assign one as 'P' and one as 'S'.\n            #\n            #       Therefore, the plan is:\n            #         - For lengths from 1 to n-1, we will assign one string as prefix and one as suffix.\n            #         - For each length k (starting from 1), we can use the constraints from the previous length (if k > 1) to determine the labels. If k==1, we can assign arbitrarily.\n            #         - For k>=2, we use the fact that the prefix of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1, and the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n            #         - If a string of length k starts with the prefix of length k-1, then it must be the prefix (unless there's a conflict). Similarly, if it ends with the suffix of length k-1, then it must be the suffix.\n            #         - But note: a string might satisfy both conditions. In that case, we can assign it as either, but then we must assign the other string as the remaining label.\n            #         - However, the problem allows any valid answer. So we can assign the string that satisfies the prefix condition as prefix, and the other as suffix, unless the other string also satisfies the suffix condition. In that case, we can assign arbitrarily, but we must ensure that the total counts are correct.\n            #\n            #       Implementation:\n            #         Step 1: Read n and the strings.\n            #         Step 2: Group strings by length.\n            #         Step 3: Initialize an empty list for results.\n            #         Step 4: For k from 1 to n-1:\n            #             - If k==1, then we have two strings. We can assign one arbitrarily as 'P' and the other as 'S'. But note: we need to remember which one is the prefix and which is the suffix for the next lengths.\n            #             - However, we must also consider that the assignment for k=1 might affect the assignment for k=2. Therefore, we cannot assign arbitrarily without considering future constraints.\n            #\n            #       This becomes complex. Let's try a different approach:\n            #         We know that the full string `s` of length n must have:\n            #           s[0:n-1] = prefix_{n-1}\n            #           s[1:n] = suffix_{n-1}\n            #         Also, for each length k, the prefix of length k is s[0:k] and the suffix of length k is s[n-k:n].\n            #         Moreover, the prefix of length k must be the prefix of length k-1 plus the next character, and the suffix of length k must be the previous character plus the suffix of length k-1.\n            #\n            #       Another idea: \n            #         The full string `s` can be constructed by aligning the given prefixes and suffixes. But note, we don't know which is which.\n            #         However, the problem does not require constructing `s`, only labeling the given strings.\n            #\n            #       Insight:\n            #         Consider the shortest strings first. For length 1, there are two strings. One must be the prefix and one the suffix. But the full string `s` must start and end with these characters. \n            #         For length 2, the prefix must start with the length1 prefix, and the suffix must end with the length1 suffix.\n            #         Therefore, for length 2, the two strings are candidates: one must start with the length1 prefix, and the other must end with the length1 suffix.\n            #         But what if the two strings of length2 are the same? Then we need to assign one as prefix and one as suffix arbitrarily, but then we must ensure that the prefix condition (starts with length1 prefix) and suffix condition (ends with length1 suffix) hold for the appropriate one.\n            #\n            #       Given the complexity, let's break down the solution into steps:\n\n            #       Step 1: Group the strings by length.\n            #       Step 2: For each length k from 1 to n-1, we have two strings.\n            #       Step 3: We will determine the labels for the strings of length k based on the labels of length k-1 (if k>1). For k==1, we can assign arbitrarily, but we must keep track of which string is the prefix and which is the suffix for the next lengths.\n            #       Step 4: However, we don't know the actual string `s`, so we need to ensure that the assignment is consistent with the existence of `s`.\n\n            #       Alternative simpler approach (since n<=100 and the strings are short):\n            #         Since the total number of strings is small (at most 198 for n=100), we can try to find a consistent assignment by checking all possibilities? But 2^(2n-2) is too many.\n\n            #       Another idea: \n            #         Let's assume we can determine the full string `s` by combining the given prefixes and suffixes. But we don't know which is which.\n\n            #       Observation:\n            #         The full string `s` must be such that its prefix of length k is one of the given strings of length k, and its suffix of length k is the other given string of length k.\n            #         Moreover, the prefix of length k must be the first k characters of `s`, and the suffix of length k must be the last k characters.\n\n            #       We can try to build `s` by assuming one of the strings of length n-1 is the prefix and the other is the suffix, then check if the built string matches the given prefixes and suffixes for all lengths.\n\n            #       However, the problem says there might be multiple valid answers, and we only need to output one.\n\n            #       Steps for building `s`:\n            #         - Let `s` be unknown.\n            #         - The prefix of length n-1 is one of the two strings of length n-1, and the suffix of length n-1 is the other.\n            #         - Then, the full string `s` must be: prefix_{n-1} + (last character of suffix_{n-1})? No, because the prefix_{n-1} is the first n-1 characters, and the suffix_{n-1} is the last n-1 characters. They overlap in the middle n-2 characters.\n            #         - Actually, s = prefix_{n-1} + c, where c is the last character of the suffix_{n-1}? But then the last n-1 characters would be the last n-1 characters of prefix_{n-1} concatenated with c, but that is not necessarily the suffix_{n-1}.\n            #\n            #       Let me denote:\n            #         Let P = prefix_{n-1} = s[0:n-1]\n            #         Let S = suffix_{n-1} = s[1:n]\n            #         Then, s = P + (S[-1])? But then S should be s[1:n] = P[1:] + S[-1]. \n            #         But note: s[0:n-1] = P, and s[1:n] = S. Then, the character at position 0 is P[0], and the character at position n-1 is S[-1]. The character at position n-1 must also be the last character of P, i.e., P[-1] = S[-1]? Not necessarily.\n            #\n            #       Example: n=3, P=\"ab\", S=\"bc\". Then s must be \"abc\". Indeed, P=\"ab\", S=\"bc\", and the last character of P is 'b' which is the first character of S.\n            #\n            #       In general, for a string `s` of length n, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1] and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n]. Therefore, the last character of the prefix (n-1) is s[n-2], and the first character of the suffix (n-1) is s[1]. These are not necessarily the same.\n            #\n            #       Actually, the relationship is:\n            #         s[0] = P[0]\n            #         s[1] = P[1] = S[0]\n            #         s[2] = P[2] (if n-1>=3) and also S[1]\n            #         ...\n            #         s[n-2] = P[n-2] = S[n-3]\n            #         s[n-1] = S[n-2]\n            #\n            #       This implies that for all i from 0 to n-2, s[i] = P[i] and s[i] = S[i] for i from 1 to n-2. Therefore, the characters from index 1 to n-2 must match between the prefix and suffix of length n-1.\n            #\n            #       So the two strings of length n-1 must agree on the overlapping part (i.e., the first n-2 characters of the suffix must equal the last n-2 characters of the prefix). \n            #\n            #       Therefore, to determine the two strings of length n-1, we can check which pair (A, B) of the two given strings of length n-1 satisfies A[i] == B[i] for i from 1 to n-2 (if we consider A as the prefix and B as the suffix, then the overlapping part is A[1:] and B[:-1]).\n            #\n            #       Similarly, for the other lengths, we can use the fact that the prefix of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1 and the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n\n            #       Revised plan:\n            #         1. Group the strings by length.\n            #         2. For k from n-1 down to 1:\n            #             - For the current length k, we have two strings: X and Y.\n            #             - If k == n-1:\n            #                 - We need to choose one as the prefix and the other as the suffix.\n            #                 - The condition: the overlapping part (the first n-2 characters of the suffix must equal the last n-2 characters of the prefix) must hold.\n            #                 - Specifically, if we choose X as prefix and Y as suffix, then X[1:] must equal Y[:-1].\n            #                 - If that holds, then we assign X as 'P' and Y as 'S'. Otherwise, we assign Y as 'P' and X as 'S'.\n            #             - If k < n-1:\n            #                 - We have two strings: A and B.\n            #                 - We already know the prefix and suffix of length k+1.\n            #                 - The prefix of length k must be the prefix of length k+1[0:k].\n            #                 - Similarly, the suffix of length k must be the suffix of length k+1[1:].\n            #                 - But note: the given strings of length k might not be the exact prefixes/suffixes of the full string. However, the problem guarantees that there exists a string `s` of length n that is consistent.\n            #                 - Actually, we can derive the prefix of length k from the known prefix of length k+1: it must be the first k characters of the prefix of length k+1.\n            #                 - Similarly, the suffix of length k must be the last k characters of the suffix of length k+1.\n            #                 - But wait, the suffix of length k+1 is the last k+1 characters. The suffix of length k is the last k characters, which is indeed the last k characters of the suffix of length k+1.\n            #\n            #       However, note: the given strings of length k are not necessarily the prefixes/suffixes of the full string `s` in the order of increasing length. But we are allowed to assign arbitrarily.\n\n            #       But let's reframe: \n            #         We are given two strings for each length. We need to assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n            #         The catch: the assignment must be such that the entire string `s` exists.\n\n            #       Given the time, I propose the following greedy method:\n\n            #         Step 1: Start with length = n-1. There are two strings. Check if one of them is the prefix and the other is the suffix by verifying the overlapping condition (X[1:] == Y[:-1] for X as prefix and Y as suffix). If yes, assign X as 'P' and Y as 'S'. Otherwise, assign Y as 'P' and X as 'S'. (Note: there is always a solution due to the problem's guarantee.)\n            #         Step 2: Move to length = n-2. We now know the prefix and suffix of length n-1. The two strings of length n-2 must be:\n            #                 - The prefix of length n-2 must be the first n-2 characters of the prefix of length n-1.\n            #                 - The suffix of length n-2 must be the last n-2 characters of the suffix of length n-1.\n            #         Step 3: But wait, the given strings of length n-2 might not be exactly these. However, the problem guarantees that the given strings are indeed the prefixes and suffixes of some string `s` of length n.\n\n            #       But note: the prefixes and suffixes of `s` are defined uniquely for each length. So the prefix of length n-2 is the first n-2 characters of the prefix of length n-1, and the suffix of length n-2 is the last n-2 characters of the suffix of length n-1.\n\n            #       Therefore, for each length k (from n-1 down to 1), we can determine the correct string for the prefix and suffix by:\n            #         - For k = n-1: use the overlapping condition.\n            #         - For k < n-1: \n            #             prefix_k = prefix_{k+1}[0:k]   (if the prefix_{k+1} is already determined)\n            #             suffix_k = suffix_{k+1}[1:k+1]   (if the suffix_{k+1} is already determined)\n\n            #       However, we are given two strings for length k. One of them must be the prefix_k and the other must be the suffix_k.\n\n            #       But wait, the given strings might not include the exact substrings? \n\n            #       Let's test with n=3, k=1 (after having determined the strings for length2):\n            #         Suppose we have determined:\n            #           prefix_{2} = \"aa\", suffix_{2} = \"aa\"\n            #         Then, the full string `s` is \"aaa\".\n            #         The prefix of length1 should be \"a\", and the suffix of length1 should be \"a\".\n            #         But the given strings for length1 are two \"a\"s. So we can assign one as 'P' and one as 'S'.\n\n            #       So the algorithm for k from n-1 down to 1 is:\n\n            #         Let's create two dictionaries: \n            #           prefix_dict: mapping length -> the string chosen as prefix\n            #           suffix_dict: mapping length -> the string chosen as suffix\n\n            #         Steps:\n            #           For k from n-1 down to 1:\n            #             if k == n-1:\n            #                 Let A, B = the two strings of length k.\n            #                 If A[1:] == B[:-1]:\n            #                     prefix_dict[k] = A\n            #                     suffix_dict[k] = B\n            #                 else if B[1:] == A[:-1]:\n            #                     prefix_dict[k] = B\n            #                     suffix_dict[k] = A\n            #                 else:\n            #                     # According to the problem guarantee, this should not happen.\n            #                     # But to be safe, we can try to assign arbitrarily and hope for the best.\n            #                     prefix_dict[k] = A\n            #                     suffix_dict[k] = B\n            #             else:\n            #                 # k < n-1\n            #                 # The prefix of length k must be the first k characters of the prefix of length k+1.\n            #                 # The suffix of length k must be the last k characters of the suffix of length k+1.\n            #                 candidate_prefix = prefix_dict[k+1][:k]\n            #                 candidate_suffix = suffix_dict[k+1][1:1+k]\n            #                 # Now, the two given strings for length k are C and D.\n            #                 if candidate_prefix in (C, D):\n            #                     prefix_dict[k] = candidate_prefix\n            #                     if candidate_prefix == C:\n            #                         suffix_dict[k] = D\n            #                     else:\n            #                         suffix_dict[k] = C\n            #                 else:\n            #                     # This means the candidate_prefix is not among the given strings? \n            #                     # But the problem guarantees the strings are from the prefixes and suffixes.\n            #                     # So this should not happen.\n            #                     # Instead, the given strings might be the suffix and prefix in reverse order? \n            #                     # Actually, the given strings for length k are two strings.

But the given strings for length k might not include these candidates? \n\n            #       Let's test with n=4, k=2:\n            #         Full string `s` = \"abcd\"\n            #         Then, the prefix of length3 is \"abc\", and the suffix of length3 is \"bcd\".\n            #         The prefix of length2 should be \"ab\", which is the first 2 characters of \"abc\".\n            #         The suffix of length2 should be \"cd\", which is the last 2 characters of \"bcd\".\n            #         But the given strings for length2 are \"ab\" and \"cd\". So it works.\n\n            #       But what if the full string is \"abac\" (n=4)? \n            #         prefix3 = \"aba\", suffix3 = \"bac\"\n            #         Then, prefix2 = \"ab\", which is the first 2 of \"aba\".\n            #         suffix2 = \"ac\", which is the last 2 of \"bac\" -> \"ac\" is indeed the last 2 of \"bac\".\n\n            #       So the method is sound.\n\n            #       Steps summary:\n\n            #         1. Group the strings by length.\n            #         2. Initialize two dictionaries: prefix_dict and suffix_dict.\n            #         3. Start from length = n-1 and go down to 1.\n            #         4. For each length k:\n            #             if k == n-1:\n            #                 Given two strings A and B.\n            #                 If A[1:] == B[:-1]: then A is prefix, B is suffix.\n            #                 Else if B[1:] == A[:-1]: then B is prefix, A is suffix.\n            #                 Else: assign arbitrarily (though the problem guarantee ensures one of the first two will hold).\n            #             else:\n            #                 candidate_prefix = prefix_dict[k+1][:k]\n            #                 candidate_suffix = suffix_dict[k+1][1:1+k]\n            #                 The two strings for length k are C and D.\n            #                 Then, assign candidate_prefix to be the prefix (if present) and candidate_suffix to be the suffix (if present). \n            #                 But note: the two given strings are exactly candidate_prefix and candidate_suffix? Not necessarily, but the problem guarantees that there is a string `s` of length n, so these candidates must be among the given strings.\n\n            #         5. Once we have determined the prefix and suffix for each length, we can output the result in the order of the input strings.\n\n            #       But wait, the input order is arbitrary. We need to output a string of 'P' and 'S' in the order of the input.\n\n            #       How to map back to the input order?\n\n            #         We can store the input strings along with their index.\n\n            #       Let's modify the grouping: instead of just storing the strings, store (string, original_index) and also record the length.\n\n            #       Steps:\n\n            #         1. Read n.\n            #         2. Read the next 2n-2 lines, keeping track of the original index (from 0 to 2n-3).\n            #         3. Group by length, but also store the index.\n            #         4. For each length from n-1 down to 1, determine the prefix and suffix.\n            #         5. Then, for each input string (by its original index), output 'P' if it was determined to be a prefix, 'S' if a suffix.\n\n            #       However, note: the problem does not specify the order of the input strings beyond the first integer. The output must be a string of length 2n-2 with the i-th character corresponding to the i-th input string.\n\n            #       Implementation:\n\n            #         Let's create an array `result_chars` of length (2n-2) initially filled with None.\n\n            #         We'll group the input strings by length, and for each length, we'll have a list of tuples (string, index).\n\n            #         Then, for k from n-1 down to 1:\n            #             Let L = groups[k]  (list of two tuples)\n            #             If k == n-1:\n            #                 (A, idx_A), (B, idx_B) = L\n            #                 if A[1:] == B[:-1]:\n            #                     prefix_dict[k] = A\n            #                     suffix_dict[k] = B\n            #                     result_chars[idx_A] = 'P'\n            #                     result_chars[idx_B] = 'S'\n            #                 elif B[1:] == A[:-1]:\n            #                     prefix_dict[k] = B\n            #                     suffix_dict[k] = A\n            #                     result_chars[idx_A] = 'S'\n            #                     result_chars[idx_B] = 'P'\n            #                 else:\n            #                     # Fallback: assign arbitrarily\n            #                     prefix_dict[k] = A\n            #                     suffix_dict[k] = B\n            #                     result_chars[idx_A] = 'P'\n            #                     result_chars[idx_B] = 'S'\n            #             else:\n            #                 # k < n-1\n            #                 # Get the candidate_prefix from prefix_dict[k+1] (which is a string)\n            #                 cand_prefix = prefix_dict[k+1][:k]\n            #                 cand_suffix = suffix_dict[k+1][1:1+k]\n            #                 # Now, the two strings for length k are cand_prefix and cand_suffix? \n            #                 # But the given strings might be in any order.\n            #                 # We need to find which string is cand_prefix and which is cand_suffix.\n            #                 found_prefix = None\n            #                 found_suffix = None\n            #                 for (str_val, idx_val) in L:\n            #                     if str_val == cand_prefix:\n            #                         found_prefix = (str_val, idx_val)\n            #                     if str_val == cand_suffix:\n            #                         found_suffix = (str_val, idx_val)\n            #                 if found_prefix and found_suffix:\n            #                     # But note: cand_prefix and cand_suffix should be distinct.\n            #                     if found_prefix[0] == cand_prefix and found_suffix[0] == cand_suffix:\n            #                         result_chars[found_prefix[1]] = 'P'\n            #                         result_chars[found_suffix[1]] = 'S'\n            #                     else:\n            #                         # This should not happen if the candidate computation is correct.\n            #                         # But if they are the same, then assign arbitrarily.\n            #                         result_chars[L[0][1]] = 'P'\n            #                         result_chars[L[1][1]] = 'S'\n            #                 else:\n            #                     # Fallback: assign arbitrarily\n            #                     result_chars[L[0][1]] = 'P'\n            #                     result_chars[L[1][1]] = 'S'\n\n            #         6.

In this labeling, the string 'a' appears twice: once as a prefix (at index3) and once as a suffix (at index0). But the problem does not require that each occurrence is labeled uniquely. It only requires that there exists a string `s` (which is \"aaa\") that has these as its prefixes and suffixes. \n            #           However, note: the input has two 'a's and two 'aa's. The problem does not distinguish between the two occurrences. \n            #           But the output must be in the order of the input. The first input string is 'a', and in the labeling \"SPSP\", the first string is labeled 'S'. This is valid because 'a' is a suffix of \"aaa\". Similarly, the fourth input string is 'a' and is labeled 'P', which is valid because 'a' is a prefix of \"aaa\".\n\n            #         Therefore, our method must allow assigning the same string (appearing twice) to different roles (prefix or suffix) if it is used in both capacities.\n\n            #         However, in our current algorithm, we are using the content of the string to determine the role. For the same string appearing twice, we are assigning arbitrarily based on the order in the group. But the group is built from the input order.\n\n            #         In the example n=3, the input order for length1 is ['a','a'] and for length2 is ['aa','aa']. Our algorithm processes length2 first, then length1. When processing length1, we have two 'a's. We assign the first 'a' (index0) to 'P' and the second 'a' (index3) to 'S'. \n\n            #         But the example input order is:\n            #           index0: 'a'\n            #           index1: 'aa'\n            #           index2: 'aa'\n            #           index3: 'a'\n            #         So the output is:\n            #           index0: 'P'\n            #           index1: 'P'\n            #           index2: 'S'\n            #           index3: 'S'\n            #         -> \"PPSS\"\n\n            #         To produce \"SPSP\", we would need to assign the first 'a' (index0) as 'S' and the fourth 'a' (index3) as 'P'. \n\n            #         How can we achieve that? \n\n            #         We cannot, because our algorithm assigns the prefix and suffix for length1 based on the candidates derived from length2. In this case, the candidate for prefix is 'a' and for suffix is 'a'. We then look at the two strings of length1 and assign one arbitrarily as 'P' and the other as 'S'. \n\n            #         But the problem allows any valid answer. We can change the assignment for length1 arbitrarily as long as one is 'P' and one is 'S'. \n\n            #         However, our algorithm currently uses the order in the group (which is the order of appearance in the input for that length). We can modify the algorithm to not favor the first occurrence.\n\n            #         In the fallback for length1 (or any length), when both candidates are the same string, we can choose either occurrence to be 'P' and the other 'S'. \n\n            #         We can do:\n\n            #           In the else branch for k<n-1, after computing cand_prefix and cand_suffix, if the group has two identical strings, then we can assign arbitrarily. But we must ensure that the counts are correct.\n\n            #         However, note: the problem does not require a specific assignment. Any assignment that results in n-1 'P's and n-1 'S's is acceptable.\n\n            #         Therefore, we can simply assign the two strings of length1 arbitrarily: one 'P' and one 'S', regardless of the candidate computation. But wait, the candidate computation is crucial for the higher lengths.\n\n            #         Actually, the candidates for lower lengths are derived from the higher lengths. Therefore, for k<n-1, we must assign the candidates correctly. Only for k=n-1 we have no higher length to base on.\n\n            #         So for k=n-1, we use the overlapping condition. For k<n-1, we use the candidates from k+1.\n\n            #         In the example n=3, the candidates for k=1 are 'a' and 'a'. These are the only two possibilities. We must assign one of the two 'a's to 'P' and the other to 'S'. \n\n            #         The choice we make affects the output order. \n\n            #         To produce different outputs, we can change the order in which we process the two strings in the group for length1.\n\n            #         But note: the group for length1 is built from the input order. We can sort the group by index to ensure consistent ordering.\n\n            #         Alternatively, we can note that the input order is fixed, and we are required to output the answer in the input order.\n\n            #         Therefore, we must assign the labels to the input strings in the order they appear.\n\n            #         Since the problem allows any valid answer, we can choose any assignment that is consistent. \n\n            #         But our current algorithm for k<n-1 is:\n\n            #           cand_prefix = ... \n            #           cand_suffix = ...\n            #           Then, we iterate over the list L (which is the group for length k) and look for cand_prefix and cand_suffix.\n\n            #         The list L is built in the order of appearance in the input. \n\n            #         In the example n=3, the input order for length1 is ['a','a'] (first occurrence and fourth occurrence). \n\n            #         We can change the algorithm to not rely on the order in the group for k<n-1. Instead, we can determine the candidate strings from the higher length and then assign the labels to the input strings by matching the candidate strings.\n\n            #         But note: the candidate strings must be among the given strings. \n\n            #         In the example, cand_prefix and cand_suffix are both 'a'. The group for length1 has two 'a's. We can assign the first occurrence of 'a' (which is the first string in the input) to 'P' and the second occurrence (the fourth string) to 'S', or vice versa.\n\n            #         To allow flexibility, we can do:\n\n            #           For k from n-1 down to 1:\n            #             if k == n-1: use the overlapping condition.\n            #             else:\n            #                 cand_prefix = ... \n            #                 cand_suffix = ...\n            #                 # Now, the two given strings for length k are cand_prefix and cand_suffix (possibly in any order).\n            #                 # We need to assign the label 'P' to the string that is cand_prefix and 'S' to the string that is cand_suffix.\n            #                 # But if cand_prefix == cand_suffix, then we have two identical strings, and we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n            #         However, the problem guarantee ensures that there is a string `s` of length n, so the candidates must be among the given strings.

Since they are the same, we can assign arbitrarily.\n            #                 However, we must ensure that the total number of 'P' and 'S' is n-1 each.\n            #             Else:\n            #                 Assign the string that equals cand_prefix to 'P', and the other to 'S'.\n\n            #         But wait, if cand_prefix != cand_suffix, then the two given strings must be cand_prefix and cand_suffix. \n\n            #         This is true because the prefix of length k is uniquely determined by the prefix of length k+1, and the suffix of length k is uniquely determined by the suffix of length k+1.\n\n            #         Therefore, we can do:\n\n            #           if cand_prefix == cand_suffix:\n            #               # Then we have two identical strings, so we can assign the first occurrence to 'P' and the second to 'S'\n            #               # But the group L might have the two strings in any order.\n            #               # We need to assign one 'P' and one 'S'.
