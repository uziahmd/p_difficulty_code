There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) from 2 to 10^18.\n\n The tournament is knockout. The winner must win all his/her games. We want the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, the total number of games is n-1. However, the structure is constrained by the rule: \n \"two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one\"\n\n We are to maximize the number of games for the winner.\n\n Let's denote by f(n) the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n How can we think about it?\n\n Consider that the entire tournament is a binary tree (each match produces one loser and one winner). The winner must win k matches, so we need at least 2^k leaves (players) in the subtree of the winner? But note: the rule allows for a non-binary tree? Actually, the rule is about the number of games played by each player.\n\n Let g(x) be the number of games a player has played when they meet the winner at the x-th game (so the winner has played x games, and the opponent has played either x-1 or x).\n\n We can model the tournament as having two parts:\n\n Option 1: The winner plays in rounds where the number of players doubles until the last round.\n\n However, note the example: \n   n=2 -> 1 game.\n   n=3 -> 2 games.\n   n=4 -> 2 games.\n\n Why for n=3: \n   We have 3 players. The winner must play two games: first beat one, then beat the remaining one. But wait, after the first game, the winner has 1 game, and the next opponent (the one who hasn't played) has 0. Is that allowed? The rule says: the difference must be at most one. So 1 and 0 -> difference 1 is allowed.\n\n For n=4:\n   If we arrange as (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4), then the winner of the first round (say player 1) will have 1 game, and then he plays the winner of the second (player 3 or 4) who also has 1 game. Then the winner (player 1) would have 2 games. But if we try to have three rounds? That would require 4 players to be arranged in a linear fashion? Actually, the tournament must be arranged so that the winner plays the minimum number of games? But we want to maximize.\n\n However, the problem says: \"assuming the rule above is used\", meaning we can arrange the grid arbitrarily as long as the condition holds. We want the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n Alternate approach: Let the winner play k games. Then the winner must have beaten k opponents. Each of these opponents must have won some matches (if they played any) but lost their last match (to the winner). \n\n Moreover, the rule requires that when the winner is playing his k-th match, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k games? Actually, let me break down:\n\n - Before the first match: both players (the winner and the opponent) have 0 games. Then the winner wins, so now the winner has 1 game, the opponent is out.\n\n - Then the winner must face another opponent. This opponent must have played either 0 or 1 game. But wait, the tournament is set up so that only the winners of their respective subtrees are available. However, the rule doesn't specify that the opponent must come from a particular part of the bracket, but rather the entire tournament is arranged arbitrarily (as long as the condition holds).\n\n We can think of building the tournament as follows:\n\n We need to form a bracket such that the winner (player 1) faces k opponents, and the entire tournament has exactly n players.\n\n Each time the winner plays, the opponent must have a certain number of games. And the entire structure must use up all n players.\n\n But note: the total number of players is fixed. The winner must defeat k opponents. Each of these opponents might have defeated some other players. How many players are there?\n\n The winner defeats k direct opponents. Each of those opponents might have defeated some players. Specifically, the opponent that the winner meets in the i-th match must have played i-1 matches (because when the winner is at the i-th match, the opponent should have played either i-1 or i). However, to maximize the total number of games the winner plays, we want to use as many players as possible without violating the condition.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider building the tournament in rounds and see the maximum k such that the total number of players is at least the minimal number required for the winner to have k games.\n\n Let F(k) be the minimal number of players needed so that",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows specific rules. The key constraint is that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their previous game counts is at most one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that each match eliminates one player until only the winner remains. The challenge is to maximize the number of matches the winner plays by strategically arranging the matches according to the given rule.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the total number of players \\( n \\) is at least the sum of \\( 2^{i-1} \\) for \\( i \\) from 1 to \\( k \\). This is derived from considering that each match the winner participates in requires a certain number of players in the subsequent rounds.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The approach involves iteratively checking for the maximum \\( k \\) where the sum of \\( 2^{i-1} \\) from \\( i = 1 \\) to \\( k \\) does not exceed \\( n \\). This sum represents the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play \\( k \\) matches under the given constraints.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks possible values of \\( k \\) by leveraging mathematical properties, ensuring it handles very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)) without performance issues.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    total_games = 0\n    k = 0\n    while True:\n        k += 1\n        total_games = (1 << (k - 1)) + total_games\n        if total_games >= n:\n            break\n            \n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If there are only 2 players, the winner must play exactly 1 match, so the answer is immediately known.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: For larger \\( n \\), the algorithm calculates the minimal number of players required for the winner to play \\( k \\) matches. This is done by summing \\( 2^{i-1} \\) for each match \\( i \\) from 1 to \\( k \\).\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the cumulative sum of players meets or exceeds \\( n \\), at which point \\( k \\) is the maximum number of matches the winner can play.\n4. **Output**: The value of \\( k \\) is printed, representing the maximum number of games the tournament winner can participate in under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging binary exponentiation and summation, ensuring optimal performance even for very large input sizes.",
