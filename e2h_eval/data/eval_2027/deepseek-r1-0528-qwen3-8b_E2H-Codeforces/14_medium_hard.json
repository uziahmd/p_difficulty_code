    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n        f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n But note: We are given m (the exact number of trailing zeros) and we want to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the n that have at least m zeros, but exactly m zeros.\n\n Observation:\n   The function f(n) is non-decreasing. Moreover, it increases only at multiples of 5. \n   For example, \n        f(4) = 0, f(5) = 1, f(9) = 1, f(10)=2, etc.\n\n   Therefore, if we consider consecutive n, the value of f(n) remains constant for a while and then jumps.\n\n   Specifically, for a given m, we are looking for all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   However, note that the same m might appear for a contiguous range of n? Actually, no: the function f(n) is constant on intervals between the numbers where the factor of 5 changes.\n\n   Example: \n        m=1: n from 5 to 9 -> because 5! to 9! have 1 trailing zero.\n\n   So the set of n with f(n)=m is an interval [L, R] (if it exists) or empty.\n\n   How to find L and R?\n        We can use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, and the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the numbers n with f(n)=m are from the smallest n0 such that f(n0)=m to the largest n1 such that f(n1)=m.\n\n   Actually, let:\n        Let L = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then we know that f(L) >= m, but we need to check if f(L) is exactly m? Not necessarily, because the function jumps.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define:\n        Let low = the smallest n such that f(n) == m. But wait, the function is non-decreasing and stepwise. Actually, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Then, check the value at that n. But note: if we get a jump over m, then there might be no n with f(n)=m.\n\n        Actually, we can define two boundaries:\n            Lower bound: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then, we must check if f(lower_bound) == m. But note that the function may jump from below m to above m.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let L = minimal n such that f(n) >= m.\n        Let R = minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Then, the numbers n with f(n)=m are the integers in the interval [L, R-1].\n\n        But note: if m is too large such that there's no n with f(n)=m, then L might be defined and then the interval would be empty? Actually, we should check the existence.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        We can write a helper function to compute f(n):\n\n            def trailing_zeros(n):\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n                return count\n\n        Then, we want to find:\n            left_bound = smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n            right_bound = smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then, the numbers n with trailing_zeros(n)==m are the integers from left_bound to right_bound-1, provided that trailing_zeros(left_bound) == m.\n\n        However, note: it is possible that the minimal n with f(n)>=m gives exactly m? Actually, the minimal n for which f(n)>=m might give exactly m, or if not, then there is no solution?\n\n        Actually, the function f(n) is non-decreasing and integer-valued. Therefore, the set {n: f(n)=m} is either empty or an interval [L, R-1] where:\n            L = min {n: f(n) >= m}\n            R = min {n: f(n) >= m+1}\n\n        And then we must check: if f(L) != m, then there is no n with f(n)=m. But wait, because the function is non-decreasing and integer, the minimal n for which f(n)>=m must have f(n)=m or more. However, if f(L) > m, then there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Use binary search to find the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m. Call this L.\n            Step 2: Check if trailing_zeros(L) == m. If not, then there is no n with f(n)=m. Then output 0.\n\n            Step 3: Similarly, find the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1. Call this R.\n\n            Then, the numbers are from L to R-1, inclusive.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"positive integers n\", so we must consider n>=1.\n\n        Example: m=1\n            trailing_zeros(0) is 0, but n starts at 1.\n\n            Let's compute for m=1:\n\n            Find L: smallest n with trailing_zeros(n) >= 1.\n                n=5: trailing_zeros(5)=1 -> so L=5.\n            Now, trailing_zeros(5)==1 -> so we proceed.\n\n            Then, find R: smallest n with trailing_zeros(n) >= 2.\n                n=10: trailing_zeros(10)= floor(10/5)+floor(10/25)=2+0=2 -> so R=10.\n\n            Then, the numbers are from 5 to 9, i.e., 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n            Output: first print the count (which is 5), then the numbers.\n\n        Example: m=5\n            Input: 5\n\n            We need to find L: smallest n with trailing_zeros(n)>=5.\n                n=20: trailing_zeros(20)= floor(20/5)+floor(20/25)=4+0=4 -> not enough.\n                n=21: 4\n                n=22: 4\n                n=23: 4\n                n=24: 4\n                n=25: floor(25/5)+floor(25/25)=5+1=6 -> so L=25.\n\n            Now, check: trailing_zeros(25)=6, which is not equal to 5 -> so there is no n with exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\n            Then output: 0\n\n        But wait: actually, the factorial of 20 has 4 zeros, then 21,22,23,24 also have 4, and 25 has 6. There is no n with 5 zeros.\n\n        Therefore, we must output 0.\n\n        However, note: what if m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We'll write a function trailing_zeros(n) as described.\n\n            Then, we need to find L and R by binary search.\n\n            The domain of n: since m can be up to 100000, we need to set an upper bound.\n\n            How high can n be? \n                We know that trailing_zeros(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... < n/4 (geometric series). \n                So n must be at least around 4*m. But sometimes we need to go higher because of the gaps.\n\n            We can set an upper bound for n: \n                Let n_max = 5 * m * 5  (or something like that) but we can use the fact that trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n            Alternatively, we can set:\n\n                low = 0, high = 5 * m * 5   (but note: sometimes m=100000, then 5*m*5 = 2500000, which is acceptable for binary search? We are doing two binary searches, each about 25 steps, so that's okay.)\n\n            However, sometimes we might need to go higher for m=0? But m>=1.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Step 1: Read m.\n\n                Step 2: Define a function trailing_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n                Step 3: Define a function to find the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= X.\n\n                Step 4: For X = m, find L. Then for X = m+1, find R.\n\n                Step 5: Check if trailing_zeros(L) == m. If not, then there is no n with f(n)=m, so output 0.\n\n                Step 6: Otherwise, the numbers are from L to R-1. Then, output the count (R-L) and then the list of numbers from L to R-1.\n\n            However, note: the problem says to output the numbers in increasing order. The numbers are consecutive, so we can output them as a space separated list.\n\n            But wait: what if the range is very large? For example, m=100000, then the range could be very big (thousands or millions of numbers). We cannot output a list of 1 million numbers in a single line (it might exceed memory or be too slow to print).\n\n            According to the problem statement: First print k (the count) and then the k integers.\n\n            But if k is large, we cannot output all the numbers one by one? However, the problem constraints say m up to 100000. \n\n            How many n are there for a given m?\n\n            Actually, the function f(n) increases by 1 at multiples of 5, but sometimes more (like at 25, it increases by 2). The maximum gap between two consecutive m values is 4 (because the next multiple of 5 might not be until 5 steps, but the zeros increase by at most 1 per 5 numbers? Actually, no: the zeros increase by the number of factors of 5 in the number being added. But the minimal n for which f(n)=m is when we just passed a multiple of 5, and then we have 4 numbers (the next 4) until the next multiple of 5.\n\n            Actually, the length of the interval for a given m is at most 5. Why? Because the function f(n) is constant between multiples of 5. But wait, no: consider m=5: we saw that there was no n with 5 zeros. But for m=6, we have n=25,26,27,28,29,30. Then at 30, we add one more zero (because 30 has one factor of 5, so trailing_zeros(30)=6+1=7). So the interval for m=6 is from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers.\n\n            Actually, the length of the interval is the gap until the next multiple of 5 that adds an extra zero? \n\n            In general, the zeros increase by the multiplicity of 5 in the number. But note: the zeros are computed by summing the powers. The function f(n) is constant for n from 5^k to 5^(k+1)-1? Not exactly, but the value of f(n) changes only at multiples of 5.\n\n            However, the key point is: the set of n for which f(n)=m is contiguous and the length is at most 5? Actually, no. Consider:\n\n                n=24: trailing_zeros(24)=4\n                n=25: trailing_zeros(25)=6\n\n            Then there is no n with 5. But for m=4, the set is from 20 to 24, which is 5 numbers.\n\n            Actually, the length of the interval for a given m is the distance from the last time the zeros increased (which was at a multiple of 5) until the next time (which is the next multiple of 5). But the zeros increase by more than 1 at some points.\n\n            However, regardless of the jump, the set of n for which f(n)=m is contiguous and the length is at most 5? Actually, no: consider m=12.\n\n            Let me compute:\n\n                trailing_zeros(45) = floor(45/5)+floor(45/25)+floor(45/125)=9+1+0=10\n                trailing_zeros(50) = floor(50/5)+floor(50/25)+floor(50/125)=10+2+0=12\n                trailing_zeros(55) = floor(55/5)+floor(55/25)+floor(55/125)=11+2+0=13\n\n            Then, what about n=46,47,...,49? \n                trailing_zeros(46)= same as 45? Actually, yes, because 46,47,48,49 don't contribute any new factor of 5. So trailing_zeros(46)=10, same as 45.\n\n            Then, the set for m=10 is from 40 to 44? Actually, let me compute:\n\n                trailing_zeros(40)= floor(40/5)+floor(40/25)=8+1=9 -> so 40:9, 41:9, 42:9, 43:9, 44:9, 45:10.\n\n            Then, the set for m=9 is from 40 to 44? Actually, no: \n                trailing_zeros(35)= floor(35/5)+floor(35/25)=7+1=8\n                trailing_zeros(40)=9 -> so the set for m=9 is from 40 to 44.\n\n            Then, the set for m=10 is from 45 to 49.\n\n            Then, the set for m=11: none, because trailing_zeros(50)=12.\n\n            Then, the set for m=12: from 50 to 54.\n\n            So the length of the interval is always 5? \n\n            Actually, the zeros only change at multiples of 5. Between two consecutive multiples of 5, the function is constant. Therefore, the set of n for a fixed m is either empty or an interval of consecutive integers of length 5 (if the zeros increased by 1 at the beginning of the interval) or less? \n\n            Wait, the zeros increase by the number of factors of 5 in the number. For example, 25 has two factors of 5, so when n goes from 24 to 25, the zeros increase by 2. Therefore, the set for m=4 (which is the zeros from 20 to 24) is 5 numbers, and then at 25 we jump to 6. There is no m=5.\n\n            Similarly, 125 has three factors of 5, so when n goes from 124 to 125, the zeros increase by 3. Therefore, we skip m=13 and m=14 and m=15? Actually, let's compute:\n\n                trailing_zeros(120) = floor(120/5)+floor(120/25)+floor(120/125)=24+4+0=28\n                trailing_zeros(121)=28, 122=28, 123=28, 124=28\n                trailing_zeros(125)= floor(125/5)+floor(125/25)+floor(125/125)=25+5+1=31\n\n            So the zeros jump from 28 to 31, skipping 29 and 30.\n\n            Therefore, the set for m=29 and m=30 is empty.\n\n            So the length of the interval is not fixed. However, the set of n for a given m is contiguous and the length is the same as the gap between two consecutive jumps in the zeros function? Actually, the zeros function increases by the number of factors of 5 in the number at the jump. Therefore, the set of n for a given m is:\n\n                If we let A = the minimal n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m, then the set is [A, B-1] where B is the minimal n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n            But note: the jump at a multiple of 5 might be more than 1. So the set for m might be empty (if the zeros jump over m) or have a length that is the gap until the next jump (which is 5 in the case of a jump of 1, but if the jump is more, then the set for m is still contiguous and the next jump is at a later multiple of 5).\n\n            However, the set is contiguous because the zeros only change at multiples of 5, so between two multiples of 5 the zeros remain constant.\n\n            Therefore, the set of n for which trailing_zeros(n)=m is contiguous and the length is the distance from the current multiple of 5 (at which the zeros were last updated) until the next multiple of 5 (which will update the zeros again). But note: the zeros update at every multiple of 5, but the amount of update depends on the factors.\n\n            But the algorithm we have (using two binary searches) is valid.\n\n            However, the problem: m can be up to 100000, and we are going to output the entire list if the set is non-empty. The set might be large? Actually, the set is contiguous and the length is the same as the gap between two consecutive multiples of 5? \n\n            Actually, the set for a given m is contiguous and the length is the same as the gap from the start of the interval (which is the last multiple of 5 that caused the zeros to become at least m) until the next multiple of 5 (which causes the zeros to become at least m+1). But wait, the zeros are constant for 5 consecutive numbers (unless there's a multiple of 25 or higher in the middle, but note: the next multiple of 5 is 5 steps away). \n\n            Actually, the zeros function is constant for n from k*5 to (k+1)*5 - 1, unless there is a multiple of 25, 125, etc. in between? No, because the zeros are determined by the cumulative factors. The zeros only change at multiples of 5. So the set of n for which the zeros are m is an interval [a, b] such that a is the smallest n with zeros>=m and b is the smallest n with zeros>=m+1, and then the numbers are from a to b-1.\n\n            But note: the zeros function is constant on intervals of 5 numbers. Therefore, the length of the interval is at most 5? \n\n            Actually, no: consider m=0, but m>=1. For m=1, the interval is 5 numbers (from 5 to 9). For m=2, from 10 to 14 -> 5 numbers. But wait, at 25 we jump by 2, so the set for m=24 is from 100 to 124? \n\n            Let's compute for m=24:\n\n                trailing_zeros(100) = 24 (since 100//5 + 100//25 + 100//125 = 20+4+0=24)\n                trailing_zeros(101)=24, 102=24, ..., 104=24, 105: 105//5 + 105//25 + 105//125 = 21+4+0=25 -> so the set for m=24 is from 100 to 104 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            Now, m=25: \n                trailing_zeros(105)=25, then 106=25, ... until 109=25, then 110: 110//5+110//25+110//125=22+4+0=26 -> so 5 numbers.\n\n            But wait, what about m=28? \n                trailing_zeros(120)=28, then 121,122,123,124: still 28, then 125: 31 -> so the set for m=28 is 5 numbers.\n\n            However, what if we have a jump of more than 1? For example, m=29: \n                There is no n with trailing_zeros(n)=29, because at n=125 we jump from 28 to 31.\n\n            Therefore, the set for a given m is either empty or an interval of consecutive integers of length 5, except when the zeros jump by more than 1, then we skip some m.\n\n            But wait: the set for m=0 is [1,4] -> 4 numbers, but m>=1.\n\n            Actually, the zeros function is defined as:\n\n                f(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ...\n\n            And the zeros function is constant for n in [a, a+4] (if a is a multiple of 5) and then jumps at a+5.\n\n            However, the jump at a+5 is the number of factors of 5 in a+5. For example, if a+5 is 25, then we add 2. So the jump is 2.\n\n            Therefore, the set for m is:\n\n                Let L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m, and then we require that f(L)==m.\n\n                Then, the next jump happens at the next multiple of 5, which is L + (5 - (L % 5)) if L%5 !=0? Actually, the next multiple of 5 after L is: if L mod5==0, then the next multiple is L+5; else, the next multiple is (L//5+1)*5.\n\n            But note: the zeros function only changes at multiples of 5. So the next change is the next multiple of 5 after L.\n\n            However, if the next multiple of 5 is not the one that causes the jump for m+1, but maybe a larger jump (if that multiple is divisible by 25, then the jump is more than 1). \n\n            But our method using binary search for m+1 is correct.\n\n            The issue: if we try to output the entire list for m=100000, the list might have up to 5 numbers, so it's small. But wait, no: the set for a given m is contiguous and the length is the gap until the next multiple of 5. However, the next multiple of 5 is 5 steps away, so the set has at most 5 numbers. \n\n            Actually, the set for a given m is an interval of consecutive integers of length exactly 5? Not necessarily: the set might end earlier if the next jump is more than 1? \n\n            Let me clarify:\n\n                The zeros function is constant on [k, k+4] for k multiple of 5. Then at k+5, it jumps by the number of factors of 5 in k+5.\n\n                Therefore, the set for m is:\n\n                    [L, L+4]  if the next jump (at L+5) is by 1, then the set for m is 5 numbers.\n\n                But if the next jump is by more than 1, then the set for m is still [L, L+4] (if L is the start of the interval) and then the next jump (at L+5) will set the zeros to a value greater than m+1, so the set for m is still [L, L+4] (which is 5 numbers). \n\n            Example: m=28, and L=120. Then the next multiple is 125, which is 5 steps away (from 120 to 125). So the set is [120,124] (5 numbers). Then at 125, we jump to 31.\n\n            Example: m=29: no solution.\n\n            Example: m=30: no solution.\n\n            Example: m=31: set is [125,129] (5 numbers).\n\n            But wait: what if the next jump is not 5 steps away? Actually, the next multiple of 5 is always 5 steps away. However, the zeros function might jump at a multiple of 5 that is not the immediate next multiple? No, the zeros function only changes at multiples of 5.\n\n            Therefore, the set for m is either empty or 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n            However, wait: what if m is achieved at a segment that is not starting at a multiple of 5? \n\n            Example: m=1: starts at 5 (which is a multiple of 5) and ends at 9 (which is 4 steps from 5). Then the set is 5 numbers.\n\n            What if m=0? Then the set is [1,4] (4 numbers). But m>=1, so we don't care.\n\n            So for m>=1, the set is either empty or 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n            Therefore, the maximum length of the set is 5.\n\n            Then, we can safely output the entire set.\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n                m = int(input().strip())\n\n                # Function to compute trailing zeros\n                def tz(n):\n                    count = 0\n                    d = 5\n                    while d <= n:\n                        count += n // d\n                        d *= 5\n                    return count\n\n                # If m=0, we would handle differently, but m>=1.\n\n                # Step 1: Find the smallest n such that tz(n) >= m.\n                lo = 0\n                hi = 5 * m * 5   # This is an upper bound: we know that tz(5*m*5) >= m (actually much larger)\n\n                # Binary search for L (smallest n with tz(n)>=m)\n                L = hi\n                while lo <= hi:\n                    mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                    if tz(mid) >= m:\n                        L = mid\n                        hi = mid-1\n                    else:\n                        lo = mid+1\n\n                # Now, check if tz(L) == m. If not, then there's no solution.\n                if tz(L) != m:\n                    print(0)\n                    exit(0)\n\n                # Step 2: Find the smallest n such that tz(n) >= m+1.\n                lo2 = 0\n                hi2 = 5 * (m+1) * 5   # Or we can set hi2 = L + 50, because the next jump is at most 5 away? Actually, we already know L, so we can set hi2 = L + 1000000 (but m<=100000, and we expect the next jump to be within 5 steps, but wait: the next jump might be at a multiple of 5, but the multiple of 5 might be much further? Actually, the next jump is the next multiple of 5, which is at most 5 away from L? \n\n                Actually, the next jump (for m+1) must be at a multiple of 5. And the set for m is from L to the next multiple of 5 minus 1, unless the next multiple of 5 causes a jump of more than 1, then the set for m is still the same interval (until the next jump for m+1) but the next jump for m+1 might be at a different multiple of 5.\n\n                However, our binary search for m+1 will find the smallest n such that tz(n)>=m+1. Since we know that the zeros increase by at least 1 at multiples of 5, the next jump (if the jump is 1) is at L+5 (if L is a multiple of 5, then the next multiple is L+5). But if the jump is more than 1, then the next jump (for m+1) might be at the same multiple? Actually, no: if we jump by 2 at L+5, then we have skipped m+1. Then the next jump that gives at least m+1 is the next multiple of 5 after L+5.\n\n                So we can do:\n\n                R = hi2\n                while lo2 <= hi2:\n                    mid = (lo2+hi2)//2\n                    if tz(mid) >= m+1:\n                        R = mid\n                        hi2 = mid-1\n                    else:\n                        lo2 = mid+1\n\n                Then, the numbers are from L to R-1.\n\n                Then, the count is R - L.\n\n                But note: the set for m is [L, R-1]. And we know that tz(L)=m, and tz(R)=m+1 (or more). \n\n                Example m=1: \n                    L=5, then we do for m+1=2: \n                    tz(10)=2, so R=10. Then the numbers are [5,9] -> count=5.\n\n                Example m=5: \n                    We found L=25, then check tz(25)=6 !=5 -> so we output 0.\n\n                Example m=0: not applicable.\n\n                Example m=100000: \n                    We find L (minimal n with tz(n)>=100000) and then check if tz(L)==100000. Then find R (minimal n with tz(n)>=100001). Then output the numbers from L to R-1 (which are 5 numbers or less? Actually, the set is contiguous and the length is the gap until the next multiple of 5, which is 5 numbers, unless the next multiple of 5 causes a jump of more than 1, then the set for m=100000 might be interrupted? \n\n                But wait: the set for m=100000 is contiguous and the zeros are constant for 5 numbers. So the set has 5 numbers, unless the zeros jump at the next multiple of 5 (which is 5 steps away) by more than 1, then the set for m=100000 is still 5 numbers.\n\n                However, the problem: m=100000 is very large, and the numbers L and R might be huge. But the binary search is logarithmic.\n\n            But note: the upper bound for n in the binary search for L: we set hi = 5 * m * 5. For m=100000, that's 2500000, which is acceptable because we are doing about 21 iterations (log2(2500000) is about 22). Similarly for R.\n\n            However, we must ensure that the trailing_zeros function is efficient. The trailing_zeros function runs in O(log_5(n)), so for n=2500000, log5(2500000) is about log(2500000)/log(5) ≈ 14. So it's efficient.\n\n            Code:\n\n                m = int(input().strip())\n\n                def trailing_zeros(n):\n                    count = 0\n                    d = 5\n                    while d <= n:\n                        count += n // d\n                        d *= 5\n                    return count\n\n                # Edge: if m is very large, we set an upper bound. But note: we might set hi too low? We use 5*m*5 for the first binary search.\n\n                # Find L: smallest n with trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n                lo, hi = 0, 5 * m * 5\n                L = hi\n                while lo <= hi:\n                    mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                    if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n                        L = mid\n                        hi = mid-1\n                    else:\n                        lo = mid+1\n\n                # Check if L is valid for m\n                if trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n                    print(0)\n                else:\n                    # Now find R: smallest n with trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1\n                    lo2, hi2 = 0, 5 * (m+1) * 5   # Or we can set hi2 to L + 10**6, but 5*(m+1)*5 is safe.\n                    R = hi2\n                    while lo2 <= hi2:\n                        mid = (lo2+hi2)//2\n                        if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m+1:\n                            R = mid\n                            hi2 = mid-1\n                        else:\n                            lo2 = mid+1\n\n                    # The numbers are from L to R-1, inclusive.\n                    count = R - L\n                    numbers = [str(i) for i in range(L, R)]\n                    # Format: first print the count, then the list of numbers.\n                    print(count)\n                    if count > 0:\n                        print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\n            However, note: the problem says first print k (the count) and then the k integers.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently determining the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is primarily determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( L \\)) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( R \\)) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values are those in the interval \\([L, R-1]\\), provided \\( f(L) = m \\). If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., \\( f(L) > m \\)), then there are no solutions.\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: The binary search efficiently narrows down the range for \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) by leveraging the monotonic nature of \\( f(n) \\). The upper bounds for the binary search are set sufficiently high (e.g., \\( 5 \\times m \\times 5 \\)) to ensure coverage of all possible \\( n \\) values without excessive computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    \n    def trailing_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        d = 5\n        while d <= n:\n            count += n // d\n            d *= 5\n        return count\n\n    lo, hi = 0, 5 * m * 5\n    L = hi\n    while lo <= hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            L = mid\n            hi = mid - 1\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n            \n    if trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    lo2, hi2 = 0, 5 * (m + 1) * 5\n    R = hi2\n    while lo2 <= hi2:\n        mid = (lo2 + hi2) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m + 1:\n            R = mid\n            hi2 = mid - 1\n        else:\n            lo2 = mid + 1\n            \n    count = R - L\n    numbers = list(range(L, R))\n    print(count)\n    if count > 0:\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \\( m \\) from standard input, which represents the required number of trailing zeroes.\n2. **Trailing Zeroes Calculation**: The helper function `trailing_zeros(n)` computes the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n3. **Binary Search for Lower Bound \\( L \\)**: The binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\). If \\( f(L) \\neq m \\), it means no \\( n \\) satisfies the condition, and the program outputs 0.\n4. **Binary Search for Upper Bound \\( R \\)**: Another binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values are those from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\).\n5. **Output**: The program prints the count of valid \\( n \\) values followed by the values themselves in increasing order, separated by spaces.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution space using binary search, leveraging the properties of factorial trailing zeroes to handle large values of \\( m \\) (up to 100,000) within feasible computational limits.",
