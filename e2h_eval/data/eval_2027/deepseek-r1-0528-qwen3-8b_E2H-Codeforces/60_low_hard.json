Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S (in Morse code). \n\n Important: The valid Morse codes for letters are strings of length 1 to 4, and there are 30 possible binary strings (from length 1 to 4) but 4 are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So we have 26 valid.\n\n However, note: the problem states that each string of length 1 to 4 (with only '0' and '1') corresponds to a distinct letter, except those four. So we know which ones are valid.\n\n We are building S one character at a time (either '0' or '1'). After each append, we need to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of letters that can be found as contiguous substrings in the current S (represented in Morse as these binary strings).\n\n But note: the same Morse code string might appear multiple times, but the problem counts distinct sequences of letters. However, note that the mapping from Morse code to letters is fixed and one-to-one (except the invalid ones, but we don't use them). Also, the same Morse code string always maps to the same letter.\n\n However, here's the catch: two different Morse code strings (substrings) may form a sequence of letters. For example, if we have the substring \"1\" (which is 'T') and then later we have \"11\" (which is 'M'), then the sequence \"TM\" is formed by the consecutive letters from the two substrings? Actually, note that the problem says: \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\n\n But note: the substring must be contiguous in the Morse representation. However, the Morse code representation of a letter is a contiguous string, but when we have multiple letters, they are concatenated without separators. Therefore, the entire substring (say, of length L) might be broken down into consecutive letters. However, the problem does not require that the entire substring is one letter. It can be multiple letters.\n\n Example: In the sample, after S=\"111\", the answer is 7. The sequences are:\n   \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n How do we break the substring \"11\" (which is the first two characters) as two T's? But note: \"1\" is T, so \"11\" is two T's. Similarly, \"111\" can be broken as three T's, or one T and one M (if we break after the first one: \"1\" and \"11\")? However, note the example lists \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". \n\n But wait: \n   - \"TT\": the substring \"11\" is broken into two T's. This corresponds to the Morse code \"11\" being two separate T's. Similarly, \"TM\" would be the substring \"111\" broken as \"1\" and then \"11\" (so the last two are M). However, note that the substring \"111\" can also be broken as \"11\" and \"1\", which is \"M\" and then \"T\", i.e., \"MT\".\n\n So the problem is: we are allowed to take any contiguous substring of S (which is a string of zeros and ones) and then break it into parts (each part being a valid Morse code for a letter) such that the entire substring is the concatenation of these parts.\n\n But note: the Morse code for a letter has length between 1 and 4. Therefore, when we break a substring, we break it into segments of length 1, 2, 3, or 4? And the entire substring must be broken into one or more complete letters (so the breaks must be such that each segment is of length 1-4 and is valid).\n\n However, the problem says: \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring\". This means that we are allowed to consider any contiguous substring (of the binary string) and then interpret that substring as a sequence of Morse code letters (by breaking it appropriately). But note: the same substring might be broken in multiple ways, and we are counting distinct sequences of letters (not the Morse code strings, but the actual letters). \n\n But wait: the mapping from Morse code to letters is fixed. However, the problem says that the four invalid strings do not correspond to any letter, so we cannot use them. Also, note: the same Morse code string (if valid) always maps to the same letter.\n\n However, the same sequence of letters might be represented by different substrings? Actually, no: because the Morse code representation is unique for each letter (the problem says: each",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by any substring of a given binary string (where '0' represents a dot and '1' represents a dash) after each modification. The solution involves efficiently tracking valid Morse code sequences and their combinations as the string grows.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that any contiguous substring of the binary string can be broken down into segments where each segment is a valid Morse code representation of a letter (length 1 to 4, excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\"). The challenge is to count all distinct sequences of these letters formed by any such segmentation of substrings in the current binary string.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array `dp[i]` to store the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string. This helps in efficiently updating the count as the string grows.\n\n3. **Tracking Valid Segments**: For each new character appended to the string, we check all possible segment lengths (1 to 4) ending at the current position. If a segment is valid (i.e., it corresponds to a valid Morse code letter), we update the DP array and the total count of valid sequences.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, all counts are maintained modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The approach processes each character in linear time, checking up to 4 previous positions for valid segments, making the overall complexity \\(O(m \\times 4)\\) per modification, which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = []\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        s_list.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    ans_lines = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    total = 0\n    n = 0\n    \n    for char in s_list:\n        n += 1\n        dp[n] = 0\n        for length in range(1, 5):\n            start = n - length\n            if start < 0:\n                break\n            seg = ''.join(s_list[j] for j in range(start + 1, n + 1))\n            if len(seg) != length:\n                continue\n            if seg == '0011' or seg == '0101' or seg == '1110' or seg == '1111':\n                continue\n            prev_total = dp[start]\n            if prev_total:\n                dp[n] = (dp[n] + prev_total) % MOD\n            else:\n                dp[n] = (dp[n] + 1) % MOD\n        total = (total + dp[n]) % MOD\n        ans_lines.append(str(total))\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(ans_lines))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values, initializes the DP array and total count, and prepares to process each character.\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each new character, it checks segments of lengths 1 to 4 ending at the current position. If a segment is valid (not one of the forbidden strings), it updates the DP value for the current position based on valid segments ending before it.\n3. **Updating Total Count**: The total count of valid sequences is updated by adding the DP value of the current position, ensuring results are modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n4. **Output**: After processing each character, the current total count is recorded and printed at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
