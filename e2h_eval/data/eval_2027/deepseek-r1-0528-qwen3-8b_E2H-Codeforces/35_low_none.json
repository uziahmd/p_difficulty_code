Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements (from 0 to n-1)\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string that is the binary representation of m (without spaces) of length n\n\n Note: The problem states that the binary representation of m is given as a string s0s1...sn-1, so m = s0*(2^(n-1)) + s1*(2^(n-2)) + ... + s_{n-1}*(2^0)\n\n However, note: the function f(x) uses the bits of x (which is from 0 to 2^n - 1) and sets bit(i) to 1 if the i-th bit (from the least significant?) is set.\n\n But note: the example: n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) then f(11)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n How is the indexing done? In the example, the binary representation of x has bits for positions 0 to n-1? Actually, note:\n\n   x = 11 = 8+2+1 -> 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0, but the array a is indexed from 0 to 3 (so 4 elements).\n\n   The example says: f(11) = a0 + a1 + a3.\n\n   So the i-th bit in the binary representation of x (counting from the least significant bit as the 0th index) corresponds to the array element a_i.\n\n   However, wait: in the example, the bit at position 0 (LSB) is set, so we use a0. Then the bit at position 1 is not set, so we don't use a1? Actually, wait: 11 is 1011 in binary (if we consider 4 bits). But note the example says: x=11 (11=2^0+2^1+2^3). So the positions are:\n\n        bit0: 1 -> a0\n        bit1: 1 -> a1? but wait, the example only adds a0, a1, a3? Actually, the example says: \"f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3\", but 11 has bits set at positions 0, 1, and 3. So the function f(x) includes a_i for every bit i that is set.\n\n   Therefore, the function f(x) is defined by: \n        Let x have bits set at positions i (with i from 0 to n-1). Then f(x) = sum_{i where the i-th bit is set} a_i.\n\n   But note: the array a has n elements, so the indices go from 0 to n-1, which matches the bits from 0 to n-1.\n\n However, the input gives the binary representation of m as a string of length n, which we can interpret as:\n\n        m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify the bit order. However, observe that the example: \n        Input: '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010'\n\n        Here, n=5, m's binary representation is \"11010\". This means:\n            m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n        Now, the maximum value of f(x) is 27, which is achieved at x=5 (binary 00101). \n\n        But wait: the function f(x) uses the bits of x (from LSB to MSB) and the array a is [17,0,10,2,1]. \n\n        The indices: \n            If we consider the bits of x from LSB (rightmost) to MSB (leftmost) then:\n\n            x=5: binary (using 5 bits) is 00101. \n            Then the bits are:\n                bit0 (LSB): 1 -> a0 = 17\n                bit1: 0 -> skip\n                bit2: 1 -> a2 = 10\n                bit3: 0 -> skip\n                bit4: 0 -> skip\n\n            So f(5) = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\n        However, the given string for m is \"11010\", which is the most",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements in array \\( a \\) at positions where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that \\( f(x) \\) is essentially the sum of elements \\( a_i \\) for each bit \\( i \\) set in \\( x \\). The challenge is to maximize this sum while ensuring \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\). \n\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal solution involves considering each bit position from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). For each bit position, we decide whether setting it to 1 in \\( x \\) would still keep \\( x \\) within the bound \\( m \\). If setting a bit to 1 does not violate the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\), we include the corresponding \\( a_i \\) in the sum; otherwise, we skip it.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy approach. Starting from the LSB to the MSB, we check if setting the current bit to 1 in \\( x \\) is allowed without exceeding \\( m \\). If allowed, we add \\( a_i \\) to our result and adjust \\( m \\) accordingly by subtracting \\( 2^i \\) (since we are effectively borrowing this bit). This adjustment ensures that subsequent bits are considered under the constraint \\( x \\leq m - \\text{current } x \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit from 0 to \\( n-1 \\), performing constant-time operations for each bit. Thus, the time complexity is \\( O(n) \\), which is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    bin_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total = 0\n    power = 1\n    m_val = int(bin_str, 2)\n    remaining = m_val\n    \n    for i in range(len(a)-1, -1, -1):\n        if remaining == 0:\n            break\n        if a[i] > 0:\n            if remaining & (1 << (len(a) - 1 - i)):\n                total += a[i]\n                remaining -= (1 << (len(a) - 1 - i))\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize `total` to accumulate the maximum sum, `power` to handle bit positions, and `m_val` converts the binary string to an integer.\n\n3. **Processing Bits**: We iterate over each element in the array from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). For each element \\( a[i] \\), we check if the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is set. If it is, we add \\( a[i] \\) to `total` and adjust `remaining` by subtracting \\( 2^{\\text{bit position}} \\), effectively marking this bit as used.\n\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all bits, the accumulated `total` is printed, representing the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) for \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each bit position in descending order of significance, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
