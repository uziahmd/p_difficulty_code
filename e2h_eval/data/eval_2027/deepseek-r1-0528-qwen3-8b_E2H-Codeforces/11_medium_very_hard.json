A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total milliliters of drink: total_drink = k * l\n    Each toast requires nl milliliters. So, the number of toasts from drink = total_drink // nl\n\n 2. Calculate the total lime slices: total_lime_slices = c * d\n    Each toast requires 1 slice. So, the number of toasts from lime = total_lime_slices\n\n 3. Calculate the salt requirement: Each toast requires np grams. The available salt is p grams.\n    So, the number of toasts from salt = p // np\n\n 4. The limiting factor is the minimum of these three values.\n\n 5. However, note that there are n friends and they all must drink the same amount. So, the total number of toasts (T) must be divisible by n for each friend to have the same amount? Actually, we are making toasts and each toast uses the resources. But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" per toast. And they want to make as many toasts as they can such that each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n However, the example does: \n   Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n   Steps:\n     Total drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> 20 // 3 = 6 toasts (since each toast uses 3 ml)\n     Total lime slices: 10*8 = 80 -> 80 toasts\n     Salt: 100 // 1 = 100 toasts\n   Then the answer is min(6,80,100) // 3 = 2\n\n But note: the total toasts made is T, and then each friend makes T/n toasts? Actually, wait: \n   There are 3 friends. Each toast requires one set of resources for one toast. But the condition is that each friend must drink the same amount. \n\n Let's re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters ... per toast\". This means that for one toast per friend, they need nl ml, one lime slice, and np grams. \n\n However, the example does not say that the entire group toasts together. Instead, they are making toasts and each toast is for one drink (one set per friend). Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast. \n\n But then note: if they are making toasts, they might be making multiple rounds. However, the problem says \"each friend needs\" for a toast. So, if a friend makes t toasts, then they use t * nl ml, t lime slices, and t * np grams.\n\n However, the resources are shared. So, the total amount of drink used is (number of toasts) * nl, because each toast (for one friend) uses nl ml. Similarly, for lime: (number of toasts) * 1, and for salt: (number of toasts) * np.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make a toast. So, if there are n friends and they each make T toasts, then the total drink required is n * T * nl, the total lime slices is n * T, and the total salt is n * T * np.\n\n However, the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" leads to an answer of 2. Let's check:\n\n If each friend makes T toasts, then:\n   Total drink needed: 3 * T * 3 = 9T ml. We have 20 ml -> 9T <= 20 -> T <= 2 (because 9*2=18<=20, 9*3=27>20)\n   Total lime slices: 3 * T * 1 = 3T. We have 80 slices -> 3T <= 80 -> T <= 26 (but we are limited by drink)\n   Total salt: 3 * T * 1 = 3T grams. We have 100 grams -> 3T <= 100 -> T <= 33.\n\n So T_max = floor(min(20/(3*3), 80/3, 100/3)) ? That doesn't match.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be interpreted as: the entire group makes T toasts, and each toast is shared by all friends? But that doesn't make sense because then the requirements would be different.\n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" \n\n This implies that for one toast, each friend must have their own set. Therefore, one toast (as in one round) requires n * nl ml, n * np grams of salt, and n slices of lime? \n\n But wait, the example says: \n   They have 3 friends, so for one toast (each friend has one) they need 3 * nl ml, 3 * np grams, and 3 slices of lime.\n\n Then, the maximum number of toasts T is limited by:\n   T <= total_drink / (n * nl)   [because each toast requires n * nl ml]\n   T <= total_lime_slices / n   [because each toast requires n slices, so total slices must be at least n*T]\n   T <= p / (n * np)   [each toast requires n * np grams]\n\n However, the example input: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n Then:\n   total_drink = 20 ml.\n   Each toast requires 3*3 = 9 ml -> max toasts from drink: 20 // 9 = 2 (since 9*2=18<=20, 9*3=27>20)\n   Lime: total slices = 10*8=80. Each toast requires 3 slices -> 80 // 3 = 26 (but we are limited by drink to 2)\n   Salt: total salt = 100. Each toast requires 3*1=3 grams -> 100 // 3 = 33.\n\n Then T = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n So the example output is 2.\n\n But wait, the example calculation in the note was:\n   \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n Why did they divide by 3 (nl) and not by (n * nl)? \n\n Let me clarify: In the example, the note says: \n   \"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n This implies that they are calculating the total toasts without considering that each toast requires one per friend. Then they divide by the number of friends to get the number per friend.\n\n But wait, the note's first step: \n   Drink: 20 / 3 (nl) = 6 toasts.\n\n Then they take the minimum of 6, 80, 100 and then divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2.\n\n This interpretation is different: \n   They are considering that the drink is used for the entire group? Actually, no. The note says: \n        \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n But what are the 6,80,100? \n   6: from drink (total_drink / nl) -> total number of toasts if we only consider drink and each toast is for one friend? Or for the entire group?\n\n Actually, the note's calculation is:\n\n   Total drink: 20 ml. Each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml. But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" per toast. \n\n   However, the note's calculation seems to assume that one toast (for the entire group) requires 3 ml? That doesn't fit.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem statement: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make a toast.\n\n This means that if they are making one toast, then each friend must have their own set. Therefore, one toast requires n * nl ml, n * np grams, and n slices.\n\n But the note calculates:\n   Drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n How did they get 3? It's nl=3. So they are dividing by 3 (nl) but not by n (which is 3). \n\n Alternatively, the note might be thinking: \n   For one toast (meaning one toast per friend) we need 3 ml per friend, so total ml needed for one round (all friends having one toast) is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. Then the number of rounds (toasts) we can do is 20 // 9 = 2.\n\n But the note says 20/3=6, which is not 2.\n\n Another possibility: the note is calculating the total number of toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend) that the entire drink can provide. Then:\n\n   Total toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend) from drink = total_drink / nl = 20/3 = 6 (rounded down to 6? but 20//3=6 in integer division).\n\n   Then, the total toasts from lime = 80 (each toast requires one slice, and we have 80 slices, so 80 toasts)\n   From salt: 100/1=100 toasts.\n\n Then the limiting factor is 6 toasts (in terms of total servings). Since there are 3 friends, each friend can have 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n This interpretation matches the example.\n\n So the steps are:\n\n   Let T_total_drink = total_drink // nl   [because each toast (for one friend) requires nl ml, so total ml divided by nl gives the total number of toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend)]\n\n   Let T_total_lime = (c * d) // 1   [each toast requires one slice, so total slices is c*d, and each toast uses one slice]\n\n   Let T_total_salt = p // np   [each toast requires np grams of salt]\n\n   Then the maximum total number of toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend) is T = min(T_total_drink, T_total_lime, T_total_salt)\n\n   Then, since there are n friends, the number of toasts per friend is T // n? \n\n   But wait: the total toasts (each being one serving for one friend) is T. Then if we distribute these T servings among n friends, each friend gets T // n toasts (if we require integer numbers and same for everyone).\n\n   However, note: the example: T=6, n=3 -> 6//3=2.\n\n   But consider: what if T is not divisible by n? The problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters ... per toast\", meaning that we cannot give a fraction of a toast to a friend. Therefore, we must have an integer number of toasts per friend.\n\n   Actually, the total toasts T must be distributed equally to n friends. The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is floor(T / n). But note: T is the total toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend). However, the problem states that they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\n   This means that we cannot exceed T_total_drink, T_total_lime, T_total_salt. And the total toasts (each serving for one friend) is T. Then, the number of toasts per friend is T // n, because if we have T = 5 and n=3, then we can only give 1 toast to each (because 1*3=3 toasts) and then we have 2 toasts left which cannot be distributed equally.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"make as many toasts as they can\", but the toasts are defined as one serving for one friend. Then the condition is that each friend must have the same number of toasts. Therefore, we cannot exceed the total T, and we cannot have fractional toasts.\n\n   But wait, the example: T=6, n=3 -> 6/3=2, so each friend gets 2 toasts. This uses 2*3=6 toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend). \n\n   However, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast. So for 2 toasts per friend, we need 2 * (nl) * n ml, 2 * n slices, and 2 * np * n grams.\n\n   But wait, the total toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend) is 6. And the resource constraints are:\n\n      Drink: 6 * nl = 6 * 3 = 18 ml -> available 20 ml -> okay.\n      Lime: 6 * 1 = 6 slices -> available 80 -> okay.\n      Salt: 6 * np = 6 * 1 = 6 grams -> available 100 -> okay.\n\n   So the calculation is:\n\n      total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, (c*d) // 1, p // np )\n\n      Then, since each friend gets the same number of toasts, we can only have up to total_toasts // n toasts per friend? \n\n   Actually, no: the total_toasts is the total number of servings (each serving is one toast for one friend). Then the number of toasts per friend is total_toasts // n? \n\n   But note: if we have total_toasts T, then we can assign floor(T / n) toasts per friend, but then we have T % n toasts left over. However, the condition is that all friends must drink the same amount. So we cannot leave any toasts if we are to assign the same amount to each? Actually, we can only use complete sets for the entire group. \n\n   However, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters ... per toast\", meaning that if a friend is to have x toasts, then they need x * nl ml, etc. Therefore, we must use whole toasts. And we cannot use a partial toast for a friend.\n\n   But note: the entire group must have the same number of toasts. So we can have at most floor(min( (k*l)//nl, (c*d)//1, p//np ) / n) * n toasts? \n\n   Actually, the total number of toasts (each being one serving for one friend) must be a multiple of n? Not necessarily, because we can have a remainder. But the condition is that each friend drinks the same amount. So if we have T total toasts, then we can only assign T // n toasts to each friend, and we don't care about the remainder (because we cannot break a toast).\n\n   However, the problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", meaning the maximum T' (total toasts) that is at most the minimum of the three and also T' must be divisible by n? \n\n   But wait, the example: \n        Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n        Output: 3\n\n   Let's break it down:\n        n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n        total_drink = 100*10 = 1000 ml -> toasts from drink: 1000 // 4 = 250\n        total_lime_slices = 1*19 = 19 -> toasts from lime: 19 // 1 = 19\n        total_salt = 90 // 3 = 30\n\n        Then T = min(250, 19, 30) = 19\n\n        Then the number of toasts per friend = 19 // 5 = 3 (because 3*5=15 toasts, which is <=19, and 4*5=20>19)\n\n        But wait, 19 toasts is the total for all friends. Each toast is one serving for one friend. Then we can only assign 3 toasts to each friend (since 3*5=15 toasts) and we have 4 toasts left. However, the problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", meaning we should use all resources? \n\n        But the problem condition: \"each friend needs nl milliliters ... per toast\". So if a friend gets 3 toasts, then they use 3*4 ml, 3 slices, and 3*3 grams.\n\n        Now, if we use 15 toasts (3 per friend) then:\n            Drink: 15 * 4 = 60 ml -> available 1000 -> okay.\n            Lime: 15 slices -> available 19 -> okay.\n            Salt: 15 * 3 = 45 grams -> available 90 -> okay.\n\n        But can we do more? The next multiple would be 4 per friend, which is 20 toasts. \n            Drink: 20*4 = 80 ml -> okay.\n            Lime: 20 slices -> but we only have 19 -> not okay.\n\n        So we cannot do 20. Therefore, 15 is the maximum multiple of 5 (number of friends) that we can achieve.\n\n        But note: we are not required to use multiples of n for the total toasts? Actually, the problem does not specify that the total toasts must be a multiple of n. However, the condition is that each friend drinks the same amount. So the total toasts must be a multiple of n? \n\n        Actually, no: if we have 19 toasts, we can assign 3 to each of the 5 friends (using 15) and then we have 4 toasts left. But these 4 toasts cannot be assigned to the friends because they must drink the same amount. We cannot give 3 to some and 4 to others.\n\n        Therefore, the total toasts must be a multiple of n. \n\n        So the correct approach is:\n\n            Step 1: Calculate the maximum total toasts (without considering the n friends) as:\n                T1 = (k * l) // nl\n                T2 = (c * d) // 1\n                T3 = p // np\n                T = min(T1, T2, T3)\n\n            Step 2: Then, we can only use multiples of n (because each friend must have the same number of toasts). The maximum multiple is T // n * n (the largest multiple of n that is <= T). Then the number of toasts per friend is (T // n) * n // n = T // n.\n\n            But wait: the number of toasts per friend is (T // n) * n / n = T // n? \n\n            Actually, the total toasts we can use is T_use = (T // n) * n. Then the number of toasts per friend is T_use // n = (T // n) * n // n = T // n.\n\n            Alternatively, we can compute: T_use = (T // n) * n, then toasts per friend = T_use // n = T // n.\n\n            However, note: the example \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\": \n                T = 19, then T // 5 = 3, and then we use 15 toasts. Then each friend gets 3.\n\n            But wait, the example output is 3.\n\n            Another example: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" -> output 0.\n\n            Let's break down:\n                n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n                T1 = (1000*1000) // 50 = 10000000 // 50 = 200000\n                T2 = 25*23 = 575\n                T3 = 1 // 1 = 1\n                T = min(200000, 575, 1) = 1\n                Then toasts per friend = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n            This matches.\n\n        However, wait: the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" -> \n                T1 = (4*5)//3 = 20//3 = 6\n                T2 = 10*8 = 80\n                T3 = 100//1 = 100\n                T = 6\n                Then toasts per friend = 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n        So the procedure is:\n\n            total_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, (c*d)//1, p//np )\n            per_friend = total_toasts // n   [because we can use at most total_toasts, and we must use a multiple of n, so we use (total_toasts // n) * n toasts, and then per friend is (total_toasts // n) * n / n = total_toasts // n]\n\n        But wait, why not just use floor(total_toasts / n) as the toasts per friend? \n\n            total_toasts = 19, n=5 -> 19//5 = 3 (integer division) -> 3 per friend.\n\n        This is the same as above.\n\n        However, note: the total_toasts is the maximum total toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend) that we can have without exceeding any resource. Then we want to assign the same number of toasts to each friend, so we take floor(total_toasts / n) and that is the answer.\n\n        But wait, is that correct? Because if we have total_toasts = 19, then we can only assign 3 to each of 5 friends (because 3*5=15 <=19, and 4*5=20>19). So yes.\n\n        However, note: the resources are shared. When we assign 3 to each friend, we are using 15 toasts. The resources used are:\n\n            Drink: 15 * 3 = 45 ml (nl=3) -> but wait, note: in the second example, nl=4. \n\n        But the calculation for total_toasts was based on:\n\n            Drink: total_toasts_drink = (k*l) // nl\n\n        Then we take the minimum. However, when we use 15 toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend) we are using 15 * nl ml. But note: our initial total_toasts_drink was calculated as (k*l) // nl, meaning that (k*l) must be at least 15 * nl to allow 15 toasts? \n\n        Actually, yes: 15 * nl = 15 * 4 = 60 ml, and we had 1000 ml, so it's okay.\n\n        But wait, the total_toasts_drink was 250, which is more than 15. So we are not constrained by the drink for 15 toasts.\n\n        However, the calculation of total_toasts was the minimum of the three. Then we are using 15 toasts, but the drink constraint was 250, which is way above 15. So the limiting factor was lime (19) and salt (30) -> actually, wait, the example \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\" had:\n\n            Drink: 250, Lime: 19, Salt: 30 -> so the limiting factor was lime. Then we used 15 toasts (which is less than 19) so that was okay.\n\n        But note: the total_toasts we calculated was 19 (from lime). Then we use 15 toasts (which is <=19). However, the drink and salt were not the limiting factors.\n\n        The key is: the total_toasts we calculated (19) is the maximum total toasts (each serving one friend) that we can have given the most limiting resource (lime). Then we distribute these 19 toasts equally to 5 friends, which gives 3 per friend (with 4 toasts left, but we cannot use them because we cannot break the rule of equal distribution).\n\n        However, wait: the problem does not require that we use the most limiting resource's exact value. We can use any number of toasts up to the minimum. But we cannot use more than the minimum. So the maximum total toasts we can have is 19, but we can choose to use only 15 (which is a multiple of 5) and that is acceptable.\n\n        But is 15 the maximum multiple of 5 that is <=19? Yes.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is: \n            T = min( (k*l)//nl, (c*d)//1, p//np )\n            ans = T // n   (using integer division)\n\n        However, wait: in the example \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\", T=6, and 6//3=2.\n\n        But let me check with the example \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\": \n            T = min(1000//4, 19, 90//3) = min(250,19,30)=19\n            ans = 19 // 5 = 3\n\n        And the third example: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" -> T=min(1000000//50, 575, 1//1)=min(20000,575,1)=1, then 1//10=0.\n\n        The sample outputs are: ['2', '3', '0'].\n\n        But wait, the sample input is given as three separate lines? Actually, the problem says: \"The first and only line contains positive integers ...\"\n\n        However, the example input is shown as:\n\n            ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n        So we are reading one line. But the example input has three examples. \n\n        The problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input. But in the actual competition, the input is one line.\n\n        So we assume one line of input.\n\n        However, the example output is three integers. But wait, the example input is three separate lines? Actually, the problem says: \"The first and only line\", meaning one line. But the example input is given as three strings in a list.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n\n            Input\n            The first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n        So we read one line.\n\n        But the example shows three inputs. This is just for illustration. \n\n        Therefore, we write code that reads one line.\n\n        Code:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            if len(data) != 8:\n                # But the problem says one line with 8 integers, so we assume 8\n                # However, let's be safe and take the first 8 if there are more?\n                # But the problem says 8, so we can assume 8.\n                pass\n\n            n = int(data[0])\n            k = int(data[1])\n            l = int(data[2])\n            c = int(data[3])\n            d = int(data[4])\n            p = int(data[5])\n            nl = int(data[6])\n            np = int(data[7])\n\n            total_drink = k * l\n            total_lime_slices = c * d\n            total_salt = p\n\n            # Calculate the maximum toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend) from each resource\n            toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n            toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // 1   # because each toast uses one slice\n            toasts_salt = total_salt // np\n\n            T = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n\n            # Then, since there are n friends, the number of toasts each friend can make is T // n\n            print(T // n)\n\n        Let's test with the examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n            n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n            total_drink = 20 -> toasts_drink = 20//3 = 6\n            total_lime_slices = 80 -> toasts_lime = 80\n            toasts_salt = 100//1 = 100\n            T = 6\n            T//n = 6//3 = 2 -> output 2\n\n        Example 2: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n            n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n            total_drink = 1000 -> 1000//4=250\n            total_lime_slices = 19 -> 19\n            toasts_salt = 90//3=30\n            T=19\n            T//n=19//5=3 -> output 3\n\n        Example 3: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n            total_drink = 1000000 -> 1000000//50=20000\n            total_lime_slices=25*23=575\n            toasts_salt=1//1=1\n            T=1\n            T//10=0 -> output 0\n\n        This matches the sample outputs.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"positive integers\" and \"not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1\", so we are safe.\n\n        One more edge: if the resources are very small.\n\n        Example: n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1\n            toasts_drink = 1//1=1\n            toasts_lime=1\n            toasts_salt=1\n            T=1, then T//1=1 -> output 1.\n\n        Another: n=2, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1\n            toasts_drink=1, toasts_lime=1, toasts_salt=1 -> T=1, then 1//2=0.\n\n        But wait, if there are 2 friends and only 1 toast (each toast for one friend) then we can only use 1 toast. But we have two friends. Then we cannot give both friends a toast because we only have 1 toast (each toast is for one friend). However, the condition is that each friend must drink the same amount. So we cannot give one friend a toast and the other not. Therefore, we give 0 toasts to each.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But what if we have n=2, k=2, l=1, c=2, d=1, p=2, nl=1, np=1\n            toasts_drink = 2//1=2\n            toasts_lime=2\n            toasts_salt=2\n            T=2, then 2//2=1.\n\n        Each friend gets 1 toast.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            Read the input line, split, convert to integers.\n\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n            total_drink = k * l\n            total_lime_slices = c * d\n            total_salt = p\n\n            toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n            toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // 1\n            toasts_salt = total_salt // np\n\n            T = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n\n            print(T // n)\n\n        However, wait: what if we have fractional toasts? We are using integer division (floor) for each resource. This is correct because we cannot use fractional toasts.\n\n        But note: the drink and salt calculations use floor division. For example, if we have 5 ml and nl=2, then 5//2=2 toasts (each requiring 2 ml) -> uses 4 ml, leaving 1 ml unused. That is acceptable because we are making whole toasts.\n\n        Similarly, for salt: 5 grams and np=2 -> 5//2=2 toasts (using 4 grams).\n\n        But wait, the problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", meaning we use the maximum number of complete toasts.\n\n        So this is correct.\n\n        However, note: the drink calculation: total_drink // nl. But if total_drink is not divisible by nl, we are ignoring the remainder. That is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n            Output: 2\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n            Output: 3\n\n        Example 3:\n            Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n            Output: 0\n\n        All correct.\n\n        But wait, the example input in the problem is given as three separate lines. However, the problem says \"The first and only line\", so we assume one line. \n\n        If the input has multiple lines, we would have to read until we get the required 8 integers. But the problem says one line.\n\n        We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n        Code:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            k = int(data[1])\n            l = int(data[2])\n            c = int(data[3])\n            d = int(data[4])\n            p = int(data[5])\n            nl = int(data[6])\n            np = int(data[7])\n\n            total_drink = k * l\n            total_lime_slices = c * d\n            total_salt = p\n\n            # Calculate the maximum toasts (each toast is one serving for one friend) from each resource\n            toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n            toasts_lime = total_lime_slices  # because each toast uses one slice, so the number of toasts is the total slices\n            # But wait, the lime resource: we have total_lime_slices, and each toast uses one slice -> toasts_lime = total_lime_slices (not divided by anything else)\n\n            # However, note: the problem says \"each toast\" requires one slice. So the maximum toasts from lime is total_lime_slices (each toast uses one slice).\n\n            # Similarly, for drink: each toast uses nl ml, so we can have total_drink // nl toasts.\n            # For salt: each toast uses np grams, so total_salt // np toasts.\n\n            toasts",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The goal is to ensure all friends have the same number of toasts while utilizing the available resources efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on three resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - One lime slice per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**: The limiting factor for the number of toasts is determined by the resource that allows the fewest toasts. This is calculated by:\n   - **Drink**: Total available drink divided by `nl` (each toast requires `nl` ml per friend).\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total available lime slices (each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt**: Total available salt divided by `np` (each toast requires `np` grams per friend).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Compute the maximum number of toasts possible from each resource.\n   - The smallest value among these three determines the total number of toasts that can be made.\n   - Since each friend must have the same number of toasts, the result is the total toasts divided by the number of friends, using integer division to ensure whole numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n    toasts_lime = total_lime_slices\n    toasts_salt = p // np\n    \n    T = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n    ans = T // n\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Multiply the number of bottles (`k`) by the milliliters per bottle (`l`).\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Multiply the number of limes (`c`) by the slices per lime (`d`).\n3. **Toast Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Toasts**: Divide the total drink by the milliliters required per toast (`nl`).\n   - **Lime Toasts**: The total lime slices directly give the maximum toasts (since each toast needs one slice).\n   - **Salt Toasts**: Divide the total salt (`p`) by the grams required per toast (`np`).\n4. **Determine Minimum Toasts**: The smallest value from the three calculations above determines the maximum number of toasts that can be made without exceeding any resource.\n5. **Per Friend Toasts**: Divide the total toasts by the number of friends (`n`) using integer division to ensure each friend gets an equal number of whole toasts.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both optimal and equitable among all friends.",
