Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all the letters must be the same (the same letter for the entire diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, and that letter must be different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the diagonals might have two different letters? Actually, the problem says:\n   - The diagonals must be the same letter? Or each diagonal is the same but both diagonals can have different letters? \n But reading the problem statement: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n This means that the main diagonal has the same letter, and the anti-diagonal has the same letter. \n However, note that the center square is common to both diagonals. So the entire diagonal must be the same, and the anti-diagonal must be the same, but the two diagonals can have different letters?\n\n Let's look at the example: \n   Input: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n\n   Output: NO.\n\n Why? Because in the third row, the center is 's' but the diagonals must be the same? Actually, the example output is NO.\n\n In the example, the main diagonal: \n   positions (0,0): 'x', (1,1): 'o', (2,2): 's', (3,3): 'o', (4,4): 'x'\n   That is not the same letter. Similarly, the anti-diagonal: \n   (0,4): 'x', (1,3): 'x', (2,2): 's', (3,1): 'x', (4,0): 'x'\n\n So the main diagonal has alternating letters, which doesn't satisfy the condition that the entire diagonal must be the same.\n\n Therefore, we require:\n   - The main diagonal must be composed of a single letter (say, 'a')\n   - The anti-diagonal must be composed of a single letter (say, 'b')\n   - The center must be the same in both? Actually, the center is part of both diagonals, so the center must be equal to both 'a' and 'b'. Hence, the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\n But wait: the example input \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" is \"YES\". Let's check:\n\n   Main diagonal: [0][0] = 'w', [1][1] = 's', [2][2] = 'w' -> not the same! \n   However, the example says YES.\n\n Let me re-read the problem: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n This means that the entire diagonal must be the same. So the main diagonal must be one letter and the anti-diagonal must be one letter, but they don't necessarily have to be the same? \n\n But then the center is shared. So if the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b', then the center must be both 'a' and 'b'. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\n However, in the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\", the main diagonal is ['w','s','w'] -> not all the same. And the anti-diagonal is ['w','s','w'] -> not all the same. But the example says YES.\n\n Wait, let me read the example again: \n   Input: \n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n   The example output: YES.\n\n Now I see: the example input does not have the same letter on the main diagonal. \n\n Let me check the example provided in the problem statement: \n   Example Input: \n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n   Expected Output: \n        ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n So what is the issue? \n\n Condition for the diagonals: \n   The problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n But note: the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" has:\n   Main diagonal: first row first char 'w', second row second char 's', third row third char 'w' -> not the same.\n\n Then why is it YES?\n\n Let me read the problem again: \n   \"Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if: \n        on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; \n        all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n In the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\": \n   The main diagonal is not all the same, so condition fails.\n\n But wait, the example output is YES. \n\n There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n Let me check the sample test cases from the problem with the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\".\n\n Another possibility: the problem means that the entire diagonal should be the same, but note that the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" has the main diagonal as ['w','s','w'] which is not uniform.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the diagonals must be composed of the same letter, but the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" is actually not an X because the diagonals are not uniform? \n\n However, looking at the example, the letter X would have the same letter along the two diagonals. In fact, the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" does not have the same letter on the main diagonal. \n\n Let me draw:\n\n   Row0: w s w\n   Row1: s w s\n   Row2: w s w\n\n Now, the main diagonal: \n   (0,0): 'w', (1,1): 'w', (2,2): 'w'? Wait, no: the example input is:\n\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n But wait, the example input is given as:\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n So the matrix is:\n\n        [['w','s','w'],\n         ['s','w','s'],\n         ['w','s','w']]\n\n Now, the main diagonal is: \n        [0][0] = 'w', [1][1] = 'w', [2][2] = 'w' -> same letter 'w'\n\n Similarly, the anti-diagonal: \n        [0][2] = 'w', [1][1] = 'w', [2][0] = 'w' -> same letter 'w'\n\n Now, the other squares: \n        (0,1) = 's', (1,0) = 's', (1,2) = 's', (2,1) = 's'\n\n So the non-diagonal squares are all 's', which is different from 'w'. \n\n Therefore, the example satisfies the condition.\n\n What was my mistake? I misread the input. The input is:\n\n        Line0: \"wsw\" -> three characters: w, s, w\n        Line1: \"sws\" -> s, w, s\n        Line2: \"wsw\" -> w, s, w\n\n So the main diagonal is [w (from row0 col0), w (from row1 col1), w (from row2 col2)].\n\n Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n.\n 2. Read n lines, each line is a string of n characters.\n\n 3. Check the two diagonals:\n    - Let diag1 = [ grid[i][i] for i in range(n) ]\n    - Let diag2 = [ grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n) ]\n\n    For diag1, all characters must be the same.\n    For diag2, all characters must be the same.\n\n    But note: the center element is common to both, so the two diagonals must have the same letter? Actually, yes, because the center is the same in both.\n\n    However, the problem does not explicitly say that the two diagonals must have the same letter, but the center is part of both. So the entire diag1 must be the same, and the entire diag2 must be the same. Since the center is common, the entire diag1 and diag2 must be the same letter.\n\n    Example: if diag1 is all 'a', and diag2 is all 'b', then at the center (which is in both) we have grid[n//2][n//2] must be 'a' and 'b', so 'a' must equal 'b'.\n\n    Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\n 4. Check the non-diagonal positions:\n    - For every cell (i, j) that is not on the diagonal (i.e., i != j and i+j != n-1), the letter must be the same, and that letter must be different from the one found on the diagonal.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\". So all non-diagonal squares must be the same letter, and that letter must be different from the diagonal letter.\n\n    But wait: what if the entire grid is filled with the same letter? Then the non-diagonal squares are the same, but the diagonal is the same, so we must have two distinct letters: the diagonal letter and the non-diagonal letter.\n\n    So the condition is: \n        Let d = the letter that appears on the diagonal (which must be the same for both diagonals, because the center is common and the entire diag1 and diag2 are the same).\n\n        Then, for every non-diagonal cell (i, j):\n            grid[i][j] must be the same letter (say, 'x'), and 'x' must not be equal to d.\n\n        Additionally, the entire non-diagonal part must be that same letter.\n\n 5. However, note: the problem says \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\". So we don't care about the value of that letter, just that they are all the same and different from d.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Step 1: Read n and the grid.\n\n    Step 2: Extract the two diagonals and check if they are constant (same letter). Also, they must be the same letter.\n\n        diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n        diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n        If not all elements in diag1 are the same, then return \"NO\".\n        If not all elements in diag2 are the same, then return \"NO\".\n        Also, if the common letter for diag1 is not the same as the common letter for diag2, then return \"NO\". \n\n        Alternatively, we can check: \n          d1 = set(diag1)\n          d2 = set(diag2)\n\n        If len(d1) != 1 or len(d2) != 1, then \"NO\".\n\n        Then, if the element from d1 is not the same as the element from d2, then \"NO\".\n\n        Let d_letter = diag1[0] (since if there's only one, then diag1[0] is the letter, and similarly for diag2, but we already know they are the same)\n\n    Step 3: Check the non-diagonal cells.\n\n        non_diagonal_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                # Otherwise, this cell is non-diagonal\n                if non_diagonal_letter is None:\n                    non_diagonal_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diagonal_letter:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)  # or break appropriately\n\n        Then, we must also ensure that non_diagonal_letter is defined (meaning there's at least one non-diagonal cell) and that non_diagonal_letter != d_letter.\n\n    However, what if n=3? Then there are 9 cells, and the diagonal has 3, so non-diagonal has 6. We check all non-diagonals.\n\n    But wait: the above loop sets non_diagonal_letter from the first non-diagonal cell, then checks the rest. If we find any non-diagonal cell that is not that letter, then we break.\n\n    After the loops, we check: if non_diagonal_letter exists and non_diagonal_letter != d_letter.\n\n    However, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Then n=1? But n>=3, so we are safe.\n\n    But note: the problem says n>=3 and odd.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Step 2: Check diagonals.\n\n        Step 3: Check non-diagonals: \n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    if grid[i][j] != target_non_diagonal:\n                        break out and say NO.\n\n        But we don't know target_non_diagonal until we see one. So we need to set target_non_diagonal to the first non-diagonal cell we meet, and then verify the rest.\n\n        However, if we don't find any non-diagonal cell? Then n=1 is not possible (n>=3). So we can assume there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n    Alternatively, we can collect all non-diagonal letters and check they are the same and different from d_letter.\n\n    But the above approach is fine.\n\n    However, note: what if the grid is entirely the same letter? Then the diagonals are that same letter, and the non-diagonals are that same letter too. Then the condition fails because the non-diagonal letter must be different from the diagonal.\n\n    Example: \n        n=3, grid:\n            aaa\n            aaa\n            aaa\n\n        Diagonals: [a,a,a] -> valid, and anti-diagonal: [a,a,a] -> valid, and the two diagonals are the same. \n        Then we look at non-diagonals: they are all 'a'. So we require that the non-diagonal letter is different from 'a'. But it's the same -> fails.\n\n    So we must check that the non-diagonal letter is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        d_letter = diag1[0]   (since we know diag1 has all the same, and diag2 has the same as diag1)\n\n        non_diag_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_letter is None:\n                    non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit()\n\n        # Now, if we have set non_diag_letter, then check that non_diag_letter != d_letter.\n        if non_diag_letter is None:\n            # This means there were no non-diagonal cells. But for n>=3, there should be non-diagonal cells.\n            # Actually, when n=1, there are no non-diagonal, but n>=3. So we can skip.\n            # But in the problem, n>=3, so we don't have to worry about n=1.\n            # However, what if n=3? Then there are 6 non-diagonal cells, so non_diag_letter will be set.\n            pass\n\n        if non_diag_letter == d_letter:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\n        Otherwise, print \"YES\".\n\n    But wait, what if the grid has no non-diagonal cells? Actually, for n>=3, there are always non-diagonal cells.\n\n    However, let me check: n=3 -> total cells 9, diagonal has 3, so 6 non-diagonal. n=5 -> 25-8=17 non-diagonal.\n\n    So the code:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Extract diagonals\n        diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n        diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n        # Check if diag1 is all same\n        if len(set(diag1)) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n        if len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        d_letter = diag1[0]  # since set(diag1) has one element, we can use the first\n\n        # Check the two diagonals have the same letter\n        if set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Now, check the non-diagonal cells\n        non_diag_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_letter is None:\n                    non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n        # Now, if non_diag_letter is still None, then there are no non-diagonal cells. \n        # But for n>=3, this shouldn't happen. But let's handle it: \n        if non_diag_letter is None:\n            # According to the problem, n>=3, so this case should not occur. \n            # But if n==1, then we have no non-diagonal. Since n>=3, we don't expect this.\n            # However, if n==1, then the grid is 1x1, then the diagonal is the entire grid and there are no non-diagonal.\n            # But n>=3, so we can skip.\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if non_diag_letter == d_letter:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n But wait, the example \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" is expected to be \"NO\". \n\n Let me check with this example:\n\n        n=3\n        grid = \n            \"xpx\"\n            \"pxp\"\n            \"xpe\"\n\n        Diagonals:\n            diag1: [grid[0][0]='x', grid[1][1]='x', grid[2][2]='e'] -> set(diag1) = {'x','e'} -> size 2 -> invalid.\n\n        So we output \"NO\", which matches.\n\n    However, note: the example \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" is the third example and expected \"NO\".\n\n    But what if the diagonals are the same, but the non-diagonals are not? \n\n    Example: \n        n=3\n        grid = \n            \"aaa\"\n            \"aaa\"\n            \"aaa\"\n\n        Diagonals: set(diag1) = {'a'}, set(diag2) = {'a'} -> same. Then we check non-diagonals: we set non_diag_letter to the first non-diagonal, which is 'a'. Then we compare: non_diag_letter == d_letter -> 'a'=='a' -> NO.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    However, there is another possibility: the diagonals are the same, and the non-diagonals are the same, but the non-diagonals are the same as the diagonals? Then we output NO.\n\n    But what if the diagonals are the same, and the non-diagonals are the same and different? Then YES.\n\n    Example: \n        n=3\n        grid = \n            \"axa\"\n            \"axa\"\n            \"axa\"\n\n        Diagonals: \n            diag1: [a, x, a] -> set(diag1) = {'a','x'} -> invalid.\n\n    So we output NO.\n\n    But wait, what if the grid is:\n\n        n=3\n        grid = \n            \"aba\"\n            \"bab\"\n            \"aba\"\n\n        Diagonals: \n            diag1: [a, b, a] -> set = {'a','b'} -> invalid.\n\n    So we output NO.\n\n    But what if the grid is:\n\n        n=3\n        grid = \n            \"aaa\"\n            \"aaa\"\n            \"aaa\"\n\n        We output NO.\n\n    And the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" is YES.\n\n    One more example: \n\n        n=3\n        grid = \n            \"bbb\"\n            \"bbc\"\n            \"bbb\"\n\n        Diagonals: \n            diag1: [b, b, b] -> same.\n            diag2: [b, b, b] -> same.\n\n        Then we check non-diagonals: \n            (0,1): 'b' -> set non_diag_letter = 'b'\n            (0,2): skip (diagonal)\n            (1,0): 'b' -> same as non_diag_letter -> ok.\n            (1,2): 'c' -> not same -> NO.\n\n    So that's correct.\n\n    However, note: the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" is:\n\n        grid = \n            \"wsw\"\n            \"sws\"\n            \"wsw\"\n\n        Diagonals: \n            diag1: [w, w, w] -> same.\n            diag2: [w, w, w] -> same.\n\n        Then non-diagonals: \n            (0,1): 's', (0,2): skip, (1,0): 's', (1,2): 's', (2,0): skip, (2,1): 's'\n\n        So non_diag_letter is 's', and d_letter is 'w'.

The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The first line contains an odd integer `n` (the size of the grid), followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each.\n2. **Check Diagonals:** \n   - **Main Diagonal:** Extract characters from positions `(i, i)` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal:** Extract characters from positions `(i, n-1-i)` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.\n   - Ensure all characters in both diagonals are the same and that both diagonals have the same character.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells:** \n   - All non-diagonal cells must contain the same character, which is different from the diagonal character.\n4. **Output Result:** If all conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n    diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n    \n    if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    d_letter = diag1[0]\n    \n    non_diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if non_diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        if non_diag_letter == d_letter:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code starts by reading the integer `n` (grid size) and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check:** The main diagonal (`diag1`) consists of elements where the row and column indices are the same. The anti-diagonal (`diag2`) consists of elements where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`. Both diagonals must have identical characters, and these characters must be the same for both diagonals.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check:** For cells not on either diagonal, all must be the same character, and this character must differ from the diagonal character. The code checks each cell, setting the first encountered non-diagonal character and verifying subsequent cells match it.\n4. **Result Output:** If all checks pass, the grid forms an \"X\" and \"YES\" is printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed. The solution efficiently handles edge cases, such as grids where non-diagonal cells might be absent (though the problem constraints ensure `n >= 3`).",
