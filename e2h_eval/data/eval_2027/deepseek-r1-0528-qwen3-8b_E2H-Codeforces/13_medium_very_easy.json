For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (tone index) in a 12-note circle.\n    Let's assign:\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 11   [Note: In some systems, H is B, but here we see two different names?

So after H (which is 11) comes C (0).\n\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we can generate all permutations of the three notes and check for the major and minor conditions.\n\n Conditions for major: \n    There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        distance(X, Y) = 4 semitones\n        distance(Y, Z) = 3 semitones\n\n Conditions for minor:\n        distance(X, Y) = 3 semitones\n        distance(Y, Z) = 4 semitones\n\n 3. How to calculate the distance between two notes?\n    We have two directions: forward and backward (since the circle is cyclic). The problem states that the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, but in the example, the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (meaning going backward: E->D->C, which is 2 steps? Wait, let me clarify:\n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". But if we have a circle of 12, the direct forward distance from E to C would be: \n        E (4) -> F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10), H(11), C(0) -> that's 8 steps (each step is 1 semitone). Alternatively, the backward distance from E to C is 4 (going from E to D, then C) but that would be 2 semitones (because E to D is 1 semitone? Actually, no: E to D is 1 semitone? Wait, the notes are consecutive: E, F, so from E to F is 1 semitone, but from E to D is not consecutive.\n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we consider the smallest circular distance that goes upward? Or actually, they say \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\" meaning we take the positive direction (which in music is upward). However, note the example: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". This implies that they are measuring the upward distance from E to C, which in a 12-tone system is 8 semitones (because E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, ... until C is 8).\n\n    But wait, the example also says: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones\", which is the other way.\n\n    Clarification: the problem states that the distance is measured from the lowest to the highest. So when we have two notes, we should consider the two possible ways: \n        Option 1: from the lower note to the higher note (without wrapping) or with wrapping?\n\n    However, note: \n        Example: \"between C and E\" is 4 semitones. C is 0, E is 4: 4-0 = 4.\n        Example: \"between E and C\" is 8 semitones. But if we consider E (4) and C (0), then if we go from E to C without wrapping, we cannot because 0 < 4. So we wrap: 12 - (4-0) = 8.\n\n    Therefore, the distance from note a to note b (if we are going upward) is:\n        diff = (b_index - a_index) % 12\n        But if the result is negative, we adjust by adding 12 and then mod 12? Actually, we want the positive distance along the circle from a to b in the upward direction (which is the minimal nonnegative steps). However, the problem does not specify minimal, it says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are going upward and if we cross the boundary we continue.\n\n    Actually, the example: from E to C is 8 semitones. So the rule is: \n        If we have two notes a and b, the distance from a to b (without crossing the octave) is (b - a) if b >= a, but if b < a then we do (b + 12 - a). \n\n    Alternatively, we can compute:\n        dist_forward = (b - a) % 12\n        But wait, if a=4 (E) and b=0 (C), then (0-4) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8 (in Python, negative modulo gives positive). So we can use modulo arithmetic.\n\n    However, the problem says: the distance from the lowest to the highest. But in the example, they say \"the distance between E and C is 8\", meaning they are considering E as the starting point and then going up to C (which is the next C). So the distance from E to C is 8. But note: in the chord condition, the ordering must be such that the distances are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). And the entire chord spans 7 semitones (for major) because 4+3=7.\n\n    How do we interpret the condition? We have three notes. We need to arrange them in increasing order (by the tone index, wrapping around the circle? Actually, the problem doesn't specify linear order, but the circle is cyclic. However, the condition is defined by the distances: 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n    Important: The condition requires an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distances from X to Y and Y to Z (in the same direction) are as given. But note: the circle is cyclic and we are allowed to start anywhere. However, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n    The musical scale goes upward. So we can think of the notes as arranged in a circle, but we can break the circle at any point and consider the linear sequence. However, the condition must hold in the upward direction.\n\n    Steps for checking a permutation (x, y, z):\n\n        Condition for major:\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12   [but we want the positive distance, and note that we might have to consider the circle]\n            However, the problem doesn't specify whether the entire chord must be contained in one octave? Actually, the chord is an unordered set, so we can consider the circle.\n\n        But note: the condition is defined by two consecutive distances: from x to y and y to z, and the entire span from x to z must be 7 semitones. However, if we have three notes, the entire chord might not necessarily be contiguous in one octave. But the problem says: the chord is an unordered set and we consider the circle.\n\n        Actually, the definition of the chord is independent of the octave. We only care about the semitones between the notes.\n\n        However, the problem states: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n        So we have to define the distance from a to b as the smallest nonnegative number of semitones to go from a to b in the upward direction? But wait, the example: from E to C is 8, not the minimal (which would be 4 downward, but they don't consider downward). The problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are always going upward.\n\n        Therefore, the distance from a to b is:\n            Let d = (b - a) % 12\n            But if d is negative, we add 12. Then we get a value between 0 and 11.\n\n        However, wait: the example: from C to E: (4-0)=4 -> correct.\n        From E to C: (0-4) % 12 = 8 (because 0-4 = -4, then -4 % 12 = 8 in Python). So that matches.\n\n        Now, condition for major: \n            We require two consecutive distances (in the ordering) of 4 and 3. But note: the entire chord must form a contiguous segment? Not necessarily, but the condition is defined by the two adjacent intervals.\n\n        However, the problem says: the set {X, Y, Z} must be ordered so that the distances are 4 and 3. This ordering is cyclic? Actually, no: the condition is linear: we break the circle and have an ordering.\n\n        But wait: what if we have the notes [C, E, G]? \n            Ordering: C, E, G: \n                C to E: 4, E to G: 3 -> major.\n\n        What if we have the notes [G, B, D] (which is a G major)? \n            Ordering: G, B, D? \n                G to B: \n                    G is 7, B is 10 -> (10-7)=3 -> not 4 or 3 for the first condition.\n\n        Actually, we must consider the circle. The problem says: the notes are repeated cyclically. So we can break the circle arbitrarily.\n\n        Alternate approach: since the chord is defined by three distinct notes (and the problem says the chord is an unordered set of three notes), we can consider the circle and the gaps between the notes.\n\n        However, the problem's example of minor: \"C# B F\" becomes \"B C# F\": \n            B: 10, C#: 1, F: 5.\n\n        How do we order these on the circle? We can break the circle at B and then go: B, then C# (which is the next note after B, because 1 is the next index? Actually, we have to arrange the three notes in increasing order (with wrap-around considered). \n\n        But note: the condition is defined by consecutive distances. We can consider the three notes and their positions. We can also consider the three possible rotations.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n        This ordering must be such that the three notes are consecutive in the ordering and the entire chord is contained in the circle.\n\n        Another idea: \n            We can map the three notes to three points on the circle (each point is a semitone). Then, we can sort the three points. Then, we can consider two possibilities: \n                Possibility 1: the chord is in the segment [0, 12)\n                Possibility 2: the chord wraps around.\n\n        But note: the circle has 12 tones, and the chord is three distinct tones.\n\n        Steps for one chord:\n\n          Step 1: Convert the three notes to numbers (0 to 11).\n          Step 2: Generate all 6 permutations of the three numbers.\n\n          For each permutation (a, b, c):\n            Condition for major: \n                d1 = (b - a) % 12   -> must be 4\n                d2 = (c - b) % 12   -> must be 3\n\n            Condition for minor:\n                d1 = (b - a) % 12   -> must be 3\n                d2 = (c - b) % 12   -> must be 4\n\n          However, wait: the modulus operation might give a negative? Actually, we can compute the distance from a to b as (b - a) % 12, but if (b - a) is negative, then (b - a) % 12 will give a positive value. But note: the modulus operation in music: we want the positive distance in the circle. However, the problem defines the distance from the lowest to the highest, meaning we are going upward. So even if we cross the boundary, we count the entire circle.\n\n          But note: the example: from E (4) to C (0): (0-4) % 12 = 8, which is the upward distance (because we go from E to F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C: 8 steps).\n\n          However, we must consider that the condition requires the entire set of three notes to be in the order (a, b, c) without skipping any note in between? Actually, the chord is defined by the set, so there might be notes missing. But the condition is just about the consecutive distances.\n\n          But wait: the example \"C E G\" is a major triad. The set is {0,4,7}. \n            Ordering: 0,4,7: \n                (4-0)%12 = 4, (7-4)%12 = 3 -> major.\n\n          Example minor: \"C# B F\": {1,10,5}. The example orders as \"B C# F\": which is 10,1,5. But wait, how do we order these? \n            We have to arrange the three numbers in the circle. \n\n          However, note: the problem says we can order the notes arbitrarily (meaning we can choose the starting note and then go in the upward direction). So we must consider the circle.\n\n          Alternate: we can break the circle at the note that is the lowest in the usual linear representation? But the circle is cyclic. \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let the three numbers be a, b, c.\n\n            We can consider the circle and the gaps. But the condition requires two consecutive distances (in the same direction) of 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n          However, note that the entire chord must be contained in an interval of 7 semitones? Because 4+3=7. But wait, the example \"C# B F\": \n            When ordered as B, C#, F: \n                B (10) to C# (1): the distance is (1-10)%12 = (1-10) = -9 %12 = 3? \n                Then from C# (1) to F (5): (5-1)=4.\n\n            But wait, that gives 3 and 4, so minor.\n\n          However, the example input is given as \"C# B F\", and we are told to output \"minor\".\n\n          But why did they order as \"B C# F\"? Because we are allowed to start at any note. So we are effectively breaking the circle at B and then going forward.\n\n          So the algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Map the input notes to numbers (0 to 11).\n\n            Step 2: Generate all 6 permutations of the three numbers.\n\n            Step 3: For each permutation (x, y, z):\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12   [This is the upward distance from x to y, which is the same as (y-x) if y>=x, else (y-x+12)]\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n                Then check if (d1 == 4 and d2 == 3) -> then this permutation is a major triad.\n                Or if (d1 == 3 and d2 == 4) -> then this permutation is a minor triad.\n\n            Step 4: If we found at least one permutation that satisfies major, output \"major\".\n                     Else if we found at least one permutation that satisfies minor, output \"minor\".\n                     Otherwise, output \"strange\".\n\n          However, note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so a chord is either major, minor, or strange.\n\n          But wait: what if a chord satisfies both? The problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", so we don't have to worry.\n\n          Example: is there a chord that is both? \n            Conditions: \n              Major: d1=4, d2=3 -> total span from x to z is 7.\n              Minor: d1=3, d2=4 -> total span from x to z is 7.\n\n            But the entire set of three notes must be the same? The three notes are fixed. In the major condition, the intervals are 4 and 3 (so the third note is 7 semitones above the first). In the minor condition, the intervals are 3 and 4 (so the third note is 7 semitones above the first as well). \n\n            However, the intermediate note is different: \n              Major: first note to second: 4, then 3 -> so the second note is 4 above the first, the third is 7 above the first.\n              Minor: first note to second: 3, then 4 -> so the second note is 3 above the first, the third is 7 above the first.\n\n            Therefore, the set of notes must be the same, but the ordering is different. However, the set of notes for major and minor are the same if the two triads share the same root and the same third (which is 7 semitones above) but the fifth is determined by the root and the third? Actually, no: the fifth is the next one. \n\n            But note: the entire set of notes is {x, x+4, x+7} for major, and {x, x+3, x+7} for minor. These sets are different unless 4==3 (which they aren't). So the sets are different.\n\n            However, wait: the circle is modulo 12. Consider:\n\n            Example: \n              Major: root C (0), then 0+4=4 (E), then 0+7=7 (G). Set: {0,4,7}\n              Minor: root C (0), then 0+3=3 (D#), then 0+7=7 (G). Set: {0,3,7}\n\n            These are different sets.\n\n            Another example: \n              Major: root C (0), then E(4), then G(7)\n              Minor: root D (2), then F(5), then A(9): {2,5,9}. \n\n            So the sets are distinct.\n\n          But wait, the example \"C# B F\": \n            Notes: C# (1), B (10), F (5). \n            They are mapped to: [1, 10, 5]\n\n            One permutation: [10, 1, 5] -> \n                d1 = (1-10)%12 = (1-10) = -9 %12 = 3\n                d2 = (5-1)%12 = 4 -> minor.\n\n            Another permutation: [1, 10, 5]: \n                d1 = (10-1)%12 = 9 -> not 3 or 4.\n                d2 = (5-10)%12 = (5-10) = -5 %12 = 7 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n            Another permutation: [1, 5, 10]: \n                d1 = (5-1)=4, d2=(10-5)=5 -> no.\n\n            Another: [5,1,10]: \n                d1=(1-5)%12 = (1-5) = -4 %12=8, d2=(10-1)=9 -> no.\n\n            Another: [5,10,1]:\n                d1=(10-5)=5, d2=(1-10)%12=3 -> no.\n\n            Another: [10,5,1]:\n                d1=(5-10)%12= (5-10)= -5%12=7, d2=(1-5)%12= (1-5)=-4%12=8 -> no.\n\n            So only one permutation works.\n\n          Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. We are generating all permutations. But the set of three distinct notes has 6 permutations.\n\n          Implementation:\n\n            Note mapping:\n                mapping = {\n                    'C': 0,\n                    'C#': 1, 'Db': 1,   # but the problem only uses the given notation, so we assume the input uses the given names: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n                    'D': 2,\n                    'D#': 3,\n                    'E': 4,\n                    'F': 5,\n                    'F#': 6,\n                    'G': 7,\n                    'G#': 8,\n                    'A': 9,\n                    'B': 10,\n                    'H': 11\n                }\n\n            But wait: the example input uses 'B' and 'H'. According to the problem, the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n            So we don't have Db, etc. Only the ones listed.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                s = input().split()\n                Then convert each note to a number.\n\n            Example: \n                Input: \"C E G\" -> ['C','E','G'] -> [0,4,7]\n\n            Then, we generate all permutations of the list [0,4,7].\n\n            For each permutation (x,y,z):\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n                But wait: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python: \n                    (-9) % 12 -> 3, which is correct.\n\n            However, note: the condition for the entire chord: the three notes must be distinct. We assume they are.\n\n          Let's test with \"C E G\":\n            Permutations: \n                (0,4,7): d1 = (4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major found.\n\n          Then we break and output \"major\".\n\n          But wait: we must check all permutations? Actually, we can break early if we find one. However, we must check for both major and minor? Actually, the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we can stop as soon as we find one that matches. But note: we must check for both conditions separately.\n\n          However, we can do:\n\n            found_major = False\n            found_minor = False\n\n            for perm in permutations(notes_as_numbers):\n                x, y, z = perm\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    found_major = True\n                if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    found_minor = True\n\n            Then, if found_major: print(\"major\")\n            elif found_minor: print(\"minor\")\n            else: print(\"strange\")\n\n          But wait: what if we have a permutation that is major and another that is minor? The sets are different, so that won't happen. But the same set of three notes cannot be both major and minor because the set for major is {x, x+4, x+7} and for minor is {x, x+3, x+7} and these sets are different.\n\n          However, note: the set of three notes might be the same for two different roots? No, because the set is fixed.\n\n          Example: {0,4,7} is the set for C major. {0,3,7} is the set for C minor (if we consider the root at 0) but also could be considered with a different root? \n\n          Actually, the set {0,3,7} is the same as {0,3,7}. But the condition for major/minor is defined by the ordering. \n\n          However, the problem says: the chord is an unordered set. The definition of major and minor depends on the ordering (the root). \n\n          But note: the problem does not specify which note is the root. The condition says: \"If we can order the notes so as...\" meaning we can choose any note as the root.\n\n          However, the entire set must satisfy the condition for one root. \n\n          Example: {0,3,7} (C minor) can be ordered as (0,3,7) -> minor, or (3,7,0) -> \n            d1 = (7-3)%12 = 4, d2 = (0-7)%12 = (0-7) = -7 %12 = 5 -> not minor or major.\n          Or (7,0,3): \n            d1 = (0-7)%12 = 5, d2=(3-0)%12=3 -> no.\n\n          So only one ordering (0,3,7) is minor.\n\n          Similarly, for {0,4,7} (C major) only one ordering (0,4,7) is major.\n\n          Therefore, we can break once we find one.\n\n          But note: we must check all permutations because one set might have two different orderings that yield two different conditions? Actually, no: the set is fixed and the condition is very specific.\n\n          However, the problem says: the chord is unambiguous. So we can break early if we find one condition, but we must check for the other condition only if we didn't find the first.\n\n          But the problem says: the answer is unambiguous, so a chord is either major, minor, or strange. So if we find a major, we don't need to check for minor (because the problem says no chord is both). Similarly, if we find a minor, we don't need to check for major.\n\n          However, we don't know which one is found first. But we can break early only if we know that we have found the chord type. But note: we must check all permutations because the same chord might be represented by multiple roots? Actually, no: the set is fixed.\n\n          But wait: what if the chord is {0,4,7} and we try the permutation (4,7,0): \n            d1 = (7-4)=3, d2=(0-7)%12=5 -> no.\n\n          So we must check all permutations.\n\n          However, we can optimize: once we find a major, we can break and output \"major\". Similarly for minor.\n\n          But the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n          However, to be safe, we can do:\n\n            major_found = False\n            minor_found = False\n\n            for perm in permutations(notes_as_numbers):\n                x, y, z = perm\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    major_found = True\n                    break   # we can break because the problem says unambiguous, so we don't need to check further\n                if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    minor_found = True\n                    break\n\n            Then, if major_found: print(\"major\")\n            elif minor_found: print(\"minor\")\n            else: print(\"strange\")\n\n          But wait: what if the chord is both? The problem says it's unambiguous, so we assume not. But the sets for major and minor are different, so the same set of three notes cannot be both. \n\n          However, let me check: \n            Major condition: d1=4, d2=3 -> so the entire chord spans 7 semitones (from x to z) and the intermediate is 4 above x.\n            Minor condition: d1=3, d2=4 -> the entire chord spans 7 semitones and the intermediate is 3 above x.\n\n          The set for major: {x, x+4, x+7}\n          The set for minor: {x, x+3, x+7}\n\n          For the set to be the same: {x, x+4, x+7} = {x, x+3, x+7} -> then we must have x+4 = x+3 (mod12) -> 4=3 mod12 -> false.\n\n          So indeed, the sets are different.\n\n          However, we are iterating over the same set of three numbers. The set of three numbers for major and minor are different. So we are checking the same set of three numbers for both conditions? \n\n          But wait: the input is fixed. The set of three numbers is fixed. We are generating all permutations of that fixed set.\n\n          Example: input set {0,4,7} (C major) cannot be {0,3,7} (C minor) at the same time.\n\n          Therefore, we can break as soon as we find one condition.\n\n          But wait: what if the same set of three notes can be interpreted as two different chords by choosing a different root? \n\n          Example: Consider the set {0,3,7}. This is C minor (root at 0). But can we also interpret it as a major chord with a different root? \n\n          Condition for major: \n            We need to find a root such that the intervals are 4 and 3. \n\n            Let the root be 3: then the next note must be 3+4=7, then 3+7=10. But 10 is not in the set {0,3,7}. \n\n            Let the root be 7: then 7+4=11, 7+7=2 -> not in the set.\n\n            Let the root be 0: then 0+4=4 -> not in the set.\n\n          So the set {0,3,7} is only minor.\n\n          Similarly, the set {0,4,7} is only major.\n\n          Therefore, we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n          However, note: the set of three notes might be the same as a set that is both? Actually, we have proved that the sets are different.\n\n          But wait: what if the set is {0,4,7} and we are checking the permutation (0,4,7) -> major, then we break. Then we don't check the rest. That's okay.\n\n          But what if the set is {0,4,7} and the permutation (0,4,7) fails because of modulus? It shouldn't.\n\n          However, there's a catch: the modulus operation. The condition for major is d1=4 and d2=3. But what if the distance from x to y is 4, but from y to z is 11 (because the circle wraps)? \n\n          Actually, we are using the modulus operation to compute the upward distance. The condition is defined by the upward distance.\n\n          But note: the entire chord must be contained in the circle. The condition does not require the chord to be within one octave, but the distances are computed modulo 12. \n\n          However, the condition for the major chord: \n            The set {0,4,7}: \n                Ordering (0,4,7): \n                    d1 = 4, d2=3 -> valid.\n\n          But what if we have the set {0,4,1}? \n            Ordering (0,1,4): \n                d1 = (1-0)=1, d2=(4-1)=3 -> not major.\n            Ordering (0,4,1): \n                d1 = (4-0)=4, d2=(1-4)%12 = (1-4)=-3 %12=9 -> not 3.\n            Ordering (1,0,4): \n                d1 = (0-1)%12=11, d2=(4-0)=4 -> no.\n            Ordering (1,4,0): \n                d1=(4-1)=3, d2=(0-4)%12=8 -> no.\n            Ordering (4,0,1): \n                d1=(0-4)%12=8, d2=(1-0)=1 -> no.\n            Ordering (4,1,0): \n                d1=(1-4)%12=9, d2=(0-1)%12=11 -> no.\n\n          So {0,4,1} is strange.\n\n          Now, let's test with the provided examples:\n\n          Example 1: \"C E G\" -> [0,4,7] -> major.\n\n          Example 2: \"C# B F\" -> [1,10,5] -> minor.\n\n          Example 3: \"A B H\" -> [9,10,11] -> \n            Check permutations:\n\n            (9,10,11): d1=(10-9)=1, d2=(11-10)=1 -> no.\n            (9,11,10): d1=(11-9)=2, d2=(10-11)%12= (10-11)=-1%12=11 -> no.\n            (10,9,11): d1=(9-10)%12= (9-10)=-1%12=11, d2=(11-9)=2 -> no.\n            (10,11,9): d1=(11-10)=1, d2=(9-11)%12= (9-11)=-2%12=10 -> no.\n            (11,9,10): d1=(9-11)%12= (9-11)=-2%12=10, d2=(10-9)=1 -> no.\n            (11,10,9): d1=(10-11)%12= (10-11)=-1%12=11, d2=(9-10)%12=11 -> no.\n\n          So output \"strange\", which matches.\n\n          However, wait: the example input is \"A B H\", and the output is \"strange\".\n\n          But note: the example input is given as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] and expected output ['major', 'minor', 'strange'].\n\n          Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n          One more edge: the set of three notes that are equally spaced? \n\n          Example: {0,4,8} (C, E, G#) -> \n            Ordering (0,4,8): d1=4, d2=4 -> not major or minor.\n            Ordering (0,8,4): d1=(8-0)=8, d2=(4-8)%12= (4-8)=-4%12=8 -> no.\n            ... we'll check all and none will match.\n\n          So we output \"strange\".\n\n          Code:\n\n            import itertools\n\n            # Build mapping dictionary\n            note_to_num = {\n                'C': 0,\n                'C#': 1,\n                'D': 2,\n                'D#': 3,\n                'E': 4,\n                'F': 5,\n                'F#': 6,\n                'G': 7,\n                'G#': 8,\n                'A': 9,\n                'B': 10,\n                'H': 11\n            }\n\n            s = input().strip().split()\n            nums = [note_to_num[note] for note in s]\n\n            # Generate all permutations of the three numbers\n            perms = itertools.permutations(nums)\n\n            found_major = False\n            found_minor = False\n\n            for p in perms:\n                x, y, z = p\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    found_major = True\n                    break\n                if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    found_minor = True\n                    break\n\n            if found_major:\n                print(\"major\")\n            elif found_minor:\n                print(\"minor\")\n            else:\n                print(\"strange\")\n\n          Let me run the example \"C E",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number (0 to 11) based on its position in the 12-note musical scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations (orderings) to check every possible sequence.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes in the upward direction (considering the circular nature of the musical scale). A major chord requires the first interval to be 4 semitones and the second interval to be 3 semitones. A minor chord requires the first interval to be 3 semitones and the second interval to be 4 semitones.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation satisfies the major chord condition, output \"major\". If any permutation satisfies the minor chord condition, output \"minor\". If neither condition is met by any permutation, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_num = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().split()\n    nums = [note_to_num[note] for note in s]\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for p in itertools.permutations(nums):\n        x, y, z = p\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n            break\n            \n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            break\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The dictionary `note_to_num` maps each note to its corresponding number (e.g., 'C' maps to 0, 'C#' to 1, etc.).\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their numerical representations.\n3. **Permutation Check**: The code generates all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, it calculates the distances between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Chord Condition Check**: The code checks if the distances between the notes in the current permutation match the criteria for a major chord (4 and 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 and 4 semitones). If either condition is met, the corresponding flag is set, and the loop breaks early.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the flags set during the permutation check, the code outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if no valid chord configuration is found.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible note orderings to determine the chord type, leveraging permutation generation and modular arithmetic to handle the circular musical scale.",
