The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n Conditions: \n   The plate is w x h.\n   We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), the second 2 cells away, etc.\n   Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n How to compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n   The i-th ring is defined on a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n   But note: the ring itself is the border of this inner rectangle (with width 1). \n\n   The number of cells in a border (if the rectangle has dimensions n x m) is:\n      If n == 1 and m == 1: then 1\n      Otherwise, if we have a rectangle that is at least 2x2, then the border is:\n          top and bottom: each has m cells, so 2*m\n          left and right: but subtract the corners because they are already counted: each side has n-2 cells, so 2*(n-2)\n          total = 2*m + 2*(n-2) = 2*(m + n - 2)\n\n   However, note the problem says: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) × (h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n   So for the i-th ring, let:\n        n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   Then the number of cells in the i-th ring is: \n        If n_i <= 0 or m_i <= 0: then this ring doesn't exist. But by the input constraint, k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so the rings we consider will be valid.\n\n   However, note: the formula for the ring must account for the fact that if the inner rectangle becomes 1x? or ?x1, then we cannot use the same formula.\n\n   Actually, the formula for the border of an n_i x m_i rectangle is:\n        If n_i == 1 and m_i == 1: 1\n        Else if n_i == 1 or m_i == 1: then it's just m_i (if n_i==1) or n_i (if m_i==1) because you can only have a single row or column.\n        But wait: our formula 2*(n_i + m_i - 2) breaks for 1x?.\n\n   Let's test with 1x5: \n        Using the formula: 2*(1+5-2)=2*4=8 -> but the border of 1x5 should be 5 (since there's only one row, then the entire row is the border).\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the border as:\n        total = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4   [because the four corners are shared by two edges]\n\n   But wait, that's the same as 2*(n_i + m_i - 2). \n\n   However, for 1x5: \n        n_i=1, m_i=5 -> 2*(1+5-2)=8, which is wrong.\n\n   Actually, the border of a 1x5 is just the entire 5 cells. Similarly, the border of a 5x1 is 5.\n\n   So the correct way is: the border is the outer perimeter minus the inner part (but there is no inner part for a ring of width 1). Actually, the ring is exactly the border.\n\n   We can break down the border into four sides, but when the rectangle is degenerate (like 1x something) then:\n\n        If n_i >= 2 and m_i >= 2: then the border is 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n        If n_i == 1: then the entire rectangle is the border, so m_i cells.\n        If m_i == 1: then the entire rectangle is the border, so n_i cells.\n\n   But note: the problem states that the plate is at least 3x3 and k is bounded so that the rings we consider are valid until the inner rectangle has positive dimensions.\n\n   However, we must consider that the condition for k is that k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 1x1? Actually, the smallest dimension of the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is:\n        min_dimension = min(w, h) - 4*(k-1)\n        Since k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), then 4*(k-1) <= min(w, h)-1, so the inner rectangle has at least 2x2? Actually, the condition is:\n\n        k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) \n        => 4*k - 4 <= min(w, h) - 1   [if we multiply by 4 and adjust, but note: floor division]\n\n   However, let's check with the example: \n        Input: \"3 3 1\" -> k=1, then min(w,h)=3, floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> valid.\n\n        For k=1, the inner rectangle is (3) x (3). Then the border of a 3x3 is 8.\n\n   But note: the formula for the border of a 3x3: \n        Using the standard border formula: 2*(3+3-2)=2*4=8 -> correct.\n\n   Now, what if we have a 1x1? The problem says the plate is at least 3x3, but we might get an inner rectangle of 1x1? \n\n   According to the constraint, k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). For w=3, h=3: k_max=1. Then for k=1, we get an inner rectangle of 3x3. \n\n   But what if we have a larger plate and k is such that the inner rectangle becomes 1x1? \n\n   Example: w=5, h=5, then k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1. So we don't get to k=2.\n\n   However, if we had w=7, h=7: k_max = floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2.\n\n        For k=1: inner rectangle is 7x7 -> border = 2*(7+7-2)=2*12=24.\n        For k=2: inner rectangle is 7-4=3x3 -> border = 8.\n\n        Total = 24+8 = 32.\n\n   But wait, the example input: \"7 9 1\" -> output 28, and \"7 9 2\" -> output 40.\n\n   Let me compute for \"7 9 1\":\n        w=7, h=9, k=1.\n        inner rectangle: 7x9.\n        border = 2*(7+9-2)=2*14=28 -> matches.\n\n   Now \"7 9 2\":\n        First ring: 7x9 -> 28\n        Second ring: inner rectangle = (7-4)=3, (9-4)=5 -> 3x5.\n        border of 3x5: 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12.\n        Total = 28+12 = 40 -> matches.\n\n   But wait, the example input \"7 9 2\" gives 40, which is correct.\n\n   However, note that the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. Our calculation for the second ring uses the inner rectangle of (w-4*(2-1)) x (h-4*(2-1)) = (7-4) x (9-4)=3x5.\n\n   But wait, the example picture: the third example (which is 7x9 with 2 rings) is described. \n\n   However, the example input \"3 3 1\" gives 8, which is correct.\n\n   But what about a degenerate case? The problem says w, h>=3 and k is bounded so that the inner rectangle has positive dimensions? Actually, the condition is that the inner rectangle must have at least one cell? \n\n   However, the condition for k is: k <= floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). \n\n   Let me check the example: w=5, h=5, k=1: \n        inner rectangle: 5x5 -> border = 2*(5+5-2)=16.\n\n   Now, what if we have w=5, h=5, k=2? \n        Condition: k<=floor((5+1)/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed. \n\n   Therefore, we don't have to worry about negative dimensions or zero.\n\n   But wait: the condition says k is at least 1 and at most that value. So we are safe.\n\n   However, what if the inner rectangle becomes 1x? \n\n   Example: w=5, h=9, k=2: \n        Condition: k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed.\n\n   So we never get to a point where the inner rectangle has dimension less than 2? \n\n   Let me check: \n        The condition for k is: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n        Then the smallest dimension for the k-th ring is: min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - 4*(floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)-1)\n\n        We know that floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) is the maximum k. \n\n        Then the minimal dimension in the k-th ring is: min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - 4*(floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)-1) \n\n        But note: 4*k <= min(w, h)+1 (from the condition k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) implies 4*k <= min(w, h)+1 + 3? Actually, floor division: \n\n        Let m = min(w, h)\n        k_max = floor((m+1)/4)\n        Then 4*k_max <= m+1, so 4*(k-1) <= 4*k_max-4 <= m+1-4 = m-3\n\n        Therefore, the inner rectangle's dimension is at least m - (m-3) = 3? \n\n        Actually, wait: \n            We have: 4*k_max <= m+1, then 4*k_max - 4 <= m+1-4 = m-3.\n            Then the inner rectangle's smallest dimension is m - 4*(k-1) >= m - (m-3) = 3.\n\n        So the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 3 in the smallest dimension.\n\n   Therefore, we always have a rectangle of at least 3x? (and since the smallest dimension is at least 3, then both dimensions are at least 3? Actually, no: the smallest dimension is min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) and we showed that this is at least 3.\n\n   So we are guaranteed that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 3 in the smallest dimension. Then the border formula 2*(n_i+m_i-2) is always valid because both n_i and m_i are at least 3, so the rectangle is at least 3x3.\n\n   However, wait: the condition was on the minimum of w and h. But the other dimension could be smaller? \n\n   Actually, the inner rectangle is (w-4*(k-1)) x (h-4*(k-1)). The condition was derived from the minimum dimension, so the inner rectangle's minimum dimension is at least 3. But what if w is large and h is small? \n\n        Example: w=100, h=5, then k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1. Then the inner rectangle for k=1 is 100-0 x 5-0 = 100x5. The smallest dimension is 5 (which is >=3). \n\n   So the condition ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has both dimensions at least 3? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        Then the smallest dimension of the inner rectangle is: min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - 4*(floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)-1) >= 3 (as above).\n\n        But note: the other dimension (the maximum) is at least as big as the smallest dimension. \n\n   Therefore, for every ring i (from 1 to k) the inner rectangle has dimensions (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)), and the smallest dimension is at least 3 (for the k-th ring) and for the first ring it's min(w, h) which is at least 3.\n\n   So we can safely use the formula for the border: 2*(a+b-2) for a = w-4*(i-1), b = h-4*(i-1).\n\n   Then the answer is the sum for i from 1 to k of: 2*((w-4*(i-1)) + (h-4*(i-1)) - 2)\n\n   Simplify: \n        For the i-th ring: \n            a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            cells_i = 2*(a_i + b_i - 2) = 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2) ?\n\n        Actually: 2*(a_i + b_i - 2) = 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2) ? \n\n        Let me expand: \n            a_i + b_i = w + h - 8*(i-1) ??? \n\n        No: \n            a_i + b_i = (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h - 4*(i-1)) = w+h - 8*(i-1)\n\n        Then: cells_i = 2*(w+h - 8*(i-1) - 2) = 2*(w+h-2) - 16*(i-1)\n\n   Then the total is: \n        Sum_{i=1}^{k} [2*(w+h-2) - 16*(i-1)]\n\n        = k * 2*(w+h-2) - 16 * (0 + 1 + ... + (k-1))\n        = 2*k*(w+h-2) - 16 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n\n        = 2*k*(w+h-2) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n   Let me test with the example \"3 3 1\":\n        w=3, h=3, k=1.\n        = 2*1*(3+3-2) - 8*1*0 = 2*1*4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n   Example \"7 9 1\": \n        w=7, h=9, k=1.\n        = 2*1*(7+9-2) - 0 = 2*14 = 28 -> correct.\n\n   Example \"7 9 2\":\n        w=7, h=9, k=2.\n        = 2*2*(7+9-2) - 8*2*1 = 4*14 - 16 = 56-16 = 40 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        total = 2*k*(w+h-2) - 8*k*(k-1)//2 * 2? Wait, let me check the derivation again.\n\n   Actually, I had: \n        = 2*k*(w+h-2) - 8*k*(k-1)   [But wait, the second term was 16 * (sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i) = 16 * (k*(k-1)//2) = 8*k*(k-1)]\n\n   So the formula is correct.\n\n   However, note: the arithmetic progression sum from 0 to k-1 is k*(k-1)//2, then multiplied by 16 gives 8*k*(k-1).\n\n   Therefore, the code is simple:\n\n        Read w, h, k\n        total = 2*k*(w+h-2) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n   But wait, let's check with the example of two rings: \n        k=2: 8*k*(k-1) = 8*2*1 = 16 -> subtracted from 56 gives 40.\n\n   However, note: the formula for the i-th ring was: 2*(a_i+b_i-2) = 2*(w+h-8*(i-1)-2) = 2*(w+h-2) - 16*(i-1)\n\n   Then the total is: \n        = 2*(w+h-2)*k - 16 * (0 + 1 + ... + (k-1))\n        = 2*(w+h-2)*k - 16 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n        = 2*(w+h-2)*k - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n   But wait, 16 * (k*(k-1)//2) = 8*k*(k-1) -> yes.\n\n   However, note: integer division? In Python, for integers, k*(k-1)//2 is integer if k is integer. But we are using k as integer, so no problem.\n\n   But wait: the example \"3 3 1\" works, \"7 9 1\" works, \"7 9 2\" works.\n\n   Let me test with another example: w=5, h=5, k=1 -> 2*1*(5+5-2)=2*8=16, then subtract 0 -> 16.\n\n   Now, if w=5, h=5, k=2? \n        Condition: k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed by the input constraint.\n\n   But if we try anyway: \n        total = 2*2*(5+5-2) - 8*2*1 = 4*8 - 16 = 32-16=16.\n\n   However, the second ring would require an inner rectangle of (5-4)=1x1. The border of 1x1 is 1, but our formula for the second ring would be: 2*(1+1-2)=0 -> which is incorrect.\n\n   But the problem states that k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So we don't need to handle k=2 for w=5, h=5.\n\n   Therefore, we assume k is within the bounds.\n\n   Code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        w = int(data[0])\n        h = int(data[1])\n        k = int(data[2])\n\n        total = 2 * k * (w + h - 2) - 8 * k * (k-1)\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the formula for the i-th ring is 2*(a_i+b_i-2). But note that the border formula for a rectangle of size a_i x b_i is 2*(a_i+b_i-2) only if a_i>=2 and b_i>=2. And we have shown that the smallest dimension is at least 3, so it holds.\n\n   But note: the above algebraic simplification is correct.\n\n   However, let's do one more example: w=10, h=10, k=2.\n\n        First ring: 10x10 -> border = 2*(10+10-2)=2*18=36.\n        Second ring: (10-4)=6x6 -> border = 2*(6+6-2)=2*10=20.\n        Total = 56.\n\n        Formula: 2*2*(10+10-2) - 8*2*1 = 4*18 - 16 = 72-16=56 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the formula.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the first ring is the edge, the second is 2 cells away, etc. And we are subtracting 4*(i-1) from both dimensions. This matches.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, meaning the outermost. Then the second ring is 2 cells away, so we subtract 4*(2-1)=4 from each dimension? \n\n        Actually, the description says: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1)) × (h - 4(i - 1))\".\n\n        Why subtract 4*(i-1)? \n\n        Consider: \n            For i=1: subtract 0 -> the entire plate.\n            For i=2: subtract 4 -> so the next ring is 4 cells away from the edge? \n\n        But the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. \n\n        Actually, the first ring is the outermost, which is 1 cell wide. Then the second ring is the next border, which is 2 cells away from the edge. \n\n        The outermost ring (first) covers the entire border of the w x h plate. Then the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle that is 2 cells in from the edge on each side. \n\n        How many cells do we remove from each dimension to get to the inner rectangle for the second ring?\n\n        To get the inner rectangle for the second ring, we must remove 2 cells from the left and 2 from the right, and similarly for the top and bottom. So we remove 2+2=4 from the width and 2+2=4 from the height.\n\n        Therefore, the formula for the inner rectangle is (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)) is correct.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 2 * k * (w + h - 2) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: let me re-check the algebra.\n\n        We said for the i-th ring: \n            cells_i = 2*( (w-4*(i-1)) + (h-4*(i-1)) - 2 )\n                    = 2*(w+h-8*(i-1)-2)\n\n        Then the total for k rings is:\n            = 2*(w+h-2)*k - 16 * (0 + 1 + ... + (k-1))\n            = 2*(w+h-2)*k - 16 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n\n        But wait, 16 * (k*(k-1)//2) = 8*k*(k-1). \n\n        However, in the expression above we wrote: 8*k*(k-1) but note the original expansion:\n\n            cells_i = 2*(w+h-8*(i-1)-2) = 2*(w+h-2) - 16*(i-1)\n\n        Then the sum over i from 1 to k:\n\n            = k * [2*(w+h-2)] - 16 * (0 + 1 + ... + (k-1))\n\n        And the sum of 0+1+...+(k-1) is k*(k-1)//2.\n\n        So the total is: 2*k*(w+h-2) - 16 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n\n        Now, 16 * (k*(k-1)//2) = 8*k*(k-1) only if k*(k-1) is even? \n\n        Actually, k*(k-1) is always even because either k or k-1 is even. So we can write:\n\n            total = 2*k*(w+h-2) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n        But wait, the factor 16 is applied to the sum of an arithmetic series which is an integer, but note: \n\n            Let S = 0+1+...+(k-1) = k*(k-1)//2.\n\n            Then 16 * S = 16 * (k*(k-1)//2) = 8*k*(k-1)\n\n        So yes, the formula is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say k>=1 and the expression is linear in k. \n\n   But wait, let me test with k=1: \n        total = 2*1*(w+h-2) - 8*1*0 = 2*(w+h-2) -> correct.\n\n   k=2: \n        total = 2*2*(w+h-2) - 8*2*1 = 4*(w+h-2) - 16 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   However, wait: the example input \"3 3 1\" -> 8, and our formula gives 8.\n\n   But note: the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, so no negative values.\n\n   One last thing: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. The rings are drawn by taking the border of the inner rectangles. \n\n   But note: the example \"3 3 1\" is 3x3. The border of a 3x3 is 8, which is the entire perimeter (each side is 3, but corners are shared). \n\n   This matches.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, wait: the example input \"3 3 1\" is provided as a string in the example, but the problem says the input is one line with three integers.\n\n   We read with map(int, input().split()).\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Input: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8\n        Input: \"7 9 1\" -> output 28\n        Input: \"7 9 2\" -> output 40\n\n   So the code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 2 * k * (w + h - 2) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait, let me check the example \"3 3 1\" again: \n        w=3, h=3, k=1: \n        total = 2*1*(3+3-2) - 8*1*0 = 2*(4) = 8.\n\n   It's correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge. The second ring is 2 cells away. But the formula we used subtracts 4*(i-1) from both dimensions. \n\n   The reason we subtract 4*(i-1) is because we are stepping away from the edge by i-1 rings, and each ring adds 2 cells on each side (so 2*2*i? Actually, no: the first ring (i=1) doesn't subtract anything. The second ring (i=2) subtracts 4, meaning we remove one cell from each side (because the ring is 1 cell wide) and then the next ring is another cell away. \n\n   But actually, the rings are drawn one after the other, each ring being 1 cell wide. The first ring is the outermost, then the second ring is the next layer, so the inner rectangle for the second ring is the original plate minus 2 layers (each layer being 2 cells: one from the left/right and one from the top/bottom). \n\n   So the formula is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we submit the code.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. The rings are drawn by taking the border of the inner rectangle. \n\n   But note: the example \"7 9 2\": \n        First ring: 7x9 -> 2*(7+9-2)=28.\n        Second ring: 3x5 -> 2*(3+5-2)=12.\n        Total 40.\n\n   Our formula: 2*2*(7+9-2) - 8*2*(2-1) = 4*14 - 16 = 56-16=40.\n\n   Another example: \"10 10 3\"\n        k_max = floor((10+1)/4)=floor(11/4)=2 -> so k=3 is not allowed. But if we try:\n\n        Condition: k<=floor((10+1)/4)=2, so k=3 is invalid. \n\n   So we don't need to worry.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input constraint: k is at least 1 and at most that value.\n\n   So we assume valid input.\n\n   Code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 2 * k * (w + h - 2) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the example \"3 3 1\" is 8, but let me compute the border of 3x3 by hand:\n\n        A 3x3 grid has 8 border cells: the center is not included. \n\n        We can count: \n            Top row: 3, bottom row: 3, and then the middle row: the two sides (left and right) -> 2. \n            Total: 3+3+2=8.\n\n   So yes.\n\n   But wait, the formula 2*(a+b-2) for a=3, b=3: 2*(3+3-2)=2*4=8.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, so we don't have to handle 1x1 or 2x2.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   But wait, let me check the example \"5 5 1\" -> 2*(5+5-2)=2*8=16.\n\n   Manually: 5x5 grid, the border is 16? \n        Top and bottom: 5 each -> 10.\n        Left and right: the middle three rows: 3*2=6.\n        Total 10+6=16.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   One more: \"5 5 2\" is not allowed by the condition, but if we compute:\n\n        First ring: 5x5 -> 16.\n        Second ring: (5-4)=1x1 -> border is 1 (but our formula for the second ring: 2*(1+1-2)=0, so total 16+0=16). \n\n        However, the condition says k<=floor((5+1)/4)=1, so k=2 is invalid.\n\n   Therefore, we rely on the input constraint.\n\n   We output the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input constraint for k is: \n        k ≤ floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n   So we don't have to handle invalid k.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        print(2 * k * (w + h - 2) - 8 * k * (k - 1))\n\n   But wait, wait! There's an alternative way to derive the formula: \n\n        We can also compute the area of the rings by considering the difference in perimeters.\n\n        The i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). \n\n        The area of the i-th ring is: \n            = 2*(w-4*(i-1)) + 2*(h-4*(i-1)) - 4   [because the four corners are counted twice in the top and bottom and left and right? Actually, the standard border formula is 2*(a+b)-4, which is the same as 2*(a+b-2)].\n\n        Then the total area is the sum from i=1 to k.\n\n        We did that and got the same formula.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the rings are drawn by taking the border of the inner rectangle. \n\n   But note: the rings do not overlap? Actually, the rings are drawn on different layers. The first ring is the outermost, then the second ring is inside the first, but separated by one cell. \n\n   The total gilded cells are the union of these rings. But the formula we used is for the border of each inner rectangle independently. \n\n   However, note: the problem does not require the rings to be disjoint? Actually, the rings are drawn on the same plate, but the description says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. \n\n   The example: \n        Input: \"7 9 2\" -> output 40.\n\n   How many cells are there in the first ring? 28, and the second ring? 12, total 40.\n\n   And the rings are disjoint: the first ring uses the outermost layer, then the second ring uses the next inner layer (leaving a gap of one cell between the first and second ring).\n\n   Therefore, the total is indeed the sum of the borders.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not specify whether the rings are drawn simultaneously or sequentially, but the result is the union of the borders of the inner rectangles.\n\n   And the borders of the inner rectangles are disjoint because the inner rectangle for the i-th ring is strictly inside the (i-1)-th ring (by at least one cell).\n\n   Therefore, we can simply add the areas.\n\n   Code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        # Calculate the total number of gilded cells\n        # Using the formula: total = 2*k*(w+h-2) - 8*k*(k-1)\n        total = 2 * k * (w + h - 2) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n        print(total)\n\n   Let me run the sample inputs:\n\n        \"3 3 1\" -> 8\n        \"7 9 1\" -> 28\n        \"7 9 2\" -> 40\n\n   All correct.\n\n   However, wait: the example input \"3 3 1\" is provided as a string in the example, but the problem says the input is one line with three integers.\n\n   We are reading from stdin.\n\n   We'll submit.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the input constraint for k: k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n   We don't have to check because the input satisfies the constraint.\n\n   Code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 2 * k * (w + h - 2) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the formula can be written in another way to avoid large k? But k is at most around 25 (since min(w, h) is at most 100, then floor((100+1)/4)=25). So k*(k-1) is at most 25*24=600, which is fine.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   But wait, wait: the problem says the first ring is the edge, and the second ring is 2 cells away. \n\n   What if the plate is 4x4? Then k_max = floor((4+1)/4)=floor(5/4)=1. \n\n        Then the first ring: 4x4 -> border = 2*(4+4-2)=12.\n\n        But wait, a 4x4 grid: \n            Top row: 4, bottom row:4, and the two middle rows: each has 2 (because the two ends) -> 2*2=4.\n            Total: 4+4+2+2=12.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   Another: 4x4, k=1 -> 12.\n\n   Now, 4x4, k=2: not allowed.\n\n   Another: 5x5, k=1 -> 16, k=2 not allowed.\n\n   Another: 6x6, k_max = floor((6+1)/4)=floor(7/4)=1 -> wait, no: \n        k_max = floor((min(6,6)+1)/4)=floor(7/4)=1.\n\n        But wait, the condition is: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n        For 6x6: min=6,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed inside the previous one, starting from the edge of the plate. The first ring is the outermost border, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the total number of cells covered by `k` concentric rings on an `w x h` grid. The i-th ring is formed by the border of a rectangle that is `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`. The key observation here is that each ring's border can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle adjusted for overlapping corners.\n2. **Insight**: The number of cells in the i-th ring is given by `2*(a + b - 2)`, where `a` and `b` are the dimensions of the inner rectangle. Summing these values for all `k` rings gives the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Optimization**: Instead of calculating each ring individually, we derive a mathematical formula to compute the total cells in constant time. The formula simplifies to `2*k*(w + h - 2) - 8*k*(k - 1)`, which efficiently sums the contributions of all `k` rings by leveraging arithmetic series properties.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 2 * k * (w + h - 2) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` from standard input, representing the plate dimensions and the number of rings.\n2. **Formula Application**: The formula `2 * k * (w + h - 2) - 8 * k * (k - 1)` is used to compute the total gilded cells. This formula is derived from summing the perimeters of each concentric rectangle, adjusting for overlapping corners and the decreasing dimensions with each subsequent ring.\n3. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the total number of cells covered by all `k` rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging mathematical insights to avoid iterative calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
