The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: \n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   string A (Nikephoros' sequence) and string B (Polycarpus' sequence)\n\n Since the sequences are cyclic, we can think of the i-th round (0-indexed) as:\n   a = A[i % len(A)]\n   b = B[i % len(B)]\n\n But note: n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate over each round.\n\n Instead, we can break the n rounds into complete cycles of the two sequences. However, note that the two sequences have different lengths.\n\n Let L1 = len(A), L2 = len(B). The combined cycle would be LCM(L1, L2) but since L1, L2 <= 1000, the LCM might be too large to consider as a cycle (but actually we can use GCD to compute LCM).\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   total_rounds = n\n\n   We can compute the result for one common period (the least common multiple of L1 and L2) and then multiply by the number of complete periods, and then add the remaining rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Precompute the LCM of L1 and L2. Since L1, L2 <= 1000, the LCM will be at most 1000*1000 / gcd(1000,1000) which is 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n  2. However, note that n can be up to 2e9, so if we use LCM period, we can do:\n\n      period = lcm(L1, L2)\n      full_periods = n // period\n      remainder = n % period\n\n  3. Then, we can simulate the period (which has at most 10^6 rounds, but 10^6 is acceptable because the period is the LCM, and the LCM of two numbers up to 1000 is at most 10^6, and we are only doing one simulation of the period, then we multiply the counts from one period by full_periods and then simulate the remainder.\n\n But wait: the problem says the two sequences are independent and we are going to use the same round index for both? Actually, the round index i (from 0 to n-1) gives:\n        a_i = A[i % L1]\n        b_i = B[i % L2]\n\n In the period of length T = LCM(L1, L2), we have that the state (i % L1, i % L2) repeats every T rounds.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   Let T = LCM(L1, L2)\n\n   We'll simulate i from 0 to T-1 (T is at most 10^6, which is acceptable) and count:\n        For each i, we get (a, b) = (A[i % L1], B[i % L2])\n\n        Then, determine the outcome of the round (a vs b):\n\n            If a == b: draw -> no red spot.\n            Else:\n                If a beats b: then Polycarpus gets a red spot (because Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses).\n                If b beats a: then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n        But note: the rules:\n\n            Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n            Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n            Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n        So, we can define:\n\n            def outcome(a, b):\n                if a == b:\n                    return None   # draw\n                elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    return 'Nikephoros'   # meaning Nikephoros wins -> Polycarpus loses (so Polycarpus gets a red spot)\n                else:\n                    return 'Polycarpus'    # meaning Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros loses (so Nikephoros gets a red spot)\n\n        Actually, we don't need the function to return the winner, we just need to assign the red spot to the loser.\n\n        Alternatively, we can assign:\n\n            Let:\n                red_spots_nike = 0\n                red_spots_poly = 0\n\n            For each round i in [0, T-1]:\n                a = A[i % L1]\n                b = B[i % L2]\n\n                if a == b: \n                    continue\n                elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    red_spots_poly += 1\n                else:\n                    red_spots_nike += 1\n\n        Then, for full_periods, we multiply these counts by full_periods.\n\n        Then for the remainder rounds (from 0 to remainder-1), we simulate the same way (using modulo indexing) and add the red spots.\n\n  4. However, note: the above simulation for one period (T rounds) might be heavy if T is 10^6 and we do it once (10^6 is acceptable in Python if we do it only once, but note that n can be 2e9 and T is at most 10^6, so we do one simulation of T rounds and then multiply by full_periods and then simulate the remainder (which is < T, so at most 10^6 again). But wait: T is the LCM, which is at most 10^6, and we do two passes: one for the full periods and one for the remainder. But 2 * 10^6 is acceptable.\n\n  5. But note: we must compute the LCM. We know that LCM(a,b) = a * b // GCD(a,b). Since a and b are <= 1000, we can compute GCD easily.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read n\n   Read A (string)\n   Read B (string)\n\n   L1 = len(A), L2 = len(B)\n\n   Compute T = (L1 * L2) // gcd(L1, L2)\n\n   Then, we can precompute the counts for one period (for i from 0 to T-1) as described.\n\n   Then, full_periods = n // T\n   remainder = n % T\n\n   total_nike = full_periods * (count_nike_in_period) + (simulate_remaining(remainder, A, B)[0])\n   total_poly = full_periods * (count_poly_in_period) + (simulate_remaining(remainder, A, B)[1])\n\n   But wait, we can also simulate the entire period without having to write a separate function for the period and remainder, but we can combine:\n\n   Alternatively, we can:\n\n        counts_period = [0, 0]   # [nike_red, poly_red] for one period\n\n        for i in range(T):\n            a = A[i % L1]\n            b = B[i % L2]\n            if a == b:\n                continue\n            elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                counts_period[1] += 1   # Poly gets a red spot\n            else:\n                counts_period[0] += 1   # Nike gets a red spot\n\n        Then, for the remainder, we do:\n\n        nike_rem = 0\n        poly_rem = 0\n        for i in range(remainder):\n            a = A[i % L1]\n            b = B[i % L2]\n            if a == b:\n                continue\n            elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                poly_rem += 1\n            else:\n                nike_rem += 1\n\n        total_nike = counts_period[0] * full_periods + nike_rem\n        total_poly = counts_period[1] * full_periods + poly_rem\n\n  6. However, note: the period T is the LCM, and the simulation for the period T is O(T) and T <= 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the problem constraints say n can be up to 2e9, and our simulation of the period (10^6) is acceptable because 10^6 is about 1e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n  However, what if the two sequences are of length 1? Then T = 1, which is even better.\n\n  But worst-case: two sequences of length 1000, then T = 1000*1000//gcd(1000,1000) = 1000*1000//1000 = 1000, which is 1000.\n\n  Actually, worst-case for the LCM of two numbers in [1,1000] is when they are coprime, then LCM = 1000 * 1000 = 1000000. That's 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: we are going to simulate two parts: the full period (once) and the remainder (at most 1e6). So total operations is about 2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, we can optimize by not simulating the remainder separately but by using the same method as the period? Actually, we already computed the period, and the remainder is less than the period. But we have to simulate the remainder anyway.\n\n  Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      import math\n\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      A_str = input().strip()\n      B_str = input().strip()\n\n      m = len(A_str)\n      k = len(B_str)\n\n      # Compute LCM(m, k)\n      g = math.gcd(m, k)\n      T = (m * k) // g\n\n      # Now, we want to compute the counts for one period (T rounds)\n      nike_count_period = 0\n      poly_count_period = 0\n\n      # We can simulate one period: for i from 0 to T-1\n      for i in range(T):\n          a_index = i % m\n          b_index = i % k\n          a_char = A_str[a_index]\n          b_char = B_str[b_index]\n\n          if a_char == b_char:\n              continue\n          elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              poly_count_period += 1\n          else:\n              nike_count_period += 1\n\n      full_periods = n // T\n      remainder = n % T\n\n      # Now simulate the remainder rounds (from 0 to remainder-1)\n      nike_rem = 0\n      poly_rem = 0\n      for i in range(remainder):\n          a_index = i % m\n          b_index = i % k\n          a_char = A_str[a_index]\n          b_char = B_str[b_index]\n\n          if a_char == b_char:\n              continue\n          elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              poly_rem += 1\n          else:\n              nike_rem += 1\n\n      total_nike = nike_count_period * full_periods + nike_rem\n      total_poly = poly_count_period * full_periods + poly_rem\n\n      print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\n  However, note: the example input:\n\n      Input: \n          7\n          RPS\n          RSPP\n\n      Expected Output: 3 2\n\n  Let me test with this example.\n\n  Steps for example:\n\n      n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n      m=3, k=4 -> LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n      Then we simulate 12 rounds to get counts_period, then full_periods = 7 // 12 = 0, remainder=7.\n\n      So we only simulate the first 7 rounds.\n\n      Round0: a='R', b='R' -> draw.\n      Round1: a='P', b='S' -> P vs S: P does not beat S? Wait, let's check:\n\n          Rules: \n            Rock beats Scissors -> R vs S: R wins (so if a=R and b=S, then a wins -> so in our condition: \n                Condition: (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, so then we add to Poly? \n\n          But wait: in the example, the first round was R-R -> draw.\n          Second round: P-S -> according to the example: \"P - S. Nikephoros loses.\" -> meaning Nikephoros used P and Polycarpus used S -> so S beats P? Actually, no: the rule is Scissors beats Paper. So in the round: \n                a = P, b = S -> P vs S: P does not beat S, but S beats P? \n\n          According to the rules: \n            Rock beats Scissors -> so if a is Rock and b is Scissors, then a wins (so the other, Polycarpus, loses).\n            Similarly, Scissors beats Paper -> if a is Scissors and b is Paper, then a wins (so the other, Polycarpus, loses).\n            Paper beats Rock -> if a is Paper and b is Rock, then a wins (so the other, Polycarpus, loses).\n\n          But note: the example says: \n            Round1: P (Nikephoros) vs S (Polycarpus): \"Nikephoros loses\" -> meaning Polycarpus wins. So that means S beats P.\n\n          Therefore, the condition should be: \n            if (a, b) is (Scissors, Paper) or (Paper, Rock) or (Rock, Scissors) -> then a wins? \n          But wait, in the example, when Nikephoros uses P and Polycarpus uses S, then we have (P, S) -> which is not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. \n\n          Actually, we have to map:\n\n            Condition for a win for a (Nikephoros) is:\n                (a, b) is ('R','S') -> R beats S -> yes, so then a wins.\n                (a, b) is ('S','P') -> S beats P -> yes.\n                (a, b) is ('P','R') -> P beats R -> yes.\n\n          But in the example, the second round: (a, b) = ('P','S') -> which is not one of these. So then it falls in the else: meaning b wins. \n\n          So the condition for a win for a (Nikephoros) is the three pairs above. Otherwise, if there's a win for b, then we count for Polycarpus.\n\n          But wait, in the example: \n            Round2: a='S', b='P' -> (S, P) -> which is one of the winning conditions for a (Nikephoros)? No, wait: (a, b) is ('S','P'): that is the second condition, so a wins. Then why did the example say \"S - P. Polycarpus loses\"? \n\n          Let me re-read the example:\n\n            \"P - S. Nikephoros loses.\" -> This is round1: a='P' (from A: \"RPS\" -> index1 is 'P') and b='S' (from B: \"RSPP\" -> index1 is 'S'). Then round2: a='S' (from A: index2 mod3 is 2 -> 'S') and b='P' (from B: index2 mod4 is 2 -> 'P').\n\n          So the example says for round2: \"S - P. Polycarpus loses.\" -> meaning Polycarpus (who used P) loses, so Nikephoros wins.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for a win for a (Nikephoros) is indeed the three pairs.\n\n          But in round1: (a, b) = ('P','S') -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so we go to the else, and that means b wins. So Polycarpus wins and gets a red spot? \n\n          However, the example says: \"Nikephoros loses\" -> meaning Polycarpus wins -> so that is correct.\n\n          But wait, the example output: \n            \"Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\"\n\n          So we are counting:\n\n            Round1: Polycarpus gets 1 red spot.\n            Round2: Nikephoros gets 1 red spot.\n            Round3: a='R', b='P' -> (R,P): not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so else: meaning b wins? Actually, (R,P): R vs P -> R doesn't beat P, and P beats R? Yes, because Paper beats Rock. So condition for a win for a? \n                (a, b) = ('R','P') -> not in the list, so we say else: meaning b wins -> so Nikephoros loses (one more for Polycarpus).\n\n            Round4: a='P', b='R' -> (P,R): which is the third condition -> a wins -> so Polycarpus loses (so Nikephoros doesn't get a red spot, but wait: when a wins, the loser is b (Polycarpus) -> so Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n\n            Round5: a='S', b='S' -> draw.\n\n            Round6: a='R', b='P' -> (R,P): same as round3 -> Polycarpus wins (so Polycarpus gets a red spot) -> but wait, round6: \n                Round6: index5: \n                    A: 5 % 3 = 2 -> 'S'? Wait, let me check the rounds:\n\n            The example rounds:\n\n                Round1: index0: a0='R', b0='R' -> draw.\n                Round2: index1: a1='P', b1='S' -> (P,S): else -> Polycarpus wins (so round2: Polycarpus gets one)\n                Round3: index2: a2='S', b2='P' -> (S,P): in the list -> a wins -> so Polycarpus loses (round3: Polycarpus loses, so we don't count for him, but for Nikephoros: no, wait, we are counting the red spots on the losers. So when a wins, the loser is Polycarpus -> so we count one for Polycarpus? No! \n\n            Correction: \n\n            We defined:\n                if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: \n                    poly_count_period += 1   # because in this case, a wins, so Polycarpus (b) loses -> so we add to Polycarpus's red spots.\n\n                else: \n                    nike_count_period += 1   # because then b wins, so Nikephoros (a) loses.\n\n            But wait, in round2: (P, S) -> condition fails, so we add to Nikephoros? But the example says Polycarpus wins. \n\n            So we have swapped: \n\n            Actually, the condition is for a win for a (Nikephoros). When a wins, then Polycarpus loses (so we add to Polycarpus's red spots). When a loses (meaning b wins), then Nikephoros loses (so we add to Nikephoros's red spots).\n\n            But in round2: (P, S) -> condition fails, so we add to Nikephoros's red spots. But the example says Polycarpus wins, so that means Nikephoros loses -> correct, because we are adding to Nikephoros's red spots.\n\n            However, wait: the example output says Nikephoros has 3 and Polycarpus has 2.\n\n            Let me recount with the code logic:\n\n            Round0: (R,R) -> draw -> no one.\n            Round1: (P,S) -> condition fails -> add to Nikephoros: so Nikephoros becomes 1.\n            Round2: (S,P) -> condition holds (since ('S','P') is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]) -> add to Polycarpus: so Polycarpus becomes 1.\n            Round3: (R,P) -> condition fails? ('R','P') is not in the list -> add to Nikephoros: now 2.\n            Round4: (P,R) -> condition holds (third element) -> add to Polycarpus: now 2.\n            Round5: (S,S) -> draw.\n            Round6: (R,P) -> condition fails -> add to Nikephoros: now 3.\n\n            So after 7 rounds: Nikephoros has 3, Polycarpus has 2 -> matches.\n\n            But wait, in round4: (P,R) -> condition holds: ('P','R') is in the list -> so we add to Polycarpus. Then round6: (R,P) -> condition fails, so we add to Nikephoros.\n\n            So the code logic is:\n\n                if a wins (condition holds): then Polycarpus loses (so we add to his red spots)\n                else: then Nikephoros loses (so we add to his red spots)\n\n            This is correct.\n\n  However, note: the example input:\n\n      Input: \n          5\n          RRRRRRRR\n          R\n\n      Expected Output: 0 0\n\n      Why? Because they both play the same in every round: R vs R -> draw every time.\n\n      So the counts for the period (if we take LCM(8,1)=8) for one period (8 rounds) would be 0 for both, then 5//8=0, and remainder=5, which also gives 0.\n\n  Therefore, the code should be:\n\n      import math\n\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      A_str = input().strip()\n      B_str = input().strip()\n\n      m = len(A_str)\n      k = len(B_str)\n\n      # Compute LCM(m, k)\n      g = math.gcd(m, k)\n      T = (m * k) // g\n\n      nike_count_period = 0\n      poly_count_period = 0\n\n      # Simulate one period (T rounds)\n      for i in range(T):\n          a_idx = i % m\n          b_idx = i % k\n          a_char = A_str[a_idx]\n          b_char = B_str[b_idx]\n\n          if a_char == b_char:\n              continue\n          elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              poly_count_period += 1\n          else:\n              nike_count_period += 1\n\n      full_periods = n // T\n      remainder = n % T\n\n      nike_rem = 0\n      poly_rem = 0\n      for i in range(remainder):\n          a_idx = i % m\n          b_idx = i % k\n          a_char = A_str[a_idx]\n          b_char = B_str[b_idx]\n\n          if a_char == b_char:\n              continue\n          elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              poly_rem += 1\n          else:\n              nike_rem += 1\n\n      total_nike = nike_count_period * full_periods + nike_rem\n      total_poly = poly_count_period * full_periods + poly_rem\n\n      print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\n  Let me run the provided examples.\n\n  Example1: \n      n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n      T = LCM(3,4)=12\n\n      We simulate 12 rounds for the period, but then we use only the first 7 for the remainder.\n\n      As above, the 7 rounds yield:\n          nike_count_period * full_periods (0) + (nike_rem=3) and poly_count_period * full_periods (0) + (poly_rem=2) -> \"3 2\"\n\n  Example2:\n      n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\"\n      T = LCM(8,1)=8\n      full_periods = 5//8 = 0, remainder=5\n      In the 5 rounds: \n          Each round: a_char = 'R', b_char = 'R' -> draw -> so no red spots.\n\n      So output: 0 0\n\n  Another example: \n      n=1, A=\"R\", B=\"S\"\n\n      T = LCM(1,1)=1\n      full_periods = 1//1 = 1, remainder=0.\n\n      Period simulation: \n          i=0: a='R', b='S' -> condition holds: ('R','S') is in the list -> poly_count_period +=1.\n\n      Then, total_nike = 0*1 + 0 = 0, total_poly = 1*1 + 0 = 1.\n\n      Output: 0 1\n\n  This is correct: \n        R vs S -> R beats S? No, wait: condition holds: ('R','S') -> so a wins? \n        But the rules: Rock beats Scissors -> yes, so a wins, so the loser is Polycarpus (b) -> so Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n\n  However, wait: the example says \"R - S\": \n        According to the rules: Rock beats Scissors -> so a wins, meaning Polycarpus loses -> so we add to Polycarpus.\n\n  So the code is correct.\n\n  But note: the condition list is [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] which corresponds to a win for a (the first element of the tuple).\n\n  One more: \n        n=1, A=\"S\", B=\"R\"\n        Condition: ('S','R') -> not in the list, so else: -> so we add to Nikephoros.\n\n        But the rules: Scissors vs Rock -> Rock beats Scissors? No, Rock beats Scissors is the opposite: Rock is stronger than Scissors. So in this case, Scissors (a) vs Rock (b): \n            The rules: Rock beats Scissors -> so b wins -> so the loser is a (Nikephoros). So we add to Nikephoros.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  However, note that the condition list is exactly the cases where a wins.\n\n  We can also write the condition without the list:\n\n      if a_char == b_char:\n          ...\n      else:\n          if (a_char, b_char) == ('R','S') or (a_char, b_char) == ('S','P') or (a_char, b_char) == ('P','R'):\n              poly_count_period += 1\n          else:\n              nike_count_period += 1\n\n  But the list is efficient.\n\n  Let me submit the code.\n\n  Note: we must be cautious with the modulo indexing and the LCM computation.\n\n  But note: the LCM computation: we use math.gcd, so we have to import math.\n\n  Code:\n\n      import math\n\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      A_str = input().strip()\n      B_str = input().strip()\n\n      m = len(A_str)\n      k = len(B_str)\n\n      # Compute LCM(m, k)\n      g = math.gcd(m, k)\n      T = (m * k) // g\n\n      nike_count_period = 0\n      poly_count_period = 0\n\n      # Simulate one period (T rounds)\n      for i in range(T):\n          a_idx = i % m\n          b_idx = i % k\n          a_char = A_str[a_idx]\n          b_char = B_str[b_idx]\n\n          if a_char == b_char:\n              continue\n          elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              poly_count_period += 1\n          else:\n              nike_count_period += 1\n\n      full_periods = n // T\n      remainder = n % T\n\n      nike_rem = 0\n      poly_rem = 0\n      for i in range(remainder):\n          a_idx = i % m\n          b_idx = i % k\n          a_char = A_str[a_idx]\n          b_char = B_str[b_idx]\n\n          if a_char == b_char:\n              continue\n          elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              poly_rem += 1\n          else:\n              nike_rem += 1\n\n      total_nike = nike_count_period * full_periods + nike_rem\n      total_poly = poly_count_period * full_periods + poly_rem\n\n      print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\n  However, note: the period T might be 0? But m,k>=1, so T>=1.\n\n  This code should work.\n\n  But wait: what if the period T is very large? Actually, the maximum T is 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n  Let me run with a worst-case: two sequences of length 997 (prime) and 991 (another prime) -> T = 997*991 = 987027, which is about 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, we are iterating twice: once for T (about 1e6) and once for remainder (which is < T). But worst-case remainder is T-1, so about 1e6 again. So total iterations about 2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the problem says n can be up to 2e9, but we are not iterating n times, we are iterating T and remainder (which is < T) and T is at most 1e6.\n\n  This is efficient.\n\n  Let me run the provided examples.\n\n  Example1: \n      Input: \n          7\n          RPS\n          RSPP\n\n      Output: 3 2\n\n  Example2:\n      Input:\n          5\n          RRRRRRRR\n          R\n\n      Output: 0 0\n\n  Example3:\n      Input:\n          1\n          R\n          S\n\n      Output: 0 1\n\n  Example4:\n      Input:\n          1\n          S\n          R\n\n      Output: 1 0\n\n  All correct.\n\n  I'll submit.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the sequences are given as strings. We are using the strings correctly.\n\n  One more edge: n=0? The problem says n>=1, so no.\n\n  Code is ready.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently handling large `n` (up to 2·10^9) without simulating each round individually, which would be computationally infeasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of rock, paper, or scissors. The outcome of each round depends on the current move in each player's sequence. The key observation is that the sequences repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of their lengths. This periodicity allows us to compute the results for one period and then extrapolate to cover all `n` rounds.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By identifying the period (LCM of the sequence lengths), we can simulate the game for one period and then use multiplication to handle the remaining rounds after full periods are accounted for. This reduces the problem from O(n) to O(T), where T is the period (at most 1,000,000 for sequences up to 1000 characters).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period.\n   - **Period Simulation**: Simulate the game for one period, counting the number of times each player loses (i.e., receives a red spot).\n   - **Extrapolation**: Use the counts from one period to compute the total losses for the full periods and then handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. The simulation of one period (O(T)) and the remaining rounds (O(r), where r < T) ensures the solution is feasible even for very large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n\n    nike_count_period = 0\n    poly_count_period = 0\n\n    for i in range(T):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_char = A_str[a_idx]\n        b_char = B_str[b_idx]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            poly_count_period += 1\n        else:\n            nike_count_period += 1\n\n    full_periods = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n\n    nike_rem = 0\n    poly_rem = 0\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_char = A_str[a_idx]\n        b_char = B_str[b_idx]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            poly_rem += 1\n        else:\n            nike_rem += 1\n\n    total_nike = nike_count_period * full_periods + nike_rem\n    total_poly = poly_count_period * full_periods + poly_rem\n\n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n2. **Period Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of `A` and `B` is computed to determine the period `T` after which the sequence of moves repeats.\n3. **Period Simulation**: The game is simulated for one period `T`. For each round within the period, the outcome is determined based on the current moves from `A` and `B`. If Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus receives a red spot; if Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros receives a red spot; draws result in no red spots.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The total red spots are calculated by multiplying the counts from one period by the number of full periods (`n // T`) and adding the results from the remaining rounds (`n % T`).\n5. **Output**: The total red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large input size by leveraging periodicity, ensuring optimal performance without explicitly processing each round.",
