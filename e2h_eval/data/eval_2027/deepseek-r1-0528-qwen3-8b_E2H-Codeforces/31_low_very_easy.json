Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers.\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer between -x and x (inclusive) to make the total sum zero.\n\n Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n Then we need to find a set of k cards (each card's absolute value <= x) such that the sum of these k cards is -S.\n\n We are to find the minimum k (non-negative integer) for which there exists a set of k cards (each in [-x, x]) that sums to -S.\n\n Note: Since we can choose any integer from -x to x, the problem reduces to: \n   Given a target T = -S, what is the minimum non-negative integer k such that T can be represented as the sum of k integers, each between -x and x?\n\n However, note that we are allowed to use any integers in that range. So the constraints on each term are:\n   Each term: -x <= a_i <= x.\n\n We can think about the maximum and minimum sum we can achieve with k cards:\n   Minimum sum with k cards: -k*x\n   Maximum sum with k cards: k*x\n\n Therefore, if |T| <= k*x, then we can represent T? Not exactly: because we have the constraint that each term is at most x and at least -x.\n\n But note: we are allowed to choose any integers. Actually, the necessary and sufficient condition for T to be representable by k cards is:\n   -k*x <= T <= k*x.\n\n However, we must also consider that we are not limited by the step size beyond the fact that we can adjust by 1 (since integers). Actually, we can form any integer T' such that T' is between -k*x and k*x, provided that the step condition holds? \n\n But wait: the set of representable numbers is all integers in the interval [-k*x, k*x] because we can change one card by 1 to adjust the total by 1 (if we have enough cards). However, note that with k=1, we can only get integers from -x to x. With k=2, we can get from -2x to 2x, but note that we can get every integer in between? Actually, no: for example, with k=2 and x=1, we can only get even numbers? Actually, no: with two cards of ±1, we can get: -2, 0, 2. So we cannot get 1 or -1 with two cards when x=1. \n\n Correction: The key is that each card can be any integer in [-x, x]. So with two cards, the possible sums are from -2x to 2x, but the step is 2? Not necessarily. For example, if x=2, then two cards can be (0,0) -> 0, (1,0) -> 1, (1,1) -> 2, (2,0) -> 2, (1,2) -> 3, etc. Actually, we can form every integer between -2x and 2x? \n\n However, let me clarify: with two cards, we can choose two integers a and b such that a in [-x, x] and b in [-x, x]. The set of sums is {a+b : a,b in [-x,x]}. This is symmetric and the minimum is -2x, maximum 2x. Now, is every integer in between achievable?\n   Consider: we can get 0 by (0,0). We can get 1 by (1,0) or (0,1). Similarly, -1 by (-1,0) or (0,-1). 2 by (2,0) or (1,1), etc.\n\n Actually, the set of achievable sums is every integer between -2x and 2x. Why? \n   We can fix the first card to be any value in [-x, x] and the second card to be (target - first card). Since the second card must be in [-x, x], we require that target - first card is in [-x, x] => first card must be in [target-x, target+x]. But note, we are free to choose the first card arbitrarily in [-x, x]. So for a fixed target T, we need an integer a in [-x, x] such that T - a is in [-x, x] i.e., a in [T-x, T+x] and also a in [-x, x]. \n\n However, we are considering two cards. Actually, we don't need to fix one card arbitrarily. We can use the following:\n\n   With k cards, the set of achievable sums is every integer T such that:\n        -k*x <= T <= k*x.\n\n Why?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards equals zero. Each card must have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum is the negative of the current sum, as we need the total sum to be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Binary Search for Minimum Cards**: For non-zero targets, use binary search to find the smallest number of cards (k) such that the absolute value of the target sum can be achieved by summing k cards, each with a maximum absolute value of x. The key insight here is that with k cards, the maximum absolute sum achievable is k*x. Therefore, if the absolute value of the target sum is less than or equal to k*x, it is possible to achieve the target sum with k cards.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(cards)\n    target = -total\n    \n    if target == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    low = 1\n    high = abs(target) * 2 + 1000000\n    \n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        max_abs_sum = mid * x\n        if abs(target) <= max_abs_sum:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n            \n    print(low)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by a list of n integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is calculated. The target sum is set to the negative of this sum to balance the total to zero.\n3. **Zero Target Check**: If the target sum is zero, the answer is zero since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is initialized with `low` set to 1 and `high` set to a sufficiently large number (to cover all possible cases).\n5. **Binary Search Execution**: The loop adjusts `low` and `high` based on whether the absolute value of the target sum can be achieved with `mid` cards. The condition `abs(target) <= mid * x` checks if the target sum can be achieved with `mid` cards, each contributing at most x in absolute value.\n6. **Output Result**: The loop exits when `low` holds the minimum number of cards needed, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution using binary search, leveraging the mathematical insight that the maximum absolute sum with k cards is k*x. This ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
