Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, and then a list of n integers (the found cards) in the second line.\n\n The problem: We have infinitely many cards with every integer from -x to x. We found n cards (with numbers that are in the range [-x, x]). We want to choose the minimum number of additional cards (from the infinite set) such that the total sum of all the cards (found plus chosen) is zero.\n\n Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n\n Then we need to achieve a total sum of 0, so the sum of the additional cards must be -S.\n\n Now, what is the minimum number of cards we need to pick from the set of integers in [-x, x] (excluding the ones we already have? Actually, note: the problem says \"he only found n of them\", meaning there are infinitely many left. So we can use any card from the set [-x, x] as many times as needed.\n\n However, note: the example input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" has n=2, x=3, and the found cards are [-2, -2]. The sum S = -4. We need to add cards that sum to 4. Since the maximum absolute value is 3, we cannot use a single card (because 3 or -3 would not give 4). The next best is two cards: 3 and 1, but wait: 3+1=4, but note 1 is allowed. However, the example output is 2.\n\n But wait: in the second sample, they say: \"He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\" So why isn't 4 broken down by two cards? Actually, the example output is 2.\n\n However, note that the example input is two cards of -2. So we need to add two cards that sum to 4. The example says 2.\n\n Why is the answer 2? Because we can use two cards: for example, [3, 1] or [2,2] etc. But note: we can use any integers in [-3,3]. So the minimal number of cards needed is 2.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Let S = sum(found_cards)\n\n We need to represent the number T = -S as a sum of integers each between -x and x (inclusive), and we want to minimize the number of terms.\n\n This is similar to the coin change problem but with an unbounded supply of coins (each integer from -x to x) and we want to make the target T with the minimum number of coins (but note: we can also use negative coins).\n\n However, note: the set of available numbers is symmetric. But we are allowed to use zeros too? Actually, zeros are included because the set is from -x to x.\n\n But using zeros doesn't help. So we can consider non-zero numbers.\n\n However, we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. So we can use positive and negative.\n\n Important observation:\n\n Since we can use both positive and negative numbers, we can adjust the sum arbitrarily. But we want the minimum number of cards.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the current sum S of the found cards. Then the target is T = -S.\n\n 2. If T == 0, then we don't need to add any card -> answer 0.\n\n 3. Otherwise, we need to find the minimum number k such that T can be written as the sum of k numbers, each in the range [-x, x].\n\n Note: We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x] multiple times.\n\n But note: the set is continuous, so we can use any integer. However, we are constrained by the absolute value.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require distinct cards, so repetition is allowed.\n\n How to compute k?\n\n Consider:\n\n Let k be the number of cards we need to add.\n\n The maximum absolute value of a card is x, so the maximum positive sum we can get with k cards is k*x, and similarly the maximum negative sum is -k*x.\n\n Therefore, we require |T| <= k*x.\n\n But also, we might not need the entire k*x if we can break T into parts.\n\n However, note that we can use negative and positive arbitrarily. In fact, the problem becomes: what is the smallest k such that k*x >= |T|?\n\n But wait, is that sufficient? \n\n Example: T=4, x=3, then k_min should be ceil(|T|/x)? \n\n For T=4, x=3: ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. So k=2.\n\n Example: T=5, x=3: ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards equals zero. Each card can have any integer value from -x to x, inclusive. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards. Let this sum be `S`.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is `-S` because the total sum of all cards (found plus additional) must be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed, so the answer is 0.\n4. **Find Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero target sum `T`, the minimal number of cards required is the smallest integer `k` such that `k * x >= |T|`. This is derived from the fact that each card can contribute at most `x` (in absolute value) towards the target sum. The ceiling of `|T| / x` gives the minimal number of cards needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    T = -total_sum\n    \n    if T == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    k = abs(T) / x\n    ans = (k // 1) if k % 1 == 0 else (int(k) + 1)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum for the additional cards is the negation of this sum.\n3. **Zero Target Handling**: If the target sum is zero, the answer is immediately 0 since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For a non-zero target, the minimal number of cards required is determined by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by `x` and taking the ceiling of the result. This works because each card can contribute up to `x` (or `-x`) towards the target sum. The ceiling ensures we round up to the next integer if there's any remainder, guaranteeing the target can be achieved.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal number of additional cards needed by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
