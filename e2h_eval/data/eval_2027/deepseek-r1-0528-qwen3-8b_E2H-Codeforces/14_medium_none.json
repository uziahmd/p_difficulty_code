He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n        f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n But note: We are given m (required number of trailing zeros) and need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. So we can use binary search to find the range of n for which f(n) = m.\n\n Observation:\n   For a fixed m, there might be a contiguous set of n's that have the same number of trailing zeros? Actually, no: \n   The value of f(n) increases only when n is a multiple of a power of 5. But between two multiples, the function stays constant.\n\n   However, note: \n     f(4) = 0, f(5)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2, etc.\n\n   So for a given m, we want to find the smallest n1 such that f(n1) >= m and the largest n2 such that f(n2) <= m?\n   Actually, we want n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   But note: It is possible that there is no n with f(n)=m? Then we output 0.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n     Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then check the next numbers until the trailing zeros increase beyond m.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: print k (the number of values) and then the list of these k integers.\n\n   Example: m=1 -> n from 5 to 9 (inclusive) because:\n        f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, and then f(10)=2.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let L(m) = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n   Let R(m) = the largest n such that f(n) < m+1? Actually, we want the largest n such that f(n) == m.\n\n   But note: We know that f(n) is non-decreasing. So:\n\n   We can define:\n        low_bound = smallest n with f(n) >= m\n        high_bound = smallest n with f(n) >= m+1\n\n   Then the numbers n such that f(n)=m are the numbers from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n   However, what if there is no n with f(n)=m? Then low_bound would be the first n with f(n)>=m, but if at that n we get f(n)>m, then the set is empty.\n\n   Actually, we can set:\n        Let A = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n        Let B = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, if f(A) == m, then the numbers from A to B-1 have exactly m zeros.\n   But what if f(A) > m? Then there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n   However, note that the function f(n) increases by steps. It might jump from less than m to more than m? Actually, it increases by an integer amount (at least 1) when n is a multiple of a power of 5. But note: sometimes the jump is more than 1 (for example, when n is 25, f(25)=6, and f(24)=4, so from 24 to 25 we jump from 4 to 6). \n\n   Therefore, if the smallest n with f(n)>=m is A and f(A) != m, then there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Define a function f(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n   Step 2: Use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Call this left_bound.\n\n   Step 3: Use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Call this right_bound.\n\n   Then, if f(left_bound) != m, then there is no n with exactly m zeros -> output 0.\n\n   Otherwise, the numbers are from left_bound to right_bound-1. The count is (right_bound - left_bound).\n\n   But wait: we must consider that sometimes the left_bound might already be above the required m? Actually, our binary search for the smallest n such that f(n)>=m will give the first n where the zeros are at least m. Then we check if that n gives exactly m.\n\n   However, what if m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n   But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n   However, we must also consider that the factorial function grows very fast and we cannot compute n! directly for large n (like up to several million? because m=100000, we need to find n such that f(n)=100000, and n will be around 400000 or more? Actually, we can use binary search and the function f(n) is computed without computing factorial.\n\n   Implementation of f(n):\n        def trailing_zeros(n):\n            count = 0\n            divisor = 5\n            while divisor <= n:\n                count += n // divisor\n                divisor *= 5\n\n   Now, we need to find left_bound and right_bound by binary search.\n\n   How to set the boundaries for binary search?\n\n   We know that for n=0, f(0)=0. And as n increases, f(n) increases. We are looking for n such that f(n)>=m (with m>=1). \n\n   We can set low = 0, high = something. What should be the upper bound?\n\n   Note: f(n) = n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... <= n/4 (geometric series, since 1/5 + 1/25 + ... <= 1/4). So n must be at least 4*m. But actually, the series is bounded by n/4, so to get m trailing zeros, we need n at least 4*m? Not exactly, but we can set an upper bound.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set:\n\n        Lower bound for n: 0\n        Upper bound for n: let's say we start with 5*m? But sometimes we need more. Actually, we know that f(n) >= n/5 (since the first term is n/5 and the rest are positive). So n must be at most 5*m? Actually, no: because f(n) = n/5 + n/25 + ... and this is less than n/4. So to have at least m zeros, we need n/4 >= m? Actually, n/4 is an upper bound for the entire series. So n must be at least 4*m. But also, the minimal n that gives m zeros is roughly 4*m (but sometimes more). \n\n   However, we can set:\n\n        left_bound: we are searching for n in [0, 5*m] (if m is large, say 100000, then 5*m=500000). But sometimes the minimal n for m zeros might be larger? Actually, the formula is:\n\n        We know that f(n) >= n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... \n\n        We can set an upper bound: n_max. We know that f(n) >= m when n >= 5*m (because even the first term n/5 is at least m when n>=5*m). But actually, we can set:\n\n        Let's say we set high = 5*m * 5? Or we can set high = 5*m + 100? \n\n   Actually, we can use a while loop to adjust the high until f(high) >= m. But we are doing binary search, so we need an upper bound that we know for sure is beyond the solution.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set:\n\n        high = 5*m   # This might be too low because sometimes the jump is more than 1 (like from 24 to 25: 24 has 4 zeros, 25 has 6). But we can set:\n\n        Actually, we can set an initial high: \n\n        We know that f(n) >= n/5 (floor division). So to have f(n) >= m, we need n >= 5*m? Not necessarily, because the next terms add more. But we can set:\n\n        high = 5*m * 5   # 25*m? But m can be up to 100000, then 25*100000 = 2500000. That's acceptable.\n\n   However, we can do better: \n\n        We can set:\n\n        low = 0\n        high = 10**6   # for m=100000, we need to go up to at most around 400000? Actually, the minimal n for m=100000 is about 400000? \n\n        But let me calculate: \n            f(n) = n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... \n            We want f(n) >= 100000.\n\n            The series is geometric: f(n) = n/(5-1) * (1 - (1/5)^(k)) approximately n/4.\n\n            So n/4 >= 100000  => n >= 400000.\n\n        So we can set high = 500000 (or 500000) for m=100000.\n\n        But we don't know m in advance? Actually, we read m from input. So we can set:\n\n        low = 0\n        high = 5 * m * 5   # 25*m, but wait: we know that f(n) <= n/4, so n must be at least 4*m. But to be safe, we set high to 5*m*5? Actually, we can set:\n\n        Alternatively, we can set high = 5*m + 100   # but sometimes we might need more because of the jumps.\n\n        But wait: we are using binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. We can set an initial high to 5*m (which is an overestimate) and then if f(5*m) < m, we double it until we exceed m.\n\n        However, note: f(5*m) = 5*m//5 + 5*m//25 + ... = m + m//5 + m//25 + ... which is definitely >= m.\n\n        So we can set:\n\n            high = 5*m   # because even if m is 100000, then 5*m=500000, and we know that f(500000) is much larger than 100000.\n\n        But wait: we are looking for the smallest n such that f(n)>=m. The minimal n might be less than 5*m, but we need an upper bound. 5*m is an upper bound because f(5*m) >= m.\n\n        Actually, we know that f(5*m) >= m (because the first term is 5*m//5 = m, and the rest are positive). So we can set:\n\n            low = 0\n            high = 5*m   # this is an upper bound\n\n        Similarly for m+1, we can set high = 5*(m+1) for the second binary search.\n\n   However, we must note: the minimal n for m zeros might be less than 5*m, but 5*m is definitely an upper bound.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read m.\n\n        Step 2: If m==0, then we know the answer is all n>=0, but the problem states m>=1, so skip.\n\n        Step 3: Define function trailing_zeros(n)\n\n        Step 4: Binary search for left_bound (smallest n with trailing_zeros(n) >= m)\n\n                low = 0\n                high = 5*m   # because f(5*m) >= m\n\n                while low < high:\n                    mid = (low+high)//2\n                    if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n                        low = mid+1\n                    else:\n                        high = mid\n\n                left_bound = low\n\n        Step 5: Similarly, for m+1:\n\n                low2 = 0\n                high2 = 5*(m+1)   # because we are looking for >= m+1, and 5*(m+1) is an upper bound.\n\n                while low2 < high2:\n                    mid = (low2+high2)//2\n                    if trailing_zeros(mid) < m+1:\n                        low2 = mid+1\n                    else:\n                        high2 = mid\n\n                right_bound = low2\n\n        Step 6: Check if trailing_zeros(left_bound) == m.\n\n                If not, then there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n        Step 7: Otherwise, the numbers are from left_bound to right_bound-1.\n\n        Step 8: Print the count (right_bound - left_bound) and then the numbers (if any) from left_bound to right_bound-1.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\n        Example: m=1 -> left_bound = 5, right_bound = 10 (because trailing_zeros(10)=2, so the smallest n with >=2 is 10). Then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 -> count=5.\n\n        But wait: trailing_zeros(9)=1, trailing_zeros(10)=2. So indeed, the numbers with exactly 1 zero are from 5 to 9.\n\n        However, our binary search for m+1 (which is 2) returns 10. So right_bound = 10, then the numbers are from 5 to 9 (inclusive) -> 5 numbers.\n\n        But what if m=0? The problem doesn't require, but let's assume m>=1.\n\n        However, note: what if m is very large, say 100000? Then we are going to do two binary searches over numbers up to 500000 and 500001. The trailing_zeros function runs in O(log_5(n)) which is about 7-8 iterations per call. The binary search will take about log2(500000) which is ~19 steps. So total operations is about 2 * 19 * (log5(n)) which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: the problem says m can be up to 100000, so we are setting high = 5*m = 500000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, what if m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't handle m=0.\n\n        But wait: what if there is no n such that f(n)=m? Then we output 0. For example, m=3: \n            trailing_zeros(13)=2, trailing_zeros(15)=3 -> so there is n=15. But wait, let me check:\n\n            Actually, we have:\n                n: 0->0, 1->0, 2->0, 3->0, 4->0, 5->1, 6->1, 7->1, 8->1, 9->1, 10->2, 11->2, 12->2, 13->2, 14->2, 15->3.\n\n            So for m=3, left_bound is 15, and then we check trailing_zeros(15)=3 -> yes, then the next one is the smallest n with >=4: \n                trailing_zeros(16)=3, 17=3, 18=3, 19=3, 20=4 -> so right_bound=20.\n\n            So the numbers are 15,16,17,18,19 -> 5 numbers.\n\n        However, note: sometimes the jump is more than one. For example, m=6: \n            The zeros: \n                n=20: 4, n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6 (because 25 adds two factors of 5: 5 and 25, so two extra factors). So from 24 to 25, the zeros jump from 4 to 6.\n\n            Therefore, for m=5: \n                left_bound: smallest n with >=5? There is no n with 5 zeros? \n                trailing_zeros(24)=4, trailing_zeros(25)=6 -> so the smallest n with >=5 is 25, but then trailing_zeros(25)=6 !=5. So we output 0 for m=5.\n\n        So the algorithm correctly handles gaps.\n\n        But note: we must be cautious: the function trailing_zeros(n) is defined for n>=0.\n\n        Code:\n\n        def trailing_zeros(n):\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n            count = 0\n            divisor = 5\n            while divisor <= n:\n                count += n // divisor\n                divisor *= 5\n            return count\n\n        Then the main:\n\n        m = int(input().strip())\n\n        # Edge: if m==0, but the problem says m>=1, so we skip.\n\n        # Binary search for left_bound (smallest n with trailing_zeros(n) >= m)\n        low = 0\n        high = 5 * m   # because f(5*m) >= m\n\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n\n        left_bound = low\n\n        # Now, if trailing_zeros(left_bound) != m, then there's no solution.\n        if trailing_zeros(left_bound) != m:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Now, find the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1\n            low2 = 0\n            high2 = 5 * (m+1)   # because f(5*(m+1)) >= m+1\n\n            while low2 < high2:\n                mid = (low2 + high2) // 2\n                if trailing_zeros(mid) < m+1:\n                    low2 = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high2 = mid\n\n            right_bound = low2\n\n            # The numbers are from left_bound to right_bound-1 (inclusive)\n            count = right_bound - left_bound\n\n            # But note: it's possible that the entire range is empty? No, because we checked that left_bound has exactly m, so at least one number exists.\n\n            print(count)\n            # Now, we have to output the numbers from left_bound to right_bound-1, but note: the range might be huge (if m is 100000, then the numbers might be from 400000 to 400000+? Actually, the gap for consecutive m's might be 1 or more, but the gap from m to m+1 is the next jump.\n\n            # However, printing all numbers from left_bound to right_bound-1 might be too slow if the gap is large (like if m=0, but m>=1, and the gap for m=1 is 5, for m=2 is 5, but for m=5 is 0). But note: the gap for consecutive m's is the next jump (which can be multiple numbers). However, the gap is (right_bound - left_bound) which is the count we just printed.\n\n            # But the problem requires to output the list of numbers. However, if the gap is large (like 100000 numbers) then we cannot output each one by one because that would be too slow and use too much memory.\n\n            # Let me reexamine: the problem says m from 1 to 100000. The numbers n that have exactly m trailing zeros are consecutive? Yes, they form a contiguous block (from left_bound to right_bound-1).

Because the next jump happens at multiples of 5? Actually, the next jump is when n is a multiple of 5, but sometimes the jump is more than one. However, the contiguous block of n with the same trailing zeros length is always 5 numbers? \n\n            # Actually, no: \n            #   Consider m=10: \n            #       We need to find the smallest n with 10 zeros.\n            #       trailing_zeros(40)=8, trailing_zeros(41)=8, ..., trailing_zeros(44)=8, trailing_zeros(45)= 45//5 + 45//25 = 9+1=10 -> so left_bound=45.\n            #       Then trailing_zeros(46)=10, 47=10, 48=10, 49=10, 50: 50//5 + 50//25 + 50//125 = 10+2+0=12 -> so right_bound=50.\n            #       Then the numbers are 45,46,47,48,49 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            # But wait, what about m=12? \n            #       We know trailing_zeros(50)=12.\n            #       Then trailing_zeros(51)=12, 52=12, 53=12, 54=12, 55: 55//5 + 55//25 + 55//125 = 11+2+0=13 -> so again 5 numbers.\n\n            # However, consider m=5: we found that there is no n with 5 zeros. So the gap is 0.\n\n            # But wait, what about m=11? \n            #       We need the smallest n with >=11: \n            #           trailing_zeros(45)=10, 46=10, 47=10, 48=10, 49=10, 50=12 -> so 50 is the first with >=11 (actually 12). Then trailing_zeros(50)=12 !=11 -> so no solution.\n\n            # So the pattern: the contiguous block is always 5 numbers, except when there is no solution (then the block is empty) or when the jump is more than one (so the block is still 5 numbers until the next multiple of 5).\n\n            # Actually, the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5. But note: the jump at a multiple of 5 might be more than 1 (if the number has more than one factor of 5). \n\n            # However, the important thing is: the function f(n) is constant on intervals [5*k+1, 5*k+5] for k>=0? Not exactly, because the zeros count changes at every multiple of 5, but the value of n mod 5 doesn't matter for the trailing zeros? \n\n            # Actually, the trailing zeros only increase at multiples of 5, and the amount of increase is the number of factors of 5 in that number.\n\n            # But note: the trailing zeros are non-decreasing and they only change at multiples of 5. Between two multiples of 5, the function is constant.\n\n            # Therefore, the set of n with the same trailing zeros is an interval that starts and ends at multiples of 5? Actually, no: the zeros remain constant until the next multiple of 5.\n\n            # Example: from 5 to 9: \n            #   n=5: 1\n            #   n=6: 1 (same as 5)\n            #   n=7: 1\n            #   n=8: 1\n            #   n=9: 1\n            #   n=10: 2\n\n            # So the interval is [5, 10) -> which is [5,9]. The next multiple of 5 is 10.\n\n            # Similarly, [10,15) -> [10,14] for 2 zeros.\n\n            # So the contiguous block for a given m is [left_bound, right_bound-1] and the length is (right_bound - left_bound). \n\n            # But note: the problem says to output the numbers. However, if the gap is large (like 100000 numbers) then we cannot output them one by one.\n\n            # But note: the gap is the same as the count we calculated. However, the gap is at most 5? Actually, no: wait, look at the next example:\n\n            #   Consider m=13: \n            #       We know trailing_zeros(50)=12, 51=12, 52=12, 53=12, 54=12, 55=13 (jump from 12 to 13). So the block for m=13 is [55, 59] -> 5 numbers.\n\n            #   Consider m=14: \n            #       trailing_zeros(55)=13, 56=13, 57=13, 58=13, 59=13, 60: 60//5 + 60//25 + 60//125 = 12+2+0=14 -> so block [55,59] for m=13, and [60,?] for m=14? Actually, no: 60 gives 14, so the block for m=14 is [60,64] (because 65: 65//5 + 65//25 + 65//125 = 13+2+0=15). So again 5 numbers.\n\n            #   But wait, what about m=0? Not applicable.\n\n            #   However, consider m=100000: the gap is 5 numbers? \n\n            #   Actually, the gap is always 5, except when there is no solution. \n\n            #   Why? Because the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5, and the next multiple of 5 is 5 away. Therefore, the contiguous block for a given m (if exists) is 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n            #   But wait: what if the jump is more than 1? Then the contiguous block is still 5 numbers because the next jump happens at the next multiple of 5.\n\n            #   Example: at n=25, we jump from 4 (at 24) to 6 (at 25). Then the block for m=5 is empty. But the block for m=6 is [25,29] (5 numbers) and then at n=30 we jump to 7.\n\n            #   So the contiguous block for a given m (if exists) is always 5 numbers.\n\n            #   Then the count is either 0 or 5, right? \n\n            #   Wait, let me test with m=1: 5 numbers, m=2:5, m=3:5, m=4:5, m=5:0, m=6:5, m=7:5, m=8:5, m=9:5, m=10:5, m=11:0, m=12:5, etc.\n\n            #   This pattern is because the trailing zeros increase by the number of factors of 5 in the number. The number of factors of 5 in n! is the sum_{k>=1} floor(n/5^k). \n\n            #   The gaps (the missing m values) occur when the jump is more than 1. Specifically, when n is divisible by 25 (or higher powers) then the jump is more than 1.\n\n            #   Therefore, the contiguous block is always 5 numbers, unless the value m is skipped.\n\n            #   But wait: what if the jump is more than 2? Then we skip more than one m value. For example, at n=125, we jump from 24 (at 124) to 31 (at 125) because 125 contributes three factors of 5 (since 125=5^3). Then the m values 25,26,27,28,29,30 are skipped.\n\n            #   However, the contiguous block for m=25 to m=29 does not exist, but the block for m=30 would be [125,129] (if 125 is the first with 31 zeros, then 125:31, 126:31, 127:31, 128:31, 129:31, 130: 130//5 + 130//25 + 130//125 = 26+5+1=32). So the block for m=31 is [125,129] (5 numbers) and then m=32 is [130,134].\n\n            #   So the gap is still 5, but we skip some m values.\n\n            #   Therefore, the code above is correct: we are finding the contiguous block for the given m (if exists) and the block is from left_bound to right_bound-1, and the length is (right_bound - left_bound). \n\n            #   However, note: the example above for m=5: \n            #       left_bound = 25, and trailing_zeros(25)=6, so we output 0.\n\n            #   But wait, what if m=26? \n            #       We have to find the smallest n with >=26: \n            #           trailing_zeros(124)= floor(124/5)+floor(124/25)+floor(124/125)=24+4+0=28 -> wait, let me compute 124: \n            #           124//5=24, 124//25=4, 124//125=0 -> 28 zeros.\n            #           But wait, we need the smallest n for 26. We can do binary search.\n\n            #   Actually, we are using two binary searches and the function trailing_zeros(n) is defined correctly.\n\n            #   But the problem: the gap between blocks is 5, so the code is efficient.\n\n            #   However, the issue is: the gap (the contiguous block) is always 5 numbers? \n\n            #   Let me check: \n            #       The trailing zeros change only at multiples of 5, and the change is by the number of factors of 5 in that number.

So the block for m=0 is [1,4] -> 4 numbers.\n\n            #   But the problem says m>=1.\n\n            #   However, the above reasoning shows that the contiguous block for m>=1 is either 0 or 5 numbers.\n\n            #   But wait, let me check m=100000: \n            #       The contiguous block should be 5 numbers.\n\n            #   Therefore, we can optimize: \n            #       Instead of storing the entire list of numbers (which might be 5 numbers, so we can store them), we can just output the count and then the five numbers.\n\n            #   However, the problem does not specify that the gap is 5, so we must rely on the general method.\n\n            #   But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000, and the gaps (the missing m values) occur when the jump is greater than 1.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently determining the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is primarily governed by the number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: \n   - **Left Bound**: Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Right Bound**: Similarly, find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m + 1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values lie between the left bound and the right bound minus one.\n\n3. **Validation**: Check if the left bound indeed gives exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. If not, there are no valid \\( n \\) values. Otherwise, the valid \\( n \\) values form a contiguous block from the left bound to the right bound minus one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    \n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n            \n    left_bound = low\n    if trailing_zeros(left_bound) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        low2 = 0\n        high2 = 5 * (m + 1)\n        while low2 < high2:\n            mid = (low2 + high2) // 2\n            if trailing_zeros(mid) < m + 1:\n                low2 = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high2 = mid\n                \n        right_bound = low2\n        count = right_bound - left_bound\n        print(count)\n        if count > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(left_bound, right_bound))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by counting the number of times \\( n \\) can be divided by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Left Bound**: The binary search starts with bounds 0 and \\( 5 \\times m \\). It adjusts the upper bound until it finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Validation**: After finding the left bound, the code checks if the trailing zeroes exactly match \\( m \\). If not, it outputs 0, indicating no valid \\( n \\) exists.\n\n4. **Binary Search for Right Bound**: Another binary search determines the smallest \\( n \\) where the trailing zeroes exceed \\( m \\) (i.e., at least \\( m + 1 \\)). The valid \\( n \\) values are those between the left bound and this new bound minus one.\n\n5. **Output**: The count of valid \\( n \\) values is printed, followed by the values themselves if they exist. The valid values are contiguous and can be generated by iterating from the left bound to the right bound minus one.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search, leveraging mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes, and handles edge cases where no valid \\( n \\) exists for the given \\( m \\).",
