Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a (angle in degrees)\n\n We have a regular convex n-gon. The vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n We need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 formed by the points v1, v2, v3 is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n Note: The angle at vertex v2 is the angle between the two sides (v1, v2) and (v2, v3). In a regular convex polygon, the vertices are equally spaced on a circle.\n\n Observation:\n In a regular n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n The angle we form at vertex v2 can be thought of as being determined by two arcs: from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the triangle to be formed by consecutive edges. But the polygon is regular, so the angle at v2 is determined by the two arcs (the two sets of edges from v2).\n\n Actually, the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle. The measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\n But note: in the circle, the entire circle is 360°. The two arcs from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3 (if we consider the minor arcs) might not cover the whole circle.\n\n However, we have two possibilities: the angle at v2 could be formed by two chords. The inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the central angle of the arc opposite to it.\n\n But note: the angle we are forming at v2 is actually the angle between the two chords (v2v1) and (v2v3). This angle is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc from v1 to v3 that does NOT contain v2.\n\n However, there is a simpler way: in a regular polygon, the angle at vertex v2 (which is on the circumference) for two points v1 and v3 is:\n\n   angle = (1/2) * |arc(v1, v3) - (full circle without the arc)|? \n\n Actually, let's think geometrically. The entire circle is 360°. The two arcs from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 (the minor ones) will add up to less than 360°, and the angle at v2 is the supplement of the central angle of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n The angle at v2 is the same as the angle between two chords. There is a formula:\n\n   angle = (1/2) * |central_angle(v1, v3) - 180°|   ??? \n\n Actually, wait: there are two arcs from v1 to v3: one passing through one side and the other passing through the other side. The inscribed angle is half the central angle of the arc that is intercepted by the angle. But note: the angle at v2 intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. However, we must consider the two possible arcs.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the polygon is cyclic and the angle at v2 is:\n\n   angle = (1/2) * (360° - central_angle_between_v1_and_v3)\n\n But wait, that is true only if the angle is the one that is facing the opposite side (like in a cyclic quadrilateral). Actually, the inscribed angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc.\n\n However, in our case, the angle at v2 intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. The central angle for that arc is (k * (360/n)), where k is the number of sides in the arc (but then we have to take the minor arc or major arc?).\n\n Actually, we can consider the two arcs: the one going clockwise and the one going counterclockwise from v1 to v3. The angle at v2 is the smaller angle, so the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite and the one that is less than 180°? Not necessarily.\n\n Let me recall: the inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. But note: the angle at v2 is formed by the two chords and the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. However, the intercepted arc is the one from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n So, the central angle for the intercepted arc is the number of edges between v1 and v3 (along the shorter path) multiplied by (360/n)? Actually, no: the central angle for an arc of k edges is k*(360/n). But the intercepted arc might be the longer one? Then the inscribed angle would be half of the longer one? \n\n Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the arc that is between the two points (v1 and v3) and that the angle \"sees\". Since we are inside the polygon and the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 must be the one that uses the arc that does not contain the rest of the polygon. \n\n But note: the entire circle is 360°. The intercepted arc (from v1 to v3) that does not contain v2 has a central angle of (let d be the number of edges from v1 to v3 along the arc that does not contain v2, then central angle = d*(360/n)). However, note that d can be from 1 to n-2.\n\n Then the inscribed angle (at v2) is half of that central angle? Actually, no: the inscribed angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc. But wait: if the intercepted arc is greater than 180°, then the inscribed angle is still half of it, but then the angle would be greater than 90°. However, in a convex polygon, the angle we form at v2 must be the internal angle? Or is it the angle we see?\n\n The problem states: the angle is formed by the two sides (v1, v2) and (v2, v3). In the context of the polygon, we are allowed to pick any three distinct vertices. The angle we compute is the one at v2. Since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 can be acute or obtuse, but note: the entire figure is cyclic.\n\n However, note: the angle we are forming is the angle between the two chords. This angle is the same as the inscribed angle.\n\n But wait, the inscribed angle theorem says: the angle at v2 is half the measure of the intercepted arc (which is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2). However, note that the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. And the inscribed angle is always the minor arc? Actually, no: the inscribed angle is defined for the arc that is intercepted, and it is half the central angle of that arc. But if the intercepted arc is more than 180°, then the angle would be more than 90°.\n\n However, in the problem, the polygon is convex and we are only considering the angle at the vertex. There are two angles: the one inside the polygon and the one outside. But note: the problem says \"the angle\" (with v1 and v3 lying on its sides). In the example, they consider angles like 45° and 90° for a square.\n\n Actually, let's consider the square (n=4). The central angle per side is 90°. The inscribed angle for two adjacent sides (so the two adjacent edges from a vertex) would be 90°? But wait, in a square, if we take three consecutive vertices (say 1,2,3) then the angle at 2 is 90°. However, if we take two non-adjacent sides (like from vertex 1, then skip some and then vertex 3) then we get different angles.\n\n But note: the problem allows any three distinct vertices. In a square, the possible angles are:\n\n   Case 1: three consecutive vertices: forms a right angle (90°).\n   Case 2: two consecutive and one skip: then the three vertices are not consecutive. For example, in square with vertices 1,2,3,4, if we take 1,2,4: then the angle at 2 is formed by the chord from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4. The central angle for the arc from 1 to 4 (not containing 2) is 90° (because from 1 to 4: clockwise: 1->2->3->4: 270°, but the other way is 90°). Then the inscribed angle would be half of 90° -> 45°.\n\n So the angle at vertex 2 for the triple (1,2,4) is 45°.\n\n Therefore, the angle we are computing is the inscribed angle, which is half the intercepted arc (the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2). The intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are given n and a.\n\n 2. The central angle per edge is 360/n.\n\n 3. The intercepted arc (in terms of edges) for the angle at v2 (with vertices v1, v2, v3) is the number of edges from v1 to v3 (along the arc that does not contain v2). Let this number be k (so the central angle is k*(360/n)). Then the inscribed angle is (k*(360/n))/2.\n\n However, note: the intercepted arc can be measured in two ways. Actually, the inscribed angle is also defined by the arc that is intercepted, and we take the minor arc? But wait, in the square example: the intercepted arc for the 45° angle was the minor arc (90°) and for the 90° angle the intercepted arc was 180°? \n\n Wait, for the 90° angle (three consecutive vertices) in the square: \n   The intercepted arc from v1 to v3 (for the angle at v2) is the arc that does not contain v2. In the square, if we take three consecutive vertices (v1, v2, v3) then the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 is the long way: from v1 to v3 going the other side (which is 270°). Then the inscribed angle would be 270°/2 = 135°, which is not 90°.\n\n So that doesn't match.\n\n Let me reexamine: \n\n In the square, when we take three consecutive vertices (1,2,3), the angle at 2 is 90°. This angle is formed by the two sides (from 2 to 1 and 2 to 3). The intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 3 that does not contain 2. In the square, from 1 to 3, the two arcs are: \n   Arc1: 1->2->3 (which contains 2, so we don't use that for the inscribed angle because the angle is formed by the two chords from 2, so the intercepted arc is the opposite one: 1->4->3). That arc has central angle 180° (because it goes from 1 to 3 via 4: two edges, so 2*(360/4)=180°). Then the inscribed angle is 180°/2 = 90°.\n\n So the formula is: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain the vertex v2. In the square, for the consecutive vertices, the intercepted arc is the one that goes the other way (which is 180°) and the angle is 90°.\n\n Similarly, for the triple (1,2,4) in the square: \n   The angle at 2 is formed by the chords from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4. The intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2. The two arcs from 1 to 4: \n        One is 1->2->3->4 (central angle 270°) and the other is 1->4 (central angle 90°). The one that does not contain 2 is the 90° arc. Then the angle is 90°/2 = 45°.\n\n Therefore, the general formula:\n\n   Let d = the minimum number of edges between v1 and v3 (along the circle) in the two directions. Then the intercepted arc (the one that does not contain v2) is either:\n        Option1: the arc of length d (if we take the direct arc) OR\n        Option2: the arc of length (n - d) (the complementary arc)\n\n   But note: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. However, we are free to choose the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) from v1 to v3. But the angle is the same regardless of the direction? Actually, the inscribed angle is the same for the minor arc and the major arc? No, the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc. But note: the intercepted arc is uniquely defined as the one opposite to the angle.\n\n   Actually, the intercepted arc is the one that is between v1 and v3 (the two points) and that does not include the vertex v2. So the intercepted arc is fixed once we fix v1, v2, v3.\n\n   However, note: the circle has two arcs between v1 and v3. The one that does not contain v2 is the one that goes the opposite way.\n\n   How to compute the intercepted arc? \n\n   Let the vertices be labeled 0 to n-1 (for simplicity, then we can map back to 1-indexed). Let v2 be fixed. Then the two arcs from v1 to v3 (without containing v2) are:\n\n        Let d1 = the clockwise distance from v1 to v3 (number of edges) and d2 = the counterclockwise distance from v1 to v3 (number of edges). Then the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. \n\n   But note: we are measuring the central angle. The central angle for an arc of d edges is d*(360/n). The total circle is 360°, so the two arcs from v1 to v3 are d1 and d2, with d1 + d2 = n (if we consider edges, because the entire circle has n edges). Actually, the entire circle has n edges, so the two arcs (in terms of edges) from v1 to v3 must sum to n.\n\n   However, wait: if we have n vertices, then the circle has n edges. The arc from v1 to v3 (clockwise) is the number of edges from v1 to v3, which is (v3 - v1 - 1) mod n? Actually, we have to define the distance in terms of steps (edges). The arc length in edges is the number of edges traversed. \n\n   Example: n=4, from vertex 0 to vertex 2 (clockwise): we traverse edges 0->1 and 1->2, so 2 edges. The central angle is 2*(360/4)=180°.\n\n   But note: the entire circle is 360°, so the two arcs from v1 to v3 (clockwise and counterclockwise) have central angles of (d_edges * (360/n)) and ((n - d_edges) * (360/n)).\n\n   Now, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. So we have two possibilities: \n        Possibility 1: the intercepted arc is the one that is the clockwise arc from v1 to v3 (if v2 is not on that arc) OR\n        Possibility 2: the other one.\n\n   However, note: the angle at v2 is the same regardless of which arc we choose? Actually, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the intercepted arc (the one that is opposite). But note: the intercepted arc must be the one that is opposite to the vertex v2. \n\n   But here is the catch: the inscribed angle is defined for the arc that is between v1 and v3 and that the angle \"sees\". In our case, the angle at v2 sees the arc that is opposite to it. Since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 is the one that is facing the interior. Therefore, the intercepted arc is the one that is the shorter one? Actually, no: in the square example, the intercepted arc for the consecutive triple was the longer arc (180°) and for the non-consecutive triple was the shorter arc (90°). \n\n   Actually, the intercepted arc is the one that is not containing v2. And note: the angle at v2 is the one that is facing the arc that is opposite. Therefore, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, and it can be either the minor or the major arc. But note: the inscribed angle is always taken to be the smaller one? Actually, the angle we compute is the one that is in the polygon, and the polygon is convex, so the angle at v2 must be less than 180°. \n\n   However, the inscribed angle can be defined for arcs greater than 180°, but then the angle would be greater than 90°. And in the square, we got 90° and 45°.\n\n   The key: the angle we are interested in is the one that is formed by the two chords and that lies inside the polygon. This angle is the one that is less than 180°. And the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite, and the central angle of that arc must be the one that is greater than 180°? Actually, no: the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc, but if the intercepted arc is greater than 180°, then the inscribed angle is still half of it, and that would be greater than 90°. \n\n   But wait: in the square, the intercepted arc for the consecutive triple was 180° (which is not greater than 180°, it is equal). Then the angle is 90°.\n\n   Actually, the inscribed angle is defined as half the intercepted arc, and the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite. And the angle we get is the one that is facing the intercepted arc.\n\n   However, note: the angle at the circumference is half the central angle of the intercepted arc, but the intercepted arc must be the one that is between v1 and v3 and that is opposite to the vertex. But in our case, the vertex v2 is on the circle, and the two points v1 and v3 divide the circle into two arcs. The angle at v2 is half the difference between the two arcs? \n\n   Actually, there is a more general formula for the angle between two chords: the angle is half the sum or half the difference? \n\n   Let me recall: the angle between two chords that intersect at a point on the circle is an inscribed angle. The inscribed angle theorem: the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\n   So, in summary, the angle at v2 is (intercepted_arc_central_angle)/2.\n\n   But what is the intercepted_arc_central_angle? It is the central angle of the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n   How to compute the intercepted arc central angle?\n\n        Let d = the number of edges in the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n        Then central_angle = d * (360/n)\n\n        Then angle = central_angle / 2.\n\n   But note: the entire circle is 360°, so the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 is the one that is the complement of the arc that goes from v1 to v3 via v2? \n\n   Alternatively, we can fix the vertex v2. Then the circle is broken by v2. The two arcs from v1 to v3 are the two parts. One part goes through v2 and the other does not. But wait, the arc that goes through v2 is the one that contains v2, so the intercepted arc is the other one.\n\n   However, we are free to choose v1 and v3. The idea is to iterate over all possibilities? But n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot iterate over O(n^2) possibilities.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n   We know that the angle we can form is of the form: (d * (360/n)) / 2, where d is the number of edges in the intercepted arc (the one that does not contain v2). But note: the intercepted arc must be the one that is opposite to v2, and d must be between 1 and n-1 (since we are skipping at least one edge and at most n-2 edges). \n\n   However, note: the angle must be positive and less than 180° (because the polygon is convex, the angle we form must be the one facing the interior, and in a convex polygon the interior angle is less than 180°). But wait, the angle we form is the one at the vertex, and in the polygon the interior angle is fixed (for a given vertex) but we are allowed to choose any three vertices. \n\n   Actually, the angle we form is the inscribed angle, and the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc can be from 1 to n-1 edges (so central angle from 360/n to (n-1)*360/n). Then the angle we form is from (360/(2*n)) to (360/2)*( (n-1)/n ) = 180*(n-1)/n. \n\n   But note: the maximum angle we can form is less than 180°? Because the intercepted arc cannot exceed 360° (but we are taking the minor arc? Actually, no: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, and if the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) is more than 180°, then the angle is more than 90°. But the maximum intercepted arc is n-1 edges, so the central angle is (n-1)*360/n, and the angle is (n-1)*180/n. \n\n   For n>=3, (n-1)*180/n is less than 180°? Yes, because (n-1)/n < 1.\n\n   Therefore, the angle we form is always less than 180°.\n\n   Now, the problem: we are to find the three distinct vertices that minimize |angle - a|.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   We note that the angle is determined by the intercepted arc (in edges) d (from 1 to n-1). The angle value is (d * (360/n)) / 2 = (180/n)*d.\n\n   But wait, is that correct? In the square: n=4, d=2 -> angle = (180/4)*2 = 45*2 = 90° -> correct. d=1 -> angle = (180/4)*1 = 45° -> correct.\n\n   However, note: the intercepted arc d is the number of edges in the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. But note: the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) can be represented by two possibilities: the direct arc (with d edges) and the complementary arc (n-d edges). However, the angle is determined by the intercepted arc (the one opposite to v2) and that is the one that does not contain v2.\n\n   But note: the same three vertices (v1, v2, v3) can be represented in two orders? Actually, the angle is the same if we swap v1 and v3? Because the intercepted arc remains the same.\n\n   However, the problem requires distinct vertices and the order matters (v1, v2, v3) but the angle is defined with v2 as the vertex.\n\n   Now, how do we relate d to the actual vertices? \n\n   We have a fixed vertex v2. Then we can choose two other vertices: one on the left (counterclockwise) and one on the right (clockwise). But note: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so if we fix v2, then the arc from v1 to v3 (the intercepted one) must not contain v2. \n\n   Actually, the intercepted arc is the one that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2. So the two vertices v1 and v3 must lie on opposite sides of v2 (or possibly one of them can be adjacent to v2?).\n\n   But note: the entire circle is broken by v2. The intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so the two points v1 and v3 must lie on the same side? Actually, no: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so v1 and v3 must lie on opposite sides of v2? \n\n   Let me clarify: the circle has vertex v2. The two arcs from v2 are: one going clockwise and one going counterclockwise. The intercepted arc (the one that does not contain v2) is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not go through v2. Therefore, v1 and v3 must lie on the two different sides of v2? Actually, no: they can lie on the same side? \n\n   Example: in the square, we had the triple (1,2,4): \n        v2 = 2, then v1=1 and v3=4. The arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2 is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 without passing through 2. In the square, the two sides from 2 are: clockwise: 2->3->4, counterclockwise: 2->1. So the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2 is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 via the counterclockwise direction? Actually, the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2 is the direct arc (which is one edge: 1->4) because the other arc (via 2) goes from 1->2->3->4, which contains 2.\n\n   But note: the two points v1 and v3 are chosen arbitrarily. The intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so if we fix v2, then the two points v1 and v3 must lie on the circle without stepping on v2. \n\n   However, the entire circle is broken by v2. The intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so the two points v1 and v3 must lie on the two opposite sides of v2? Actually, they can lie on the same side? \n\n   Consider: if both v1 and v3 are on the same side of v2 (say the clockwise side), then the intercepted arc (the one that does not contain v2) would be the arc from v1 to v3 that goes the other way (the counterclockwise side) and that does contain v2? Actually, no: the intercepted arc is defined as the one that does not contain v2, so if we choose two points on the same side, then the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 is the one that goes the long way (the other side) and that does not contain v2? \n\n   Actually, the definition: the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. So if v1 and v3 are on the same side of v2, then the short arc from v1 to v3 (on that side) does not contain v2? \n\n   But wait, if v1 and v3 are on the same side (clockwise from v2) then the arc from v1 to v3 that goes clockwise (on the same side) does not contain v2 (because v2 is the starting point and we are going away from it). Actually, no: the arc from v1 to v3 that is on the clockwise side of v2 does not contain v2? \n\n   Let me label the square again: vertices 1,2,3,4 (clockwise). Fix v2=2. Then the two sides are: \n        Clockwise: 2->3->4\n        Counterclockwise: 2->1\n\n   Now, if I choose v1=3 and v3=4 (both on the clockwise side from 2), then the intercepted arc (the one that does not contain 2) is the arc from 3 to 4 that does not contain 2. The two arcs from 3 to 4: \n        Arc1: 3->4 (clockwise) -> does not contain 2.\n        Arc2: 3->2->1->4 (counterclockwise) -> contains 2.\n\n   So the intercepted arc is the minor arc (3->4) of 1 edge. Then the angle is (1 * (360/4))/2 = 90/2 = 45°.\n\n   Now, if I choose v1=1 and v3=3 (one on each side), then the intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 3 that does not contain 2. The two arcs from 1 to 3:\n        Arc1: 1->2->3 (contains 2)\n        Arc2: 1->4->3 (does not contain 2) -> 2 edges, central angle 180°, angle 90°.\n\n   Therefore, the angle depends on the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\n   But note: the angle is determined solely by the intercepted arc (the central angle of the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2). The intercepted arc is the one that is the opposite side.\n\n   How to compute the intercepted arc from two vertices v1 and v3 (without v2)? \n\n        We have two points on the circle. The circle is divided into two arcs. The intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. \n\n   However, we are trying to avoid iterating over all triples (which is O(n^2)). \n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n        The angle is (intercepted_arc_central_angle)/2, and the intercepted_arc_central_angle = d * (360/n), so angle = d * (180/n).\n\n        But note: d is the number of edges in the intercepted arc (the arc that does not contain v2). The entire circle has n edges, so the intercepted arc has d edges, and the other arc has n-d edges.\n\n        The condition is that the intercepted arc must not contain v2. But note: the arc from v1 to v3 (the intercepted one) has d edges, so it covers d edges. The vertex v2 must not lie on that arc.\n\n        However, we can also note: the angle is determined by d, and d can range from 1 to n-1. But note: for a fixed d, there are many triples (v1, v2, v3) that yield the same angle. \n\n   Therefore, we can iterate over possible d (from 1 to n-1) and check the absolute difference |angle - a|, and then choose the best d. Then, we have to find a triple (v1, v2, v3) that produces that d.\n\n   But note: the angle is (d * 180 / n). However, is that always true?\n\n        Example: n=5, d=1 -> angle = 180/5 = 36°.\n        Example: n=5, d=2 -> angle = 36*2 = 72°.\n\n        But wait, what about d=3? 3*36=108°.\n\n        And d=4: 4*36=144°.\n\n        But note: the intercepted arc must be the one that does not contain v2. In the above, we assumed that the intercepted arc is the one with d edges. However, for a fixed triple (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is fixed. \n\n        But note: the same d can be achieved by different placements. However, the angle only depends on d.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the intercepted arc must be the one that does not contain v2, and the arc must be the one that is opposite. But note: the arc with d edges is uniquely defined by the triple? \n\n        Actually, for a fixed triple (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, and the number of edges in that arc is d. But note: the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that does not contain v2) is the one that goes the long way if the direct arc (containing v2) is short? \n\n        Actually, no: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so if the direct arc (from v1 to v3) contains v2, then we take the other one. But wait, the direct arc (the one that goes from v1 to v3 without going through v2) is the one that does not contain v2. \n\n        However, the direct arc (the one that does not contain v2) is the one that is the minimal arc? Not necessarily: sometimes the direct arc might be the long way, but we are forced to take the one that does not contain v2. \n\n        But note: the two arcs from v1 to v3 are of lengths d and n-d (in edges). The one that does not contain v2 is the one that has the edges that do not include the segment from v2 to ... \n\n        Actually, the condition for which arc does not contain v2 is independent of the length: we just choose the arc that does not have v2.\n\n        Therefore, the angle is (d * 180 / n) where d is the number of edges in the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n        But note: the same d can be achieved by different pairs (v1, v3) for a fixed v2? \n\n        However, we are free to choose any three distinct vertices. We want to minimize the absolute difference between (d * 180 / n) and a.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Precompute all possible angles: for d in [1, n-1], the angle = d * (180.0 / n). But note: the same angle may be repeated by multiple d? Actually, d is integer, so the angles are distinct unless n divides 180*d by coincidence? \n\n   2. Then, we want the d0 in [1, n-1] that minimizes |(d0 * 180 / n) - a|.\n\n   3. Then, we need to output a triple (v1, v2, v3) that yields the angle (d0 * 180 / n). \n\n   But wait: is every d in [1, n-1] achievable? \n\n        Yes: for a fixed d, we can choose any vertex v2. Then we need two vertices: one at distance x (edges) clockwise from v2 and the other at distance d-x (edges) counterclockwise from v2? \n\n        Actually, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, and it has d edges. Then the two vertices v1 and v3 must be chosen such that the arc from v1 to v3 (without v2) is d edges. \n\n        But note: the arc from v1 to v3 (without v2) can be broken down into two parts: from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3? Actually, no: the intercepted arc does not contain v2, so v1 and v3 are separated by d edges (so the arc from v1 to v3 has d edges). \n\n        How to assign the vertices? \n\n        Let the vertices be arranged in a circle: 0,1,...,n-1.\n\n        Suppose we fix v2 at position 0. Then the two vertices v1 and v3 must lie on the circle such that the arc from v1 to v3 (without passing 0) has d edges. \n\n        But note: the arc from v1 to v3 without passing 0 is the one that goes, say, from a negative index to a positive index? \n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the entire circle is broken by v2 (vertex 0). The two sides: one from 0 to n-1 (clockwise) and one from 0 to 1 (counterclockwise). \n\n        The intercepted arc (without 0) is the one that goes from v1 to v3 without passing 0. \n\n        We can choose v1 and v3 arbitrarily as long as the number of edges from v1 to v3 (without passing 0) is d.\n\n        However, note: the arc from v1 to v3 (without 0) must be exactly d edges. \n\n        The two vertices must be placed such that the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that does not contain 0) is d",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficient computation to determine the optimal vertices without exhaustive search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the angle formed at any vertex in a regular convex n-gon can be derived from the intercepted arc between the other two vertices. The angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc. The central angle is determined by the number of edges in the intercepted arc multiplied by (360/n) degrees.\n\n2. **Insight**: For each possible intercepted arc length `d` (from 1 to n-1 edges), the corresponding angle is `(d * 180 / n)` degrees. We need to find the `d` that minimizes the absolute difference between this angle and the given angle `a`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over all possible arc lengths `d` from 1 to n-1.\n   - For each `d`, compute the angle and its absolute difference from `a`.\n   - Track the `d` with the smallest difference.\n   - Once the optimal `d` is found, determine the vertices: fix the middle vertex (v2) and place the other two vertices (v1 and v3) such that the intercepted arc between them has exactly `d` edges, ensuring they are distinct and form the desired angle.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time since it iterates over `n` possible values of `d` once. Each iteration involves constant-time operations, making the solution efficient for large `n` (up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = float(data[1])\n    \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_d = None\n    best_angle = None\n    \n    for d in range(1, n):\n        angle_val = (d * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_d = d\n            best_angle = angle_val\n    \n    if best_d is None:\n        best_d = 1\n    \n    d = best_d\n    angle_val = (d * 180.0) / n\n    \n    v2 = 1\n    step1 = (d // 2) + (d % 2)\n    left_step = step1\n    right_step = d - left_step\n    \n    v1 = v2 - left_step\n    if v1 < 1:\n        v1 += n\n    \n    v3 = v2 + right_step\n    if v3 > n:\n        v3 -= n\n    \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle in degrees).\n2. **Finding Optimal Arc Length**: The code calculates the angle for each possible arc length `d` (from 1 to n-1) and tracks the `d` that results in the angle closest to `a`.\n3. **Vertex Selection**: Once the optimal `d` is found, the middle vertex (v2) is fixed at position 1. The other two vertices (v1 and v3) are positioned such that the intercepted arc between them contains exactly `d` edges. This is done by adjusting their positions relative to v2 using integer division and modulo operations to handle circular arrangement.\n4. **Output**: The vertices v1, v2, and v3 are printed, forming the desired angle configuration.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the optimal solution by leveraging geometric properties and avoids the need for an exhaustive search, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
