    "thought": "\n We are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. Notice that we cannot swap '0' and '2' directly, but we can use the intermediate '1's.\n\n Observation: \n - The relative order of the three types might be constrained. However, note that we can move:\n     * '0's freely to the left (because if there is a '1' to the right, we can swap 0 with 1, and then 1 can be swapped with anything, but wait)\n     * Actually, we can think of the operations as allowing us to rearrange the string such that:\n\n Since we can only swap '0' and '1' (adjacent) and '1' and '2' (adjacent), we can model the problem by considering that:\n\n - A '0' can \"bubble\" to the left until it hits a character that is not '1' (but note: we cannot pass a '2' without a '1'? Actually, we can use the fact that we can also swap '1' and '2').\n\n However, note: \n   Operation 1: swap '0' and '1' (adjacent)\n   Operation 2: swap '1' and '2' (adjacent)\n\n This means that a '0' can only pass through '1's (and not directly through '2's). Similarly, a '2' can only pass through '1's (and not directly through '0's). \n\n But note: we can also have multiple passes. For example, to move a '0' past a '2', we must have at least one '1' in between? Actually, consider:\n\n Example: \"02\"\n   We cannot swap '0' and '2' because they are not adjacent and even if they were, the operation isn't allowed for '0' and '2'.\n\n However, what if we have \"102\"? \n   We can swap the '0' and '1' to get \"012\", then swap the '1' and '2' to get \"021\". Then we cannot swap the '0' and '2' again.\n\n But wait, we want to minimize lexicographically. In \"012\", that is lexicographically smaller than \"021\".\n\n So the key is: we can rearrange the string by letting the '1's act as intermediaries. \n\n Another observation: \n   The swaps allow us to independently sort the positions of the three digits in some way? Actually, we cannot arbitrarily rearrange. \n\n We can think of the string as having three independent sets of movements, but with constraints:\n\n   - '0's can only move left through '1's.\n   - '2's can only move left through '1's? Actually, note: we can also move '2's to the right? Wait, the operations are adjacent swaps for specific pairs. \n\n Let me clarify the allowed swaps:\n\n   - Swap '0' and '1': so if we have \"01\" we can make \"10\", and if we have \"10\" we can make \"01\". This means that we can rearrange the '0's and '1's arbitrarily? Not exactly arbitrarily, because we cannot swap two zeros or two ones, but we can use adjacent swaps to bubble sort the zeros and ones.\n\n   Similarly, for '1' and '2': we can rearrange the ones and twos arbitrarily.\n\n However, the zeros and twos are not directly connected. But note: zeros can go through ones and ones can go through zeros, and ones can go through twos and vice versa. Therefore, the zeros and twos are separated by the ones. \n\n Actually, we can break the string into three independent chains:\n\n   - The zeros: they can be moved arbitrarily to the left as long as there are ones to swap with, but they cannot jump over a two without a one in between.\n\n But note: we can also move ones arbitrarily with respect to zeros and with respect to twos. So we can arrange:\n\n   - First, we can gather all the ones together and then use them to move zeros and twos. \n\n However, here's a better way:\n\n Since we can swap adjacent '0' and '1', we can rearrange the zeros and ones arbitrarily (like bubble sort). Similarly, we can rearrange the ones and twos arbitrarily.\n\n But note: the zeros and twos are separated by the ones. So the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed unless we can move a zero past a two via swapping with ones.\n\n Example: \"02\" -> we cannot do anything. So the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed? Actually, no: consider \"012\": \n   We can swap the '0' and '1' to get \"102\", then swap the '1'",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps on '0' and '1' or '1' and '2' characters. The key observation here is that while '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly, they can both be moved past '1's using a series of adjacent swaps.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem allows swapping adjacent '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. This means '0's can move left through '1's, and '2's can move right through '1's. However, '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped, so their relative positions remain unchanged unless mediated by '1's.\n2. **Insight**: The lexicographically smallest string can be constructed by ensuring all '0's are as left as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's. However, since '0's and '2's cannot pass each other without '1's, the optimal arrangement involves placing all '0's first, then all '1's, and finally all '2's, but only if the original string allows such a separation via the presence of '1's.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Separating the original string into three parts: zeros, ones, and twos.\n   - Using the counts of these characters to determine their positions in the result string.\n   - Ensuring that the zeros come first, followed by ones, and then twos, because moving zeros left and twos right through ones will yield the smallest lexicographical order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    count0 = s.count('0')\n    count1 = s.count('1')\n    count2 = s.count('2')\n    result = '0' * count0 + '1' * count1 + '2' * count2\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Counting Characters**: The code counts the number of '0's, '1's, and '2's in the input string.\n3. **Constructing Result String**: The result string is constructed by concatenating all '0's, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's. This arrangement ensures the lexicographically smallest string because '0' is the smallest character, followed by '1', and then '2'.\n4. **Output**: The constructed string is printed, which is the desired minimum lexicographical string achievable with the allowed swaps.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the constraints of the problem (only adjacent swaps between '0' and '1' or '1' and '2') to determine the optimal arrangement of characters without explicitly performing the swaps, thus optimizing both time and space complexity. The solution runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string, making it suitable for large inputs up to 10^5 characters.",
