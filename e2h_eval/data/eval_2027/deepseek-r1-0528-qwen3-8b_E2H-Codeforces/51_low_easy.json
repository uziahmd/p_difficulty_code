Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to combine the first two strings (guest's name and host's name) and then check if the combined string has exactly the same letters as the third string (the pile), with the same frequencies.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any extra whitespace.\n 2. Concatenate the first two strings to form the expected string.\n 3. Compare the sorted list of characters of the expected string with the sorted list of characters of the third string.\n 4. If they are the same, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the example input has multiple test cases? Actually, the problem says the input file consists of three lines for one test case. But the example output shows a list of answers for three different examples.\n\n But wait, the problem states: \n   Input: The input file consists of three lines: [guest name], [host name], [pile]\n\n And the example input is given as:\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n This example input seems to be a list of three different test cases? Actually, reading the problem statement again, it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input and output. \n\n However, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\" for one test case. But then the example input is provided as a single string with three parts separated by '\\n'. \n\n Let me clarify: The example input is actually three separate test cases? Or is the example input just one sample?\n\n Looking at the example output: \n   ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n This implies that the example input has three test cases. But the problem says the input file has three lines for one test case.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\" meaning one test case per run? Or maybe the example input is provided in a way that there are three test cases?\n\n Let me re-read: \n   Input: The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\n\n So each test case has three lines. But the example input is given as a string that contains three lines (with newlines). \n\n However, the example input is provided as a list of three strings? Actually, the example input is:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ... ]\n\n But wait, the problem says \"The input file\", so we are reading from standard input. In competitive programming, the input might be multiple test cases? \n\n Actually, the problem statement says: \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning one test case. But the example output has three answers. \n\n Clarification from the example: the example input has three test cases? Or the example input is a representation of three test cases?\n\n Let me look again: the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being a concatenation of three lines? That doesn't match.\n\n Alternatively, the example input is one string that contains three lines? Then we read three lines from stdin.\n\n However, the example input format is:\n\n   Input:\n     SANTACLAUS\n     DEDMOROZ\n     SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Then next test case?\n   But the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so probably one test case.\n\n But then how do we get three outputs? \n\n Actually, the example input in the problem is:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n This is confusing. It seems the example input is three test cases, each test case being a string of three lines? But that would be 9 lines. \n\n After reading the example again, I see:\n\n   Example Input: \n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ... ]\n\n   This is actually a representation of three test cases, but each test case is given as a string that has three lines (so each string is the concatenation of three lines).\n\n However, the problem says: the input file consists of three lines (for one test case). \n\n This is ambiguous. But looking at the example output:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the combined letters of both names match the letters in the pile exactly, including their counts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read three lines from the input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Letter Counts**: Compare the sorted list of characters from the combined names with the sorted list of characters from the pile. If both lists are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the original names; otherwise, it cannot.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter composition by leveraging sorting, which ensures that the counts of each letter are compared correctly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest_name = input().strip()\n    host_name = input().strip()\n    pile_letters = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest_name + host_name\n    \n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile_letters):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The program reads three strings: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters. Each input is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string, `combined`.\n3. **Checking Letter Counts**: The program sorts the characters of the `combined` string and the pile of letters. If the sorted lists are identical, it prints \"YES\", indicating the pile can be rearranged to form the original names. Otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis method efficiently verifies the required conditions by ensuring the multiset of letters in the pile matches exactly with the multiset derived from the combined names, thus solving the problem.",
