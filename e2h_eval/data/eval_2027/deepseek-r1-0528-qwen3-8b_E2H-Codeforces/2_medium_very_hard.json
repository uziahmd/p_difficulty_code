Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all the letters must be the same (the same letter for the entire diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, and that letter must be different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the two diagonals might have different letters? Actually, the problem says:\n   - Both diagonals have the same letter (so the same letter for the entire main diagonal and the entire anti-diagonal)\n   - The non-diagonal squares must have a different letter (same as each other) and not the diagonal letter.\n\n But note: the example input:\n    5\n    xooox\n    oxoxo\n    soxoo\n    oxoxo\n    xooox\n\n In this example, the diagonals are both 'x' (from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left) but the center is part of both diagonals and that's okay because it's the same letter.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n.\n 2. Read the grid (n lines)\n\n Let's define:\n   Let the grid be `grid` with dimensions n x n.\n\n Conditions to check:\n\n Condition 1: The main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) should have the same letter, say `d`.\n Condition 2: The anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) should have the same letter, and that letter must also be `d`.\n\n Condition 3: For every cell not on either diagonal, the letter must be the same (say `other`) and `other != d`.\n\n However, note: what if the two diagonals don't have the same letter? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n But wait, the problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\", meaning the entire main diagonal is one letter and the entire anti-diagonal is the same letter. It does not explicitly say they must be the same as each other. However, looking at the example and the problem statement, we must assume that the two diagonals must be the same letter? Actually, let me re-read: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n This means:\n   - For the main diagonal: all letters are the same (say A)\n   - For the anti-diagonal: all letters are the same (say B)\n\n But then condition 3: the other squares must be the same letter (say C) and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n However, the example outputs: \n      Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> YES\n      Here, the diagonals are both 'w' (because the main diagonal: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='s', [2][2]='w'] -> wait, that's not the same letter! \n\n Let me check the example: \n      Input: 3\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n Actually, in the example, the main diagonal is ['w','w','w']? No, wait: \n   Row0: index0: 'w'\n   Row1: index1: 'w'\n   Row2: index2: 'w'\n\n But wait, the example input is given as:\n        '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'\n\n So the grid is:\n        row0: 'w','s','w'\n        row1: 's','w','s'\n        row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n Therefore, main diagonal: \n        grid[0][0] = 'w'\n        grid[1][1] = 'w'\n        grid[2][2] = 'w'\n\n Anti-diagonal:\n        grid[0][2] = 'w'\n        grid[1][1] = 'w'\n        grid[2][0] = 'w'\n\n So both diagonals are all 'w'. Then the other squares are the ones that are not on the diagonals: \n        (0,1): 's'\n        (1,0): 's'\n        (1,2): 's'\n        (2,1): 's'\n\n So they are all 's' and 's' is different from 'w'. So that's valid.\n\n But wait, the example input was provided as a list of strings. The example that fails is:\n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n The third example: \n        Input: 3\n            x p x\n            p x p\n            x p x\n\n Now, the diagonals: \n        Main diagonal: ['x','x','x'] -> all 'x'\n        Anti-diagonal: ['x','x','x'] -> all 'x'\n\n Then the other squares: \n        (0,1): 'p'\n        (1,0): 'p'\n        (1,2): 'p'\n        (2,1): 'p'\n\n They are all 'p' and 'p' is different from 'x'. So by the conditions above, this would be \"YES\". \n\n However, the expected output for the third example is \"NO\".\n\n Why? Let me read the problem again: \n        \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n But note: the example input is:\n\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpx\n\n The grid is:\n        ['x','p','x']\n        ['p','x','p']\n        ['x','p','x']\n\n Now, the diagonals are the set of indices (i,i) and (i, n-1-i). \n\n However, note that the center is included in both diagonals. The condition says \"both diagonals\" meaning the entire main diagonal and the entire anti-diagonal. \n\n But wait, in the third example, the diagonals are both 'x'? Actually, the main diagonal: \n        [0][0] = 'x'\n        [1][1] = 'x'\n        [2][2] = 'x'\n\n The anti-diagonal:\n        [0][2] = 'x'\n        [1][1] = 'x'\n        [2][0] = 'x'\n\n So the diagonals are all 'x'. Then the other squares (non-diagonals) are:\n        (0,1): 'p'\n        (1,0): 'p'\n        (1,2): 'p'\n        (2,1): 'p'\n\n So they are all 'p'. And 'p' != 'x'. So why is the answer \"NO\"?\n\n Let me check the example output provided: \n        ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n The third example is expected to be \"NO\".\n\n There must be an additional constraint: the problem says \"both diagonals\" meaning the entire main diagonal must be the same letter and the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter, but note that the center is shared. However, the example output for the third example is NO.\n\n After reading the example input again: \n        The third example input is: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\n\n Wait, the last character in the third row is 'e'? \n\n The example input as given in the problem is: \n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n So the third example is actually:\n\n        n=3\n        line1: \"xpx\"\n        line2: \"pxp\"\n        line3: \"xpe\"\n\n So the grid is:\n        ['x','p','x']\n        ['p','x','p']\n        ['x','p','e']\n\n Now, the diagonals:\n        Main diagonal: [0][0]='x', [1][1]='x', [2][2]='e' -> not all same (has 'e' at the end). So the main diagonal is not uniform.\n\n Therefore, the third example fails because the main diagonal has an 'e' at the last element.\n\n So the issue is that the third example does not have the same letter on the main diagonal (because the last element is 'e').\n\n Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n Step 1: Read n and the grid.\n\n Step 2: \n   Let d1 = the letter on the main diagonal. We'll check that all the main diagonal letters are the same.\n   Let d2 = the letter on the anti-diagonal. We'll check that all the anti-diagonal letters are the same.\n\n   Also, note: the center (if n>=3, the center is at (n//2, n//2)) is included in both diagonals. So we require that the center letter is the same for both? Actually, the two diagonals must be the same letter? Or can they be different?\n\n Let me reread the problem statement: \n        \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n This could mean that the main diagonal is one letter (say A) and the anti-diagonal is one letter (say B). But then the center is in both so A must equal B. \n\n However, the example: \n        Example 1: \n            n=5, the diagonals are both 'x'\n        Example 2: \n            n=3, the diagonals are both 'w'\n        Example 3: \n            n=3, the diagonals are not the same: main diagonal has 'x','x','e' -> not uniform, and anti-diagonal has 'x','x','x' -> uniform.\n\n So the problem does not explicitly state that the two diagonals must be the same letter. It says \"on both diagonals\" meaning each diagonal individually has the same letter. However, note that the center is common to both, so if the main diagonal has a center letter and the anti-diagonal has the same center letter, then the entire anti-diagonal must be the same as the center and the entire main diagonal must be the same as the center. \n\n But wait, the problem does not say the two diagonals must be the same letter. It says:\n        \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n This can be interpreted as:\n        (a) The main diagonal has the same letter throughout.\n        (b) The anti-diagonal has the same letter throughout.\n\n However, the example 3 has the main diagonal not having the same letter (because the last element is 'e'), so condition (a) fails.\n\n But note: the example 3 input is given as:\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpe\n\n The main diagonal: \n        grid[0][0] = 'x'\n        grid[1][1] = 'x'\n        grid[2][2] = 'e'   -> so not the same.\n\n Therefore, the condition (a) fails.\n\n However, the example 2: \n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n Main diagonal: \n        grid[0][0] = 'w'\n        grid[1][1] = 'w'\n        grid[2][2] = 'w'\n\n Anti-diagonal:\n        grid[0][2] = 'w'\n        grid[1][1] = 'w'\n        grid[2][0] = 'w'\n\n So condition (a) and (b) hold.\n\n Then, condition (c): All non-diagonal cells must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n How do we check condition (c)? \n\n We can:\n   Let d = the letter that is on the main diagonal (which is the same for all main diagonal cells). Similarly, the anti-diagonal must have the same letter (by condition (b)) and that letter must be d because the center is common? Actually, no: the problem doesn't say the two diagonals must be the same. But note: the center is common, so if the main diagonal has a uniform letter and the anti-diagonal has a uniform letter, then the center must be the same for both. Therefore, the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal must be the same letter (because the center is fixed). \n\n However, wait: what if the two diagonals have different letters? Then the center being part of both would force the two diagonals to have the same letter. Therefore, the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n But the problem statement does not explicitly say that. However, the example 3 fails because the main diagonal is not uniform. So the condition (a) must hold.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check that the main diagonal is composed of the same letter. If not, output \"NO\".\n 2. Check that the anti-diagonal is composed of the same letter. Since the center is common, the anti-diagonal must be the same letter as the main diagonal? Actually, if the main diagonal is uniform, then the center is known. The anti-diagonal must have the same letter at the center, so if the anti-diagonal is uniform and the center is the same, then the entire anti-diagonal is the same as the main diagonal's letter.\n\n However, wait: the problem does not require the two diagonals to be the same letter. But note: the center is included in both. So if the main diagonal is uniform (say letter A) and the anti-diagonal is uniform (say letter B), then the center must be both A and B. Hence A must equal B.\n\n Therefore, we can just check that the entire main diagonal is one letter (say `d`). Then, we must check that the entire anti-diagonal is the same letter `d`. Alternatively, we can check that the anti-diagonal is uniform and then check that its letter is `d`.\n\n But note: we already know the main diagonal is uniform with letter `d`, and the anti-diagonal must be uniform and the center is `d` (because the center is part of the main diagonal). So the entire anti-diagonal must be `d`. \n\n However, let's think: what if the anti-diagonal is uniform but with a different letter? Then the center would have to be two different letters (one from main diagonal and one from anti-diagonal) which is impossible. So the anti-diagonal must be the same letter as the main diagonal.\n\n Therefore, we can simply:\n\n   Let d = grid[i][i] for i from 0 to n-1, and check that for all i, grid[i][i] == d.\n\n   Then, check that for all i, grid[i][n-1-i] == d.\n\n   Then, for every cell (i,j) that is not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal, check that the letter is the same (call it `other`) and that `other != d`.\n\n However, note: the condition (c) says that all non-diagonal squares must be the same letter. So we can:\n\n   Let other_letter = None\n   For i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i+j == n-1: \n                continue   # skip diagonal and anti-diagonal\n            else:\n                if other_letter is None:\n                    other_letter = grid[i][j]\n                elif grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n   Then, check that other_letter is not None (meaning there is at least one non-diagonal) and that other_letter != d.\n\n But note: what if n==1? The problem says n>=3 and odd, so n>=3.\n\n However, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? That happens when n==1, but n>=3 so we don't have to worry.\n\n But wait: the example 3 had a problem in the main diagonal (last element was 'e') so we never even get to the non-diagonal part.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and grid.\n\n   Step 2: Check main diagonal: \n        d = grid[0][0]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n   Step 3: Check anti-diagonal:\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n   Step 4: Check non-diagonal cells:\n        other_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if other_letter is None:\n                    other_letter = grid[i][j]\n                elif grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n        # If we didn't find any non-diagonal cell, then n==1 (which isn't the case) so we assume there is at least one non-diagonal?\n        # But n>=3, so there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n        # However, what if the entire grid is the diagonal? Then there are no non-diagonal cells? \n        # Actually, for n>=3, the grid has more than just the diagonals. For example, n=3: total cells=9, diagonals have 3+3-1=5? Actually, the two diagonals together have 3+3-1=5 cells. So there are 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\n        # But wait: the condition says \"all other squares\" (non-diagonals) must be the same. If there are no other squares, then the condition is vacuously true? However, the problem says n>=3, so there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n        # Now, we must also ensure that the non-diagonal letter is different from d.\n\n        if other_letter is None:\n            # This means there were no non-diagonal cells. According to the problem, n>=3, so this shouldn't happen, but if it does, then we have to check.\n            # Actually, for n>=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So we can safely assume other_letter is set.\n            print(\"YES\")   # Actually, no: if there are no non-diagonal cells, then the grid is entirely the diagonal? But the diagonal is d, so then the entire grid is d. Then condition (c) requires that non-diagonal cells are the same letter and different from d. But if there are none, then we don't have to check condition (c) for existence, but we do have to check that the non-diagonal letter (if present) is different from d. However, since there are no non-diagonal cells, condition (c) is satisfied (vacuously) and the entire grid is d, so condition (c) also requires that the non-diagonal letter (if any) is different from d. But since there are none, we don't have a non-diagonal letter. However, the problem says \"all other squares ... that is different from the letters on the diagonals\", so if there are no other squares, then the condition holds.\n\n            # But wait, the problem says: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n            # If there are no other squares, then the condition is automatically true (because there are no squares that break the condition). \n\n            # However, in our Step 3, we set other_letter only if we see a non-diagonal cell. So if there are none, other_letter remains None. Then we must check that the entire grid is the diagonal letter and there are no non-diagonal cells. But the condition (c) is satisfied because there are no non-diagonal cells.\n\n            # But wait, the problem does not require that the non-diagonal letter exists. It just says that the non-diagonal cells (if any) must be the same and different from d.\n\n            # So we can say: if there are non-diagonal cells, then they must be the same and different from d. If there are none, then we don't care.\n\n            # However, the problem states: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\", meaning if there are other squares, then they must be that same letter. But if there are none, then the condition holds.\n\n            # But note: the problem says \"all other squares\", so if there are none, then the condition is trivially true.\n\n            # Therefore, we must also check that the non-diagonal letter (if present) is not d. However, we haven't set other_letter, so we don't know.\n\n            # Actually, in the case of no non-diagonal cells, we don't need to set other_letter. We can break out and then check: if there are non-diagonal cells, then other_letter must not be d. Otherwise, we don't care.\n\n            # But note: if the entire grid is the diagonal letter, then the non-diagonal cells are the same as the diagonal? Actually, no: the non-diagonal cells are the ones that are not on the diagonals. If the entire grid is the diagonal letter, then the non-diagonal cells are the diagonal letter. Then condition (c) requires that the non-diagonal letter is different from d. But if they are the same, then condition (c) fails.\n\n            # Therefore, we must check that the non-diagonal cells (if any) are not d.\n\n            # However, in Step 4, we are checking that all non-diagonal cells are the same. But if there are no non-diagonal cells, then we don't set other_letter. Then we must check that the entire grid is d? Actually, the entire grid being d would imply that the non-diagonal cells are d, which violates condition (c) if there is at least one non-diagonal cell. But if there are no non-diagonal cells, then we don't have a violation.\n\n            # But wait, for n>=3, there are always non-diagonal cells. So we don't have to worry about the entire grid being d.\n\n            # However, let me calculate: for n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 5 (3 for main, 3 for anti, but the center is counted twice). So non-diagonal cells: 9-5=4. So n>=3 always has non-diagonal cells.\n\n            # Therefore, we can assume there is at least one non-diagonal cell.\n\n        else:\n            if other_letter == d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n However, wait: what if the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are uniform (both d) but the non-diagonal cells are not all the same? Then we break in the inner loop.\n\n But note: in Step 4, we set other_letter to the first non-diagonal cell and then check that every subsequent non-diagonal cell is the same as that.\n\n But what if the non-diagonal cells are not all the same? Then we break and output \"NO\".\n\n Therefore, the code:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   # Check main diagonal\n   d = grid[0][0]\n   for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n   # Check anti-diagonal\n   for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n   # Check non-diagonal cells\n   other_letter = None\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                continue\n            if other_letter is None:\n                other_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n   # Now, check that other_letter is not equal to d (if there is at least one non-diagonal cell, which there is for n>=3)\n   if other_letter == d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n   else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n However, wait: what if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform (with the same letter d) but the non-diagonal cells are not the same? Then we break in the inner loop and output \"NO\".\n\n This matches.\n\n But wait: the example 3 that was provided as input was:\n\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpe\n\n We break at the main diagonal check because the last element of the main diagonal is 'e' (which is not 'x'). So we output \"NO\".\n\n Another example: \n\n        Input: \n            3\n            www\n            www\n            www\n\n        Main diagonal: 'w','w','w' -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: \n            grid[0][2] = 'w'\n            grid[1][1] = 'w'\n            grid[2][0] = 'w' -> ok.\n\n        Non-diagonal: \n            (0,1): 'w' -> set other_letter='w'\n            (1,0): 'w' -> same\n            (1,2): 'w' -> same\n            (2,1): 'w' -> same\n\n        Then we check: other_letter=='w' and d=='w' -> so we output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, the grid is all 'w'. Then condition (c) requires that the non-diagonal cells are the same and different from the diagonal. But the non-diagonal cells are the same (they are 'w') and the diagonal is 'w', so they are not different. Therefore, condition (c) fails. So \"NO\" is correct.\n\n        However, consider:\n\n        Input:\n            3\n            xxx\n            xox\n            xxx\n\n        Main diagonal: ['x','o','x'] -> not uniform (because of 'o') -> \"NO\".\n\n        Input:\n            3\n            xxx\n            xax\n            xxx\n\n        Here, the main diagonal: ['x','a','x'] -> not uniform -> \"NO\".\n\n        Input:\n            3\n            xxx\n            xxx\n            xxx\n\n        Then: main diagonal: ['x','x','x'] -> uniform, anti-diagonal: ['x','x','x'] -> uniform, non-diagonal: all 'x' -> same as d, so \"NO\".\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Now, the example that passed: \n            Input: \n                3\n                wsw\n                sws\n                wsw\n\n            Main diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> ok.\n            Anti-diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> ok.\n            Non-diagonal: \n                (0,1): 's'\n                (1,0): 's'\n                (1,2): 's'\n                (2,1): 's'\n\n            other_letter='s', and 's' != 'w' -> \"YES\".\n\n        So the code should work.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: 5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x' -> d='x'\n            row1: 'o' -> wait, grid[1][1] is the second row, second char: the second row is \"oxoxo\", so grid[1][1] is 'x'? \n\n        Let me write the grid:\n\n            row0: 'x','o','o','o','x'\n            row1: 'o','x','o','x','o'\n            row2: 's','o','x','o','o'\n            row3: 'o','x','o','x','o'\n            row4: 'x','o','o','o','x'\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            [0][0] = 'x'\n            [1][1] = 'x'\n            [2][2] = 'x'\n            [3][3] = 'x'\n            [4][4] = 'x'\n\n        So yes, main diagonal is 'x'. \n\n        Anti-diagonal: \n            [0][4] = 'x'\n            [1][3] = 'x'\n            [2][2] = 'x'\n            [3][1] = 'x'\n            [4][0] = 'x'\n\n        So anti-diagonal is 'x'.\n\n        Non-diagonal cells: \n            We look for any cell that is not (i,i) and not (i,4-i).\n\n            Example: (0,1): 'o', (0,2): 'o', (0,3): 'o'\n                     (1,0): 'o', (1,2): 'o', (1,4): 'o'\n                     (2,0): 's', (2,1): 'o', (2,3): 'o', (2,4): 'o'\n                     (3,0): 'o', (3,2): 'o', (3,4): 'o'\n                     (4,1): 'o', (4,2): 'o', (4,3): 'o'\n\n            The first non-diagonal cell we meet is (0,1) -> 'o'. Then we check all others must be 'o'. \n\n            However, in row2, we have a 's' at (2,0). Let's check (2,0): \n                i=2, j=0: is (2,0) on the main diagonal? 2==0? no. Is (2,0) on the anti-diagonal? 2+0 = 2, n-1=4 -> 2 != 4 -> no. So (2,0) is non-diagonal.\n\n            Then we set other_letter='o' at (0,1) and then at (2,0) we get 's' which is not 'o'. So we break and output \"NO\".\n\n        Therefore, the first example outputs \"NO\", matching the sample.\n\n        But wait, the example input is:\n\n            ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n        Expected output: ['NO','YES','NO'].\n\n        Our code produces:\n\n            Example1: NO\n            Example2: YES\n            Example3: NO (because main diagonal fails)\n\n        So that matches.\n\n        However, wait: the example1 grid has a non-diagonal cell that is 's' (at (2,0)) and that breaks the condition that non-diagonal cells are all the same? Yes, because we have both 'o' and 's' in the non-diagonal cells.\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter\". In example1, the non-diagonal cells are not all the same (we have 'o' and 's').\n\n        Therefore, the first example fails.\n\n        But wait, the example1 grid:\n\n            row2: \"soxoo\"\n\n            The main diagonal of the entire grid is all 'x', the anti-diagonal is all 'x'. The non-diagonal cells must be the same letter. However, the non-diagonal cells include:\n\n                (0,1): 'o'\n                (0,2): 'o'\n                (0,3): 'o'\n                (1,0): 'o'\n                (1,2): 'o'\n                (1,4): 'o'\n                (2,0): 's'\n                (2,1): 'o'\n                (2,3): 'o'\n                (2,4): 'o'\n                (3,0): 'o'\n                (3,2): 'o'\n                (3,4): 'o'\n                (4,1): 'o'\n                (4,2): 'o'\n                (4,3): 'o'\n\n            So indeed, there is an 's' in (2,0) and the rest are 'o'. Therefore, the non-diagonal cells are not all the same.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example1 input was provided as:\n\n            ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n        And the expected output is \"NO\".\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        d = grid[0][0]\n        # Check main diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check non-diagonal cells\n        other_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if other_letter is None:\n                    other_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n        # Now check that the non-diagonal letter is different from d\n        if other_letter == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n But wait, what if the entire grid is the same letter? Then the main diagonal is that letter, the anti-diagonal is that letter, and the non-diagonal is that letter (so other_letter == d) -> output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n However, what if the grid has two different letters in the non-diagonal? Then we break in the inner loop.\n\n One more corner: the center is included in both diagonals, so we don't check it twice in the non-diagonal part. But we don't care because we skip the center.\n\n Let me run the example2 again:\n\n        n=3, grid:\n            row0: 'w','s','w'\n            row1: 's','w','s'\n            row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal:\n            [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w' -> ok.\n\n        Non-diagonal cells: \n            (0,1): 's' -> set other_letter='s'\n            (1,0): 's' -> same\n            (1,2): 's' -> same\n            (2,1): 's' -> same\n\n        Then check: other_letter ('s') != d ('w') -> YES.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Example3: \n            n=3, grid:\n                row0: 'x','p','x'\n                row1: 'p','x','p'\n                row2: 'x','p','e'\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            [0][0]='x', [1][1]='x', [2][2]='e' -> fails at [2][2] (expected 'x' but got 'e') -> output \"NO\".\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Example4: \n            n=3, grid:\n                row0: 'a','b','a'\n                row1: 'b','a','b'\n                row2: 'a','b','a'\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> ok.\n        Non-diagonal: \n            (0,1): 'b', (1,0): 'b', (1,2): 'b', (2,1): 'b'\n\n        Then check: other_letter='b' and d='a' -> different -> YES.\n\n        But wait, the example4 is symmetric and forms an X? Yes.\n\n        However, the example4 input is:\n\n            3\n            ab a\n            baa b\n            aba\n\n        Actually, the input format: \n            Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters.\n\n        So the input would be:\n\n            ab a\n            baa b   -> wait, that's 3 letters per line? Actually, the example4 grid is:\n\n                \"aba\"\n                \"bab\"\n                \"aba\"\n\n        But wait, the example I wrote:\n\n            row0: \"aba\" -> ['a','b','a']\n            row1: \"bab\" -> ['b','a','b']\n            row2: \"aba\" -> ['a','b','a']\n\n        Then main diagonal: [0][0]='a', [1][1]='a', [2][2]='a' -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: [0][2]='a', [1][1]='a', [2][0]='a' -> ok.\n        Non-diagonal: \n            (0,1): 'b'\n            (1,0): 'b'\n            (1,2): 'b'\n            (2,1): 'b'\n\n        So it's the same as above.\n\n        Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n        However, note: the example input might have spaces? The problem says: \"each of the next n lines contains n small English letters\"\n\n        So we can use strip() to remove any extraneous whitespace.\n\n        Let me write the final code.\n\n        Note: we are using exit(0) to terminate early. Alternatively, we can use a function and return.\n\n        Since the problem is small (n<300, so at most 300x300=90000 cells) and we break early, it's efficient.\n\n        Code:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        d = grid[0][0]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same as each other but different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Main Diagonal**: Verify that all characters along the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are the same.\n2. **Check Anti-Diagonal**: Verify that all characters along the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same and match the character from the main diagonal.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Ensure all characters not on either diagonal are identical and different from the diagonal character.\n\nThe solution involves iterating through the grid to check these conditions. If any condition fails, the answer is \"NO\"; otherwise, it's \"YES\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nd = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\nother_letter = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        if other_letter is None:\n            other_letter = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\nif other_letter == d:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the size of the grid `n`, followed by `n` lines of input which form the grid.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: The code checks each element on the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) to ensure they are all the same character `d`.\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, the code checks each element on the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`) to ensure they are also the same character `d`.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For cells not on either diagonal, the code ensures all such cells contain the same character `other_letter`, which must differ from `d`.\n5. **Output Result**: If all checks pass, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\" at the first failure.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions by leveraging early termination upon encountering any discrepancy, ensuring optimal performance.",
