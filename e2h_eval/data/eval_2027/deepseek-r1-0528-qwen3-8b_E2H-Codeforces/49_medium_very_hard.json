They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. For each edge (u, v), we are given two numbers: gcd and lcm.\n Conditions for an edge (a, b) with gcd = g and lcm = l:\n   We must have g | a and g | b, and also we must have a * b = g^2 * (l/g)^2? Actually, note that:\n   Let a = g * x, b = g * y, then the condition is that gcd(x,y)=1 and LCM(a,b) = g*x*y = l.\n\n So from the edge we know that the product of the two numbers (in terms of g) is l / g, but note that the LCM is (g * x * y) so we have:\n   g * x * y = l  => x * y = l // g\n\n And since x and y must be integers and coprime (because gcd(x,y)=1), we can set:\n   a = g * x, b = g * y.\n\n However, note that the entire graph must assign to every node a positive integer (at least 1) such that for every edge (u,v) with given gcd and lcm, \n the conditions hold.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. For each edge, we can check if the given gcd and lcm are consistent. Specifically, the gcd must divide both the gcd and the lcm, and the gcd must divide the lcm. Also, we must have that gcd divides both numbers (which we don't know yet) and the lcm is the LCM of the two numbers.\n\n But note: the condition for an edge (a,b) is that gcd(a,b)=g and lcm(a,b)=l. Then we must have:\n   g * l = a * b   [since LCM(a,b) * GCD(a,b) = a*b]\n\n So for each edge, we can check: does g * l equal a*b? But wait, we don't know a and b. However, from the edge alone, we can require that:\n   Condition 1: g divides l (because g divides a and b, so g divides any multiple of a and b, in particular the LCM which is a multiple of both). This is necessary because the LCM must be divisible by the GCD.\n\n   Condition 2: We must have that (l // g) is an integer and that there exists a factorization of (l//g) into two coprime factors. However, note that the same edge might connect two nodes that are part of multiple constraints.\n\n But note: the entire graph must satisfy all edges.\n\n 2. We can try to assign to each node a value. The idea is to use the following:\n\n   Let d[i] be the number of mushrooms at node i.\n\n   For an edge (u, v) with gcd = g and lcm = l, we have:\n        d[u] * d[v] = g * l\n        and also, g must be the gcd(d[u], d[v]).\n\n   However, note that the assignment must be consistent across the graph.\n\n 3. Another idea: factorize the numbers? But note that the numbers can be up to 10^6, and we have up to 10^5 edges? Actually, the problem says n, m up to 10^6? Wait, the input format says: first line has two numbers n and m (with no specific limit, but typically competitive programming problems have constraints like 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5 or 10^6). The example inputs are small.\n\n But note: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 10^6\", meaning gcd and lcm are between 1 and 10^6.\n\n 4. However, note that the product g*l for an edge might be as large as 10^12, which is acceptable in Python if we do it carefully, but we have to consider the entire graph.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n   We can use the fact that for every edge (u, v): \n        d[u] * d[v] = g * l   (condition1)\n\n   and also, for every edge, the gcd of d[u] and d[v] must be exactly g.\n\n   Moreover, note that the same node u may appear in multiple edges. We can try to set up equations.\n\n 5. Consider: Let the value at node u be d[u]. Then for an edge (u, v) with (g, l), we have:\n        d[u] * d[v] = g * l.\n\n   Now, if we take two edges incident to u: (u, v) and (u, w) then:\n        d[u] * d[v] = g1 * l1\n        d[u] * d[w] = g2 * l2\n\n   Then d[v] = (g1 * l1) / d[u], and d[w] = (g2 * l2) / d[u]. \n\n   Also, the gcd condition must hold for each edge.\n\n   How to break the symmetry? We can fix one node's value arbitrarily? But note: the product condition must hold for every edge.\n\n 6. Actually, from the product condition, if we fix d[u] then we can compute d[v] for every neighbor. Then we must check that the gcd condition holds for every edge and that the computed values are integers and positive.\n\n   But note: we have multiple edges. Also, the graph might be disconnected.\n\n 7. Steps:\n\n   a) First, check for each edge (u, v): \n        - Check that g divides l (because g divides both d[u] and d[v] so the LCM must be divisible by g).\n        - Check that (l // g) is an integer and that g * l is the product of two numbers (we'll use this later).\n\n   b) Then, we can build a graph with n nodes and m edges.\n\n   c) We need to assign a value to each node. We can choose an arbitrary starting node (say node 0) and set its value to some candidate. But what candidate?\n\n        Since for an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we have d[u] = g * x, d[v] = g * y, and x*y = l//g, and x,y coprime.\n\n        But note: the entire graph must be consistent.\n\n   d) However, we can also note: the value at a node must divide the product of the node and all its neighbors? Not exactly.\n\n   e) Alternate Insight: Since for each edge (u, v): d[u] * d[v] = g * l, we can think of the entire graph as having the product fixed for each edge.\n\n      Then, if we consider the graph as a system of equations for the logarithms, we can set:\n\n          log(d[u]) + log(d[v]) = log(g) + log(l)\n\n      But that is just one equation. However, note that the gcd condition is more restrictive.\n\n   f) Another known fact: In such a graph, the value at a node must divide the product of the values of its neighbors appropriately? Not directly.\n\n 8. We can try the following:\n\n      Let's define for each node u, let P[u] be the product of the values of all edges (but that is too vague).\n\n   Instead, consider: We can fix the value for one node arbitrarily? But note: the product condition must hold. However, we cannot fix arbitrarily because the gcd condition must hold.\n\n   But note: from the edge condition, we have two numbers (g and l) and we know the product is fixed. However, the value at a node must be such that for each edge, the product is fixed and the gcd is fixed.\n\n   How about: we can factorize the gcd and lcm for each edge? But note: the numbers are up to 10^6, so we can precompute smallest prime factors (spf) for numbers up to 10^6.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        Let d[u] = A, d[v] = B. Then we know A*B = g*l, and gcd(A,B)=g.\n\n        Then we can write A = g * a, B = g * b, with gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n        Then the condition is a*b = l // g.\n\n        So for the edge, we can factorize l//g and then split it into two coprime factors a and b.\n\n        But note: the same node appears in multiple edges. So the value d[u] must be consistent.\n\n        We can represent d[u] in terms of the product of primes? But then we have to combine the information from multiple edges.\n\n 9. Steps:\n\n   a) Precomputation: Factorize all the numbers that appear (the gcd and lcm for each edge, and then the product g*l). But note: the product g*l can be as large as 10^12, which is too big for factorizing every edge.\n\n   b) Another idea: Instead of directly assigning the value, we can use the following necessary conditions:\n\n        Condition 1: For each edge, g must divide l (so that l//g is integer) and also g*g <= l (since the product of two numbers that are multiples of g is g^2 * (a*b) and the LCM is g*a*b, so we have g*a*b = l, and a*b = l/g, and a and b are integers >=1, so the minimum product is when a=b=1, then l/g>=g^2? Not necessarily, because a and b can be different: for example, if a=1, b=l/g, then the gcd(a,b)=1 only if a and b are coprime. But note: if we set a=1 and b=l/g, then the gcd(1, l/g)=1, so that works. Then the product condition is satisfied. However, we must have that g divides both a and b? No, wait: we set A = g * a, and B = g * b, and then the gcd(A,B)=g * gcd(a,b). But we require gcd(a,b)=1. So the condition is that the product a*b = l//g and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n        Therefore, for the edge, the value l//g must be expressible as a product of two coprime integers.\n\n        However, note: the factorization of l//g might not be unique. But we don't need the exact factors, we just need to check existence? But wait, we have multiple edges.\n\n   c) We can use union-find or graph coloring for the exponents? Actually, we can consider the prime factorizations.\n\n   Insight:\n\n        Let the entire graph's nodes have values that are built from the primes that appear in the factorizations of the gcds and lcms.\n\n        However, note: the same prime factor might appear in different edges. We must ensure that the exponents for each prime are consistent across the graph.\n\n        For a prime p:\n\n          For an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, the exponent of p in g is e_g, and in l is e_l.\n\n          Then the exponent of p in d[u] and d[v] must be between e_g and e_l, and the minimum exponent in the two nodes must be e_g, and the maximum must be e_l.\n\n        Why? Because:\n\n          d[u] = g * a, d[v] = g * b, and a and b are coprime. But wait, actually, the gcd condition is that the minimum exponent of p in d[u] and d[v] is e_g, and the maximum exponent is e_l.\n\n          However, note: the LCM is the max exponent and the GCD is the min exponent.\n\n        So for each prime p and each edge (u, v):\n\n          Let e_min = exponent of p in g\n          Let e_max = exponent of p in l\n\n          Then for nodes u and v, the exponent of p in d[u] and d[v] must be:\n\n            one of them is e_min and the other is e_max? Not necessarily: they can be any two numbers such that the minimum is e_min and the maximum is e_max. But note: the product condition: d[u]*d[v] = g*l, so the total exponent for p is e_min + e_max. And the exponents in d[u] and d[v] must add up to e_min+e_max, and the minimum of the two is e_min and the maximum is e_max.\n\n          Actually, the two exponents must be (e_min, e_max) because:\n\n            Let x = exponent in d[u] and y = exponent in d[v]. Then min(x,y) = e_min and max(x,y) = e_max, and x+y = e_min+e_max.\n\n          Then, solving: \n            Without loss of generality, assume x <= y. Then x = e_min, y = e_max.\n\n          So for each prime p, for each edge, the two nodes must have exponents (e_min, e_max) for p.\n\n        Then, we can build for each prime p:\n\n          Create a graph where each node is labeled by the exponent of p (if the node is not assigned, we don't know). But wait, we have multiple primes.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider: for each prime p, we can define a constraint on the edges. Then, we can use a graph for each prime p? That would be too heavy.\n\n   d) However, note that the graph is fixed, and we have to assign exponents for every prime to every node. This seems complex.\n\n 10. Another Insight: Since for each edge (u, v) we have d[u] * d[v] = g * l, we can use the following:\n\n      Let d[u] be the product over primes p of p raised to some exponent. Then for each prime p, the exponent in d[u] must satisfy:\n\n          For an edge (u, v): \n            Let e_uv_min = exponent of p in g, and e_uv_max = exponent of p in l.\n            Then the exponent for p in d[u] (say e_u) and in d[v] (e_v) must satisfy: \n                e_u + e_v = e_uv_min + e_uv_max   [from the product condition: d[u]*d[v] = g*l]\n                and min(e_u, e_v) = e_uv_min, and max(e_u, e_v) = e_uv_max.\n\n      But note: the product condition is multiplicative, so for each prime p, the exponents add independently. \n\n      However, the condition min(e_u, e_v) = e_uv_min and max(e_u, e_v)=e_uv_max is automatically satisfied if the exponents are e_uv_min and e_uv_max (because then the sum is e_uv_min+e_uv_max, and the min is the smaller one and the max is the larger one). But note: if we have two edges, we must assign the same exponent to a node for all edges.\n\n      So, for each prime p, we can create a graph G_p where the vertices are the n nodes, and for each edge (u, v) in the original graph, we add an edge that requires that the exponents of p at u and v are (e_min, e_max) (but we don't know which is which). \n\n      Then, we can traverse the graph for prime p and assign the exponents consistently.\n\n      Steps for a fixed prime p:\n\n          For each edge (u, v) with given (g, l) (for the entire edge), we get the exponents for p: \n            e_min = exponent of p in g\n            e_max = exponent of p in l\n\n          Then, we have two possibilities: either d[u] has exponent e_min and d[v] has exponent e_max, or vice versa.\n\n          Then, the entire graph for prime p must be bipartite? Actually, we can assign two labels: low and high for the two exponents (if e_min != e_max, then we have two distinct exponents). But if e_min == e_max, then both nodes must have exponent e_min.\n\n          However, note: if e_min == e_max, then the edge doesn't give any distinction: both nodes must have the same exponent. Then, in the connected component of the graph (for prime p) we must assign the same exponent to all nodes? Not exactly: if two edges share a node and both have the same (e_min, e_max) and the graph is connected, then the whole connected component must have the same exponent? \n\n          But wait, consider two edges (u,v) and (v,w) and both have the same (e_min, e_max). Then we require:\n            d[u] has exponent x, d[v] has exponent x (since the edge (u,v) requires min(x,y)=x and max(x,y)=x -> so x=y), and similarly for (v,w): d[v] and d[w] must be x. Then the entire connected component must be x.\n\n          If e_min != e_max, then for an edge (u,v) we have two possibilities. But note: the product condition for the entire edge is fixed: the exponents must add to e_min+e_max. However, the condition that the minimum is e_min and the maximum is e_max forces that one node has e_min and the other e_max.\n\n          Then, for a connected component in the graph (for prime p), we can assign two labels (if e_min != e_max) and then we must have a bipartition: one set of nodes with exponent e_min and the other with e_max. But wait: if we have a cycle, then the product condition must hold for every edge. However, note: the exponents are fixed by the edge: for each edge, the two nodes must be one low and one high. Then the graph (for prime p) must be bipartite, and the two parts are the two exponents.\n\n          However, what if the graph for prime p is not connected? Then we can assign independently.\n\n      But note: the same node must have the same exponent for all primes. So we are building an assignment for each prime p, and then the overall d[u] is the product over p of (p raised to the exponent assigned by the graph for p).\n\n      However, the problem is that the graph for each prime p is built from the edges that have non-zero exponent for p. But note: if an edge has zero exponent for p (i.e., p does not divide g or l), then we don't have a constraint for p for that edge.\n\n      Actually, we should consider: for each edge, for each prime p, we extract the exponent in g and in l. Then, for an edge, if p divides g, then we know the exponents for p in the two nodes must be (e_min, e_max). If p does not divide g, then the exponent for p in g is 0, and the exponent for p in l is some number (say k). Then, the condition is: the minimum exponent in the two nodes must be 0, and the maximum must be k. \n\n      But note: the product condition: the exponents add to k (since the product d[u]*d[v] has exponent k). And the minimum is 0, so one of the nodes must have exponent 0 and the other k. \n\n      So the procedure for each prime p and each edge (u, v):\n\n          Let e_g = exponent of p in g, and e_l = exponent of p in l.\n\n          Then the condition is: the exponents in d[u] and d[v] (call them x and y) must satisfy:\n            x + y = e_g + e_l\n            min(x,y) = e_g\n            max(x,y) = e_l\n\n      This is equivalent to: the two exponents must be (e_g, e_l) (because the only solution to x+y = e_g+e_l and min(x,y)=e_g and max(x,y)=e_l is {x=e_g, y=e_l} or {x=e_l, y=e_g}). \n\n      Therefore, for each edge (u, v) and each prime p, we require that the exponents for p at u and v are e_g and e_l (in some order).\n\n      Then, we can build a graph for each prime p (over the n nodes) and for each edge (u, v) that has non-zero contribution for p (i.e., at least one of e_g or e_l is non-zero) we add an undirected edge with two possible assignments: (u gets e_g, v gets e_l) or (u gets e_l, v gets e_g). \n\n      Then, the entire graph for prime p must be bipartite, and we can assign two colors (if e_g != e_l) such that adjacent nodes get different colors (and the color corresponds to the exponent: either e_g or e_l). But note: if e_g == e_l, then the edge requires that both nodes have the same exponent (e_g). Then, in the graph for prime p, if we have an edge with e_g==e_l, then the two nodes must have the same exponent. This forces that the entire connected component (for prime p) must have that exponent.\n\n      However, if we have two edges (u,v) and (v,w) and both have e_g==e_l, then u, v, w must all have the same exponent. So we can collapse the connected component into a single node with fixed exponent.\n\n      But note: if we have two edges (u,v) and (v,w) and the first edge has (e1, e1) and the second edge has (e2, e2) (with e1 != e2), then we have a contradiction.\n\n      Therefore, for each prime p, we can:\n\n          Build a graph G_p with n nodes.\n\n          For each edge (u, v) (each edge in the original graph) and for prime p, let e1 = exponent of p in g, e2 = exponent of p in l.\n\n          If e1 == e2:\n             Then we require that the exponent at u and v is e1. Then, we can merge these two nodes (or simply note that they must have the same exponent) and then if we find two edges that force two different exponents for the same connected component, then we have a contradiction.\n\n          If e1 != e2:\n             Then we require that the two exponents are e1 and e2 (but not fixed which is which). Then, we can model this as an undirected edge that requires the two endpoints to be in different sets (like a bipartition).\n\n      However, we can combine the two cases: \n\n          Case 1: e1 == e2 -> then the two nodes must have the same exponent (e1).\n          Case 2: e1 != e2 -> then the two nodes must have different exponents (one e1 and one e2).\n\n      Then, we can build a graph for prime p and do:\n\n          We will use a union-find or DFS to traverse the graph and assign two types of constraints: \n            - Same exponent (if e1==e_l) for the two nodes (like an equality constraint)\n            - Different exponents (if e1 != e_l) for the two nodes.\n\n      But note: the entire graph must be consistent. We can use a two-coloring for the graph, but with the twist that sometimes we require nodes to be the same.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use a union-find for the same-exponent constraints and then check the different-exponent constraints.\n\n      Steps for prime p:\n\n          Step 1: Group nodes that must have the same exponent (from edges with e1==e2). We can use union-find for these.\n\n          Step 2: For edges with e1 != e2, we require that the two nodes have different exponents. But if the two nodes are in the same connected component (by the same-exponent union-find), then we require that the exponent for that component is both e1 and e2, which is impossible if e1 != e2 -> then we output NO.\n\n          Step 3: If the two nodes are in different connected components (from the same-exponent graph), then we require that the exponents of the two components are different. But note: the exponents for a component are fixed to a single value (the one from the same-exponent constraint, or if the component has no same-exponent constraint then we haven't fixed it). \n\n      However, wait: the same-exponent constraint only applies to edges with e1==e2. There might be multiple edges forcing the same component to have a fixed exponent. But note: if an edge (u,v) has e1==e2, then we set the exponent for u and v to e1. Then, if we have another edge (u,w) with e1==e2 (same value e1), then we set w to e1. But if we have an edge (u,w) with e1 != e2, then we require that the exponent of u (which is e1) and w must be the other one (e2) but w was forced to e1 by the same-exponent constraint -> contradiction.\n\n      Therefore, we must do:\n\n          For each prime p, we build a graph with edges:\n\n            For each original edge (u, v) with (g, l):\n              Let e1 = exponent of p in g, e2 = exponent of p in l.\n              If e1 != e2, then we add an undirected edge (u, v) with weight (e1, e2) [meaning: the two exponents must be e1 and e2, but we don't know which].\n\n          Then, we want to assign to each node a value (either e1 or e2) for prime p, but subject to:\n\n            For an edge (u, v) with (e1, e2): the two nodes must be assigned different values (exponents) and the two values must be e1 and e2 (so one is e1, the other is e2).\n\n          However, note: we might have multiple edges. Also, we have to consider that the same node might appear in multiple edges with different primes.\n\n      But note: the above approach for each prime p independently and then combining the exponents by multiplying together is valid.\n\n      However, the challenge is that the graph for prime p might have many edges and many primes, and we have up to 10^6 primes (primes up to 10^6) and up to 10^6 edges, and up to 10^6 nodes. \n\n 11. Considering the complexity, we cannot iterate over all primes up to 10^6 and build a graph for each prime (because the total number of edges for all primes would be m * (number of distinct primes in the factorization of all g and l) which is too high.\n\n 12. Alternative Insight: We know that the entire graph must satisfy for each edge (u, v): d[u] * d[v] = g * l and gcd(d[u],d[v]) = g.\n\n      We can try to assign the value for each node by:\n\n          Let d[u] = 1 for all nodes initially.\n\n          Then, for each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we can set:\n\n            d[u] = gcd(current_d[u], current_d[v] * (g * l) // (current_d[u] * current_d[v]))? \n\n      That doesn't seem straightforward.\n\n 13. Another known approach for such problems (restoring numbers from GCD and LCM) is to use the following:\n\n        For an edge (u, v): \n            d[u] = gcd(d[u], d[v]) * something? \n\n      Actually, we can use the fact that the product d[u]*d[v] is fixed, and the gcd is fixed. Then, we can write:\n\n            d[u] = g * a, d[v] = g * b, with a*b = l//g and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n      Then, we can set d[u] = g * a, but then we must choose a and b coprime and their product is l//g.\n\n      But how to choose a and b? We can choose the factorization of l//g into two coprime factors arbitrarily. However, the entire graph must be consistent.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          Let F be a dictionary that maps node u to the value d[u].\n\n          Then, for each edge (u, v) with (g, l):\n\n            Let P = g * l   (the product condition)\n\n            Then, we must have F[u] * F[v] = P.\n\n            Also, gcd(F[u], F[v]) = g.\n\n      We can try to assign the nodes in increasing order of degree? Or use BFS.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Check for each edge (u, v): \n                  - g must divide l (so that l//g is integer) and g*g <= l (because the minimum product is g*g, and then a and b must be at least 1, so g*g <= g*l, which is always true, but note: the product of two numbers that are multiples of g is g^2 * (a*b) and the LCM is g * a * b, so we have g * a * b = l, so a*b = l//g, and then the product F[u]*F[v] = g^2 * a*b = g*l. So the product condition is automatically satisfied if we set F[u]=g*a and F[v]=g*b. But the gcd condition requires that gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n          Step 2: We can fix one node arbitrarily? But note: the product condition is multiplicative and the gcd condition is additive in the exponents.\n\n      However, note: the entire graph might be disconnected. We can handle each connected component separately.\n\n      Algorithm for a connected component:\n\n          We have a set of nodes V and a set of edges E.\n\n          Let's pick a node s.\n\n          We will assign F[s] arbitrarily? But wait, the product condition for edges incident to s will determine the neighbors.\n\n          However, we can set F[s] to a candidate value. What candidate?\n\n          From an edge (s, t) with (g, l), we have:\n\n                F[s] * F[t] = g * l\n\n                and gcd(F[s], F[t]) = g.\n\n          Then, F[t] = (g * l) / F[s] must be an integer, and gcd(F[s], (g*l)//F[s]) must be g.\n\n          But note: F[s] must divide g*l.\n\n          How to choose F[s]? We can set F[s] to be a divisor of g*l (from some edge incident to s). But which divisor?\n\n          Actually, we can set F[s] to be a divisor of g*l for every edge incident to s. Then, we must choose a common divisor? \n\n          Alternatively, we can set F[s] to be g * x, where x is chosen such that x divides (l//g) and then we factor (l//g) into x and (l//g)//x with gcd(x, (l//g)//x)=1. But note, we have multiple edges.\n\n      After careful thought, here is a method:\n\n          We can use the following: the value at node u must be the product over all primes p of p raised to the exponent we determined for that prime.\n\n          But we already discussed the prime factorization approach. \n\n 14. Given the time, I decide to use the following:\n\n      Step 1: Precompute the smallest prime factor (spf) for numbers up to 10^6 (or up to 10^12? but we have g and l up to 10^6, so g*l up to 10^12, and we need to factorize numbers up to 10^6 and 10^12).\n\n      However, 10^12 is too big to factorize by trial division for each edge (m can be up to 10^6). \n\n 15. We must find a better way.\n\n      Let me reexamine the conditions:\n\n          For an edge (u, v): \n            d[u] * d[v] = g * l   ... (1)\n            gcd(d[u], d[v]) = g    ... (2)\n\n          From (2), we have d[u] = g * a, d[v] = g * b, and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n          Then (1) becomes: g*a * g*b = g * l  => g * a * b = l  => a * b = l // g.\n\n          So the condition for an edge is that l // g is an integer and there exists a factorization of l//g into two coprime factors.\n\n      Now, note that the entire graph must be consistent. \n\n      We can try to assign the values by:\n\n          Let F[u] be the value at node u.\n\n          For a node u, let S[u] be the set of edges incident to u.\n\n          Then, for each edge (u, v) with (g, l), we have:\n\n                F[u] * F[v] = g * l.\n\n          Then, F[u] must be a divisor of g*l for every edge (u, v). \n\n          Also, the gcd condition must hold.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          Step 1: For each edge (u, v), check that g divides l. If not, output \"NO\".\n\n          Step 2: For each node u, let M[u] be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the (g*l) for edges incident to u? Not exactly, but we can consider that F[u] must be a common divisor of all the (g*l) for edges incident to u divided by the F[v] for the neighbor? That is circular.\n\n 16. Another idea: use the following necessary condition for the entire graph:\n\n        Let d[u] be the value at node u. Then for every edge (u, v), d[u] must divide g*l (because d[u] divides d[u]*d[v] = g*l).\n\n        Then, we can set:\n\n            F[u] = the greatest common divisor of all the (g*l) for edges incident to u? Not necessarily.\n\n        Example: two edges (u, v) and (u, w) with (g1, l1) and (g2, l2). Then F[u] must divide both g1*l1 and g2*l2. But also, F[u] must be such that F[u] * F[v] = g1*l1 and F[u] * F[w] = g2*l2.\n\n        Then, F[u] must be a common divisor of g1*l1 and g2*l2, and then F[v] = (g1*l1)/F[u] and F[w] = (g2*l2)/F[u].\n\n        Then, we must also have gcd(F[u], F[v]) = g1 and gcd(F[u], F[w]) = g2.\n\n        But note: F[u] = g1 * a1 = g2 * a2, so we must have that g1 divides F[u] and g2 divides F[u]. \n\n        Therefore, F[u] must be a common multiple of g1 and g2? No, wait: F[u] is a divisor of g1*l1 and g2*l2, and also F[u] is a multiple of g1 and g2? Not necessarily.\n\n        Actually, from the edge (u, v): F[u] = g1 * a1, and from (u, w): F[u] = g2 * a2.\n\n        So F[u] must be a common multiple of g1 and g2? No, F[u] is expressed as g1*a1 and g2*a2, so F[u] must be a multiple of both g1 and g2 if and only if a1 is a multiple of g2/g1 and a2 is a multiple of g1/g2, but that is not necessarily true.\n\n        Example: g1=2, g2=4, then F[u] must be even and divisible by 4? Not necessarily: if g1=2, then F[u] = 2 * a1, and if g2=4, then F[u] = 4 * a2. Then 2*a1 = 4*a2 => a1 = 2*a2, so F[u] is a multiple of 4.\n\n        In general, F[u] must be a common multiple of all the g's incident to u? \n\n        Yes, because for each edge (u, v): F[u] = g * a, so F[u] is a multiple of g.\n\n        Therefore, F[u] must be a common multiple of all the g's in the edges incident to u.\n\n        And also, F[u] must divide the product of g and l for each edge? Actually, from the product condition, F[u] divides g*l for each edge incident to u.\n\n        But note: F[u] is also determined by the product with its neighbors.\n\n 17. Proposed algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read input.\n\n        Step 2: For each edge, check that g divides l. If not, output \"NO\" and exit.\n\n        Step 3: For each node, let GCD_node[u] = 1, and LCM_node[u] = 1 (or we will compute the product condition).\n\n        But note: we can't easily compute the product condition without knowing the neighbors.\n\n        Step 4: For each node u, let the set of incident edges be E_u. Then, F[u] must be a common multiple of all the g's in these edges, and must divide the corresponding l's appropriately.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            Let F[u] = the product of the gcd's of all incident edges? Not likely.\n\n        Let me try with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: Input \"1",

The initial value for a node is set based on the product of its GCD and LCM with any one neighbor.\n3. **Validation**: After assigning values to all nodes in a connected component, the code checks if the product of the values of each edge matches the given GCD and LCM product and if the GCD condition is satisfied.\n4. **Output**: If all checks pass, the code prints \"YES\" followed by the restored values; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the feasibility of restoring the mushroom counts and ensures all conditions are met through systematic validation during graph traversal.",
