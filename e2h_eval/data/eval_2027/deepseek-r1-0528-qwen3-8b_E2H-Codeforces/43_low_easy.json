He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string only contains 'a', 'b', 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends 'c' so there might be no 'c'? Actually, the problem says C appends some number of 'c'. But note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (or both). However, note that the problem states that A gives a string of some 'a's, then B appends some 'b's, then C appends some 'c's.\n\n Important observations:\n - The string must start with at least one 'a' and then at least one 'b' (because A gives some 'a's, then B appends some 'b's). Then C appends some 'c's at the end.\n - Therefore, the string should not contain any 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', and similarly, once a 'b' appears, we shouldn't see an 'a' again? Actually, the problem says A's string consists of only 'a', then B appends only 'b' at the end, then C appends only 'c' at the end. So the entire string is divided into three contiguous parts: [some 'a's] [some 'b's] [some 'c's]. \n\n Steps:\n 1. Check if the string has any invalid character? But input is guaranteed to be 'a','b','c'\n\n 2. We need to check the order: \n    - All the 'a's must come first, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's.\n\n 3. Conditions on counts:\n    Let:\n        count_a = number of 'a'\n        count_b = number of 'b'\n        count_c = number of 'c'\n\n    According to the process:\n        - There must be at least one 'a' and at least one 'b' (so count_a>=1, count_b>=1). Note: C might add zero 'c's? But the problem says \"appends some number\", which could be zero? However, note the condition: the number of 'c' must equal either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. If C appends zero, then we require 0 == count_a or 0 == count_b. But since there's at least one 'a' and one 'b', that would require 0==count_a (which is false) or 0==count_b (false). Therefore, C must append at least one 'c'. However, wait: the problem says \"some number\", meaning possibly zero? But then the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. So if there are 3 'a's and 4 'b's, then C can choose to append 3 or 4, but not 0 because 0 != 3 and 0 != 4. But note: the problem does not say that the number of 'c' is positive, but the condition must hold. Therefore, the number of 'c' must be either count_a or count_b (and note: the entire string after C's appending is considered, so the counts include the ones from the original and appended).\n\n    However, note: the entire string is built as:\n        Original: count_a0 (at least 1) of 'a'\n        Then B appends: count_b0 (at least 1) of 'b'\n        Then C appends: count_c0 (which is either count_a0 + count_b0? Actually, wait: the condition is about the entire string at the time of appending by C. \n\n    Clarification from the problem: \n        - When C appends, the string already has the original 'a's and the appended 'b's. Then C appends 'c's such that the total number of 'c' is either the total number of 'a' (which is the original count_a0) or the total number of 'b' (which is the original count_b0 + any appended by B? Actually, note: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". \n\n    At the time C appends, the string has:\n        count_a = count_a0 (since no 'c' yet)\n        count_b = count_b0 (since no 'c' yet)\n\n    And then C appends k 'c's, where k is either count_a0 or count_b0.\n\n    But note: the entire string then becomes:\n        count_a = count_a0\n        count_b = count_b0\n        count_c",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by following a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order with certain constraints. The solution involves checking the order of characters and verifying the count conditions for the appended characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Character Order**: The string must consist of three contiguous segments: one or more 'a's followed by one or more 'b's followed by one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like 'a's after 'b's or 'c's) makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Validation**: After confirming the correct order, we check if the number of 'c's appended is either equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the entire string. Additionally, there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    a_count = 0\n    b_count = 0\n    c_count = 0\n    \n    found_a = False\n    found_b = False\n    found_c = False\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if found_b or found_c:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n            found_a = True\n            a_count += 1\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if found_c:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n            found_b = True\n            b_count += 1\n        elif char == 'c':\n            found_c = True\n            c_count += 1\n            \n    if not found_b or not found_c:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Order Check**: The code iterates through each character in the string to ensure that all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. If any character appears out of order (like a 'b' before an 'a' or a 'c' before a 'b'), the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Count Validation**: After verifying the correct order, the code checks if the number of 'c's is either equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The code also checks for the presence of at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string. If either is missing, the string is invalid.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural integrity of the string (order of characters) and the numerical conditions required for validity, ensuring correctness across all specified scenarios.",
