Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to combine the first two strings (guest's name and host's name) and then check if the combined string has exactly the same letters as the third string (the pile), with the same frequencies.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any extra whitespace.\n 2. Concatenate the first two strings to form the expected letters.\n 3. Compare the sorted list of characters of the expected string with the sorted list of characters of the pile string.\n    - Alternatively, we can use a frequency counter for each letter.\n\n However, note: the problem says that there should be no extra letters and we should be able to form the two names exactly.\n\n But note: the example input might have multiple words? The problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input description says: \"The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\"\n\n And the example input format is given as an array of strings, but actually the input is three separate lines.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n We can do:\n\n   s1 = input().strip()\n   s2 = input().strip()\n   s3 = input().strip()\n\n Then, let total_string = s1 + s2\n Let pile_string = s3\n\n We need to check if the multiset (frequency) of total_string is equal to the multiset of pile_string.\n\n However, note: the example input provided in the problem statement is given as:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n But that is just one example. In reality, we'll get three separate lines.\n\n Approach 1: sort both strings and compare.\n\n   sorted(total_string) == sorted(pile_string)\n\n But wait, what if there are different lengths? Then they are not the same.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n   if len(total_string) != len(pile_string):\n        print(\"NO\")\n   else:\n        if sorted(total_string) == sorted(pile_string):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n However, note: the problem says \"verify that there are no extra letters\", meaning the pile must have exactly the same letters as the combined names.\n\n But wait, what if there are repeated letters? Sorting will take care of that.\n\n Example 1: \n   guest = \"SANTACLAUS\", host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   total_string = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Let's count the letters:\n\n   total_string: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S, D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z\n\n   pile: S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S\n\n   If we sort total_string: \n        ['A','A','A','C','D','D','E','L','M','N','O','O','R','S','S','T','U','Z'] -> but wait, let me write them:\n\n        total_string: \n          S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S, D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z\n\n        Sorted: \n          A, A, A, C, D, D, E, L, M, N, O, O, R, S, S, T, U, Z\n\n   pile: \n        S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S\n\n        Sorted: \n          A, A, A, C, D, D, E, L, M, N, O, O, R, S, S, T, U, Z\n\n   They are the same.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   total_string = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n   pile_string = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   We can check the length: \n        len(total_string) = 9 + 9 = 18\n        len(pile_string) = 20 -> so NO.\n\n Example 3:\n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   total_string = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> length 20+14 = 34?\n        Let me count: \n            BABBONATALE: 11 letters\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS: 14 letters -> total 25.\n\n        pile_string = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> 26 letters -> so NO.\n\n So, the above approach would work.\n\n However, note: the example outputs are ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n But wait, the example input is given as an array of three strings, but actually the sample input has three lines.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   s1 = input().strip()\n   s2 = input().strip()\n   s3 = input().strip()\n\n   total = s1 + s2\n   if len(total) != len(s3):\n        print(\"NO\")\n   else:\n        # Sort both and compare\n        if sorted(total) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait, what if the names are case-sensitive? The problem says uppercase Latin letters, so we don't have to worry about case.\n\n However, note: the example input has uppercase only.\n\n This solution is O(n log n) which is acceptable for strings up to 200 characters (each line <=100, so total <=200).\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   total = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" (length 18)\n   s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" (length 18) -> same length.\n\n   Then sorted(total) and sorted(s3) are the same.\n\n Example 2: \n   total = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\" (length 18) but s3 has length 20 -> NO.\n\n Example 3: \n   total = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\" (length 11+14=25) and s3 has 26 -> NO.\n\n Therefore, the code below implements this logic.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n But that is just the example representation. In the actual input, each string is on a separate line.\n\n Let's run the code with the provided examples.\n\n But wait, the example input has three lines per example? Actually, the problem states three lines. The example output is given as an array of three elements, but that's just the example representation.\n\n We'll assume standard input.\n\n Code:\n\n   s1 = input().strip()\n   s2 = input().strip()\n   s3 = input().strip()\n\n   total = s1 + s2\n   if len(total) != len(s3):\n        print(\"NO\")\n   else:\n        if sorted(total) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n However, note: the example input has three lines. The example input provided in the problem statement is:\n\n   Input:\n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   But wait, the example input format in the problem statement is given as an array of three strings, but the actual input is three lines.\n\n   So our code reads three lines.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But note: the second example input is:\n\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   And the third example input is:\n\n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   And the expected outputs are YES, NO, NO.\n\n   However, wait: the example output is given as ['YES','NO','NO'] for the entire example set? \n\n   Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Input: \n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        Output: \n            ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   But note: that input representation is confusing. It seems they provided three example cases, each being a string of three lines.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\". So we are reading three lines.\n\n   But the example input is given as one string with newlines embedded? Actually, the problem states:\n\n        The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\n\n   So we are reading three lines.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is just one way to represent three lines. In reality, the input file would have:\n\n        Line1: SANTACLAUS\n        Line2: DEDMOROZ\n        Line3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   So our code will read:\n\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Then total = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", and then compare with \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   But wait, the example output for the first sample is \"YES\", and the other two are \"NO\".\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input provided in the problem statement is actually three examples? Or is it one example?\n\n   The problem says:\n\n        Input: \n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        Output: \n            ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   This suggests that the input file is providing three separate test cases? But the problem says \"three lines\". \n\n   Actually, the problem does not specify multiple test cases. It says \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning one test case.\n\n   But the example output is given as an array of three strings. \n\n   There's confusion. However, looking at the problem statement again, it says:\n\n        The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n        [Problem description]\n\n        Example\n        ### Input\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        ### Output\n        ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   This example is showing three separate inputs and their outputs. But the problem is defined for one test case.\n\n   Clarification: the problem expects one test case. The example shows three examples, but we are writing a program that reads one test case.\n\n   Since the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", we are reading three lines.\n\n   The example input provided in the problem statement is just for illustration and is not the actual input to the program.\n\n   Therefore, we assume the input is three lines.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the example input strings have newlines? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But in reality, when we read from stdin, we are reading three lines. Each line is stripped of any extraneous whitespace.\n\n   But the example input is embedded in a list and has '\\n' as separators. This is just for representation.\n\n   So we'll proceed.\n\n   But wait: what if the input has spaces? The problem says \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" So no spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we can safely use .strip().\n\n   However, if there are trailing newlines or spaces, .strip() removes them. But since the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters, we don't expect spaces.\n\n   But using .strip() is safe.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   s1 = input().strip()\n   s2 = input().strip()\n   s3 = input().strip()\n\n   total_length = len(s1) + len(s2)\n   if total_length != len(s3):\n        print(\"NO\")\n   else:\n        if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n Let me test with the first example:\n\n   s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\" -> len 10\n   s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\" -> len 8, so total_length = 18\n   s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> len 18\n\n   Now, sorted(s1+s2) = sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\") \n   sorted(s3) = sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n   We can compare the two sorted lists.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use collections.Counter for a more efficient solution? \n\n   But note: the length is at most 200, so sorting is acceptable.\n\n   However, let's consider the possibility of performance: worst-case 200 elements, so sorting 200 elements is very fast.\n\n   But we can also use Counter:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n\n   This is also O(n) and might be faster for large inputs, but here n<=200.\n\n   Which one is better? \n\n   Sorting: two lists of size 200, so 400 elements in total? Actually, no: the total string is 200 at most, so two lists of 200 elements.\n\n   Actually, the length of s1+s2 is 200, so we are sorting two lists of 200 elements.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n\n   But note: if the total_length is not equal, we already print \"NO\". The Counter method doesn't require the length to be the same, but it will automatically fail if the counts don't match because the length is part of the multiset.\n\n   However, the Counter method would also work without the length check, but we already did the length check.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"There are no extra letters\", so the pile must have exactly the same letters.\n\n   Using Counter: \n\n        if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n\n   This is more direct: it checks that the frequency of each letter in s1+s2 is the same as in s3.\n\n   And it also implies the same length.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But note: what if there are different letters? The Counter will catch that.\n\n   However, the problem says the letters are uppercase Latin letters, so we don't have to worry about other characters.\n\n   Also, the length condition is implicitly checked by Counter (because if the length is different, the counts for some letters would differ).\n\n   But wait, what if the pile has an extra letter that is not in the names? Then the Counter for that letter in s3 would be higher, so it fails.\n\n   This method is more robust and doesn't require the length check separately.\n\n   However, the problem says the pile may have extra letters, so we are checking that the multiset is exactly the same.\n\n   So we can use the Counter method.\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Counter(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\") == Counter(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\") -> True\n\n   Example 2: \n        Counter(\"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\") == Counter(\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\") -> False, because the lengths are different (18 vs 20) so the Counters won't match.\n\n   Example 3: \n        Counter(\"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\") == Counter(\"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\") -> False (different lengths and counts)\n\n   But note: the Counter method is more efficient in the sense that if the length is different, we don't even need to build two Counters? Actually, no: we build the Counter for s1+s2 and for s3. \n\n   However, building a Counter for a string of 200 is very fast.\n\n   Considering clarity and correctness, I choose the Counter method.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say the length of each line is at most 100, so total length 200, which is small.\n\n   However, the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", but the constraints are small.\n\n   We'll use the Counter method.\n\n   Code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait: the example input has three lines, and we are reading three lines.\n\n   However, note: the example input representation in the problem statement is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is just a representation. In reality, we read three lines.\n\n   But wait, what if the input has newline characters? The problem says the input consists of three lines. The newline characters are separating the lines, but we are stripping each line. \n\n   However, the example input strings do not include newline characters because the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters.\n\n   But if we read a line and there is a newline, then .strip() removes it. So it's safe.\n\n   But what if the input is given with spaces? The problem says uppercase letters only.\n\n   We are safe.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is three lines, so we must read three lines.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input:\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   Example 3:\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait, the example input representation has the pile string as the third line. In the first example, the pile string is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is the third line.\n\n   However, note: the example input representation is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This means the first element of the list is the entire first line (without the newline) and then the second element is the entire second line? Actually, no. The problem's example representation is just a list of three strings, each string being a complete test case.\n\n   But our program reads three lines. So we are good.\n\n   However, if we are getting the input from a file that has three lines, then the above code works.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we are reading three lines.\n\n   We'll submit the Counter version.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the problem says the letters are uppercase, so we don't have to worry about case.\n\n   But what if the names have the same letters but in different cases? The problem says uppercase, so we are safe.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples through the Counter code.\n\n   Example 1: \n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Counter(s1+s2) = \n            'S': 2, 'A': 3, 'N': 1, 'T': 1, 'C':1, 'L':1, 'U':1, 'D':2, 'E':1, 'M':1, 'O':2, 'R':1, 'Z':1\n\n        Counter(s3) = \n            'S':2, 'A':3, 'N':1, 'T':1, 'M':1, 'O':2, 'R':1, 'Z':1, 'D':2, 'E':1, 'L':1, 'C':1, 'U':1\n\n        They are the same.\n\n   Example 2: \n        s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\", s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\", s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Counter(s1+s2) = \n            'P':2, 'A':2, 'I':1, 'N':1, 'O':2, 'E':1, 'L':1, 'J':1, 'U':2, 'K':2\n\n        Counter(s3) = \n            'J':1, 'O':2, 'U':3, 'L':2, 'N':1, 'A':2, 'P':1, 'I':1, 'E':1, 'K':1\n\n        Not the same.\n\n   Example 3: \n        s1 = \"BABBONATALE\", s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Counter(s1+s2) = \n            'B':3, 'A':4, 'O':2, 'N':2, 'T':2, 'E':1, 'F':1, 'H':1, 'R':2, 'C':1, 'H':1, 'R':2, ... wait, let me count:\n\n        Actually, let me break down:\n\n        s1 = \"BABBONATALE\": \n            B:2, A:2, O:1, N:1, T:1, E:1, and then the word: BAB, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E -> actually, \n            B:2, A:3, O:1, N:1, T:1, E:1, L:1\n\n        s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\":\n            F:1, A:1, T:1, H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H:1, R:1, I:1, S:1, T:1, M:1, A:1, S:1\n            Actually, let me count properly:\n\n            F:1, A:2, T:2, H:2, E:1, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1\n\n        Total for s1+s2:\n            B:2, A:5, O:1, N:1, T:3, E:2, F:1, H:2, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1, L:1\n\n        Now, s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\":\n\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            B:3, A:5, B: (already counted) -> \n            B:3, A:5, C:1, H:2, R:2, I:1, S:2, T:3, M:1, O:1, N:1, L:2, E:3, F:1\n\n        Wait, let me count s3:\n\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            B: 3 (positions:0,1,9)\n            A: 5 (positions:2,4,14,16,22)\n            C:1\n            H:2\n            R:2\n            I:1\n            S:2\n            T:3 (positions:6,12,18, ... wait, let me break the string:\n\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            Break into letters:\n\n            B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R\n\n            Actually, I think the example input representation might have been truncated.\n\n            But the example input representation is:\n\n                'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'\n\n            The third line is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            Let me count:\n\n                B: appears 3 times (first two B's and then one more later)\n                A: appears 5 times (including the two in BONATALLE?

The problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters, but the newline is not part of the letters. \n\n   We are stripping, so if there's a space, then we remove it. But the problem says no spaces. \n\n   However, to be safe, the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters, so no spaces. But the newline is present at the end of each line? \n\n   The input function by default includes the newline in the string? Actually, no: the input() function in Python returns the line without the trailing newline if the line ends with a newline. But if the input is coming from a file and the last line doesn't have a newline, then it might include the newline? \n\n   The problem says three lines. We are reading three lines. The input() function will read until the newline and then stop. So the trailing newline is removed.\n\n   But if the input is given without a newline at the end of the last line, then .strip() might remove trailing spaces, but the problem says only uppercase letters. So we are safe.\n\n   However, using .strip() is safe because it removes any leading/trailing whitespace. The problem says the letters are uppercase, so no whitespace should be there.\n\n   But if there is whitespace, then the Counter will see that as a letter? No, because the problem says only uppercase letters. \n\n   We'll assume the input is well-formed.\n\n   Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n   But note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the total length is 200. The Counter will handle that.\n\n   We'll submit.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset (frequency count) of letters in the pile matches the multiset of letters from the concatenated guest and host names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The first two lines of input represent the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line contains the letters found in the pile.\n2. **Concatenate Names:** Combine the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Frequency Comparison:** Use a frequency counter (like Python's `collections.Counter`) to compare the letter counts between the concatenated names and the pile letters. If the counts match exactly, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for an exact match in letter frequencies, ensuring no extra or missing letters are present in the pile.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines of input, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names:** The guest's name (`s1`) and the host's name (`s2`) are concatenated into a single string.\n3. **Frequency Check:** The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile letters (`s3`). If the counts match, it means the pile letters can exactly form the combined names, so the output is \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n\nThis method ensures that the solution is both efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in tools for handling frequency counts. The complexity is linear with respect to the length of the input strings, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
