Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all the letters must be the same (the same letter for the entire diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, and that letter is different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the example input has:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n      Output: 'NO'\n\n   Why? In the center, the diagonals meet at the center. But note the third row (index 2) and third column (index 2) have an 's' in the center?\n      Actually, the example input has the third row as \"soxoo\", meaning the center is 'x'? Wait, let's index from 0 to 4.\n\n      Row 0: \"xooox\"\n      Row 1: \"oxoxo\"\n      Row 2: \"soxoo\" -> Here, the third character (index 2) is 's', but the center of the square (which is [2][2]) should be part of both diagonals.\n\n      The condition says: the diagonals must be the same. Let's check the main diagonal: \n          [0][0] = 'x'\n          [1][1] = 'o' -> wait, this is not the same as the first element.\n\n      Actually, the example input provided in the problem is:\n          Input: ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]\n\n      But wait, let me read the example again:\n\n      Example Input:\n          5\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          oxoxo\n          xooox\n\n      Then the main diagonal: \n          positions: (0,0): 'x', (1,1): 'o', (2,2): 'x', (3,3): 'o', (4,4): 'x'\n      This is not all the same.\n\n      So the condition fails because the main diagonal has alternating 'x' and 'o'.\n\n      But the example output is 'NO'. \n\n      However, the second example:\n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      Main diagonal: \n          (0,0): 'w', (1,1): 's', (2,2): 'w' -> not the same? But wait, the example output is 'YES'\n\n      Let me re-read the condition: \n        \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n      For the second example, the two diagonals are:\n        Main diagonal: ['w', 's', 'w'] -> not the same? \n        Anti-diagonal: ['w', 's', 'w'] -> also not the same?\n\n      But wait, the example output is 'YES'. \n\n      Let me check the problem statement again: \n        \"Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if: \n         on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; \n         all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n      However, in the example \"wsw\\nsws\\nwsw\", the diagonals are not constant? \n        Main diagonal: [w, s, w] -> not constant (unless we consider that the two ends are the same and the middle is different? That doesn't fit).\n\n      Alternatively, I think I misunderstood the problem. The problem says \"all letters are the same\" on the diagonal. So the entire diagonal must be one letter.\n\n      But in the example, the main diagonal is ['w','s','w'] which is not the same letter (because 'w' != 's').\n\n      Why is the example output 'YES'?\n\n      Let me check the example again. The example input is:\n\n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      Now, note: the diagonals are:\n        Main diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) -> 'w', 's', 'w'\n        Anti-diagonal: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) -> 'w', 's', 'w'\n\n      The problem requires that the entire diagonal is the same letter. So the main diagonal must be three 'w's? Or three 's's? It's not.\n\n      But wait, perhaps the problem means that the diagonals must have the same letter throughout, but it does not say that the two diagonals must have the same letter as each other? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n      This implies that the main diagonal has one letter (say, letter A) and the anti-diagonal has one letter (say, letter B). However, the example output is 'YES'. \n\n      Then the second condition: all other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter (different from A and B). \n\n      In the example, the other squares are:\n        (0,1): 's'\n        (1,0): 's'\n        (1,2): 's'\n        (2,1): 's'\n\n      So the non-diagonal squares are all 's'. And the diagonals are 'w' and 's'? But wait, the diagonals have both 'w' and 's'. \n\n      Actually, the example has the diagonals containing two 'w' and one 's'. So the condition that the diagonal must be the same letter is not met.\n\n      There seems to be a contradiction.\n\n  After reading the problem statement again, I notice the example:\n\n      Example Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      Output: YES\n\n  This suggests that the diagonals are considered to be the same if they are both composed of the same letter? But wait, the example has two different letters in the main diagonal: 'w' and 's'. \n\n  Let me clarify: the problem says \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". \n\n  This means:\n      For the main diagonal: every letter from [0][0] to [n-1][n-1] must be the same.\n      For the anti-diagonal: every letter from [0][n-1] to [n-1][0] must be the same.\n\n  But in the example, the main diagonal is ['w','s','w'] -> not all same.\n\n  So why is the answer YES?\n\n  Wait, the example input was provided as:\n\n      Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      And the example output is YES.\n\n  There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n  Let me check the example visually:\n\n      w s w\n      s w s\n      w s w\n\n  The diagonals are:\n      Main diagonal: top-left to bottom-right: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> wait, no, the example input is given as:\n\n        Line0: \"wsw\" -> [0][0]='w', [0][1]='s', [0][2]='w'\n        Line1: \"sws\" -> [1][0]='s', [1][1]='w', [1][2]='s'\n        Line2: \"wsw\" -> [2][0]='w', [2][1]='s', [2][2]='w'\n\n  So the main diagonal is: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> all 'w'. \n  The anti-diagonal: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w' -> all 'w'. \n\n  But wait, the example input is written as:\n\n      3\n      wsw\n      sws\n      wsw\n\n  So the second line is \"sws\", meaning the center is 'w'? Then the example input is actually:\n\n      w s w\n      s w s\n      w s w\n\n  Then the diagonals are indeed all 'w'. \n\n  But wait, the example input string in the problem is given as:\n\n      ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n  The second example is: '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'\n\n  So the three lines are: \n      Line0: \"wsw\"\n      Line1: \"sws\"\n      Line2: \"wsw\"\n\n  Now, the second line is \"sws\", which means:\n      [1][0] = 's', [1][1] = 'w', [1][2] = 's'\n\n  Therefore, the main diagonal is: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> that's correct.\n\n  The anti-diagonal: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w' -> that's correct.\n\n  Then the non-diagonal squares: \n      (0,1): 's'\n      (0,2) is on the anti-diagonal? Actually, (0,2) is the first element of the anti-diagonal. \n      We need to mark the diagonals. The main diagonal includes (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal includes (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). \n\n  So the non-diagonal squares are:\n      (0,1): 's'\n      (1,0): 's'\n      (1,2): 's'\n      (2,1): 's'\n\n  So the non-diagonals are all 's'. And 's' is different from the diagonal letter 'w'. \n\n  Therefore, the conditions are satisfied.\n\n  What was my mistake? I thought the second example was:\n\n      w s w\n      s w s   -> but wait, the second line is \"sws\", so the center is 'w', and the others are 's'. \n\n  So the example is correctly represented.\n\n  Now, the first example:\n\n      5\n      xooox\n      oxoxo\n      soxoo\n      oxoxo\n      xooox\n\n  Let's break it down:\n\n  The grid:\n\n      x o o o x\n      o x o x o\n      s o x o o\n      o x o x o\n      x o o o x\n\n  Main diagonal: \n      (0,0): 'x'\n      (1,1): 'x' -> wait, the second row second character is 'x'? \n          Second row: \"oxoxo\" -> so (1,0)='o', (1,1)='x', (1,2)='o', (1,3)='x', (1,4)='o'\n      (2,2): 'x' -> third row: \"soxoo\", so (2,0)='s', (2,1)='o', (2,2)='x', (2,3)='o', (2,4)='o'\n      (3,3): 'x'\n      (4,4): 'x'\n\n  So the main diagonal is: ['x','x','x','x','x'] -> all 'x'\n\n  Anti-diagonal:\n      (0,4): 'x'\n      (1,3): 'x'\n      (2,2): 'x'\n      (3,1): 'x' -> fourth row: \"oxoxo\", (3,0)='o', (3,1)='x', (3,2)='o', (3,3)='x', (3,4)='o'\n      (4,0): 'x'\n\n  So the anti-diagonal is: ['x','x','x','x','x'] -> all 'x'\n\n  Then the non-diagonal squares must be the same letter and different from 'x'. \n\n  Let's check the non-diagonal squares:\n\n      First row: \n        (0,1): 'o', (0,2): 'o', (0,3): 'o'\n      Second row:\n        (1,0): 'o', (1,2): 'o', (1,4): 'o'\n      Third row:\n        (2,0): 's', (2,1): 'o', (2,3): 'o', (2,4): 'o' -> wait, (2,0) is 's', which is not 'o'\n\n  Therefore, the non-diagonal squares are not all the same: we have 'o' and 's'. \n\n  So the condition fails.\n\n  However, wait: the example output for the first example is 'NO'. \n\n  But wait, in the example input, the third row is \"soxoo\", so the first character (index0) is 's'. \n\n  So the program must return \"NO\".\n\n  Now, what about the third example?\n\n      Input: \n          3\n          xpx\n          pxp\n          xpe\n\n      Grid:\n\n          x p x\n          p x p\n          x p e\n\n      Main diagonal: [0][0]='x', [1][1]='x', [2][2]='e' -> not the same (x, x, e) -> fails.\n\n      But even if we check the anti-diagonal: [0][2]='x', [1][1]='x', [2][0]='x' -> all 'x'. However, the main diagonal isn't all the same.\n\n      So condition 1 fails: both diagonals must be the same. \n\n      Alternatively, the problem says \"on both diagonals\" meaning each diagonal must be uniform, but they can be different from each other? \n\n      Let me read the problem again: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n      This could be interpreted as: \n          Condition 1a: The main diagonal has one letter (say, letter A).\n          Condition 1b: The anti-diagonal has one letter (say, letter B). \n          There is no requirement that A == B.\n\n      But then the example:\n\n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      has A = 'w' and B = 'w', which is consistent.\n\n      Now, the third example:\n\n          Main diagonal: ['x','x','e'] -> not the same, so condition 1a fails.\n\n      Also, the anti-diagonal: ['x','x','x'] -> same, but condition 1a fails so overall condition fails.\n\n      Therefore, we can proceed with the following plan:\n\n      Step 1: Read n, then n lines.\n\n      Step 2: Check the main diagonal and anti-diagonal:\n\n          main_diag_letters = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n          anti_diag_letters = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n      Step 3: Check that all characters in main_diag_letters are the same, and all characters in anti_diag_letters are the same.\n\n      Step 4: Let d1 = the letter for the main diagonal (if there is one, otherwise if the list is empty but n>=3 so not empty, then we take the first)\n               d2 = the letter for the anti-diagonal.\n\n      Step 5: Now, we must check that the rest of the grid (non-diagonal elements) are all the same letter, and that letter is different from both d1 and d2.\n\n      But note: what if d1 != d2? Then the non-diagonal letter must be the same and different from d1 and d2.\n\n      However, the problem does not explicitly require that the two diagonals are the same letter. They can be different.\n\n      Step 6: Traverse the grid and for every cell (i, j) that is not on either diagonal, check that it is the same letter, say 'c'.\n\n      How to check if a cell (i,j) is on a diagonal?\n          - It is on the main diagonal if i == j.\n          - It is on the anti-diagonal if i+j == n-1.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          non_diag_letter = None\n          for i in range(n):\n              for j in range(n):\n                  if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                      continue   # skip the diagonal cells\n                  else:\n                      if non_diag_letter is None:\n                          non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                      elif grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                          print(\"NO\")\n                          exit(0)\n\n          However, wait: what if the grid has non-diagonal cells that are not the same? Then we break.\n\n      But note: there might be no non-diagonal cell if n=1? But n>=3 and odd, so minimum n=3, so there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n      However, we must also ensure that the non_diag_letter is different from d1 and d2.\n\n      But note: if d1 != d2, then we have two distinct diagonal letters. The non-diagonal letter must be a third letter? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\"\n\n      So the non-diagonal letter must be different from d1 and from d2.\n\n      But if d1 == d2, then the non-diagonal letter must be different from that one letter.\n\n      Therefore, we can:\n\n          Condition 1: main_diag_letters are all the same -> let d1 = main_diag_letters[0]\n          Condition 2: anti_diag_letters are all the same -> let d2 = anti_diag_letters[0]\n\n          Condition 3: Every non-diagonal cell is the same letter, say c, and c != d1 and c != d2.\n\n      However, note: the problem does not require that the two diagonals are the same letter. They can be different.\n\n      But wait, the example with n=3 and the example input:\n\n          3\n          www\n          www\n          www\n\n      This would be an X? Actually, no. The diagonals are all 'w', and the non-diagonals must be a letter different from 'w'. \n\n      But in the above example, the non-diagonals are also 'w'. So condition fails.\n\n      Another example:\n\n          3\n          www\n          www\n          www\n\n      -> NO.\n\n      Now, what if the two diagonals are different? Example:\n\n          3\n          aba\n          bbb\n          cab\n\n      Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not same -> NO.\n\n      Let me create a valid example with two different diagonals:\n\n          n=3\n          a b c\n          d e f\n          g h i\n\n      Conditions for diagonals:\n          Main: [a, e, i] -> must be same, say 'x'\n          Anti: [c, e, g] -> must be same, say 'y'\n\n      Then the non-diagonal: \n          [b,d,f,h] must be the same letter, say 'z'\n\n      Example:\n\n          x o o\n          o y o\n          o o x\n\n      But wait, in a 3x3:\n\n          x o o\n          o y o\n          o o x\n\n      Main diagonal: [x, y, x] -> not same. So invalid.\n\n      Another try:\n\n          a b c\n          d e f\n          g h i\n\n      We require:\n          a, e, i are the same -> say 'x'\n          c, e, g are the same -> say 'y'\n\n      Then the non-diagonals: [b, d, f, h] must be the same and different from 'x' and 'y'.\n\n      Example:\n\n          x . y\n          . y .\n          y . x\n\n      But wait, the anti-diagonal: [y, y, y] -> okay, but the main diagonal: [x, y, x] -> not the same (unless x=y, but then non-diagonal must be different from x, but x=y so non-diagonal must be different from x, but then the center is x and also part of anti-diagonal, so if x=y then the center is the same for both diagonals, which is allowed by the condition? \n\n      Actually, the condition does not require the two diagonals to be the same letter, but they can share the center. \n\n      However, the example above has the main diagonal [x, y, x] which is not uniform unless x=y. \n\n      So if we set x=y, then the main diagonal becomes [x,x,x] and the anti-diagonal is [x,x,x]. Then the non-diagonal must be a letter different from x.\n\n      Example:\n\n          3\n          xxx\n          xxx\n          xxx\n\n      Then non-diagonal: none? Actually, in 3x3, the diagonals cover:\n          (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) and (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). \n      So the non-diagonal are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). \n\n      If the entire grid is 'x', then the non-diagonals are 'x' too. Condition fails.\n\n      Now, if we set:\n\n          a b c\n          d e f\n          g h i\n\n      with:\n          a = i = 'x'\n          c = g = 'y'\n          and the center e must be both 'x' and 'y'? Then x=y.\n\n      So the two diagonals must have the same letter at the center. Therefore, the two diagonals must be the same letter? Because the center is common. \n\n      Actually, the main diagonal: [a, e, i] must be the same. The anti-diagonal: [c, e, g] must be the same. Since e is common, then the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal must be the same letter.\n\n      Therefore, d1 must equal d2.\n\n      So we can simplify: \n          Condition 1: The main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, and the center element (which is common) must be the same. Therefore, the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal must be the same letter.\n\n      But wait, the example:\n\n          3\n          www\n          wwww   -> wait, no, we have 3 rows. Let me write:\n\n          Row0: \"www\"\n          Row1: \"www\"\n          Row2: \"www\"\n\n      Then the main diagonal: [w,w,w] -> uniform.\n      Anti-diagonal: [w,w,w] -> uniform.\n      And the center is w, so d1=d2='w'.\n\n      Then non-diagonal must be same and different from 'w'. But the non-diagonal is also 'w' (because the entire grid is w). -> fails.\n\n      Now, example with d1=d2='w':\n\n          Grid:\n          w . w\n          . w .\n          w . w\n\n      But wait, the non-diagonal are the dots. Let me fill the non-diagonal with 'x':\n\n          w x w\n          x w x\n          w x w\n\n      Now, check:\n\n          Main diagonal: [w, w, w] -> uniform.\n          Anti-diagonal: [w, w, w] -> uniform.\n          Non-diagonal: [x, x, x] -> uniform and different from 'w'.\n\n      This is valid.\n\n      Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and grid.\n\n        Step 2: Extract the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n\n        Step 3: Check if all elements in the main diagonal are the same, and all elements in the anti-diagonal are the same.\n\n        Step 4: Since the center is common, the two diagonals must have the same letter. But wait, what if the grid is:\n\n                a b c\n                d e f\n                g h i\n\n            and we require the main diagonal: [a,e,i] same, anti-diagonal: [c,e,g] same. Then e must be the same for both, so the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n        Step 5: Check that every non-diagonal cell is the same letter (say, 'x') and that 'x' is different from the diagonal letter (say, 'y').\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require that the two diagonals are the same letter? But our reasoning above shows that they must be because they share the center.\n\n        Actually, the problem statement does not explicitly say that the two diagonals must have the same letter, but the condition that the entire main diagonal is the same and the entire anti-diagonal is the same, and they share the center, forces the two diagonals to be the same letter.\n\n        Therefore, we can combine:\n\n          d = the main_diagonal[0]   (since we know they are same, so all are d)\n          Similarly, the anti-diagonal must be d.\n\n        So:\n\n          Condition 1: \n            for i in range(n): \n                if grid[i][i] != d: -> fail\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][n-1-i] != d: -> fail\n\n        Condition 2: \n            non_diag_letter = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i==j or i+j==n-1:\n                        continue\n                    if non_diag_letter is None:\n                        non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            exit(0)\n\n        Condition 3: \n            if non_diag_letter is None: \n                # This only happens when n=1, but n>=3, so skip.\n                pass\n            else:\n                if non_diag_letter == d:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n        Then, if we complete without breaking, print \"YES\".\n\n      But wait: what if the grid is 3x3 and the two diagonals are the same, but the non-diagonal letter is the same as d? Then condition 3 fails.\n\n      However, what if the two diagonals are the same and the non-diagonal is the same as d? Then we have:\n\n          Example: \n            a b c\n            d e f\n            g h i\n\n          Main: a=e=i=d\n          Anti: c=e=g=d\n          Non-diagonal: b, d, f, h must be d? Then the entire grid is d -> then condition 3: non_diag_letter is d, same as d -> fails.\n\n      So we output \"NO\".\n\n      Now, let me test with the example that should be YES:\n\n          n=3, grid:\n            ['www','www','www'] -> entire grid is 'w'. \n          Condition 1: \n            main: [w,w,w] -> ok, d='w'\n            anti: [w,w,w] -> ok.\n          Condition 2: non_diag_letter: we look for non-diagonal cells. In 3x3, the non-diagonals are:\n            (0,1): 'w', (1,0): 'w', (1,2): 'w', (2,1): 'w'\n            non_diag_letter is set to 'w'\n          Condition 3: non_diag_letter == 'w' and d=='w' -> fails -> outputs \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n      Another example (valid):\n\n          n=3\n          grid = [\n            \"w.x\",\n            \".wx\",\n            \"x..\"\n          ]\n\n          Actually, let me build the valid example:\n\n          We want the diagonals to be 'w' and the non-diagonals to be '.' (dot) and different from 'w'.\n\n          Example:\n\n            w . w\n            . w .\n            w . w\n\n          But wait, the grid has to be 3x3. \n\n          Represented as:\n\n            row0: \"w.w\"\n            row1: \".w.\"\n            row2: \"w.w\"\n\n          Now, main diagonal: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> ok.\n          anti-diagonal: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w' -> ok.\n\n          Non-diagonals: \n            (0,1): '.' -> set to '.'\n            (1,0): '.' -> same\n            (1,2): '.' -> same\n            (2,1): '.' -> same\n\n          Condition 3: '.' != 'w' -> ok.\n\n          So output \"YES\".\n\n      However, note: the example input provided in the problem:\n\n          Example 1: \n            Input: 5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox -> NO (we already saw)\n\n          Example 2: \n            Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> YES\n\n          Example 3: \n            Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe -> NO\n\n      Let me test example 2:\n\n          n=3\n          grid = [\n            \"wsw\",\n            \"sws\",\n            \"wsw\"\n          ]\n\n          Main diagonal: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> ok, d='w'\n          Anti-diagonal: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w' -> ok.\n\n          Non-diagonals: \n            (0,1): 's'\n            (1,0): 's'\n            (1,2): 's'\n            (2,1): 's'\n\n          non_diag_letter = 's'\n          Condition 3: 's' != 'w' -> ok.\n\n          So output \"YES\".\n\n      Example 3:\n\n          n=3\n          grid = [\n            \"xpx\",\n            \"pxp\",\n            \"xpe\"\n          ]\n\n          Main diagonal: [0][0]='x', [1][1]='x', [2][2]='e' -> not the same -> condition 1 fails.\n\n          So we break and output \"NO\".\n\n      Therefore, code:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Condition 1: Check both diagonals are uniform and the same letter (actually, we just check they are uniform and then use the same letter for both)\n        d = grid[0][0]   # We'll use this for the diagonal letter\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d:\n                d = None\n                break\n\n        if d is None:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n                d = None\n                break\n\n        if d is None:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Now, check non-diagonal cells\n        non_diag_char = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_char is None:\n                    non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n        # If we didn't find any non-diagonal cell, then we set non_diag_char to None (but n>=3, so there are non-diagonal cells)\n        if non_diag_char is None:\n            # This means there are no non-diagonal cells?

Then main diagonal is 'a','a','a' -> ok. Anti-diagonal: [0][2]='a', [1][1]='a', [2][0]='a' -> ok.\n\n      Then non-diagonal: all 'a', which is the same as d -> condition 3 fails -> \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n  But consider:\n\n      n=3\n      grid = [\n          \"bbb\",\n          \"bbb\",\n          \"bbb\"\n      ]\n\n      Then d='b'. Then everything is 'b'. Then non-diagonal is 'b' -> same as d -> \"NO\".\n\n  Now, consider:\n\n      n=3\n      grid = [\n          \"abc\",\n          \"def\",\n          \"ghi\"\n      ]\n\n      Main diagonal: a, e, i -> must be same. But we set d='a'. Then check:\n          i==0: grid[0][0]=='a' -> ok.\n          i==1: grid[1][1]=='e' -> compare to 'a': not same -> d becomes None -> break.\n\n      Then output \"NO\".\n\n  But wait, the main diagonal is not uniform, so we break and output \"NO\".\n\n  However, what if the main diagonal is uniform but not starting with grid[0][0]?\n\n  Example:\n\n      n=3\n      grid = [\n          \"aab\",\n          \"aba\",\n          \"baa\"\n      ]\n\n      Main diagonal: [0][0]='a', [1][1]='a', [2][2]='a' -> uniform, so d='a' (from [0][0]).\n      Anti-diagonal: [0][2]='b', [1][1]='a', [2][0]='b' -> not uniform (b, a, b) -> so condition breaks.\n\n  But wait, the anti-diagonal is not uniform, so we break and output \"NO\".\n\n  However, what if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, but the anti-diagonal has a different letter than the main diagonal? \n\n  Example:\n\n      n=3\n      grid = [\n          \"aaa\",\n          \"aaa\",\n          \"aaa\"\n      ]\n\n      But wait, the entire grid is 'a'. Then the anti-diagonal is 'a','a','a'. \n\n  But note: our code uses d from the main diagonal, and then checks the anti-diagonal against that d.\n\n  However, we just argued that the two diagonals must be the same letter because they share the center. Therefore, if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then the center is the same for both, so the entire anti-diagonal must be the same as the main diagonal's letter.\n\n  So the above code is correct.\n\n  But wait, what if the main diagonal is uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform and with a different letter? \n\n  Example:\n\n      n=3\n      grid = [\n          \"aaa\",\n          \"aba\",\n          \"aaa\"\n      ]\n\n      Main diagonal: [0][0]='a', [1][1]='b', [2][2]='a' -> not uniform -> fails.\n\n  So we don't have to worry.\n\n  However, note: the center is included in both diagonals, so if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then the center must be the same for both. Therefore, the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter as the main diagonal.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, but the center is the same for both, but the other elements are not? \n\n  Example:\n\n      n=3\n      grid = [\n          \"aaa\",\n          \"aaa\",\n          \"aaa\"\n      ]\n\n      Then the entire grid is 'a'. \n\n  But note: the code sets d='a' and then checks the anti-diagonal: all are 'a'. Then non-diagonal: all are 'a' -> same as d -> fails.\n\n  Another example with two different diagonals? \n\n  We cannot have two different diagonals because they share the center. \n\n  Therefore, the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n  So the code is:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        d = grid[0][0]\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d:\n                d = None\n                break\n\n        if d is None:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n                d = None\n                break\n\n        if d is None:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Now, check non-diagonal cells\n        non_diag_char = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_char is None:\n                    non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                        print(\"",

This involves checking each element in these diagonals.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements:** Ensure all elements not on either diagonal are the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n4. **Output Result:** If all conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    d = grid[0][0]\n    \n    # Check main diagonal\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d:\n            d = None\n            break\n            \n    if d is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n            d = None\n            break\n            \n    if d is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    non_diag_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_char is None:\n                non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if non_diag_char is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if non_diag_char == d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading:** The code starts by reading the size of the grid `n` and then reads each row of the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check:** The main diagonal is checked by iterating through each element where the row index equals the column index. Similarly, the anti-diagonal is checked by ensuring each element's row index plus column index equals `n-1`.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check:** The code then iterates through all elements not on the diagonals to ensure they are the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n4. **Result Determination:** If any condition fails (diagonals not uniform, non-diagonal elements not consistent, or non-diagonal letter matches diagonal letter), it prints \"NO\".
