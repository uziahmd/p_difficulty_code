And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers.\n We have to consider all contiguous weeks of length k (there are n-k+1 weeks).\n For each week, we compute the average (sum of the k days divided by k) and then take the overall average over all weeks.\n\n However, note: \n   The overall average is defined as (sum of averages of each week) / (number of weeks)\n But note that the average of a week is (sum of that week) / k.\n\n So, if we let S_i be the sum of the i-th week (from day i to day i+k-1), then the average for that week is S_i / k.\n Then the overall average is (S_1/k + S_2/k + ... + S_{n-k+1}/k) / (n-k+1) = ( (S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) ) / (k * (n-k+1))\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n   total_sum_weeks = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])   [if we use prefix sums]\n\n But note: There is an alternative way to express the overall average.\n\n Let T = total sum of all sleep times for the entire sequence? Not exactly.\n\n However, note that each week is k consecutive days. Each day is included in multiple weeks?\n Actually, the first day is included in the first k days, then the second day is included in the first week and the second week (if k>=2) until the (n-k+1)-th week.\n\n Specifically, the j-th day (0-indexed) is included in the weeks starting from max(0, j-k+1) to min(n-k, j) ? \n Actually, the j-th day is included in the weeks that start from 0 to n-k, but the week starting at index i includes days i to i+k-1.\n So the j-th day is included in the weeks that start from max(0, j-k+1) to min(j, n-k) ??? \n\n Alternatively, we can use prefix sums to avoid nested loops.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the prefix sum array for the list of sleep times.\n    Let `a` be the list, then prefix[0] = 0, prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{i-1}\n\n 2. The sum of the week starting at index i (0-indexed) is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i].\n\n 3. Then the total sum of all weeks is the sum of (prefix[i+k]-prefix[i]) for i from 0 to n-k.\n\n 4. The number of weeks is n-k+1.\n\n 5. Then the overall average is (total_sum_weeks) / (k * (n-k+1)) ?\n\n But wait: \n    total_sum_weeks = (S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1})\n    Then the average per week is (total_sum_weeks) / (n-k+1)\n\n But note: each week's average is S_i/k, so the sum of all week averages is (total_sum_weeks) / k, and then we divide by the number of weeks (n-k+1) to get the overall average.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"average sleeping time over all weeks\", meaning the average of the averages of the weeks.\n\n So: \n    average_over_all_weeks = (sum_{each week} (average of that week)) / (number of weeks)\n                          = (sum_{each week} (S_i / k)) / (n-k+1)\n                          = ( (S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) / k ) / (n-k+1)\n                          = (total_sum_weeks) / (k * (n-k+1))\n\n But note: we can also compute total_sum_weeks without the prefix array by using a sliding window? However, we already have the prefix array.\n\n However, note: there is a more efficient way to compute the total_sum_weeks?\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the entire array is used in overlapping windows. We can use a single pass with a sliding window to compute the sum of all windows.\n\n But let's stick to prefix sum for clarity.\n\n Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n   prefix = [0, 3, 7, 14]\n   Week0: from index0 to index1 -> 3+4 = 7 -> prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 7-0 = 7\n   Week1: from index1 to index2 -> 4+7 = 11 -> prefix[3]-prefix[1] =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of sleep records. A week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are n-k+1 such weeks. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then determining the average sleep time across all weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires processing multiple overlapping windows of size k in an array of size n. For each window, we need to compute the sum of its elements, then find the average for that window by dividing the sum by k. Finally, we average these individual weekly averages.\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, we use a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums. This allows us to compute the sum of any window in constant time by subtracting the appropriate prefix values.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct an array where each element at index i contains the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to (but not including) index i. This enables efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray.\n   - **Sliding Window Sum**: Using the prefix sum array, compute the sum of each window of size k by subtracting the prefix value at the start of the window from the prefix value at the end of the window.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) for constructing the prefix sum array and O(n) for summing all windows, resulting in an overall O(n) time complexity.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the prefix sum array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum = 0.0\n    for i in range(total_weeks):\n        s = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n        total_sum += s\n        \n    average = total_sum / (k * total_weeks)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of days) and k (length of a week), followed by a list of n integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: A prefix sum array is constructed where each entry at index i holds the sum of all elements before i in the original array. This allows efficient computation of subarray sums.\n3. **Window Sum Calculation**: For each possible window of size k, the sum is found by subtracting the prefix value at the start of the window from the prefix value at the end of the window.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the product of k (window size) and the number of windows (n-k+1) to get the average sleep time over all weeks. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages prefix sums to minimize repeated calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
