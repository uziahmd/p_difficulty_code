And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers.\n We have to consider all contiguous weeks of length k (there are n-k+1 weeks).\n For each week, we compute the average (total sleep time in the week divided by k) and then we need to output the overall average over all weeks.\n\n However, note: The problem asks for the average of the averages of each week? But wait, let's read carefully.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n        Averages: (3+4)/2 = 3.5 and (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n        Then the overall average is (3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 9/2 = 4.5.\n\n But note: Alternatively, we can think of it as the total sleep time over all days is used in multiple weeks?\n However, observe: \n        Total sleep time from all weeks: (3+4) + (4+7) = 3+4+4+7 = 18.\n        Number of weeks: 2.\n        Then overall average = 18 / 2 = 9.\n\n But wait, that doesn't match 4.5. Actually, the example output is '9.0000000000'?\n\n Let me check the example again: \n   Example input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n   Output: \"9.0000000000\"\n\n How did they get 9?\n\n Explanation in the problem: \n        \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n They don't show the intermediate steps. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n \"the average sleeping time over all weeks\"\n\n And they say: \"the answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6\"\n\n What is the definition? \n\n Let S = sum_{i=1}^{n-k+1} (average_i) \n But note: each average_i = (sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} a_j) / k.\n\n Then the overall average is (S) / (number of weeks) = S / (n-k+1)\n\n However, note that the same day may appear in multiple weeks. \n\n Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n   total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (a1 + a2 + ... + an) but with the first (k-1) days and the last (k-1) days being counted multiple times?\n\n Actually, no. Each week is independent. But we can also express the overall average as:\n\n   overall_avg = [ (sum_{week=1}^{n-k+1} (sum_{day in week} a_day)) ] / (n-k+1) / k * k? \n\n Wait, let's break down:\n\n   Let W = n-k+1 (number of weeks)\n   Then, the overall average is (total_sleep_in_all_weeks) / (W * k) ??? \n\n But wait, no: because the overall average is defined as the average of the averages of the weeks.\n\n   = (1/W) * sum_{week} ( (1/k) * (sum of week) )\n   = (1/(W*k)) * (sum_{week} (sum of week))\n\n Now, what is the total sleep time summed over all weeks?\n\n   Each day i (from 1 to n) appears in how many weeks?\n     - The first day (index 0) appears in the first k consecutive days: so from week starting at 0 to week starting at n-k (if 0-indexed). \n       Actually, day i (0-indexed) will appear in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) ? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a sliding window and then note that the entire set of weeks is overlapping.\n\n But there is an easier way:\n\n   total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{k-1}) \n                            + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_k)\n                            + ... \n                            + (a_{n-k} + ... + a_{n-1})\n\n   This can be computed by:\n\n   Let T = [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}]\n   Then, the total_sleep_in_all_weeks = \n        (a0 * (number of weeks containing a0)) \n        + (a1 * (number of weeks containing a1)) \n        + ...\n\n   How many weeks contain a0? \n        The first day is included in the first (n - k + 1) weeks? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, for day i (0-indexed), it will be included in the weeks that start from 0 to i (if i < k-1, then from 0 to i) but also must end before n, so the last week that includes day i is the one that starts at i - (k-1) if i-(k-1) >=0, but actually:\n\n   The condition for a week starting at j to include day i: j <= i <= j+k-1.\n   => j <= i and j >= i - k + 1.\n\n   Also j must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive). So the number of weeks containing day i is:\n        L = max(0, i - (k-1))   [but wait, j must be at least 0 and at most n-k]\n        Actually, the smallest j is max(0, i - k + 1) and the largest j is min(i, n-k) but wait, the condition is j<=i and j>= i-k+1 and j from 0 to n-k.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the total_sleep_in_all_weeks by:\n\n        Let prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{i-1}\n        Then the sum of the first window is prefix[k] (if we define prefix[0]=0, then prefix[i] is the sum of first i elements)\n\n        Then the next window is prefix[k+1] - prefix[j] for j=0? Actually, we can use a double ended queue or simply a running total.\n\n   However, note: we can use the fact that the total_sleep_in_all_weeks is the sum of the first window, then each subsequent window adds the next element and removes the first.\n\n   But we don't need to know the individual week averages. We can compute the total_sleep_in_all_weeks by:\n\n        total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (a0 * (min(k, n-k+1))) + ... ?\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the formula:\n\n        total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{k-1}) \n                                + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{k})\n                                + ... \n                                + (a_{n-k} + ... + a_{n-1})\n\n        This can be rewritten as:\n\n        = a0 * (n-k+1 - 0)   [if we consider that a0 is only in the first (n-k+1) - (k-1 - 0) ???]\n\n   Actually, the first element a0 is included in the first (n-k+1) weeks? No, because the first week is from index0 to index k-1, then the second week is index1 to index k, and so on until the week starting at index n-k (so the last week ends at index n-1). \n\n   For a0 (index0): \n        It is included in the weeks starting from 0 to n-k, but only those weeks that start from 0 to 0 (because the week must include index0, so the start j must be <=0 and >=0). Actually, the week starting at j must satisfy j<=0 and j>=0. So only one week: the one starting at 0.\n\n   Similarly, for a1 (index1):\n        The week must start at j such that j<=1 and j>= 1-k+1 = 0 (if k>=2). So j can be 0 and 1. But if k==1, then j must be 1? Actually, if k==1, then the week is just one day, so a1 is included in the week starting at 1.\n\n   In general, the number of weeks that include day i is:\n        left_count = i+1   (weeks starting from 0 to i)\n        right_count = n - i   (weeks ending from i to n-1, and the week must end at i+k-1 which must be <= n-1, so i+k-1 <= n-1 -> i <= n-k, but that's already given by the condition of being in the array)\n\n   Actually, more accurately: \n        The week starting at j must satisfy: j <= i and j+k-1 >= i, and j from 0 to n-k.\n\n        => j <= i and j >= max(0, i-k+1) and j <= n-k.\n\n        So the count = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1   ??? \n\n   But wait, let's test with k=2, n=3, and i=0 (first day):\n        j must be >= max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0, and j <= min(0, n-k)=min(0,1)=0. So count= 0-0+1 = 1.\n\n   i=1: j >= max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0, j<=min(1,1)=1, so count= 1-0+1 = 2? But wait, the week starting at 0: [0,1] -> includes day1, and week starting at 1: [1,2] -> includes day1. So two weeks.\n\n   i=2: j>=max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1, j<=min(2,1)=1, so count=1-1+1=1.\n\n   So the total_sleep_in_all_weeks = a0*1 + a1*2 + a2*1.\n\n   Then, the overall average is (a0*1 + a1*2 + a2*1) / (n-k+1) / k? No.\n\n   Remember: The overall average is the average of the weekly averages.\n\n        = ( ( (a0+a1)/k ) + ( (a1+a2)/k ) ) / 2   [for n=3,k=2, two weeks]\n\n        = ( (a0+a1 + a1+a2) / (2*k) )\n\n        = (a0 + 2*a1 + a2) / (2*k)\n\n   But wait, we just computed the total_sleep_in_all_weeks as (a0 + 2*a1 + a2) and then we divide by (2*k) to get the overall average?\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        overall_avg = (total_sleep_in_all_weeks) / (number_of_weeks * k)\n\n   Because: \n        total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{k-1}) + (a1 + ... + a_k) + ... \n\n        and we have (n-k+1) weeks, each week contributes k days, but note: each day is counted as above.\n\n   So: \n        overall_avg = (total_sleep_in_all_weeks) / ( (n-k+1) * k )\n\n   But wait, in our example: \n        total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (3+4) + (4+7) = 3+4+4+7 = 18.\n        (n-k+1)=2, k=2, so denominator=4.\n        18/4 = 4.5, but the example output is 9.0.\n\n   Why 9.0? \n\n   Let me read the example again: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\", Output: \"9.0000000000\"\n\n   There's a discrepancy.\n\n   Let me reread the problem statement: \n\n        \"the average sleeping time over all weeks\"\n\n   What does that mean? \n\n   They say: \"In the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\n   Wait, in the third example: \n        Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n        Output: \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n   How many weeks? n=8, k=2 -> 7 weeks.\n\n   Then the answer is the sum of the weeks (each week is the sum of two consecutive days) divided by 7.\n\n   So the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" has 3 days and k=2, so 2 weeks. Then the answer should be ( (3+4) + (4+7) ) / 2 = 18/2 = 9.\n\n   Therefore, the overall average is the total_sleep_in_all_weeks divided by the number of weeks (n-k+1).\n\n   But wait, note: the example says \"the result is\" and then they show two weeks. The example output is 9.0.\n\n   So the process is:\n\n        Step1: For each week (each consecutive k days) compute the total sleep (the sum of the week).\n        Step2: Sum all these total sleep amounts (across weeks) and then divide by the number of weeks (n-k+1).\n\n   However, note: the example output for the first sample is 9.0, which is 18/2.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"the average sleeping time over all weeks\". \n\n   In the first sample, we have two weeks. The first week: 3.5 hours, the second week: 5.5 hours. The average of these two numbers is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5.\n\n   But the example output is 9.0.\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Let me check the example output provided in the problem:\n\n        Input: ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n        Output: ['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n   The first sample: 9.0.\n\n   Now, wait: 9.0 is the average of the weeks in terms of total sleep per week? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"the average sleeping time over all weeks\".\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify whether it is the average of the average per week or the average of the total sleep per week.\n\n   However, the example calculation in the problem statement for the first sample is not shown. But the output is 9.0.\n\n   Let me clarify:\n\n   There are two interpretations:\n\n   Interpretation 1: The average of the weekly averages (which is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 4.5)\n\n   Interpretation 2: The average of the total sleep per week (which is (3+4+4+7)/2 = 18/2 = 9)\n\n   The example output is 9.0.\n\n   Therefore, the problem is asking for the average of the total sleep per week, i.e., the average of the sums (not the averages) of the weeks.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\"\n\n   And then: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks\"\n\n   And then the example: \"if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is\"\n\n   Without the intermediate step, but the expected output is 9.0.\n\n   Now, note: the second sample: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n10\"\n        Output: \"10.0000000000\"\n\n        Here, n=1, k=1 -> one week. The week's total sleep is 10. Then the average is 10.\n\n   Third sample: \n        Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n        Output: \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n        Number of weeks = 8-2+1 = 7.\n        The total sleep in all weeks = (1+2) + (2+4) + (4+100000) + (100000+123) + (123+456) + (456+789) + (789+1)\n\n        Let's compute:\n          3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790\n\n        Then divide by 7.\n\n        But the example output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the total_sleep_in_all_weeks by:\n\n        total = 1+2+4+100000+123+456+789+1 = 101476, but wait, that's the entire array.\n\n        However, note: each day except the first and last appears twice, and the first and last once.\n\n        So total_sleep_in_all_weeks = 101476 + 1 + 2   [because the first and last day are added one extra time?] \n\n        Actually, no: the entire array is covered, but the first day (1) is only in the first week, the last day (1) is only in the last week. The others are in two weeks.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n          total_sleep_in_all_weeks = 1*1 + 2*2 + 4*2 + 100000*2 + 123*2 + 456*2 + 789*2 + 1*1\n\n        But wait, the day 1 (first) is in one week, the day 2 (second) is in two weeks, the day 4 (third) is in two weeks, ... and the last day (1) is in one week.\n\n        So: \n          = 1*1 + 2*2 + 4*2 + 100000*2 + 123*2 + 456*2 + 789*2 + 1*1\n          = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n          = 1+4+8+200000+246+912+1578+1 = 200000+ (1+4+8+1)+ (246+912+1578) \n          = 200000+14+2736 = 200000+2750 = 202750\n\n        Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n   So the method is:\n\n        total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (each day multiplied by the number of weeks it appears) \n\n        Then, overall average = total_sleep_in_all_weeks / (n-k+1)\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"the average sleeping time over all weeks\", meaning we are taking the average of the total sleep per week.\n\n   But wait, the example: \n        First sample: total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1) = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18, then divided by 2 (weeks) -> 9.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n        Step1: Read n, k and the list a.\n\n        Step2: If k == 0, but k>=1 so no issue.\n\n        Step3: We need to compute the total_sleep_in_all_weeks.\n\n        How to compute the count for each day?\n\n        For day i (0-indexed), the number of weeks that include it is:\n            left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)   [the earliest week start that includes i is i-k+1, but if negative then 0]\n            right_bound = min(i, n-k)          [the latest week start that includes i is i, but the week must end by n-1, so the start must be at most n-k, and also the week must start at or before i]\n\n        Actually, the number of weeks that include day i is: \n            L = max(0, i - (k-1))   [no, that's not matching]\n\n        Alternatively, the week starting at j must satisfy: j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and j from 0 to n-k.\n\n        So the count = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1   [if the range [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)] is valid]\n\n        But note: we require j>=0 and j<=n-k.\n\n        Actually, we can compute:\n\n            low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high = min(i, n-k)   [because the week starting at j must be at most i (so that i>=j) and at most n-k (so the week exists)]\n\n            Then count = high - low + 1, if high>=low, else 0.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the week to include i is j<=i and j>= i-k+1 and j in [0, n-k]. So the valid j are from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k).\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, i=0: \n            low = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0\n            high = min(0, 3-2)=min(0,1)=0\n            count=0-0+1=1.\n\n        i=1: \n            low = max(0,1-2+1)=0\n            high = min(1,1)=1\n            count=1-0+1=2.\n\n        i=2:\n            low = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1\n            high = min(2,1)=1\n            count=1.\n\n        Then total_sleep_in_all_weeks = a0*1 + a1*2 + a2*1 = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3+8+7 = 18.\n\n        Then overall average = 18 / (n-k+1) = 18/2 = 9.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"the average sleeping time over all weeks\", and each week's total sleep is the sum of k days.\n\n   So the average is the total_sleep_in_all_weeks divided by the number of weeks.\n\n   However, note: the total_sleep_in_all_weeks is the sum of all the weeks' total sleep, so we are dividing by the number of weeks.\n\n   But note: each week is k days, but we are not averaging by k. We are simply taking the average of the total sleep per week.\n\n   This is consistent.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute:\n\n        Let W = n-k+1\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Count the number of weeks that include day i\n            low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high = min(i, n-k)   # because the week must start at or before i and at least 0 and at most n-k (last week start)\n            count_i = high - low + 1 if high >= low else 0\n            total += a[i] * count_i\n\n        Then, average = total / W\n\n   However, note: the above count_i calculation might be inefficient if n is large (up to 200000) and we do it for each i.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a sliding window to compute the total_sleep_in_all_weeks.\n\n   But note: the total_sleep_in_all_weeks can be computed by:\n\n        total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (a0 * (min(k, n-k+1, i+1)) ) ... no, we have a direct formula.\n\n   Another way: use the fact that the first k-1 days (if we consider 0-indexed) have increasing counts, and the middle part has constant counts, and the last k-1 days have decreasing counts.\n\n   Actually, the counts for day i is:\n\n        count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1)   -> no, let's check:\n\n        For i from 0 to n-1:\n\n        The count for day i is the minimum of:\n            (number of weeks that start from 0 to i) -> i+1\n            (number of weeks that end from i to n-1) -> n-i\n            (number of weeks that have at least k days starting from 0 to i) -> but wait, we are constrained by the window of k days.\n\n        Actually, the count is the minimum of (i+1, n-i, k) ??? \n\n        But wait, the week must be of length k, so the day i can only be included in the weeks that start at j from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). \n\n        We can also note that the count for day i is:\n\n            count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k)   -> no, for the example n=3,k=2,i=0: min(1,3,2)=1 -> ok.\n                     i=1: min(2,2,2)=2 -> ok.\n                     i=2: min(3,1,2)=1 -> ok.\n\n        But wait, the condition for the week is that the week must be of length k, so the day i must be in a window of k days. The maximum number of weeks that can include day i is limited by the window size? \n\n        Actually, no: the count is determined by the available weeks that include the day i, and the window size k is fixed. The count_i is independent of k beyond defining the boundaries? \n\n        But wait, the condition for the week to include day i is that the week must start at j such that j<=i and j>= i-k+1 and j in [0, n-k]. \n\n        The window size k is used to set the lower bound (i-k+1). So the count_i is:\n\n            count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k)   -> doesn't hold.\n\n        Let me test with k=3, n=5, i=1 (0-indexed):\n\n            Conditions: j<=1 and j>=1-3+1 = -1 -> so j from 0 to min(1,5-3)=min(1,2)=1 -> count=2.\n\n            Now, min(1+1, 5-1, 3) = min(2,4,3)=2 -> matches.\n\n        i=2 (middle): \n            Conditions: j<=2 and j>=2-3+1=0, and j<=min(2,2)=2 -> count=3 (j from 0 to 2, three weeks)\n            min(3, 5-2=3, 3)=3 -> matches.\n\n        i=3 (fourth element, index3 in 0-indexed, which is the fourth day in 5-day array):\n            Conditions: j<=3 and j>=3-3+1=1, and j<=min(3,2)=2 -> so j from 1 to 2 -> count=2.\n            min(4,5-3=2,3)=2 -> matches.\n\n        i=4 (last day, index4):\n            Conditions: j<=4 and j>=4-3+1=2, and j<=min(4,2)=2 -> j=2 -> count=1.\n            min(5,1,3)=1 -> matches.\n\n        So the formula: count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k) is not matching the example above.\n\n        Actually, wait: in the above example with k=3, n=5, i=0: \n            Conditions: j<=0 and j>=0-3+1=-2, j from 0 to min(0,2)=0 -> count=1.\n            min(1,5,3)=1 -> ok.\n\n        But wait, the formula I wrote was min(i+1, n-i, k) but for i=0: min(1,5,3)=1 -> ok.\n\n        However, wait: the condition for the week is that the week must be of length k, so the day i must be in a window of k days. The window of k days means that the week must start at j and end at j+k-1. The day i must be between j and j+k-1. The condition j<=i and j>=i-k+1 is correct.\n\n        But note: the count_i is the number of j in [max(0,i-k+1), min(i, n-k)] (inclusive). \n\n        And we can express the count_i as:\n\n            count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1) ? \n\n        Actually, no: the count_i is the number of j in [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)].\n\n        But note: the condition for j is:\n            j must be at least 0 and at most n-k, and j>= i-k+1 and j<=i.\n\n        So the count_i = max(0, min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1)\n\n        And we cannot simplify that easily.\n\n   However, we can use a two-pointer or precomputation to avoid O(n) per day.\n\n   But note: n can be up to 200000, and if we do a loop for each i and compute the interval, that's O(n) and acceptable.\n\n   But let me see: we are doing:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high = min(i, n-k)\n            if high < low:\n                count_i = 0\n            else:\n                count_i = high - low + 1\n\n        Then total += a[i] * count_i\n\n   Then divide by (n-k+1)\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints: n, k up to 200000, so this loop is O(n) which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait, is the condition for high correct?\n\n        Condition: j must be at most i (to include the day i) and at most n-k (the last week starts at n-k). So high = min(i, n-k)\n\n        Condition: j must be at least i-k+1 (so that the week covers day i) and at least 0. So low = max(0, i-k+1)\n\n   Let me test with the third sample: n=8, k=2, i=0 to 7.\n\n        i=0: low = max(0,0-2+1)=0, high=min(0,6)=0 -> count=1.\n        i=1: low = max(0,1-2+1)=0, high=min(1,6)=1 -> count=2.\n        i=2: low = max(0,2-2+1)=1, high=min(2,6)=2 -> count=2.\n        i=3: low = max(0,3-2+1)=2, high=min(3,6)=3 -> count=2.\n        i=4: low = max(0,4-2+1)=3, high=min(4,6)=4 -> count=2.\n        i=5: low = max(0,5-2+1)=4, high=min(5,6)=5 -> count=2.\n        i=6: low = max(0,6-2+1)=5, high=min(6,6)=6 -> count=2.\n        i=7: low = max(0,7-2+1)=6, high=min(7,6)=6 -> count=1.\n\n        Then total_sleep_in_all_weeks = 1*1 + 2*2 + 4*2 + 100000*2 + 123*2 + 456*2 + 789*2 + 1*1\n        = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1 = 1+4+8+200000+246+912+1578+1 = 200000+ (1+4+8+1)+ (246+912+1578) = 200000+14+2736 = 202750.\n\n        Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857... which matches.\n\n   Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the above method works, but we can also use a different approach by computing the total_sleep_in_all_weeks using a sliding window and prefix sums.\n\n   But the above is straightforward.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        W = n - k + 1   # number of weeks\n\n        total_sleep = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high = min(i, n - k)   # because j must be <= i and j <= n-k (since the last week starts at n-k)\n            if high < low:\n                count_i = 0\n            else:\n                count_i = high - low + 1\n            total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n        # Then average = total_sleep / W\n        # But note: W = n-k+1, and if W==0 then we have a problem, but n>=k so W>=1.\n\n        avg = total_sleep / W\n\n        # Format the output to have 10 decimal places, but ensure no scientific notation and trailing zeros.\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\n   However, wait: the above condition for 'high' is using 'n-k'. But note: the week starts go from 0 to n-k (inclusive). So the highest start index is n-k, and the condition j<=i must be satisfied, so the highest j is min(i, n-k). \n\n   But what if n-k is negative? Since k<=n, n-k>=0.\n\n   Let me test with the sample \"1 1\": n=1, k=1, W=1.\n        i=0: low = max(0,0-1+1)=max(0,0)=0, high = min(0,0)=0 -> count=1.\n        total_sleep = a[0]*1 = 10 (from the input) -> 10.\n        avg = 10/1 = 10.0 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, the sample input \"3 2\" gives 9.0, which is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above formula for high uses n-k, which is the maximum start index (since the last week starts at n-k). \n\n   But wait, why is the condition for the week start j to be <= n-k? Because the last week starts at n-k (so that the week goes from n-k to n-k+k-1 = n-1).\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: there is an alternative way to compute the total_sleep_in_all_weeks by using a sliding window to compute the sum of each week and then summing them, but that would be O(n) and we are already doing O(n). \n\n   However, the above method is O(n) and acceptable.\n\n   But wait, we can also use a more efficient method by precomputing prefix sums and then using a two-pointer?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. Each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of `k` days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks. The goal is to compute the average of the total sleep time across all these weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to consider all possible consecutive sequences of `k` days (weeks) in the given list of sleep durations. For each week, we sum the sleep durations of its days. The final result is the average of these sums across all weeks.\n2. **Insight**: Each day in the sequence contributes to multiple weeks. Specifically, a day at position `i` (0-indexed) will be included in all weeks that start from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to `min(i, n - k)`. The number of such weeks determines how many times the day's sleep duration is added into the total sum.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each day, compute the number of weeks it appears in, multiply this count by the day's sleep duration, and accumulate these values. The total sum divided by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`) gives the desired average.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each day once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of days. This is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    W = n - k + 1\n    total_sleep = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        high = min(i, n - k)\n        if high >= low:\n            count_i = high - low + 1\n        else:\n            count_i = 0\n        total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n        \n    avg = total_sleep / W\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (days per week), followed by a list of `n` integers representing sleep durations.\n2. **Initialization**: Calculate the number of weeks `W` as `n - k + 1`.\n3. **Processing Each Day**: For each day at position `i`, determine the range of weeks that include this day. The start of the week must be between `max(0, i - k + 1)` and `min(i, n - k)`. The count of such weeks is `high - low + 1` if `high >= low`, otherwise 0.\n4. **Summing Sleep Durations**: Multiply each day's sleep duration by the number of weeks it appears in and accumulate this value into `total_sleep`.\n5. **Calculating Average**: Divide `total_sleep` by the number of weeks `W` to get the average sleep time per week.\n6. **Output**: Print the average formatted to 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the observation that each day's contribution to the total sum is proportional to the number of weeks it appears in, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
