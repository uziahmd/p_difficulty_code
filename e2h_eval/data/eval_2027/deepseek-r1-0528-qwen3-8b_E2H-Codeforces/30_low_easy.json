Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n We need to assign each digit in the original number (from left to right) to either Homer (H) or Marge (M) for exactly n moves each.\n\n The catch: the total prize is the sum of two numbers S1 and S2 (each built by taking the leftmost digit at each move and appending it). \n But note: the moves are interleaved. However, the problem is asking for a sequence of 2n characters (each either 'H' or 'M') that maximizes the total prize.\n\n How do we interpret the total prize? Since the two players are building two separate numbers, the total prize is S1 + S2.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars\", so the total is S1 + S2.\n\n But here's the key: the assignment of digits to players matters because the digits are taken from the leftmost of A one by one.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the original number A = d0 d1 d2 ... d_{2n-1}\n\n In the game, the moves are interleaved arbitrarily (but exactly n moves for each). The catch: the order of digits is fixed (from left to right).\n\n However, the total prize is the sum of the two numbers. Each digit is assigned to one of the two players and will be placed in the corresponding number at a specific position.\n\n Example: n=2, A=\"1234\"\n\n Possibilities:\n   Option 1: HHMM -> \n        Move1 (H): take '1', S1 becomes 1, then A becomes \"234\"\n        Move2 (H): take '2', S1 becomes 12, then A becomes \"34\"\n        Move3 (M): take '3', S2 becomes 3, then A becomes \"4\"\n        Move4 (M): take '4', S2 becomes 34.\n\n        Total prize = 12 + 34 = 46.\n\n   Option 2: HMHM ->\n        Move1 (H): take '1' -> S1=1, A=\"234\"\n        Move2 (M): take '2' -> S2=2, A=\"34\"\n        Move3 (H): take '3' -> S1=13, A=\"4\"\n        Move4 (M): take '4' -> S2=24.\n\n        Total prize = 13+24 = 37.\n\n   Option 3: HM HM again but starting with M? Actually, we have to assign exactly n moves to each. The example output for the second sample is 'HMHM' and the first sample output is 'HHMM'.\n\n But wait, the example input ['2\\n1234'] outputs 'HHMM'. Why?\n\n Because 46 > 37. So we want to maximize the total.\n\n However, note: the example input ['2\\n9911'] outputs 'HMHM'\n\n Let's check with A='9911':\n\n Option: HHMM:\n   Move1 (H): take '9' -> S1=9, A=\"911\"\n   Move2 (H): take '9' -> S1=99, A=\"11\"\n   Move3 (M): take '1' -> S2=1, A=\"1\"\n   Move4 (M): take '1' -> S2=11.\n\n   Total = 99 + 11 = 110.\n\n Option: HMHM:\n   Move1 (H): take '9' -> S1=9, A=\"911\"\n   Move2 (M): take '9' -> S2=9, A=\"11\"\n   Move3 (H): take '1' -> S1=91, A=\"1\"\n   Move4 (M): take '1' -> S2=91.\n\n   Total = 91 + 91 = 182.\n\n So 182 > 110, so we choose HMHM.\n\n Therefore, the goal is to assign the digits (in order) to two players such that the two resulting numbers (each being the concatenation of the digits assigned to that player in the order they were taken) have the maximum sum.\n\n How to think about the problem?\n\n We have to assign the 2n digits to two numbers, say X (for Homer) and Y (for Marge). The catch: the assignment must be such that we assign the digits in the order of the original string, and we cannot reassign the order (i.e., the i-th digit of the original string must appear in X or Y at a position determined by the turn when it was taken).\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns picking digits from a given number A. The players each make exactly n moves, and the goal is to assign the digits to the players in such a way that the sum of the two numbers they form is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves distributing digits from a 2n-digit number into two separate numbers (S1 for Homer and S2 for Marge) such that each player picks exactly n digits. The key observation is that the sum of the two numbers is maximized when higher digits are assigned to the more significant positions in both numbers. \n\n2. **Insight**: The optimal strategy involves prioritizing higher digits for the most significant positions. Specifically, the first n moves should aim to pick the largest possible digits for both players, but ensuring that the digits are picked in the order they appear in the original number.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Iterating over the first n digits (the first half of the number) and assigning the largest available digit to one of the players, while keeping track of which digits are already taken.\n   - For the remaining digits (the second half), simply assign them alternately to the two players to complete their respective sequences.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each digit exactly once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is up to 18, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    \n    first_half = list(map(int, list(A[:n])))\n    second_half = list(map(int, list(A[n:])))\n    \n    first_half.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    moves = []\n    index = 0\n    \n    for i in range(2 * n):\n        if index < n and i % 2 == 0:\n            if first_half[index] >= second_half[i % n]:\n                moves.append('H')\n                index += 1\n            else:\n                moves.append('M')\n                j = 0\n                while j < n and second_half[j] <= second_half[i % n]:\n                    j += 1\n                second_half.pop(j)\n                second_half.insert(i % n, second_half.pop(j-1))\n        else:\n            moves.append('M')\n            \n    result = ''.join(moves)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the integer n and the string A, which consists of 2n digits.\n2. **Digit Processing**: The first half of the digits (first n digits) are converted into a list of integers and sorted in descending order. This helps in easily accessing the largest available digit.\n3. **Move Assignment**: The algorithm iterates over each position in the sequence of moves:\n   - For the first n moves (even indices), it checks if the largest remaining digit in the first half is greater than or equal to the corresponding digit in the second half. If yes, it assigns 'H' to that move; otherwise, it assigns 'M'.\n   - For the remaining moves (odd indices), it simply assigns 'M' to ensure both players have exactly n moves.\n4. **Output**: The sequence of moves is printed as a string of 'H's and 'M's.\n\nThis approach ensures that the highest digits are strategically placed in the most significant positions of both players' numbers, maximizing their combined value.",
