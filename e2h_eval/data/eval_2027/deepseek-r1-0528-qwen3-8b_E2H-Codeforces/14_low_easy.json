He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n        f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n But note: We are given m (the exact number of trailing zeros) and we want to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the value of n for a fixed m, but the set of n for which the factorial has exactly m zeros.\n\n Observation:\n   The function f(n) is non-decreasing. Also, note that sometimes we skip some values of m because between two consecutive multiples of 5, the zeros remain constant until a multiple of 5 is reached.\n\n Example: \n   For m=1, the numbers n that satisfy are 5,6,7,8,9. Why?\n     f(4)=0, f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2.\n\n So the idea is to find the smallest n0 such that f(n0) >= m, then we know that for n from n0 to n1-1, f(n)=m, where n1 is the smallest n such that f(n1) >= m+1.\n\n However, note: It might be that there is no n with exactly m zeros? Actually, the problem says \"the number of positive integers n\", and then if there are none, we output 0.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the lower bound: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Let this be L.\n 2. Find the upper bound: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Let this be R.\n\n Then, the n's that have exactly m zeros are the integers from L to R-1.\n\n But wait: what if there is no n with f(n) >= m? Actually, m is at least 1 and up to 100000. We need to consider that for very large m, we might not have an n? Actually, the factorial grows without bound, so for any m, there will be an n such that f(n) >= m.\n\n However, note that sometimes the zeros jump by more than one. For example, when n=25, f(24)=4, f(25)=6. So for m=5, we don't have any n with f(n)=5.\n\n Therefore, we must check: the set of n we get from [L, R-1] is non-empty only if f(L) = m and f(R-1)=m. But actually, we defined L as the smallest n with f(n)>=m, and R as the smallest n with f(n)>=m+1. Then the numbers from L to R-1 will have f(n)=m, unless there is a gap? Actually, the function f(n) is non-decreasing and increases by steps. The condition is that if there exists an n with f(n)=m, then the entire interval [L, R-1] has f(n)=m.\n\n But note: the definition of L and R ensures that for n in [L, R-1]: f(n) is at least m (because L is the first with >=m) and less than m+1 (because R is the first with >=m+1). Therefore, they must equal m.\n\n However, what if m is very large such that even the maximum n we can consider (like up to 10^6 or more) doesn't reach m? Then we must output 0.\n\n Alternatively, we can use binary search to find L and R.\n\n But note: m can be up to 100000. We need to find an n such that f(n) >= m. What is the maximum n we might need?\n\n   f(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... \n\n   We note that n must be at least around 5*m (but actually more because of the higher powers). We can set an upper bound for n.\n\n   Consider: the maximum power we need to consider is until 5^k <= n. The series is bounded by n/4 (geometric series). So n is roughly at most 5*m (but actually, since we have to account for higher powers, we can set an upper bound: n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently determining the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is given by the function \\( f(n) = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\rfloor + \\ldots \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( L \\)) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\), and the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( R \\)) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m + 1 \\), we use binary search. The binary search helps in quickly narrowing down the range where \\( f(n) \\) crosses the thresholds \\( m \\) and \\( m + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: Once \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) are found, all integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\) will have \\( f(n) = m \\). If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., if \\( L \\) does not exist or the range is empty), we output 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m = int(data[0])\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m + 1\n    \n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n            \n    L = low\n    \n    if count_trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    low2 = L + 1\n    high2 = 5 * (m + 1) + 1\n    \n    while low2 < high2:\n        mid2 = (low2 + high2) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid2) < m + 1:\n            low2 = mid2 + 1\n        else:\n            high2 = mid2\n            \n    R = low2\n    \n    result_list = list(range(L, R))\n    \n    print(str(len(result_list)))\n    if result_list:\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, result_list)))\n    else:\n        print()\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer \\( m \\), which represents the required number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound (\\( L \\))**: The binary search starts with an initial range and adjusts until it finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\). The function `count_trailing_zeros` calculates the number of trailing zeroes by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound (\\( R \\))**: Similarly, another binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m + 1 \\). This helps in determining the upper limit of the range where \\( f(n) = m \\).\n\n4. **Output the Result**: The valid range of \\( n \\) values is from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\). If no such \\( n \\) exists (checked by verifying \\( f(L) = m \\)), the output is 0. Otherwise, the numbers from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\) are printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of valid \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the function \\( f(n) \\) to ensure correctness.",
