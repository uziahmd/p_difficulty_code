Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all the letters must be the same (the same letter for the entire diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, and that letter must be different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the diagonals might have two different letters? Actually, the problem says:\n   - The diagonals must be the same letter? Or each diagonal is the same but both diagonals can have different letters as long as the non-diagonal part is the same and different?\n\n But note the example: \n   Input: 3\n           wsw\n           sws\n           wsw -> Output: YES\n\n In this example, the main diagonal is 'w','s','w' -> but wait, not all same? Actually, let me check:\n\n The example input is:\n   ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n The second example: \n      3\n      wsw\n      sws\n      wsw\n\n Let's break down the diagonals:\n\n Main diagonal: \n    (0,0) -> 'w'\n    (1,1) -> 's'\n    (2,2) -> 'w'\n\n This is not the same letter! So what's going on?\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n However, in the example, the main diagonal has 'w','s','w' — not the same. \n\n Let me re-read the problem statement: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n And then: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n But note: the example output is \"YES\" for the second example.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the problem means that the two diagonals must have the same letter? \n\n Let me check the example: \n   The two diagonals are:\n     Main diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) -> 'w','s','w'\n     Anti-diagonal: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) -> 'w','s','w'\n\n Now, the condition says: \n   - On both diagonals, all letters are the same.\n\n But in the example, the main diagonal has two 'w' and one 's'. So that doesn't satisfy.\n\n However, looking at the example input and output provided in the problem:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: 5xooox, oxoxo, soxoo, oxoxo, xooox -> Output: NO\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: 3 with the pattern above -> Output: YES\n\n Example 3: \n   Input: 3 with the last row being 'xpe' -> Output: NO\n\n After reading the problem again, I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n This means that for the main diagonal, every letter must be the same. Similarly, for the anti-diagonal, every letter must be the same.\n\n But in the example, the main diagonal has 'w','s','w' — not all same. So why is the answer YES?\n\n Wait, the example is:\n\n   w s w\n   s w s\n   w s w\n\n Actually, the main diagonal is 'w','w','w'? No, wait:\n\n   Row0: index0: 'w'\n   Row1: index1: 'w'? But wait, the second row is \"sws\": so index1 is 'w'? Actually, no: \n        row0: [0][0] = 'w', [0][1]='s', [0][2]='w'\n        row1: [1][0]='s', [1][1]='w', [1][2]='s'\n        row2: [2][0]='w', [2][1]='s', [2][2]='w'\n\n So the main diagonal is [0][0], [1][1], [2][2] -> 'w','w','w' -> that's correct.\n\n And the anti-diagonal is [0][2], [1][1], [2][0] -> 'w','w','w' -> same.\n\n Then the other squares (non-diagonal) are:\n   [0][1] -> 's'\n   [1][0] -> 's'\n   [1][2] -> 's'\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms an \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Main Diagonal**: Letters from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal**: Letters from the top-right to the bottom-left.\n   - For each diagonal, verify that all letters are identical.\n   \n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Letters**:\n   - Collect all letters not on either diagonal.\n   - Ensure all these letters are identical and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the grid size is 1x1, it trivially satisfies the conditions but must be handled separately.\n   - Ensure that the diagonal letters are the same as each other and different from the non-diagonal letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        return\n        \n    diag1_set = set()\n    diag2_set = set()\n    non_diag_letters = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                diag1_set.add(grid[i][j])\n            if i + j == n - 1:\n                diag2_set.add(grid[i][j])\n            else:\n                non_diag_letters.append(grid[i][j])\n                \n    if len(diag1_set) != 1 or len(diag2_set) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    diag_letter = next(iter(diag1_set))\n    if any(letter == diag_letter for letter in non_diag_letters):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the grid size `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If the grid is 1x1, it immediately prints \"YES\" since a single cell trivially satisfies the conditions.\n3. **Diagonal Check**: For each cell in the grid, it checks if the cell lies on the main diagonal (i == j) or the anti-diagonal (i + j == n - 1). It collects all unique letters on these diagonals into sets.\n4. **Validation**: \n   - If either diagonal has more than one unique letter, it prints \"NO\".\n   - It then checks if any non-diagonal letter matches the diagonal letter. If so, it prints \"NO\".\n5. **Output Result**: If all checks pass, it prints \"YES\", indicating the grid forms an \"X\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming an \"X\" by leveraging set operations to check for uniformity on diagonals and consistency among non-diagonal letters.",
