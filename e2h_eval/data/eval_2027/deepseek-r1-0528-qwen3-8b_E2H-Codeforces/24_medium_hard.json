She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We have to compute the minimum seconds required to leave only tabs from l to r.\n\n The operations allowed are:\n  - Move cursor left: from i to max(a, i-1) [where a is the current leftmost tab index]\n  - Move cursor right: from i to min(b, i+1) [where b is the current rightmost tab index]\n  - Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (if any): then the left boundary becomes the cursor's current tab (and the set of tabs is reduced)\n  - Close all tabs to the right of the cursor (if any): then the right boundary becomes the cursor's current tab.\n\n However, note that the problem is simplified by the fact that we are only concerned with the segment [l, r] and the initial condition is that all tabs from 1 to n are open.\n\n The goal is to close all tabs not in [l, r]. We can do two types of closing: left closing and right closing.\n\n There are several cases:\n\n Case 1: If the entire set of tabs is already the desired segment [l, r], then answer 0.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we must consider that we might need to close some left part and some right part.\n\n However, note: we can also move the cursor arbitrarily (within the current boundaries) and then close. But note the boundaries change after closing.\n\n Important: After closing, the cursor remains at the same position, but the boundaries a and b change.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n We have two main operations: closing left and closing right. We can do these in any order, but note that the cursor must be moved appropriately.\n\n Steps:\n\n Option 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n   - We must move the cursor to the left boundary (or beyond) to close the left part? Actually, to close the left part, we need to be at a position such that the left part includes everything from the original left (which is 1) to our current position-1. But wait, the problem says: \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\" meaning the current left boundary (which initially is 1) and the cursor is at i, so we close [a, i-1] (but note: the problem defines a as the minimum index of unclosed tabs). So initially, a=1, b=n.\n\n However, note: the problem states that after closing, the boundaries become the remaining tabs. So if we close left, then the new left boundary becomes the current cursor's tab (because all tabs to the left of the cursor are closed). Similarly for closing right.\n\n But note: we can also close multiple times. However, the problem allows us to close only the left or the right at a time.\n\n How do we think?\n\n We are only concerned with leaving [l, r]. So we must close [1, l-1] and [r+1, n].\n\n There are two ways: \n   - First close the left part, then the right part.\n   - First close the right part, then the left part.\n   - Or, we might even do multiple moves without closing until we are at a position where we can close a big chunk.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we close only the left part and then the right part. We can close arbitrary parts. But note: the operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" will close everything from the current left boundary (which initially is 1) to the cursor's position minus one. Similarly for right.\n\n But observe: we want to leave [l, r]. Therefore, we must close [1, l-1] and [r+1, n]. \n\n We can do:\n\n Option 1: Close the left part [1, l-1] and then the right part [r+1, n].\n   - To close the left part, we must have the cursor at a position >= l (so that when we close left, we close everything from 1 to cursor-1, which must include [1, l-1] and possibly more if we are beyond l). But wait, we don't necessarily have to go to l to close the left part? Actually, we can close the left part from a cursor position that is at least l (so that the left part [1, l-1] is included). However, if we are at a position > l, then we would also close [l, cursor-1] which we don't want to close because we need to keep [l, r]. Therefore, we must close the left part from a position exactly at l (so that the left part is [1, l-1]).\n\n Similarly, for the right part: we must close from a position exactly at r.\n\n But note: we can also close in parts? Actually, we can do multiple closing operations. However, the problem does not specify that we have to close entire contiguous segments. But note: the operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" closes every tab that is to the left of the cursor and still open. So if we have already closed some left part, then the left boundary changes. Similarly for the right.\n\n However, we are allowed to close in any order and we can also move arbitrarily (even within the remaining tabs).\n\n Alternate approach: since n is at most 100, we can consider simulating the entire process, but we need an efficient way.\n\n Let's define:\n   - Initially, the set of open tabs is [1, n], and the cursor is at `pos`.\n   - We want to end up with [l, r].\n\n We can consider breaking the problem into two parts: closing the left part and the right part.\n\n However, note: we might be able to close the left part from a position that is inside [l, r] and similarly for the right.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the current set of tabs is already [l, r] (i.e., if l == 1 and r == n, then no operation is needed? Actually, if l==1 and r==n, then we don't need to close anything. But note: the problem says \"leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r\", so if the entire set is [1, n] and we want [1, n] then we are done.\n\n But wait: the input condition is that we start with n tabs from 1 to n.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab\" and we have n tabs.\n\n However, the example: Input \"6 3 1 3\" -> output 1.\n\n In the example: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\n We must close [4,6] (to the right). How?\n   - We can close the right part from the cursor at 3: then we close [4,6] (since the cursor is at 3, and the right part is from 4 to 6). This takes 1 second.\n\n But what if we are at 3 and we want to close the left part? The left part is [1,2] (because we want to keep [1,3]). However, if we close the left part from 3, then we close [1,2] (because the left boundary is 1, so [1, 3-1] = [1,2]). Then we can close the right part from 3: [4,6]. But note: after closing the left part, the left boundary becomes 3, so the tabs are now [3,6] (with boundaries 3 and 6). Then we can close the right part from 3: that would close [4,6] (because the current boundaries are [3,6] and the cursor is at 3, so we close [4,6]). So two operations: 2 seconds.\n\n But wait, the example output is 1. So why is that? Because we don't need to close the left part? Actually, the left part [1,2] is within [1,3] so we don't need to close it. We only need to close [4,6]. Therefore, we can simply close the right part from the current position (if we are at 3) and that's it.\n\n So the key is: we only need to close the parts that are outside [l, r]. That is, we must close [1, l-1] and [r+1, n].\n\n Therefore, the minimal operations might be:\n\n   - If there is no left part to close (i.e., l == 1) and no right part to close (i.e., r == n), then 0.\n\n   - Otherwise, we can consider:\n\n        Option A: Close the left part and then the right part.\n        Option B: Close the right part and then the left part.\n\n        And also, we might do:\n\n        Option C: Maybe we can close the left part from a position that is already in [l, r] and then the right part from a different position? But note: we are allowed to move arbitrarily.\n\n However, note that after closing the left part, the left boundary becomes the cursor's position (which must be at least l). Similarly for the right.\n\n But we are constrained by the fact that we must close exactly the parts [1, l-1] and [r+1, n]. \n\n Let's define:\n   left_close = (l > 1)   [meaning we need to close the left part]\n   right_close = (r < n)   [meaning we need to close the right part]\n\n Now, if both are true, we have two possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n\n   Step 1: Move the cursor to the left boundary (which is l) and then close the left part? But wait, we don't necessarily have to go to l. Actually, to close the left part [1, l-1] we must be at a position >= l (so that the cursor doesn't cover [l, ...] for the left closing). But note: if we are at a position greater than l, then closing left will also remove [l, cursor-1] which we cannot do because we must keep [l, r]. Therefore, to close the left part without affecting [l, r], we must be at a position that is exactly l (then closing left removes [1, l-1]). Similarly, to close the right part without affecting [l, r], we must be at a position exactly r.\n\n So the steps for Option A (left first):\n\n   Step 1: Move the cursor from `pos` to `l`. The number of moves to the left: if pos >= l, then we move left (pos - l) times. But wait, we are moving one tab per second. However, note: we can also use the closing operations to adjust the boundaries. But here, we are only considering moving.\n\n   However, we have two types of moves: left and right. But note: the boundaries change when we close, so we must be cautious.\n\n But wait: in Option A (closing the left part first) we assume that we haven't closed anything yet. So the boundaries are [1, n] until we close.\n\n   Step 1: Move to l. The cost for moving from `pos` to `l` is abs(pos - l). Then we do one operation: close left. Then the boundaries become [l, n] (the left boundary is now l).\n\n   Step 2: Now we need to close the right part. We must move from `l` to `r` (if r < n, otherwise we don't need to move). Then we close the right part. The cost for moving from `l` to `r` is abs(l - r). Then one operation for closing right.\n\n   Total cost: abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2.\n\n Possibility 2: Close the right part first, then the left part.\n\n   Step 1: Move from `pos` to `r`: cost abs(pos - r).\n   Step 2: Close the right part: 1 second.\n   Step 3: Move from `r` to `l`: cost abs(r - l).\n   Step 4: Close the left part: 1 second.\n\n   Total cost: abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2.\n\n However, wait: is that always the case? What if we can combine the movements? For example, if we are already in the middle of [l, r], maybe we don't need to move all the way to one end and then the other.\n\n But note: we must be at the boundary (at l for closing left, at r for closing right) to avoid closing the desired part.\n\n However, there is a third possibility: we might not have to move all the way to one end and then the other. For example, if we are at a position between l and r, we can choose to close one side and then the other without having to traverse the entire segment.\n\n But wait, to close the left part we must be at l (exactly) and to close the right part we must be at r (exactly). So we have to get to l and then to r, or to r and then to l.\n\n But note: we can also consider that after closing one side, the boundaries change. However, the above calculations assume that the boundaries are fixed until we close. But that is correct: until we close the left part, the left boundary is 1, so we must be at l (to not close any part of [l, r]).\n\n However, there is a catch: what if we can use the fact that after closing one side, we don't have to traverse the entire segment again? Actually, the above calculation for Option A and B already account for the movement from the initial position to the first boundary (l or r) and then to the second boundary (r or l). \n\n But wait, in Option A: we move from `pos` to `l` (which is the left boundary) and then to `r` (which is the right boundary). Similarly for Option B: from `pos` to `r` and then to `l`.\n\n However, note: the movement from `l` to `r` (in Option A) is necessary because after closing the left part, the right boundary is still n, so we have to move from l to r to then close the right part (which requires being at r). Similarly, in Option B: from `r` to `l` is necessary because after closing the right part, the left boundary is still 1, so we have to get to l to close the left part.\n\n But wait: after closing the left part, the left boundary becomes l, but the right boundary is still n. So to close the right part, we must be at r (the original r) or at the current right boundary? Actually, the operation to close the right part uses the current boundaries: the current boundaries are [l, n]. Then, to close the right part, we must be at a position such that the right part we wish to close (from r+1 to n) is the entire right part. However, if we are at a position greater than r, then we would close [current_cursor+1, n] which might include more than just [r+1, n] (if current_cursor > r). But note: we must leave [l, r]. So we cannot close any part of [l, r]. Therefore, we must be at r (so that the right part to close is [r+1, n]). Similarly, for the left part: we must be at l.\n\n Therefore, the two options are:\n\n   Option A: total_seconds = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n   Option B: total_seconds = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n\n Then the answer is the minimum of these two, but wait: what if we don't need to close both sides?\n\n   If l == 1 and r == n: then 0.\n   Else if l == 1: then we only need to close the right part.\n        Then we can do: move from `pos` to `r` (if `pos` is not already at r) and then close the right part. But wait: we can also close the right part from a position that is not necessarily at r? Actually, to close the right part without affecting [l, r] (which is [1, r]), we must be at r (so that we close [r+1, n]). So the steps are: move from `pos` to `r` (cost abs(pos - r)), then close (cost 1). Total: abs(pos - r) + 1.\n\n   Similarly, if r == n: then we only need to close the left part. Then steps: move from `pos` to `l` (abs(pos - l)) and then close (1). Total: abs(pos - l) + 1.\n\n But wait: in the example \"6 3 1 3\": \n      n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3 -> only the right part needs closing (since l==1, so we don't close left). Then we should do: \n          Option: move from 3 to 3 (0 moves) and then close the right part (1 second). Total 1.\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n However, what if we are not forced to go to the boundary? Actually, we are: because the operation \"close the right part\" requires that we are at a position from which we can close [r+1, n] without affecting [l, r]. Since the left boundary is 1, we can only close the right part if we are at r (so that the right part is [r+1, n]). Similarly for the left.\n\n But note: what if we are at a position to the left of r? Then we can close the right part without moving? Actually, no: because if we are at a position i (<= r) and we close the right part, then we close [i+1, n]. But we must leave [1, r] (if we are closing the right part and we are at i, then we close [i+1, n]). However, we must not close [1, i] (which is part of [1, r]). But wait, we are only closing the right part. The operation for closing the right part uses the current boundaries. Initially, the boundaries are [1, n]. So if we are at i (<= r), then closing the right part will close [i+1, n]. But note: we wish to leave [1, r]. So if i+1 <= r, then we would close some part of [1, r] (from i+1 to r) which is not allowed.\n\n Therefore, we must be at r (so that i = r, then we close [r+1, n] and leave [1, r] intact).\n\n Similarly, for the left part: we must be at l to close [1, l-1] without affecting [l, r].\n\n Therefore, the procedure is:\n\n   If l == 1 and r == n: 0.\n   Else if l == 1: then we only need to close the right part. Steps: move to r (if necessary) and then close. Cost = abs(pos - r) + 1.\n   Else if r == n: then we only need to close the left part. Steps: move to l (if necessary) and then close. Cost = abs(pos - l) + 1.\n   Else (both sides need closing): then we have two options:\n\n        Option 1: Go to l first, then to r: cost = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n        Option 2: Go to r first, then to l: cost = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n\n        But note: we can also consider that we might not need to go back to the opposite boundary after closing one side? Actually, no: because after closing one side, the boundaries change and we still need to be at the opposite boundary to close the other side.\n\n        However, wait: is there a possibility that we can close one side and then from the same position (if we are at the boundary) we can close the other side? \n\n        Example: if we are at l, then we close the left part. Now the boundaries are [l, n]. Then we are at l, and we wish to close the right part. To close the right part we must be at r. So we have to move from l to r (unless l == r, but if l==r then the segment is a single tab and we have to close both sides? Actually, if l==r, then we must close both sides only if l != 1 and r != n. But then the segment [l, r] is [x,x] and we must close [1, x-1] and [x+1, n]. Then we must be at x (which is both l and r) to close both? Actually, we can close the left part from x: then the left part [1, x-1] is closed, and then the right part from x: [x+1, n] is closed. But note: we are already at x. So:\n\n          Option: close left (1 second) and then close right (1 second) without moving. Total 2.\n\n        But according to our Option A and Option B:\n\n          Option A: abs(x - x) + 1 + abs(x - x) + 1 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.\n          Option B: same.\n\n        So that works.\n\n        However, note: the above Option A and Option B are independent of the order, and we take the minimum. But they are the same.\n\n        But wait, what if we are at a position that is between l and r? Then we have two choices: go to l first then r, or go to r first then l. But note: the movement from l to r is the same as from r to l (abs(l - r) is the same in both). So the two options are:\n\n            Option A: abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n            Option B: abs(pos - r) + abs(l - r) + 2\n\n        Then we take the minimum of these two.\n\n        However, wait: is it possible that we can do both operations without going all the way to the opposite boundary? \n\n        Let me think: Consider we are at a position p (between l and r). We wish to close both sides. We must be at l to close the left and at r to close the right.\n\n        One idea: maybe we can close one side from a position that is not the boundary? No, because if we close the left part from a position p (>= l) then we can only close [1, p-1]. But we need to close [1, l-1]. So if p > l, then we are closing [1, p-1] which includes [1, l-1] and [l, p-1] (which we don't want to close). Therefore, we must be at l to avoid closing any part of [l, r] when closing the left.\n\n        Similarly, for the right: we must be at r.\n\n        Therefore, the above holds.\n\n        But wait: what if we are already at one of the boundaries? For example, if we are at l and we need to close both sides.\n\n        Then Option A: \n            Move from l to l: 0, then close left (1), then move from l to r (abs(l - r)), then close right (1). Total: 0 + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1.\n\n        Alternatively, we could consider: \n            First, we can close the right part from l? But wait, we are at l, and to close the right part we need to be at r. So we must move to r first. Then we close the right part, then move back to l to close the left part.\n\n        However, note: if we are at l and we wish to close the right part, we must move to r (because we are at l, which is less than r). Then after closing the right part, the boundaries become [l, r]. Then we are at r, and we can close the left part from r? But wait, to close the left part from r, we would close [current_left, r-1]. The current_left is l (because we haven't closed the left part) so we would close [l, r-1]. But [l, r-1] is part of [l, r] (which we wish to keep) except that we are about to close the left part? Actually, the operation \"close the left part\" from r would close [current_left, r-1] = [l, r-1]. But we want to keep [l, r]. So we cannot close [l, r-1] because that leaves only [r] (if we then close the left part, and we have to close the left part again? Actually, no: we wish to leave [l, r]. We have already closed the right part (leaving [l, r]), and then we close the left part from r: that closes [l, r-1] and leaves only [r]. Then we have to close the left part again from r? Actually, no: we can't because then we would close [l, r-1] again (but they are already closed) and we are left with nothing.\n\n        So the correct way is: we must close the left part from the left boundary (l) and the right part from the right boundary (r). \n\n        Therefore, the two-step process is necessary.\n\n        However, note: we might be able to minimize the movement by choosing the closer boundary first. For example, if we are closer to l than to r, then going to l first and then to r might be cheaper than going to r first and then to l.\n\n        So the minimal cost when both sides need closing is:\n\n            min( abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2, \n                 abs(pos - r) + abs(l - r) + 2 )\n\n        But wait, we can also consider: what if we can close one side without moving to the boundary by using the other side's closure? \n\n        Actually, let's consider an alternative: we can use the fact that after closing one side, the boundaries change and we might not have to traverse the entire segment again. However, the requirement for the next closure is still to be at the opposite boundary.\n\n        Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8.\n\n        We must close [1,2] and [9,10].\n\n        Option A: \n            Move from 5 to 3: 2 moves, then close left (1) -> now boundaries [3,10]\n            Then move from 3 to 8: 5 moves, then close right (1) -> total 2+1+5+1 = 9.\n\n        Option B:\n            Move from 5 to 8: 3 moves, then close right (1) -> boundaries [1,8] (but wait, we haven't closed the left part, so the left boundary is still 1? Actually, the operation \"close the right part\" from 8: closes [9,10] (because the current boundaries are [1,10] and the cursor is at 8, so the right part is [9,10]). Then the boundaries become [1,8]. Now we must close the left part [1,2]. But we are at 8. Then we have to move from 8 to 3 (5 moves) and then close left (1). Total: 3+1+5+1 = 10.\n\n        But wait, in Option B: after closing the right part, the boundaries are [1,8]. Then to close the left part, we must be at 3 (the left boundary of the desired segment). So we must move from 8 to 3 (5 moves). \n\n        However, note: we can also consider that after closing the right part, the left boundary is still 1. So to close the left part, we must be at 3 (the left boundary of the desired segment, which is also the left boundary of the current open tabs? Actually, the current open tabs are [1,8]. The desired segment is [3,8]. So we must close [1,2]. But to close [1,2] we must be at 3 (so that we close [1,2] and leave [3,8]). So yes, we must move to 3.\n\n        But wait, there is another possibility: we can close the left part from a position that is greater than 3? No, because then we would close more than [1,2]. \n\n        However, note: we can also consider closing the left part without moving to 3? \n\n        Actually, the operation \"close the left part\" from a position i closes [current_left, i-1]. The current_left is 1 (until we close the left part). So if we are at a position i (>=3) and we close the left part, we close [1, i-1]. But we wish to leave [3,8]. So if i-1 >= 3, then we close [3, i-1] as well. That is not acceptable. Therefore, we must be at 3 to close only [1,2].\n\n        So the above holds.\n\n        But wait, is there a smarter way? \n\n        Consider: we can close the left part from a position that is not 3, but we don't have to? Actually, no.\n\n        However, note: we can close the left part from a position that is less than 3? But wait, the current open tabs are [1,8] (after closing the right part). The cursor is at 8 (we just closed the right part). We wish to close [1,2]. We can move left from 8 to 3 (which is 5 moves) and then close. \n\n        Alternatively, we can move left from 8 to 2 and then close? Then we would close [1,1] (if we are at 2) because the left part is [1,2-1]=[1,1]. But wait, we wish to close [1,2]. Then we must close two separate operations? Actually, no: we can close the entire left part in one operation if we are at 3. But if we are at 2, then we close [1,1] (leaving [2,8]) which is not acceptable because we need [3,8]. Then we have to close [2] separately? But the operation \"close the left part\" from 2 would close [1,1] (if we haven't closed 2). Then we are left with [2,8]. Then we must close [2] by another operation? But note: the operation \"close the left part\" from 3 (if we move to 3) would close [1,2] (which is acceptable). \n\n        Therefore, we must be at 3 to close [1,2] in one operation.\n\n        So the above calculation is correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if we do not close the entire left part at once? The problem allows multiple operations. But note: we are allowed to close the left part arbitrarily many times. However, the problem asks for the minimum seconds.\n\n        But observe: we can only close the left part from a given position, and the closure operation removes all the tabs to the left of the cursor (that are still open). Therefore, we cannot partially close the left part. We must close all the left part in one go from the correct boundary.\n\n        Therefore, we must be at the boundary of the desired segment.\n\n        Now, let's check the example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8.\n\n        Our formula for both sides: min( abs(5-3)+abs(3-8)+2, abs(5-8)+abs(3-8)+2 ) = min(2+5+2, 3+5+2) = min(9,10) = 9.\n\n        But wait, is there a better way? \n\n        Consider: we can move to 3 (2 moves), then close left (1 second) -> now the set is [3,10]. Then we are at 3. Now, we wish to close the right part. The right part we wish to leave [3,8] so we must close [9,10]. We must be at 8 to do that. So we move from 3 to 8 (5 moves) and then close (1). Total 2+1+5+1=9.\n\n        Alternatively, we can move to 8 (3 moves), then close right (1) -> now the set is [1,8]. Then we move from 8 to 3 (5 moves) and close left (1). Total 3+1+5+1=10.\n\n        So 9 is the minimum.\n\n        But note: what if we do not go directly to 3 and then to 8? \n\n        Consider: we are at 5. We can move left to 3 (2 moves), then instead of closing the left part, we move right to 8 (from 3 to 8: 5 moves) and then close the right part (1) and then close the left part (from 8: we must move to 3 again? 5 moves) and then close (1). This gives 2+5+1+5+1 = 14, which is worse.\n\n        Another idea: we can close the left part from a position that is not 3? But wait, we must be at 3 to avoid closing [3,8] when closing the left part.\n\n        Therefore, the above two-step process is necessary.\n\n        However, note: we can also consider that we might not need to close one side entirely if we are already at the boundary? But the boundaries are defined by the current open tabs.\n\n        Let me restate the solution:\n\n        Let left_needed = (l > 1)\n        Let right_needed = (r < n)\n\n        If not left_needed and not right_needed:\n            print(0)\n        elif left_needed and not right_needed:\n            # Only close left part\n            print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n        elif right_needed and not left_needed:\n            # Only close right part\n            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n        else:\n            # Both sides need closing\n            option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n            option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(l - r) + 2\n            print(min(option1, option2))\n\n        But wait: is the movement from l to r (or r to l) necessary? \n\n        In the two-step process for both sides, we must move from the first boundary to the second boundary. However, note: the distance from l to r is |l - r|, but we are moving from l to r (which is the same as |l - r|). But wait: what if we are at l and we wish to go to r, we move |l - r|. Similarly for r to l.\n\n        However, note: we might be able to do the two closures without traversing the entire segment twice? \n\n        Actually, the above calculation for both sides is:\n\n          Option A: \n            Move from pos to l: |pos-l|\n            Then close left: 1\n            Then move from l to r: |l-r|\n            Then close right: 1\n\n          Option B:\n            Move from pos to r: |pos-r|\n            Then close right: 1\n            Then move from r to l: |r-l|  (same as |l-r|)\n            Then close left: 1\n\n        Therefore, the total is |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2 and |pos-r| + |l-r| + 2.\n\n        But wait: is it possible that we can close one side and then the other without having to traverse from one boundary to the other? \n\n        Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8.\n\n        We did 9 seconds.\n\n        Is there a way to do it in less? \n\n        Alternative approach:\n\n        We can consider: what if we first move to the middle of the segment? But that doesn't help because we must be at the boundaries.\n\n        Another idea: we can use the same closure operation to cover two purposes? Probably not.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to move arbitrarily and we can also use the fact that the boundaries change. \n\n        Let me try:\n\n          Start at 5.\n\n          We wish to close [1,2] and [9,10].\n\n          What if we move to 3 (2 moves) and then close the left part (1) -> now the set is [3,10]. Then we are at 3.\n\n          Now, we wish to close [9,10]. We must be at 8 to do that. So we move from 3 to 8 (5 moves) and then close (1). Total 2+1+5+1=9.\n\n          Alternatively, what if we move to 8 first (3 moves) and then close the right part (1) -> set [1,8]. Then we must close [1,2] and we are at 8. We move from 8 to 3 (5 moves) and then close (1). Total 3+1+5+1=10.\n\n        So 9 is the best.\n\n        But wait: what if we do:\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive in her browser, starting from a given position `pos` with `n` tabs initially open. The operations allowed include moving the cursor left or right and closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`. This involves two main operations: closing tabs to the left of `l` and closing tabs to the right of `r`. The challenge is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closures to minimize the total time.\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - If the entire range of tabs is already the desired segment (`l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed.\n   - If only one side needs closing (either left or right), the solution is straightforward: move the cursor to the boundary (`l` for left closure, `r` for right closure) and perform the closure.\n   - If both sides need closing, the optimal strategy is to choose the shorter path between moving to `l` first or `r` first, then proceed to the other boundary for the second closure.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking the conditions for the segments and calculating the minimal steps required based on the cursor's initial position and the boundaries of the desired segment.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in constant time O(1) since it involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient even for the upper constraint of `n = 100`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n    elif l == 1:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    elif r == n:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    else:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(l - r) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the desired segment spans all tabs (`l == 1` and `r == n`), the answer is `0` since no operations are needed.\n2. **Single Side Closure**: \n   - If only the left side needs closing (`l == 1`), the cursor moves from `pos` to `r` (the right boundary) and closes the right tabs. The total time is the distance from `pos` to `r` plus one second for the closure.\n   - Similarly, if only the right side needs closing (`r == n`), the cursor moves from `pos` to `l` (the left boundary) and closes the left tabs. The total time is the distance from `pos` to `l` plus one second.\n3. **Both Sides Closure**: For cases where both sides need closing, the solution calculates the time for two scenarios:\n   - Moving from `pos` to `l`, then to `r`, performing two closures.\n   - Moving from `pos` to `r`, then to `l`, performing two closures.\n   The minimal time between these two scenarios is chosen as the answer. Each closure operation takes one second, and the movement time is the absolute difference between positions. \n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the minimal time is computed by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks.",
