Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, and then a list of n integers (the found cards) in the second line.\n\n The problem: We have infinitely many cards with every integer from -x to x. We found n cards (with numbers that are in the range [-x, x]). We want to choose the minimum number of additional cards (from the infinite set) such that the total sum of all the cards (found plus chosen) is zero.\n\n Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n\n Then we need to achieve a total sum of 0, so the sum of the additional cards must be -S.\n\n Now, we can choose any cards (each card's absolute value at most x) arbitrarily (any number of times). We wish to minimize the number of cards.\n\n This becomes a classic coin change problem but with:\n   - We can use any integer from -x to x (except zero? Actually including zero, but note: if we use a zero card, it doesn't change the sum. However, we are minimizing the number of cards, so we might not use zeros because they don't help. But wait, the problem says \"minimum number\", so we can ignore zeros because they don't help and we can always choose non-zero to adjust the sum.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to choose any card from -x to x (so including zero). But since we are minimizing the number of cards, we would only use non-zero cards. Why? Because if we use a zero card, we are increasing the count without changing the sum.\n\n So we can consider using any integer in the set { -x, -(x-1), ..., -1, 1, ..., x-1, x }.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use any integer in that range arbitrarily many times.\n\n We wish to represent the target sum = -S as a linear combination (with positive integer coefficients, and each term being an integer in [-x, x] excluding zero? Actually, we can also use zeros, but zeros don't help, so we can ignore them.\n\n However, note: we might need to use multiple cards. The problem is: what is the minimum number of cards (from the set of integers in [-x, x]) to get a sum of -S?\n\n But note: we are allowed to use zeros? Actually, the set includes zeros, but zeros don't help. So we can focus on the non-zero set.\n\n But wait, what if we cannot represent -S by non-zero cards? Actually, we can because the set is symmetric and we have all integers from -x to x. However, the issue is that we are limited by the absolute value, so we cannot use a card larger than x.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require distinct cards, so we can use multiple copies.\n\n But the problem is similar to: given a target T (-S) and a set of denominations (all integers from 1 to x and from -1 to -x), we wish to cover T with the fewest coins (but note: we can mix positive and negative).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use both positive and negative. This is equivalent to: we can use any integer in the range [-x, x] (including zero) but we are minimizing the number of cards. Since zeros don't help, we can ignore them.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We are allowed to use any integer between -x and x. So the minimal number of cards required to achieve a sum T is at least ceil(|T| / x) if we were only allowed to use positive or negative? But wait, we can use both. Actually, we can use a mix. However, note:\n\n The best we can do in one card is to get from -x to x. So the maximum absolute value we can cover in k cards is k*x. Therefore, we need at least k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n But also, we might use positive and negative to cancel out. However, note: we can also use negative cards to reduce a positive deficit and vice versa.\n\n Actually, the problem is: what is the minimum k such that there exists integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k (each in [-x, x]) such that their sum is T?\n\n This is similar to the \"change-making\" problem but with arbitrary denominations (every integer in [-x,x]) and negative allowed.\n\n However, note: we can use both positive and negative. This means we can represent any integer T provided that the total absolute value we can use (i.e., the sum of the absolute values of the chosen cards) is at least |T|. But wait, no: because we can use negative to cancel positive, but the net must be T.\n\n Actually, the necessary condition is that the sum of the absolute values must be at least |T|, but we can also use negatives to adjust. However, we are free to choose any integers. The minimal k is the smallest integer k such that there exists k integers (each in [-x,x]) that sum to T.\n\n We can think: \n\n Let k be the number of cards. The maximum positive sum we can get is k*x, and the maximum negative is -k*x. Therefore, we must have T in the range [-k*x, k*x].\n\n Also, we can represent any integer in the range [?, ?] with k cards? Actually, with k cards, we can represent any integer T' such that |T'| <= k*x and T' ≡ (some residue) modulo something? But note: we have all integers from -x to x. \n\n Actually, we can represent any integer T' in the range [-k*x, k*x] if k is sufficiently large. However, we are minimizing k.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x,x]. This set is contiguous from -x to x. So the problem becomes: find the minimal k such that T is in the interval [-k*x, k*x] and T is congruent modulo 1? Actually, we can represent any integer T' for which |T'| <= k*x? \n\n Not exactly: for example, if k=1, then we can only represent T' in [-x, x]. \n If k=2, then we can represent from -2*x to 2*x, but can we represent every integer in between? \n\n Let's check for k=2: \n   The smallest sum is -2*x, then -2*x+1, ... up to 2*x.\n   But note: we can choose two cards: the two cards can be any two integers in [-x,x]. The set of sums is the set of all integers from -2*x to 2*x. Why?\n      Because the two cards can be (a, b) and the sum is a+b. The smallest a+b is -x + (-x) = -2*x, and the largest is 2*x. And we can get every integer in between? \n\n   For example, to get 0: (0,0) or (1,-1) etc. But even without zeros, we can get consecutive integers? \n   Actually, we can get every integer from -2*x to 2*x because the set of two-card sums from [-x,x] is contiguous.\n\n Similarly, for k cards, we can represent every integer T' such that |T'| <= k*x.\n\n But wait, is that true? Consider k=3 and x=1: \n   Then the set of one-card: {-1,0,1}; two-card: {-2,-1,0,1,2}; three-card: {-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3}. So yes, contiguous.\n\n In fact, the set of k-card sums is all integers from -k*x to k*x.\n\n Therefore, the condition is: we need k such that |T| <= k*x.\n\n Then the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x). But wait, let's test:\n\n Example 1: T = 3, x = 2 -> then ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. But with two cards, the maximum absolute sum is 4, and 3<=4 -> so k=2. But is 3 achievable? \n   We can use two cards: 2 and 1 -> 3. Yes.\n\n Example 2: T = 4, x=2 -> ceil(4/2)=ceil(2)=2. But wait, 4 is 2+2, so k=2. But also note: 4<=2*2 -> yes.\n\n However, consider T=0: then k=ceil(0/x)=0. That is correct.\n\n But wait, what if T is negative? Same because absolute value.\n\n However, note: T is the target, which is -S, where S is the sum of the found cards.\n\n But wait: is the representation always possible for any T in [-k*x, k*x]? \n\n Yes, because we can use the following greedy-like idea: \n   We want to form T. We can use as many positive x as possible until we get close to T, and then adjust with smaller steps.\n\n However, note: we don't have only positive and negative x, we have every integer from -x to x. So we can adjust by any amount. \n\n But here's a catch: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. So we can also use negative numbers. \n\n Actually, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n Why? Because the maximum absolute value we can form with k cards is k*x (if we use all x's or all -x's). But note: we can form any integer in between, so we need the absolute value of T to be at most k*x.\n\n Therefore, k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n However, let's test with the sample:\n\n Sample 1: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n   Found cards: [-1,1,2] -> S = -1+1+2 = 2 -> T = -2.\n   Then |T|=2, x=2 -> ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1. So answer=1. Matches.\n\n Sample 2:\n   Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n   Found cards: [-2,-2] -> S=-4, T=4.\n   Then |T|=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.333...) = 2. So answer=2. Matches.\n\n But wait, what about T=1, x=2: ceil(1/2)=1. With one card, we can use 1. So yes.\n\n However, consider T=3, x=2: ceil(3/2)=2. With two cards, we can use 2 and 1 (or 1 and 2) to get 3. Yes.\n\n But consider T=5, x=2: ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. With three cards, maximum absolute value is 6, so 5 is within. How do we form 5? 2+2+1=5. Yes.\n\n But wait, is there a case where this formula fails?\n\n Consider: T=0, then k=0. Correct.\n\n Consider: T=2, x=3 -> ceil(2/3)=1. One card: we can use 2 (since 2<=3) so yes.\n\n Consider: T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. Two cards: maximum absolute sum is 6, so 4 is within. How? 3+1=4. Or 2+2=4. Or 3+1. So yes.\n\n But wait, what if T=1, x=1? ceil(1/1)=1. One card: 1. Correct.\n\n Another: T=2, x=1 -> ceil(2/1)=2. Two cards: 1+1=2. Correct.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use negative cards too. So sometimes we might use negative to get a positive? Actually, no: because we are trying to get a positive T, we would use positive cards. But if we are to get a negative T, we use negative cards.\n\n But the formula uses absolute value, so it works for negative as well.\n\n However, wait: what if T is not an integer? But T is an integer because the found cards are integers and x is integer, so T=-S is integer.\n\n So the answer is: \n   Let T = -sum(found_cards)\n   Let k = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n But wait: what if we can represent T with fewer cards by mixing positive and negative? \n\n Actually, the condition is that the absolute value of T must be <= k*x. So k must be at least ceil(|T|/x). \n\n However, note: the minimal k is indeed the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n But wait: consider T=0. Then k=0. But we already found that.\n\n However, what if the found cards already sum to zero? Then T=0, so we need 0 additional cards.\n\n But wait, the problem: we are to output the minimum number of cards to add. \n\n However, note: the above reasoning gives the minimal k for which the absolute value condition holds, and we know that condition is sufficient (because we can form any integer in [-k*x, k*x]). \n\n Therefore, the answer is k = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n But wait: there is a caveat. What if we can form T with fewer cards by using negative and positive together? \n\n Let me reexamine: the condition for k cards is that the absolute value of the sum must be at most k*x, but also we must be able to form T. And we know that with k cards we can form any integer from -k*x to k*x. So the minimal k is indeed the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n However, note: the set of integers we can form with k cards is contiguous from -k*x to k*x. So the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   total = sum(found_cards)\n   T = -total\n\n   if T == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        k = abs(T) // x\n        if abs(T) % x != 0:\n            k += 1\n        print(k)\n\n But wait, let's test with T=3, x=2: \n        abs(T)=3, 3//2=1, 3%2!=0 -> k=2. Correct.\n\n However, consider T=4, x=3: \n        abs(T)=4, 4//3=1, remainder 1 -> k=2. Correct.\n\n But wait, what if T is negative? Doesn't matter because we take absolute value.\n\n However, wait: is the condition really that k*x >= |T|? \n\n Example: T=1, x=2 -> k=ceil(1/2)=1, and 1<=1*2 -> yes.\n\n But note: with k=1, we can form 1 (which is within [-2,2]). \n\n However, consider a different representation: sometimes we might use more than one card to form a sum that is not just the absolute value? \n\n But the condition is necessary and sufficient: we can form any integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x] with k cards (each in [-x,x]). \n\n However, there's a catch: we are allowed to use zeros. But zeros don't help, so we are effectively using non-zero cards. But the above reasoning still holds because zeros don't extend the range? Actually, zeros are included, but they don't change the sum. So the set of sums we can form is the same as if we were allowed to use any integer in [-x,x] (including zeros) because we can always use zeros to pad without affecting the sum. But the minimal k is determined by the requirement to cover the absolute value.\n\n But wait, what if we don't have to use the entire k*x? \n\n Actually, the condition is that the absolute value of the total sum we wish to achieve (|T|) must be less than or equal to the maximum absolute sum we can form with k cards, which is k*x. \n\n However, note: we can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] (as long as k>=1). \n\n But wait, is that true for k=0? Then the range is [0,0]. \n\n So the minimal k is the smallest integer k (nonnegative) such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n Therefore, the code:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   total = sum(cards)\n   T = -total\n\n   if T == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        # Compute k = ceil(|T| / x)\n        k = abs(T) // x\n        if abs(T) % x != 0:\n            k += 1\n        print(k)\n\n But wait, what if T is very large? \n\n Example: T=1000, x=1 -> k = ceil(1000/1)=1000. Correct.\n\n However, note: there's another way to think: we can use the following:\n\n   k = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x   [this is a common way to compute ceiling division for positive numbers]\n\n But note: T can be negative, but we take absolute value so it's positive.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   k = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x\n\n But wait, if abs(T)==0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x -> which is 0 when x>=1. So that also works for T=0.\n\n Actually, we can write without the if-else:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   total = sum(cards)\n   T = -total\n   abs_T = abs(T)\n\n   if abs_T == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        # Ceiling division: (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n        k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n But wait, let's test with T=3, x=2: \n        abs_T=3, (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        T=4, x=3: (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        T=1, x=2: (1+2-1)//2 = (2)//2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        T=2, x=1: (2+1-1)//1 = 2//1=2 -> correct.\n\n However, note: what if T is negative? The absolute value takes care of that.\n\n But wait: the problem says the found cards are n integers, and the maximum absolute value on a card is x. The found cards themselves are in [-x,x]. But the total T might be large? \n\n But note: the maximum absolute value of one card is x, and we have n cards. The maximum absolute value of the total is n*x. Then T=-total, so |T| <= n*x.\n\n But our x is at most 1000, and n at most 1000, so |T| is at most 1000000. Then k = ceil(|T|/x) might be up to 1000000, which is acceptable in Python because we are just doing integer arithmetic.\n\n However, note: the problem says the found cards are n (up to 1000) and x (up to 1000). The worst-case |T| is 1000 * 1000 = 1000000, and then k = ceil(1000000/x) which is at least ceil(1000000/1000)=1000. So k can be up to 1000000, but wait: we are doing (abs_T + x - 1) // x, which is an integer operation and abs_T is up to 1000000, so that's acceptable.\n\n But wait: is it always true that we can represent T with k cards? \n\n We argued that with k cards, we can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n However, there's a catch: the set of available card values is integers from -x to x. We assumed that the set of k-card sums is contiguous from -k*x to k*x. \n\n This is true because the set of one-card sums is contiguous (from -x to x). Then for two cards, the set of sums is the convolution of two contiguous sets, which is also contiguous from -2*x to 2*x. Similarly, by induction, for k cards the set is contiguous from -k*x to k*x.\n\n Therefore, the answer is k = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n But wait: there is a known example in the problem that matches.\n\n However, let me consider an edge: T=1, x=1000 -> k=ceil(1/1000)=1. Correct.\n\n But wait, what if T=0? Then k=0. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if T is negative? For example, T=-5, x=3 -> then |T|=5, k=ceil(5/3)=2. With two cards, we can form -5? \n        The minimum two-card sum is -6 (if we use two -3's). But we can form -5: for example, -3 and -2 (if we are allowed to use -2, which is in [-3,3]). So yes.\n\n However, wait: the set of two-card sums: \n        The smallest is -3 + -3 = -6, then -3+-2=-5, then -3+-1=-4, etc.\n\n So yes, we can form -5.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Read n and x, then the list of n integers.\n   Compute total = sum(list)\n   T = -total\n   abs_T = abs(T)\n\n   if abs_T == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n But wait, there is a known example in the problem: \n\n   Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> T=-2, so k=ceil(2/2)=1 -> correct.\n\n   Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> T=4, k=ceil(4/3)=2 -> correct.\n\n However, wait: what if T is not divisible by x? \n\n   Example: T=3, x=2 -> k=ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Correct.\n\n But note: the above formula (abs_T + x - 1) // x is the standard way to compute ceiling division for positive integers.\n\n But wait, there is a possibility: what if T is positive and we use negative cards? Actually, the sign doesn't matter because we are taking absolute value. We are representing T (which can be negative) by the sum of the chosen cards. But the formula for the minimal k is based on the absolute value.\n\n However, consider: we are forming T (which might be negative). But the set of k-card sums is symmetric: if we can form a positive T, we can form the negative T by flipping the signs. So the absolute value condition is the same.\n\n Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n But wait, let me check the example from the problem statement:\n\n   Example 1: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2'] -> T=-2, k=ceil(2/2)=1 -> output 1.\n\n   Example 2: ['2 3\\n-2 -2'] -> T=4, k=ceil(4/3)=2 -> output 2.\n\n However, wait: the second example input is \"2 3\\n-2 -2\". The found cards are two: [-2,-2]. Their sum is -4, so T=4. Then k=ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2.\n\n But note: the problem says: \"In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2.\" \n\n Why two cards of 2? Because 2+2=4. \n\n But wait, why not one card of 4? Because the maximum absolute value is 3, so 4 is not allowed. So we cannot use a single card of 4. Hence two cards of 2 (or other combinations that sum to 4, such as 3 and 1, but 1 is available). \n\n However, the minimal number is 2.\n\n But wait, what if we use a card of 3 and a card of 1? That's two cards. \n\n So the answer 2 is correct.\n\n However, wait: the example input is \"2 3\\n-2 -2\", meaning the found cards are two: [-2,-2]. The total found is -4. We need to add cards so that the total becomes 0. So we need to add cards that sum to 4.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the additional cards are distinct from the found ones. We can use any card from -3 to 3. \n\n The minimal k is 2.\n\n But wait, why did the example say \"two cards with number 2\"? That is one valid way.\n\n Now, let me consider a different example: \n\n   Input: \"1 1\\n0\" -> n=1, x=1, found card=[0]\n   Then total=0, T=0 -> k=0.\n\n   Input: \"1 1\\n1\" -> total=1, T=-1 -> k=ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\n   Input: \"1 1\\n-1\" -> total=-1, T=1 -> k=ceil(1/1)=1.\n\n   Input: \"2 1\\n1 1\" -> total=2, T=-2 -> k=ceil(2/1)=2.\n\n   Input: \"2 1\\n1 -1\" -> total=0, T=0 -> 0.\n\n   Input: \"3 1\\n1 1 1\" -> total=3, T=-3 -> ceil(3/1)=3.\n\n   Input: \"3 1\\n1 1 -1\" -> total=1, T=-1 -> ceil(1/1)=1.\n\n   Input: \"3 2\\n1 1 1\" -> total=3, T=-3 -> ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2.\n\n        With two cards: we need to form -3. We can use two -2's: -2 + -2 = -4, which is too low. Or one -2 and one -1: -3. So yes, two cards.\n\n   But wait, the maximum absolute value per card is 2, so we can use -2 and -1. So two cards.\n\n However, note: the problem says the cards can be any integer from -x to x. So we can use -1 and -2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n But wait: is there a scenario where we can form T with fewer cards by using a mix of positive and negative? \n\n Actually, no: because the condition is that the absolute value of T must be <= k*x, and k is the minimal integer satisfying that. \n\n However, note: the minimal k must be at least ceil(|T|/x). And we know that with k cards we can form T. So the minimal k is indeed the ceiling.\n\n But wait, consider: T=3, x=2 -> k=ceil(3/2)=2. We form 3 with two cards: 2+1=3. \n\n Now, what if we try to form 3 with one card? The maximum positive card is 2, so we cannot. Therefore, two is minimal.\n\n Similarly, T=4, x=3 -> k=ceil(4/3)=2. We form 4 with two cards: 3+1=4.\n\n But wait, what if T=2, x=3? Then k=ceil(2/3)=1. Correct, because one card of 2 is allowed.\n\n So the formula holds.\n\n However, wait: what if T=0? We don't need any cards.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the minimum number of cards he needs to find\", so if the found cards already sum to zero, then we don't need to find any.\n\n Therefore, the code:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   t = -s\n\n   if t == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        # Compute k = ceil(|t| / x)\n        # Since t might be negative, use absolute value.\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        # Ceiling division: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n But wait: what if t is negative? Then abs_t is positive, and the calculation is the same.\n\n However, there is a special case: what if the found cards are such that the sum is zero? Then t=0, and we print 0.\n\n But note: the problem says the found cards are n cards. We are only concerned with the total.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"the minimum number of cards does he need to find\", meaning the additional ones.\n\n So the above code is correct.\n\n But wait: I just saw the example inputs: \n   First sample: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> sum=2, so t=-2 -> k=ceil(2/2)=1 -> output 1.\n\n   Second sample: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> sum=-4, t=4 -> k=ceil(4/3)=2 -> output 2.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the found cards are n, and the set of available cards is from -x to x. \n\n But note: the found cards are part of the infinite set, so they are in [-x,x]. \n\n But wait: what if the found cards are already such that the sum is zero? Then we don't need to add any. \n\n But what if the found cards are not zero, but we can form the required T with zero cards? No, because T is -sum(found_cards) and if the found cards are not zero then T is not zero.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?\"\n\n So we are counting the additional cards.\n\n But wait, what if the found cards are [0,0,...,0]? Then the total is 0, so we need 0 additional cards.\n\n Our code handles that.\n\n However, wait: what if the found cards are [0,0,...,0] and then we have n zeros? Then total=0, so t=0 -> 0.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   t = -s\n\n   if t == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n But wait, there is an alternative: we can compute k without the if for t==0 by using:\n\n   k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x if abs(t) != 0 else 0\n\n But we already have the condition.\n\n However, note: the ceiling division formula (abs_t + x - 1) // x works for abs_t=0 as well:\n\n   If abs_t=0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. Since x>=1, (x-1)//x is 0. So we can write without the if:\n\n   k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n\n   Then print(k)\n\n But wait: what if t=0? Then abs(t)=0, and k= (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x -> which is 0 for x>=1. So it works.\n\n Therefore, we can simplify:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   t = -s\n\n   abs_t = abs(t)\n   k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n   print(k)\n\n However, wait: what if t is negative? Then abs(t) is positive, and the formula still holds.\n\n But wait, let me test with t=-5, x=3: \n        abs_t=5, k=(5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2 (since 7//3 is 2 in integer floor division). But ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. Correct.\n\n So the code is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   t = -s\n   abs_t = abs(t)\n   k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n   print(k)\n\n But wait: what if the total sum is negative? Then t is positive, but we take absolute value so it's the same.\n\n Example: found cards sum to -5 -> t=5, then k=ceil(5/x). Correct.\n\n Therefore, we can submit this.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the cards found are n integers. The sum might be very large? But n<=1000, x<=1000, and each card is in [-x,x]. So the maximum absolute value of the sum is at most 1000*x (which is 1000000). The ceiling division by x (at least 1) will give an integer up to 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait, there is a known issue: the ceiling division formula (abs_t + x - 1) // x is standard for positive numbers.\n\n However, note: abs_t is nonnegative, and x is positive (given x>=1). So it's safe.\n\n But wait: what if x=0? The problem states x>=1, so no.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   t = -s\n   abs_t = abs(t)\n   k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n   print(k)\n\n However, wait: let me test with the sample inputs again.\n\n   Sample1: n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s=-1+1+2=2, t=-2, abs_t=2, k=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2=1 (in integer floor division, 3//2=1). Correct.\n\n   Sample2: n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, t=4, abs_t=4, k=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2. Correct.\n\n But wait, what if the total is positive? Example: found cards [2,2,2] (n=3, x=3) -> s=6, t=-6, abs_t=6, k=(6+3-1)//3=8//3=2 (floor division: 8//3=2, but ceil(6/3)=2). Correct.\n\n However, wait: 8//3 is 2 in Python? Yes, because 8//3 is floor division, which truncates toward negative infinity? Actually, for positive numbers, floor division is the same as truncating the decimal. 8/3 is about 2.66, floor is 2. But our formula is (abs_t+x-1)//x, which for abs_t=6, x=3: (6+3-1)=8, 8//3=2 -> which is the ceiling of 6/3=2. But wait, 6/3=2, so ceiling is 2. \n\n Actually, the formula for ceiling division is (a + b - 1) // b, which is correct.\n\n But wait, the formula is: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b   [for positive integers a and b]\n\n So it's correct.\n\n However, note: the formula works for positive a and positive b.\n\n Since abs_t is nonnegative and x is positive, we are good.\n\n But wait: what if t=0? Then abs_t=0, and (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. For x=1: (0)//1=0. For x=2: (1)//2=0 (since 1//2=0). Correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   t = -s\n   abs_t = abs(t)\n   k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n   print(k)\n\n However, wait: there is a known example that fails? \n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the sum of the found cards, let's call it `s`, must be negated by the sum of the additional cards. The additional cards must sum to `-s`. The challenge is to find the smallest number of cards (each with a value between -x and x) that sum up to `-s`.\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of `-s` divided by `x`. This is because each card can contribute at most `x` (in absolute value) towards the target sum. Therefore, the minimal number of cards needed is the smallest integer `k` such that `k * x >= | -s |`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the total sum of the found cards, then computing the absolute value of its negative. The result is obtained by performing ceiling division of this absolute value by `x`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves a linear scan of the input array to compute the sum, which is O(n), where n is the number of found cards. The subsequent calculations are constant time operations, making the overall complexity O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    s = sum(arr)\n    t = -s\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of found cards `n`, the maximum absolute value `x`, and the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum `s` of the found cards is computed. The target sum for the additional cards is `-s`.\n3. **Absolute Value**: The absolute value of the target sum is taken to handle both positive and negative targets uniformly.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: The minimal number of cards `k` is calculated using ceiling division, which ensures that even if the target sum isn't perfectly divisible by `x`, we round up to the next integer to cover the entire sum.\n5. **Output Result**: The result `k` is printed, representing the minimum number of additional cards needed to balance the sum to zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages mathematical insights to solve the problem with optimal performance.",
