A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink available: k * l milliliters.\n    - Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend? Actually, note: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n      But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n    However, note that the group has n friends and they are making toasts such that each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n    The total drink required for one toast by all friends is n * nl (because each friend needs nl for one toast).\n    Similarly, the total lime slices needed for one toast is n * 1 (since each friend gets one slice) but wait: actually, the problem says \"a slice of lime\", meaning one per friend per toast? \n    And the salt needed for one toast is n * np.\n\n 2. Therefore, we can compute:\n    - Total toasts from drink: (k * l) // (n * nl)   [because each toast uses n*nl milliliters]\n    - Total toasts from limes: (c * d) // n           [because each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices needed per toast is n, and we have c*d slices]\n    - Total toasts from salt: p // (n * np)            [because each toast requires n*np grams of salt]\n\n However, wait: let's read the example:\n\n Example 1: Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\n Breaking down:\n   n = 3, k = 4, l = 5 -> total drink = 20 ml.\n   Each toast: each friend needs 3 ml (nl=3) -> so for 3 friends, 9 ml per toast.\n   Then number of toasts from drink: 20 / 9 -> 2.222... -> floor to 2.\n\n   Limes: c=10, d=8 -> 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices (one per friend) -> 80/3 -> 26.666... -> floor to 26.\n   Salt: p=100, np=1 -> 100 grams. Each toast requires 3*1=3 grams -> 100/3 -> 33.333... -> floor to 33.\n\n   Then the limiting factor is the drink: 2 toasts. But then we divide by the number of friends? \n\n   However, the example says: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n   Let me reexamine the example explanation:\n\n   They say: \n        Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n   But wait, why 20 / 3? Because each toast requires 3 ml per friend? Or does it require 3 ml in total?\n\n   The problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n\n   So for one toast, the total drink needed is n * nl (which is 3*3=9). Then 20 ml can only support 20 // 9 = 2 toasts (with remainder 2, so 2 full toasts).\n\n   However, the example explanation says: \"20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". That calculation is based on assuming that one toast uses 3 ml in total? \n\n   But wait, if one toast uses 3 ml for one friend, then for 3 friends it should be 3 * 3 = 9 ml. \n\n   There seems to be a confusion in the example explanation. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\n   The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n\n   Therefore, for one toast, the entire group requires n * nl milliliters.\n\n   However, the example input has nl=3, so one toast requires 3 ml per friend, so 3 friends: 9 ml.\n\n   Then the drink allows: 4*5 = 20 ml -> 20 // 9 = 2 (toasts) because 2*9=18 <=20, and 3*9=27>20.\n\n   But the example explanation says: \"20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". This implies that they are considering 3 ml as the total",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, limes, and salt, and then divide the result by the number of friends to ensure everyone drinks the same amount.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on three resources: drink, limes, and salt. Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend (so total `n * nl` milliliters per toast).\n   - One lime slice per friend (so total `n` slices per toast).\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend (so total `n * np` grams per toast).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The number of toasts is constrained by the most limited resource. We need to compute how many toasts each resource can support and then take the minimum of these values.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Drink Calculation**: Total drink available is `k * l`. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters. The number of toasts from drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Calculation**: Total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices. The number of toasts from limes is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt Calculation**: Total salt available is `p`. Each toast requires `n * np` grams. The number of toasts from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that division truncates towards zero since partial toasts are not allowed. The solution must handle all input constraints efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    toasts_from_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    toasts_from_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    \n    toasts_from_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    min_toasts = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_lime, toasts_from_salt)\n    \n    print(min_toasts)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers separated by spaces, representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink per toast per friend, and salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: Multiply the number of bottles (`k`) by the milliliters per bottle (`l`) to get the total drink volume. Divide this by the total drink required per toast (`n * nl`) to find how many toasts the drink can support.\n   - **Limes**: Multiply the number of limes (`c`) by the slices per lime (`d`) to get the total slices. Divide this by the number of friends (`n`) since each toast requires one slice per friend.\n   - **Salt**: Divide the total grams of salt (`p`) by the total salt required per toast (`n * np`).\n3. **Determine Minimum Toasts**: The smallest value among the three calculations (drink, limes, salt) determines the maximum number of toasts possible. This value is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
