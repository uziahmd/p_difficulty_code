    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000) and we need to output two integers.\n\n First integer: the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph.\n Second integer: the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n Definition: \n   A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are mutually reachable (i.e., there's a path from u to v and from v to u).\n\n Note: The problem says \"ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v\" for mutual reachability. But note that the condition for being mutually reachable is symmetric, so the pair (u, v) and (v, u) would both be considered in the mutual reachability? Actually, no: the problem states \"exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other\". So we are only counting the pairs with u < v.\n\n However, note that the entire graph might have more than just these mutual pairs. We are allowed to have any other edges as long as the mutual pairs (with u < v) are exactly p.\n\n Also, note that the graph must be directed.\n\n Observation:\n\n In a strongly connected component (SCC), every pair of nodes (u, v) with u != v is mutually reachable (if the graph is strongly connected, then for any two nodes there is a path in both directions). However, note that the problem counts only pairs with u < v. So in a complete SCC of k nodes, the number of mutual pairs (for u < v) is C(k,2) = k*(k-1)//2.\n\n But we can have multiple SCCs? Actually, the problem does not require the graph to be strongly connected. However, the condition for being p-reachable is that the graph has exactly p mutual pairs (for u < v). \n\n However, note that if the graph is built from multiple SCCs, then the mutual pairs are the sum of the mutual pairs within each SCC. Moreover, note that the definition requires that the entire graph has exactly p mutual pairs (for u < v). \n\n Also, we are allowed to have any directed edges as long as the mutual pairs (with u < v) is exactly p.\n\n But note: the problem also asks for the minimum number of nodes.\n\n How to minimize the number of nodes?\n\n Let n be the number of nodes.\n\n Consider: Each mutual pair (for u < v) must be contained within a single SCC (since if u and v are in different SCCs, they cannot be mutually reachable). Therefore, we can partition the graph into several strongly connected components, and the total mutual pairs is the sum over each component of C(size_i, 2). We require that sum_i [size_i*(size_i-1)//2] = p.\n\n Moreover, we want the minimum n (which is the sum of the sizes of the components) such that we can partition the integer n into positive integers (the sizes of the components) and the sum of the combinations (i.e., the triangular numbers) is p.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to have multiple components, but the mutual pairs are only counted within each component. And the entire graph must have exactly p mutual pairs.\n\n But wait: what about edges between components? The problem doesn't restrict edges between components. However, note that if there is an edge from one component to another, then that does not create mutual reachability between nodes in different components (because for two nodes in different components, there is no path from one to the other in both directions). Also, the problem counts only pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability. So edges between components do not contribute to mutual pairs (they might break the mutual reachability if we try to use them, but actually the mutual reachability condition requires both directions, which cannot happen across components if we don't have cycles between them).\n\n Therefore, we can consider the graph as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of SCCs, and the mutual pairs are the sum of the mutual pairs within each SCC.\n\n Now, we wish to minimize n (the total number of nodes) such that there exists a partition of n into k parts (each part at least 1) and the sum of C(a_i, 2) for all parts a_i equals p.\n\n Additionally, we are to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) (with u != v) such that there is a path from u to v but not from v to u. Note that unidirectional pairs are defined for any distinct nodes (not necessarily u < v) and the condition is asymmetric.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"Find the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph. Also, among",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable, and among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional node pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-Reachability**: A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are mutually reachable (i.e., there is a path from u to v and from v to u). The mutual reachability between nodes implies they must belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC).\n\n2. **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we need to partition the nodes into SCCs such that the sum of combinations of nodes within each SCC (i.e., C(size_i, 2)) equals p. The goal is to find the smallest n (total nodes) such that some partition of n into parts (each part ≥ 1) satisfies the sum of C(size_i, 2) = p.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum n is determined, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) where there is a path from u to v but not from v to u. This involves constructing the graph in a way that maximizes such asymmetric paths while maintaining the p-reachability condition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    p = int(data[0])\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"1 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = 1\n    s = 0\n    while s < p:\n        n += 1\n        s = n * (n - 1) // 2\n        \n    if s == p:\n        print(f\"{n} 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n_min = n\n    total_triangles = n_min * (n_min - 1) // 2\n    remaining = p - (total_triangles - n_min)\n    n_min -= 1\n    while remaining > 0:\n        n_min += 1\n        total_triangles_new = n_min * (n_min - 1) // 2\n        needed = total_triangles_new - (total_triangles - n_min)\n        if needed >= remaining:\n            break\n        total_triangles = total_triangles_new\n        \n    print(f\"{n_min} {remaining}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer p, which is the number of mutual pairs required.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If p is 0, the solution requires at least one node with zero mutual pairs.\n3. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The loop increments the number of nodes until the sum of combinations (triangular number) of nodes exceeds or equals p. The triangular number for n nodes is n*(n-1)/2.\n4. **Adjusting for Exact p**: If the triangular number exactly matches p, the solution is straightforward. Otherwise, adjustments are made to find the smallest n such that the sum of combinations within its parts equals p.\n5. **Output**: The solution outputs the minimum number of nodes and the remaining value, which represents the maximum number of unidirectional pairs achievable under the constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal graph structure that meets the p-reachability condition and maximizes the desired unidirectional pairs.",
