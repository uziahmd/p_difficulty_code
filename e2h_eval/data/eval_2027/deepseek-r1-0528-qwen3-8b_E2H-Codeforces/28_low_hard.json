String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three integers: n (number of zeros required), m (number of ones required), and g (the last character after performing any number of allowed modifications).\n The allowed modification is: replace the two last characters by one character. The rule for replacement:\n   - If the two last characters are \"00\", then replace by '1'.\n   - Otherwise (if at least one is '1'), replace by '0'.\n\n However, note that the problem states that we can perform any number of modifications (until the string has length < 2). So the process is reversible? Actually, we are not reversing but generating the original strings.\n\n Observation:\n We are to count the number of strings s (over {0,1}) such that:\n   - It has exactly n zeros and m ones.\n   - And if we repeatedly apply the reverse operation (which is the given modification) until the string length is less than 2, then the last character (if the string becomes of length 1) must be g? But note: the problem says \"obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications\".\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"1 1 0\" -> beautiful strings are \"01\", \"10\". \n   Then we consider applying modifications? Actually, we don't modify the final string, but the process is defined as: we can obtain g from s by some modifications. \n\n But note: the modification operation reduces the length. So we can think of it as: we start from s and we keep modifying until we get a string of length 1 (if we have an odd total length? Actually, the length reduction: each modification removes one character. So if we start with L = n+m, then we do k modifications until L-k = 1. So k = n+m-1, and then the string becomes one character. Or we stop earlier if the length becomes less than 2? Actually, the problem says we can do zero or more, so we can stop at any time. But note: the problem says \"obtain character g\", meaning that after some sequence of modifications (any sequence that stops when the string has length 1 or more? Actually, the problem says: \"with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications\". \n\n However, note: the modification is defined on two last characters. We can stop at any point. But the condition is that we must be able to obtain the character g. This means that there exists a sequence of modifications that leads to g. \n\n Alternatively, we can think of the reverse process: starting from a single character (either '0' or '1') and expanding by inserting at the end two characters that would lead to that character when modified. But note: the expansion is deterministic? Actually, no. The reverse operation is:\n\n   Operation: from a string t, we can expand the last character c by two characters (a,b) such that:\n        if c == '1', then the two characters must be '0' and '0'. Then the expansion is ...00 -> ...0 0, and then we replace the last two (00) to get 1, so we get the same string without the last character being 1.\n\n   Similarly, if c == '0', then the two characters can be any of: \n        '0' and '0'? -> then we get '00' which becomes '1' (so that doesn't work for getting 0)\n        Actually, the rule for replacement is: \n            Replace two last characters by:\n                '1' if they are both '0'\n                '0' otherwise.\n\n        So to get a '0' from the last two, the two characters must not be both zeros. So they can be:\n            '0' and '1' -> gives '0'\n            '1' and '0' -> gives '0'\n            '1' and '1' -> gives '0'\n\n        Therefore, to reverse from a '0' we can insert any two characters that are not \"00\". And to reverse from a '1' we must insert \"00\".\n\n This suggests that we can use dynamic programming or generating functions to count the number of ways to form a string that ends with a given character after a certain number of operations. However, note that the entire string must have exactly n zeros and m ones.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let T be the total length: T = n+m.\n\n We are going to consider the reverse process: starting from a string of length 1 (either '0' or '1') and then expanding until we get a string of length T.\n\n Steps:\n   Let f(0, x) be the number of ways to build a string of length x (from the reverse process) ending with '0' (and having a total of zeros and ones determined by the expansion steps) and similarly f",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that meet specific criteria. A beautiful string consists of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, and after performing any number of allowed modifications (replacing the last two characters with one based on certain rules), the resulting string must end with a specified character `g`. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the modifications reduce the string length by one each time. The process continues until the string length is less than 2. The final character `g` is obtained from the original string through these modifications. The problem can be approached by considering the reverse process: starting from a single character (either '0' or '1') and expanding it by inserting two characters at the end according to the modification rules in reverse.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to construct strings of increasing lengths. The state `dp[len][last_char]` represents the number of strings of length `len` ending with `last_char` (0 or 1) that can be reduced to `g` through modifications.\n\n3. **Base Cases**: \n   - For strings of length 1, if `g` matches the character, there's one way; otherwise, zero.\n   - For strings of length 2, the characters are directly considered if they match the required counts and the final character.\n\n4. **Transition**: For each length from 3 to `n + m`, update the DP table by considering how adding two characters at the end affects the count. The transitions depend on whether the new character added is '0' or '1' and how it relates to the previous characters.\n\n5. **Combination Counting**: The solution involves combinatorial mathematics to count valid sequences, leveraging precomputed factorials and modular inverses for efficient computation under large constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n_val = int(data[0])\n    m_val = int(data[1])\n    g_val = int(data[2])\n    \n    total_len = n_val + m_val\n    \n    if total_len == 1:\n        if g_val == 0:\n            print(1 if n_val == 1 else 0)\n        else:\n            print(1 if m_val == 1 else 0)\n        return\n    \n    fact = [1] * (total_len + 1)\n    inv_fact = [1] * (total_len + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, total_len + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % MOD\n        \n    inv_fact[total_len] = pow(fact[total_len], MOD - 2, MOD)\n    for i in range(total_len, 0, -1):\n        inv_fact[i - 1] = inv_fact[i] * i % MOD\n        \n    def nCr(n, r):\n        if r < 0 or r > n:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n] * inv_fact[r] % MOD * inv_fact[n - r] % MOD\n        \n    dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(total_len + 1)]\n    \n    if g_val == 0:\n        dp[1][0] = 1\n        dp[1][1] = 0\n    else:\n        dp[1][0] = 0\n        dp[1][1] = 1\n        \n    if total_len >= 2:\n        dp[2][0] = nCr(n_val, 1) if n_val >= 1 else 0\n        dp[2][1] = m_val * (m_val - 1) // 2 if m_val >= 2 else 0\n        if g_val == 0:\n            dp[2][0] %= MOD\n            dp[2][1] = 0\n        else:\n            dp[2][0] = 0\n            dp[2][1] %= MOD\n            \n    for length in range(3, total_len + 1):\n        dp[length][0] = (dp[length - 1][0] * (n_val + m_val - 1)) % MOD\n        dp[length][1] = (dp[length - 1][1] * (n_val + m_val - 1)) % MOD\n        \n        if length - 2 <= n_val and length - 2 >= 0:\n            dp[length][0] = (dp[length][0] + nCr(n_val, length - 2)) % MOD\n        if length - 2 <= m_val and length - 2 >= 0:\n            dp[length][1] = (dp[length][1] + nCr(m_val, length - 2)) % MOD\n            \n        if length - 2 >= 1:\n            dp[length][0] = (dp[length][0] - nCr(n_val, length - 2) + MOD) % MOD\n            dp[length][1] = (dp[length][1] - nCr(m_val, length - 2) + MOD) % MOD\n            \n    result = (dp[total_len][0] if g_val == 0 else dp[total_len][1]) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading input values `n`, `m`, and `g`. It checks if the total string length is 1, handling this edge case separately.\n2. **Factorial Precomputation**: Factorials and their modular inverses are precomputed up to the total string length to efficiently compute combinations using `nCr`.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Table Setup**: The DP table `dp[len][last_char]` is initialized where `len` ranges from 1 to `n + m`. The base cases for strings of length 1 and 2 are handled based on the value of `g`.\n4. **DP Transitions**: For each length from 3 to `n + m`, the DP values are updated by considering all possible ways to extend strings of length `len-1` by two characters, ensuring the counts of zeros and ones remain within limits.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is derived from the DP table by selecting the appropriate entry based on `g`, ensuring the result is modulo `1000000007`.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid strings by leveraging dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics, handling large numbers with modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.",
