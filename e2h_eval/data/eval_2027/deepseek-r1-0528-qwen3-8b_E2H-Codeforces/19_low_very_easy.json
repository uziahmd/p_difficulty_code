The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an undirected tree with n nodes (districts) and n-1 edges. The fan count for a contestant from district i is 2^i.\n The president wants to remove k contestants (so we keep n - k districts). The remaining districts must form a connected component (since there's exactly one path between every two, so the graph is a tree; we need the remaining to be connected).\n\n Since the fan count for a district i is 2^i, which grows exponentially, we want to maximize the total fans. Note that 2^i is larger than the sum of all smaller powers. Therefore, we definitely want to keep the highest numbered districts as much as possible.\n\n However, the condition is that the remaining districts must form a connected component (so they must be connected in the original tree). This means that if we remove some districts, the remaining must form a connected subgraph.\n\n Observation:\n In trees, a connected subgraph is determined by a set of nodes that are connected. We cannot break the connectivity arbitrarily. \n\n But note: the problem requires removing k districts. We are to output the k districts to remove (in increasing order).\n\n Alternate view: we wish to choose a connected subgraph of n-k nodes such that the sum of 2^i for the kept nodes is maximized. Then, the removed nodes are the complement.\n\n Since the fan counts are powers of two, the best way to maximize is to keep the largest numbers. However, we have connectivity constraints.\n\n We can think: the entire nation is a tree. We are going to remove k nodes, leaving n-k nodes. The remaining nodes must be connected.\n\n How do we choose which ones to remove? We want to remove as many small-numbered districts as necessary to keep the large-numbered ones connected.\n\n However, note: if we remove a node, then the tree breaks into multiple components. We require that the remaining nodes form one connected component.\n\n Therefore, we must not remove any node that would disconnect the high-numbered nodes from each other, unless we remove all the way around.\n\n Actually, we can reframe: We wish to keep a connected component of size (n-k). And we want the kept component to have as large fan count as possible.\n\n Since 2^i is exponential, we prefer to keep the largest nodes. So we want to keep the largest (n-k) nodes if possible. But sometimes, the largest (n-k) nodes might not form a connected component.\n\n Then we might have to drop one or more of the largest nodes and include a slightly smaller one to maintain connectivity.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: what is the maximum number of the highest-numbered districts we can keep while ensuring connectivity?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Note that the districts are numbered from 1 to n. The fan count increases with the district number.\n\n 2. We wish to keep the largest (n-k) districts. But we must check if they form a connected component.\n\n 3. However, the entire set of the largest (n-k) districts might not be connected. Then we have to adjust.\n\n But note: we are allowed to remove any k nodes arbitrarily, but the remaining must be connected.\n\n Another idea: the connected component of n-k nodes must be contiguous in the tree? Not necessarily, but we can use the concept of \"core\" or \"steiner tree\", but that is too heavy.\n\n Insight: the connectivity constraint forces that the kept nodes must form a connected subtree. In a tree, the minimal connected subgraph containing a set of nodes is the union of the simple paths between each pair of nodes. However, we don't know the set.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n Since we want the largest fan counts, we want to keep the highest-numbered nodes. The highest fan count comes from keeping the largest index. So we want to keep the largest (n-k) nodes. But if these largest (n-k) nodes are not connected, then we must drop some of them and pick up some smaller ones? Actually, we can also consider: maybe we keep a connected component that contains all the largest nodes and some others? \n\n However, note: if we keep a set S of nodes, then the total fan count is fixed (the sum of 2^i for i in S). Since 2^i is exponentially increasing, the largest nodes dominate. So we want to keep the largest nodes.\n\n The problem reduces to: find the smallest set of nodes (in terms of node indices) that must be removed so that the remaining graph (which is a tree) is connected and has n-k nodes. But note: we are forced to remove exactly k nodes, so we keep exactly n-k nodes.\n\n Actually, we can think of it as: we wish to keep the largest (n-k) nodes (by index) if they form a connected component. If not, we have to replace some of the smallest nodes in this set (i.e., the ones with the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which k districts should be removed from a tree-structured network such that the remaining n-k districts form a connected component and the total fan count of the remaining districts is maximized. The fan count for each district i is given by 2^i, which means higher-numbered districts contribute more significantly to the total fan count.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves a tree structure where each node (district) has a unique fan count based on its number. The goal is to remove k nodes such that the remaining nodes are connected and their total fan count is maximized. Given the exponential nature of the fan counts (2^i), the optimal solution will involve keeping the highest-numbered nodes possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The highest-numbered nodes must be included in the connected component to maximize the fan count. However, these nodes must be interconnected in the original tree. If the highest-numbered nodes do not form a connected component themselves, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to maintain connectivity.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Union-Find Data Structure**: This helps efficiently manage and merge connected components as we process nodes.\n   - **Processing Nodes in Descending Order**: By processing nodes from the highest number down to the lowest, we can greedily include the highest-numbered nodes first and check if they form a connected component. If not, we include necessary lower-numbered nodes to bridge the gaps.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each node once and performs union-find operations, which are nearly constant time per operation due to path compression and union by rank. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n α(n)), where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, making it efficient for large n (up to 10^6).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    edges = []\n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        edges.append((a, b))\n    \n    parent = [i for i in range(n+1)]\n    rank = [0] * (n+1)\n    \n    def find(x):\n        if parent[x] != x:\n            parent[x] = find(parent[x])\n        return parent[x]\n    \n    def union(x, y):\n        rx = find(x)\n        ry = find(y)\n        if rx == ry:\n            return False\n        if rank[rx] < rank[ry]:\n            parent[rx] = ry\n        elif rank[ry] < rank[rx]:\n            parent[ry] = rx\n        else:\n            parent[ry] = rx\n            rank[rx] += 1\n        return True\n\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for a, b in edges:\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n        \n    order = list(range(1, n+1))\n    order.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    components = {}\n    for node in order:\n        comp = find(node)\n        if comp not in components:\n            components[comp] = set()\n        components[comp].add(node)\n        \n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if find(neighbor) != comp:\n                union(node, neighbor)\n                \n    kept_nodes = set()\n    for comp in components.values():\n        if len(comp) >= n - k:\n            kept_nodes |= comp\n            break\n            \n    for node in order:\n        if node not in kept_nodes and len(kept_nodes) < n - k:\n            kept_nodes.add(node)\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor not in kept_nodes:\n                    union(node, neighbor)\n                    \n    removed_nodes = sorted([i for i in range(1, n+1) if i not in kept_nodes])\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, removed_nodes)))\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts (n) and the number of districts to remove (k). The edges of the tree are stored in a list.\n2. **Union-Find Initialization**: The union-find data structure is initialized to manage and merge connected components efficiently.\n3. **Graph Construction**: The tree is represented using an adjacency list for easy traversal.\n4. **Processing Nodes**: Nodes are processed in descending order (from highest to lowest number). For each node, its connected component is determined using the union-find structure.\n5. **Component Selection**: The largest connected component(s) is selected to ensure the maximum number of high-value nodes are retained. If necessary, additional nodes are included to reach the required size (n-k).\n6. **Output**: The nodes not included in the largest connected component are identified and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the remaining nodes form a connected component with the highest possible total fan count by leveraging union-find and processing nodes in a strategic order.",
