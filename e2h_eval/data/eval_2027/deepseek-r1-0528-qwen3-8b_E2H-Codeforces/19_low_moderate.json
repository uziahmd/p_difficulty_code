The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an undirected tree with n nodes (districts) and n-1 edges. The fan count for a district i is 2^i (so higher districts have more fans). We need to remove k districts (so we keep n-k districts) such that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph (thus, they must form a connected subtree). Additionally, we want to maximize the total fan count.\n\n Observation: Since the fan count for a district is 2^i, which grows exponentially, we would prefer to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. However, the constraint is that the remaining districts must be connected.\n\n How do we approach?\n\n Note: The entire graph is a tree. The condition for the remaining districts to be connected is that they form a connected subtree.\n\n Idea:\n Since the fan value is increasing with the district number, we want to keep the highest numbered districts. However, if we remove some lower ones, we might break the connectivity.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the problem in reverse: we wish to choose a connected subtree of size (n-k) that has the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\n But note: the fan value is 2^i, so the total fan value is the sum of 2^i for the kept districts. The exponential nature means that including a high-numbered district is very beneficial.\n\n However, note that the districts are numbered from 1 to n, but the tree structure is arbitrary. The key is: we cannot simply take the largest n-k districts because they might not form a connected subgraph.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Consider that the connected component must be a contiguous part of the tree. We can use the following:\n\n 1. Root the tree arbitrarily (say at node 1) and compute the subtree sizes and the sum of the fan values (which are powers of two) in the subtree? But note: the fan value is fixed per node (2^i) and independent of the tree structure.\n\n However, note: the problem says the nation has exactly one path between every two districts, meaning it's a tree.\n\n 2. We are allowed to remove k nodes, so we keep n-k nodes. We wish to maximize the sum of 2^i for the kept nodes.\n\n Since the fan value is exponential, the best candidate is to keep the highest numbered districts. But if we keep a set S of districts, then S must form a connected subtree.\n\n How about: we try to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, and then check if the set of kept districts is connected? But how to enforce connectivity?\n\n Another idea: \n\n In trees, a connected subgraph is a tree (if we consider the minimal connected subgraph) and we can also include extra nodes arbitrarily. However, the problem does not require the kept set to be minimal.\n\n What if we consider the following:\n\n - We know that the entire graph is a tree, so the kept nodes must form a connected subgraph. This is equivalent to saying that the kept nodes must include all the edges that lie between them, and the induced subgraph is connected.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the kept set to be a spanning tree; it can be any connected subgraph.\n\n We can reframe: We want to remove k nodes, so we keep n-k nodes. We wish to maximize the sum of 2^i for the kept nodes.\n\n Since 2^i is larger for higher i, we would like to keep the districts with the largest numbers. But sometimes we may have to remove a high-numbered district to keep connectivity? Actually, no: we want to keep the high ones, and remove the low ones. However, if we remove too many low ones, we might break connectivity.\n\n Alternatively, think of the problem as: we are going to select a connected subgraph (a tree) of n-k nodes. We want to maximize the sum.\n\n How about: we start by assuming we keep all the nodes with numbers from x to n (for some x). Then we check if these nodes form a connected subgraph? But note: the tree structure is arbitrary, so we cannot just take consecutive numbers.\n\n Another approach: \n\n Since the fan value is 2^i, note that the sum is dominated by the highest numbers. Therefore, we would prefer to keep the highest numbers. So the optimal solution will keep the highest n-k numbers? Not necessarily: because the highest n-k numbers might not be connected.\n\n Example: \n   n=3, k=0 -> keep all, so [1,2,3] must be connected (they are, since it's a tree).\n   n=3, k=1 -> we remove one. We have two options: remove 1, or remove 2, or remove 3.\n        Removing 1: kept {2,3} -> connected? Only if the edge (2,3) exists. But the input is a tree with 3 nodes:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which k districts to remove from a tree-structured network such that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph and the sum of their fan values (2^i) is maximized. The solution involves leveraging the exponential nature of the fan values and ensuring connectivity in the remaining subgraph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires selecting n-k districts from a tree structure such that they form a connected subgraph and the sum of their fan values (2^i) is maximized. Given the exponential growth of 2^i, higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more to the total fan value. Thus, the optimal solution will prioritize keeping the highest-numbered districts while ensuring connectivity.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal set of districts to keep must include all districts from some starting point up to the highest-numbered district. This is because any removal of a lower-numbered district could potentially disconnect the higher-numbered districts, but skipping a high-numbered district would unnecessarily reduce the total fan value.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Tree Traversal**: We perform a depth-first search (DFS) or a similar traversal to compute the size of the subtree rooted at each node. This helps in determining how many districts can be included below each node.\n   - **Greedy Selection**: Starting from the highest-numbered district, we check if including it and all necessary lower-numbered districts maintains connectivity. Specifically, for each candidate district, we verify if the number of districts that can be included in its subtree (including itself) is sufficient to form a connected component of the desired size.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The DFS traversal processes each node once, resulting in O(n) time complexity. The greedy selection step also operates in O(n) time as it checks each node once. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^6).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it))\n    k_remove = int(next(it))\n    keep_count = n - k_remove\n    \n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(next(it))\n        b = int(next(it))\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n        \n    parent = [-1] * (n+1)\n    order = []\n    stack = [1]\n    parent[1] = 0\n    while stack:\n        node = stack.pop()\n        order.append(node)\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor == parent[node]:\n                continue\n            parent[neighbor] = node\n            stack.append(neighbor)\n            \n    subtree_size = [0] * (n+1)\n    subtree_size_sum = [0] * (n+1)\n    \n    for node in reversed(order):\n        count = 1\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor == parent[node]:\n                continue\n            count += subtree_size[neighbor]\n        subtree_size[node] = count\n        subtree_size_sum[node] = 2**node * count\n        \n    res = []\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        if subtree_size[i] >= keep_count:\n            res.append(i)\n            break\n            \n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        if i in res:\n            continue\n        if subtree_size[i] >= keep_count:\n            res.append(i)\n            \n    res.sort()\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, res[:k_remove])))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts (n) and the number of districts to remove (k_remove). The subsequent lines define the tree structure connecting the districts.\n2. **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed using an adjacency list for efficient traversal.\n3. **DFS Traversal**: A DFS is performed starting from district 1 to establish parent-child relationships and determine the order of nodes.\n4. **Subtree Size Calculation**: For each node, the size of its subtree (including itself) is computed. This helps in determining how many districts can be included if a particular node is retained.\n5. **Greedy Selection**: Starting from the highest-numbered district, the algorithm checks if the subtree rooted at that node contains enough districts (at least `keep_count`). If so, those districts are kept; otherwise, the check continues for lower-numbered districts.\n6. **Output**: The selected districts to remove are sorted in increasing order and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph while maximizing the total fan value by prioritizing higher-numbered districts.",
