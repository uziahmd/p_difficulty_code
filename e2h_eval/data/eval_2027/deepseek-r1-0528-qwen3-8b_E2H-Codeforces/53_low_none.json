    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and occurrences can overlap).\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to check for each possible substring length (from the maximum possible down) whether there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate from the maximum possible substring length (which is n-1, because two non-overlapping would require at least double but note: they can overlap) and then check for each substring of that length if it appears at least twice.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. Let n = len(string). We are going to check from L = n//2 (because if we have two overlapping, the maximum length of the substring that can appear twice is when one occurrence ends and the next starts in the middle, so the maximum length is n? Actually, even the entire string can appear twice if the string is periodic? But note: the substring must appear at least twice. However, the problem says \"at least twice\", and they can overlap.\n\n But note: the entire string appearing twice would require two copies of the entire string, but the problem says the substring can appear at least twice (and they can overlap). So we cannot have two non-overlapping entire strings unless the string is empty or something. Actually, the problem does not require the two occurrences to be non-overlapping. Therefore, we can have overlapping.\n\n Example: \"ababa\" -> substring \"aba\" appears starting at index0 and index2.\n\n However, the sample input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] gives [0,3,2].\n\n For \"abcd\": no substring of length>=1 appears twice -> answer 0.\n For \"ababa\": the substring \"aba\" (length3) appears at index0 and index2, so answer 3.\n For \"zzz\": the substring \"z\" (length1) appears three times, but also \"zz\" (length2) appears twice (overlapping). The problem asks for the longest substring that appears at least twice. So the answer is 2.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can try from the maximum possible substring length (which is n) downwards until we find one that appears at least twice.\n\n However, note: if a substring of length L appears twice, then we need to check for every substring of length L if it appears at least twice. But note: if we find one substring of length L that appears at least twice, then we can output L.\n\n But wait: what if a longer substring appears twice? Actually, we are iterating from the maximum possible (which is n) down to 1. The first (largest) L for which we find a substring that appears at least twice is our answer.\n\n However, note: a substring of length L appearing twice does not necessarily imply that a substring of length L+1 will not appear twice. Actually, we want the longest. So we start from the maximum possible (which is n) and go down until we find one.\n\n But note: the entire string (length n) can appear twice? Only if the string is repeated twice? Actually, no: if the string is \"aaa\", then the entire string \"aaa\" appears only once (unless we consider overlapping? But the entire string is contiguous and we are looking for two occurrences. In \"aaa\", the entire string \"aaa\" appears only once as a contiguous block. However, we can have overlapping occurrences for shorter substrings.\n\n Actually, the two occurrences of the substring must be contiguous and can be overlapping. But the entire string itself cannot appear twice unless the string is periodic with period less than n? Actually, we are just taking contiguous substring.\n\n Example: \"ababab\", the entire string \"ababab\" appears only once. But we might have \"abab\" (length4) appearing at index0 and index2.\n\n So we should check from the maximum possible substring length (n) down to 1.\n\n However, note: the two occurrences can be overlapping. So for a substring of length L, we can have two occurrences that start at indices i and j (with i<j and j-i < L) meaning they overlap.\n\n But note: the definition of substring is contiguous. So we are simply checking for a contiguous substring of length L that appears at least twice (the two occurrences can start at different indices and can overlap).\n\n How to check for a given L?\n   We can create a set of all substrings of length L. Then if the set size is less than the total number of substrings of length L, then there's at least one duplicate.\n\n But note: the problem doesn't require the two occurrences to be non-overlapping, so even if they overlap, that's allowed.\n\n However, we are only concerned",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution must efficiently determine the answer for any input string of lower-case Latin letters with a maximum length of 100.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves checking all possible substrings of the input string to determine if any substring appears more than once. The key observation is that overlapping occurrences are allowed, so we need to consider all possible starting positions for substrings.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking substrings from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each possible substring length, we examine all substrings of that length to see if any appear more than once. The first length (from the largest) for which a duplicate is found is our answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1, where n is the string length) down to 1. For each length, it checks all substrings of that length to see if any duplicate exists. If found, it returns the current length immediately as the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, the approach is efficient. The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), which is feasible for n ≤ 100.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = True\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Iterating Over Substring Lengths**: The loop starts from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1. This ensures that the first duplicate found corresponds to the longest valid substring.\n3. **Checking for Duplicates**: For each substring length L, the code checks every substring of length L in the input string. It uses a dictionary to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is encountered more than once, the current length L is printed, and the program exits.\n4. **Output Result**: If no duplicates are found for any length, the program outputs 0, indicating no substring appears at least twice.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging the problem constraints and ensures optimal performance for the given input size.",
