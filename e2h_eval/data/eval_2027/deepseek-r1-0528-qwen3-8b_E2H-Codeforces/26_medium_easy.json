    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers: A, B, C, D (with 1 <= A <= B <= C <= D <= 500000)\n\n We are to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B\n   B <= y <= C\n   C <= z <= D\n\n And the triangle is non-degenerate, meaning that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.\n\n However, note that the triangle inequality for sides (x, y, z) requires:\n   x + y > z\n   x + z > y\n   y + z > x\n\n But note the constraints on x, y, z: \n   x is in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D].\n\n Since x <= y <= z (because A<=B<=C<=D and x<=B, y>=B, z>=C and since B<=C, so x<=B<=C<=z, and similarly y<=C<=z), \n the strictest condition is x+y>z. The other two inequalities are automatically satisfied because:\n   x+z >= x+y (since z>=y) and we know x+y>z, but wait: actually, we have:\n     x+z >= x + C (since z>=C) and C>=B>=x? Not necessarily, but note: \n        x+z >= A + C (since x>=A, z>=C) and we require A+C > y_max? Actually, we don't need to check the other two if we use the following:\n\n However, note that since x<=y<=z, the triangle inequality reduces to just x+y>z.\n\n So the problem reduces to counting the triplets (x,y,z) with:\n   A <= x <= B\n   B <= y <= C\n   C <= z <= D\n   and x+y>z.\n\n How to count without iterating over all possibilities (since A,B,C,D can be up to 500000)?\n\n We can fix z first? Or fix x and y? But note the ranges are large.\n\n Alternate approach: fix the side z (which is the largest) and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B, C].\n\n But note: the condition for a fixed z is: x+y > z, and we also have x<=B, y<=C, and x>=A, y>=B.\n\n However, the total number of pairs (x,y) for a fixed z is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). Then we subtract the pairs that do not satisfy x+y>z.\n\n But note: the condition x+y>z is equivalent to x+y>=z+1.\n\n We can also fix x and then y must be at least max(B, z+1-x) and at most C. But then we have to consider the entire range.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the number of pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y <= z for each z from C to D, and then subtract from the total.\n\n But note: z goes from C to D, which is up to 500000, and for each z we would iterate over x from A to B, and then set y from B to min(C, z+1-x) ? That would be too slow.\n\n Instead, we can use a two-pointer or cumulative sums.\n\n Let's reframe: We want to count the number of pairs (x,y) such that x in [A, B], y in [B, C] and x+y>z.\n\n For a fixed z, the condition is x+y>z.\n\n We can precompute an array for the counts of x (from A to B) and then for each x, we can compute the minimum y required: y_min = max(B, z+1-x) and maximum y is C.\n\n Then for each z, the number of valid (x,y) is:\n   For x from A to B:\n      if z+1 - x <= C and z+1-x >= B, then the number of y for this x is: max(0, min(C, z) - (z+1-x) + 1) ??? Wait, let me correct:\n\n Actually, for a fixed x and z, y must be at least max(B, z+1-x) and at most C. So the count for x is: \n   L = max(B, z+1-x)\n   R = C\n   If L > R, then 0.\n   Else, R - L + 1.\n\n Then the total for z is the sum_{x=A}^{B} [max(0, C - max(B, z+1-x) + 1)].\n\n But note: we can also change the order: for a fixed z, the condition is y >= max(B, z+1-x). This is equivalent to y >= max(B, z+1-x). \n\n Alternatively, we can fix y and then x must be at least max(A, z+1-y) and at most B, but again we are summing over x.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over z from C to D and then over x from A to B (which is about 500000 * 500000 operations) because that would be too slow.\n\n We need to optimize.\n\n Another idea: instead of iterating over z, we can iterate over x and y and then consider the range of z for which x+y>z. But note z is from C to D, and we require x+y>z, i.e., z < x+y. So for a fixed (x,y), z must be in [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\n Then the total count is the sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} [max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)].\n\n But note: we have to be careful because the inner loop over y for each x would be from B to C, and then we are doing (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) iterations, which can be up to 500000*500000, which is 25e10, too many.\n\n We need to reverse the problem.\n\n Let F(z) = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z.\n\n Then total_triangles = sum_{z=C}^{D} F(z)\n\n How to compute F(z) for a fixed z?\n\n We have: x in [A, B], y in [B, C]. Condition: x+y > z.\n\n We can break the condition: y > z - x.\n\n Since y is at least B and at most C, we need to count the y in [B, C] such that y > max(B, z-x) [but note: the condition is y > z-x, but since y>=B, we can write y >= max(B, floor(z-x)+1) ].\n\n Actually, the condition is y >= max(B, z-x+1) and y <= C.\n\n Then F(z) = sum_{x=A}^{B} [ max(0, C - max(B, z-x+1) + 1) ]\n\n But note: if z-x+1 <= B, then the lower bound for y is B, so the count is C - B + 1.\n        else, the lower bound is z-x+1, so the count is max(0, C - (z-x+1) + 1) = max(0, C - z + x).\n\n So we can split the x range:\n\n   Case 1: z-x+1 <= B  => x >= z - B + 1   (then the lower bound for y is B)\n   Case 2: x < z - B + 1  => then the lower bound is z-x+1.\n\n However, note: we must also ensure that the lower bound does not exceed C.\n\n Alternatively, we can use two parts:\n\n   For x in [max(A, z - C + 1), B]: Here, even if we set y = C, we have x+y <= x+C, and we require x+y>z -> x+C>=z+1? Not exactly, but note: if x is large enough, then the condition is automatically satisfied for all y? Actually, no: the condition is x+y>z. The worst-case y is C, so if x+C <= z, then no y will work. But wait, our condition above was based on the lower bound.\n\n Actually, let's define:\n\n   Condition: x+y > z   <=> y > z - x.\n\n   For a fixed x, y must be at least max(B, z-x+1) and at most C.\n\n   The number of y for fixed x is: max(0, C - max(B-1, z-x))  [because the smallest integer y satisfying y>z-x is floor(z-x)+1, but if floor(z-x)+1 <= B then we use B]\n\n   Actually, the smallest integer y satisfying y > z-x is y0 = floor(z-x) + 1. Then if y0 <= B, then we use y from B to C; else, we use y from y0 to C.\n\n   So the count is: \n        if y0 <= C:\n            if y0 <= B:\n                count = C - B + 1\n            else:\n                count = C - y0 + 1\n        else:\n            count = 0\n\n   But note: y0 = floor(z-x) + 1, and since x,y,z are integers, we can write y0 = z - x + 1 (if we consider integer floors, then for real numbers floor(z-x) is the integer part, but here z,x are integers, so floor(z-x)=z-x).\n\n   Therefore, y0 = z - x + 1.\n\n   So for fixed x and z, the condition is that y must be at least max(B, z-x+1) and at most C.\n\n   Then the count for x is: \n        L = max(B, z-x+1)\n        if L > C: 0\n        else: C - L + 1\n\n   Then F(z) = sum_{x=A}^{B} max(0, C - max(B, z-x+1) + 1)\n\n Now, we can try to compute F(z) without iterating over all x by using a two-pointer or by precomputing prefix sums.\n\n Notice that as z increases, the condition for each x becomes harder (the required y is larger). \n\n But note: we have to compute F(z) for each z from C to D. The total number of z is (D-C+1) which can be up to 500000, and for each z we iterate over x from A to B (which is (B-A+1) ~ 500000) so total operations ~ 500000*500000 which is 25e10, which is too slow in Python.\n\n We need to find a better way.\n\n Let's change the order: Instead of fixing z and then x, fix x and then consider the range of z for which the condition holds.\n\n For a fixed x, we require that for a pair (x,y) (with y in [B, C]) we have x+y>z, i.e., z < x+y.\n\n Then for a fixed x and y, z can be from C to min(D, x+y-1).\n\n Then the total number of triangles is the sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)\n\n But now, we are still iterating over x and y, which is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be up to 500000*500000, which is 25e10, too slow.\n\n We need to optimize the double summation.\n\n We can fix x and then the inner sum is over y from B to C, and we are summing for each y: max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)\n\n Let T = x+y-1. Then for each y, we are counting the number of z from C to min(D, T).\n\n The count for a fixed (x,y) is: max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)\n\n Then we can write:\n\n   total = 0\n   for x from A to B:\n        for y from B to C:\n            T = x+y-1\n            low_z = C\n            high_z = min(D, T)\n            if high_z < C:\n                add 0\n            else:\n                add (high_z - C + 1)\n\n But again, the inner loop is (C-B+1) which is too large.\n\n We can try to fix x and then express the inner sum in terms of y.\n\n For fixed x, we have:\n\n   For a given y, the condition is that z must be <= x+y-1, and z>=C.\n\n   The contribution is: max(0, min(x+y-1, D) - C + 1)\n\n   We can break the y range:\n\n        Let y_min = B, y_max = C.\n\n        The condition min(x+y-1, D) >= C is automatically satisfied if x+y-1 >= C (i.e., y >= C - x + 1). But note, y starts from B, and if B >= C-x+1, then we start from B. Otherwise, we start from max(B, C-x+1).\n\n        Then, for y from max(B, C-x+1) to min(C, D-x) [because when y <= D-x, then min(x+y-1, D) = x+y-1; and when y > D-x, then min(x+y-1, D) = D]? \n\n        Actually, note: we require z to be at most min(D, x+y-1). But the condition for the existence of any z is that x+y-1 >= C (so that there is at least one z: from C to min(D, x+y-1)).\n\n        Alternatively, we can split the y range into two parts:\n\n          Part 1: y from y0 to y1, where y0 = max(B, C-x+1) and y1 = min(C, D-x) [because if y <= D-x, then x+y-1 <= D, so we use x+y-1; if y > D-x, then we use D].\n\n          Then for y in [y0, y1]:\n               contribution = (x+y-1 - C + 1) = x+y - C\n\n          For y from y1+1 to C (if any):\n               contribution = (D - C + 1)   [constant]\n\n        But wait, is that correct? Actually, for y from y0 to y1, the condition is that x+y-1 <= D, so the upper bound for z is x+y-1, so the count is (x+y-1 - C + 1) = x+y - C.\n\n        For y from y1+1 to C: the condition is that x+y-1 >= D (because y>D-x => x+y-1 >= D) so the upper bound is D, so the count is (D - C + 1).\n\n        However, note: we must also ensure that y0 <= y1. Also, if y0 > C, then no y satisfies the condition.\n\n        Steps for fixed x:\n\n          Let y_low = max(B, C-x+1)\n          Let y_high1 = min(C, D-x)   [if x+y_high1-1 <= D, then we use the first part for y_high1]\n\n          Then the valid y range is from y_low to C.\n\n          Then the total for x is:\n\n            part1 = 0\n            part2 = 0\n\n            If y_low <= y_high1:\n                part1 = sum_{y=y_low}^{y_high1} (x+y - C)\n            Then for y from y_high1+1 to C (if any), part2 = (C - y_high1) * (D - C + 1)\n\n          Then total += part1 + part2\n\n        Now, how to compute part1 quickly?\n\n            part1 = (number of terms) * x - C*(number of terms) + (sum of y from y_low to y_high1)\n\n            The number of terms = y_high1 - y_low + 1\n\n            The sum of y from y_low to y_high1 = (y_low + y_high1) * (y_high1 - y_low + 1) // 2\n\n            So part1 = (y_high1 - y_low + 1)*x - C*(y_high1 - y_low + 1) + (y_low + y_high1) * (y_high1 - y_low + 1) // 2\n\n        Then we do for each x from A to B.\n\n        The total operation for x is O(1) per x, so overall O(B-A+1) which is acceptable (at most 500000).\n\n        But note: we must consider that sometimes y_low > y_high1, then part1=0 and part2 = (C - y_high1) * (D-C+1) but note: if y_low > y_high1, then the entire y range [y_low, C] falls in the second part? Actually, no: we defined y_high1 = min(C, D-x). Then if y_low > y_high1, then the entire valid y range is from y_low to C, and in that case, note that for y from y_low to C, we have x+y-1 >= D (because y_high1 = D-x, so y_low > D-x, then x+y-1 > D-1, so we use the constant part).\n\n        However, note: we defined y_low = max(B, C-x+1). So if y_low > y_high1, then the entire range of y is in the second part.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            Let y_start = max(B, C-x+1)\n            Let y_end = C\n\n            Let y_break = min(y_end, D-x)   [because for y <= D-x, we use x+y-1; for y > D-x, we use D]\n\n            Then:\n                part1: y from y_start to y_break (if any)\n                part2: y from y_break+1 to y_end (if any)\n\n        Then:\n\n            part1 = 0\n            if y_start <= y_break:\n                n1 = y_break - y_start + 1\n                sum_y = (y_start + y_break) * n1 // 2\n                part1 = n1 * x - n1 * C + sum_y\n\n            part2 = 0\n            if y_break+1 <= y_end:\n                n2 = y_end - y_break\n                part2 = n2 * (D - C + 1)\n\n            total += part1 + part2\n\n        But note: we must check that the entire range [y_start, y_end] is considered.\n\n        Example: Input \"1 2 3 4\"\n\n        Then A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\n        We need to count the triangles: (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4) -> 4.\n\n        Let's try x=1:\n            y_start = max(2, 3-1+1) = max(2,3) = 3\n            y_break = min(3, 4-1) = min(3,3)=3\n            Then part1: y from 3 to 3: \n                n1=1, sum_y=3\n                part1 = 1*1 - 1*3 + 3 = 1 - 3 + 3 = 1\n            part2: none (since y_break+1=4, which is >3, so part2=0)\n            So for x=1, we get 1.\n\n        x=2:\n            y_start = max(2, 3-2+1)=max(2,2)=2\n            y_break = min(3, 4-2)=min(3,2)=2\n            Then part1: y from 2 to 2:\n                n1=1, sum_y=2\n                part1 = 1*2 - 1*3 + 2 = 2-3+2=1\n            part2: y from 3 to 3: \n                n2=1, part2=1*(4-3+1)=1*2=2\n            So for x=2, we get 1+2=3.\n\n        Total = 1 (from x=1) + 3 (from x=2) = 4. Correct.\n\n        Now, let's test the second example: \"1 2 2 5\"\n\n        Then A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n        Expected output: 3.\n\n        Triangles: (1,2,2), (2,2,2), (2,2,3) -> wait, but note: the condition is A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D. \n        Here, C=2, so z from 2 to 5, but y is from B=2 to C=2, so y=2 only.\n\n        Then x can be 1 or 2.\n\n        x=1: y=2, then z must satisfy 1+2>z -> z<3, so z from 2 to min(5,2) (wait: min(D, x+y-1)=min(5, 1+2-1)=min(5,2)=2. Then z from 2 to 2: one value.\n\n        x=2: y=2, then z must satisfy 2+2>z -> z<4, so z from 2 to 3 (because min(5,3)=3). So z=2,3 -> two values.\n\n        Total = 1+2 = 3.\n\n        Now, let's compute with our method:\n\n        x=1:\n            y_start = max(2, 2-1+1)=max(2,2)=2\n            y_break = min(2, 5-1)=min(2,4)=2\n            part1: y from 2 to 2: \n                n1=1, sum_y=2\n                part1 = 1*1 - 1*2 + 2 = 1-2+2=1\n            part2: none (since y_break+1=3>2) -> 0\n            so 1.\n\n        x=2:\n            y_start = max(2, 2-2+1)=max(2,1)=2\n            y_break = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n            part1: y from 2 to 2: \n                n1=1, sum_y=2\n                part1 = 1*2 - 1*2 + 2 = 2-2+2=2\n            part2: none -> 0\n            so 2.\n\n        Total = 1+2 = 3. Correct.\n\n        Now, the third example: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\"\n\n        Only one triangle: (500000,500000,500000)\n\n        Compute:\n\n        x=500000, y_start = max(500000,500000-500000+1)=max(500000,1)=500000\n        y_break = min(500000,500000-500000)=min(500000,0)=0 -> wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\n        Correction: y_break = min(C, D-x) = min(500000, 500000-500000)=min(500000,0)=0.\n\n        Then part1: y from y_start=500000 to y_break=0 -> no y (since 500000>0) so part1=0.\n        Then part2: from y_break+1=1 to C=500000, which is 500000 terms, each term adds (D-C+1)= (500000-500000+1)=1, so part2=500000.\n\n        But that gives 500000, which is not 1.\n\n        What's wrong?\n\n        Let me check the condition for x=500000, y in [500000,500000] (only one y).\n\n        The condition: z must be from 500000 to min(500000, 500000+500000-1)=min(500000,999999)=500000.\n\n        So only one z.\n\n        In our method for x=500000:\n\n            y_start = max(500000, 500000-500000+1)=max(500000,1)=500000\n            y_break = min(500000, 500000-500000)=min(500000,0)=0\n\n            Then we consider part2: y from 1 to 500000, but wait: our y is fixed to 500000. We should only consider y=500000.\n\n        The mistake: our y range is from B to C, which is [500000,500000]. So we should only consider y=500000.\n\n        The error is that in the definition of y_break, we did D-x, but note: the condition for part1 is that the upper bound for z is x+y-1, and for part2 it is D.\n\n        However, note that for y=500000, the condition for part1 is: if y <= D-x (i.e., 500000 <= 500000-500000=0) -> false, so we use part2.\n\n        But wait, the condition for part1 is that the upper bound is x+y-1, and we use part1 only when x+y-1 <= D. However, in our definition, we set y_break = min(C, D-x) to split the y range. \n\n        Actually, the splitting condition was:\n\n          For y <= D-x: then x+y-1 <= D, so we use the formula x+y-C.\n          For y > D-x: then x+y-1 > D, so we use D-C+1.\n\n        But note: D-x might be negative, so we must be cautious.\n\n        Let me redefine the splitting point: we want to split the y range [y_start, C] into two parts:\n\n          Part1: y such that x+y-1 <= D, i.e., y <= D-x\n          Part2: y such that x+y-1 > D, i.e., y > D-x\n\n        However, if D-x < y_start, then no y in the first part, and all y in [y_start, C] are in the second part.\n\n        But note: y_start = max(B, C-x+1). In the example, y_start=500000 and D-x=0, so indeed no y in the first part.\n\n        Then part2: y from max(y_start, D-x+1) to C? Actually, the condition for part2 is y > D-x, i.e., y >= floor(D-x)+1? But since integers, y >= D-x+1.\n\n        So for x=500000, D-x=0, then part2: y from 1 to 500000, but wait, our y is only from 500000 to 500000. So we must restrict the part2 to [max(y_start, D-x+1), C]?\n\n        Actually, the splitting is:\n\n          Part1: y in [y_start, min(C, D-x)]   [note: D-x might be less than y_start]\n          Part2: y in [max(y_start, D-x+1), C]\n\n        Then for x=500000, y_start=500000, D-x=0, so part2: y from max(500000, 1) to 500000 -> [500000,500000]\n\n        Then part2 = (C - y_break2 + 1) * (D-C+1) but wait, no: in part2, for each y we add (D-C+1). Actually, the condition for part2 is that the number of z is (D-C+1). But note: the condition for part2 is that x+y-1>D, so the upper bound for z is D, and the lower bound is C, so the count is (D-C+1). \n\n        So for x=500000, part2: only y=500000, so we add (D-C+1)=1.\n\n        But wait, in our previous code, we computed part2 as (number of y in [y_break+1, C]) * (D-C+1). But note: we defined y_break as min(C, D-x) for part1, and then part2 is from y_break+1 to C. However, we changed the splitting condition.\n\n        Let me reexamine the two cases:\n\n          Case1: y <= D-x  -> then the condition for z is z <= x+y-1, so the number of z is (x+y-1 - C + 1) = x+y-C.\n          Case2: y > D-x   -> then the condition for z is z <= D, so the number of z is (D-C+1).\n\n        But note: the condition y <= D-x is equivalent to y <= D-x. However, we must also ensure that y>=y_start and y<=C.\n\n        So the correct splitting is:\n\n          Let y_low_bound = max(B, C-x+1)   [minimum y that can form a triangle with this x? Actually, we require x+y>z_min=C, so y>C-x? No: the condition is x+y>z, and the smallest z is C, so we require x+y>C, i.e., y>C-x. But since y is integer, y>=floor(C-x)+1? Actually, y>=C-x+1 is the minimal y to have at least one z (if we ignore the upper bound D). \n\n        However, note: we are considering all z from C to D. The condition for a fixed (x,y) is that there exists at least one z in [C, D] such that z < x+y. The minimal requirement is that x+y > D? No, the minimal requirement is that x+y > C (because the smallest z is C). But wait, the condition is x+y>z for the chosen z, and we are free to choose any z from C to D. So the condition is that the largest z (which is D) must be less than x+y? Actually, no: the triangle condition is for the chosen triplet. But note: the problem requires that the triplet (x,y,z) satisfies A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D and x+y>z. \n\n        However, note: we are counting the triplets. For fixed (x,y) we require that there exists a z in [C, D] such that z < x+y. The existence condition is: there exists z in [C, D] with z < x+y, i.e., x+y > C (because if x+y <= C, then even the smallest z (which is C) is >= x+y, so no z works). But wait, the condition for a fixed (x,y) is that the entire range of z must be considered? Actually, no: the condition is that we choose a z from [C, D] and we require x+y>z. So the condition for (x,y) to form a triangle is that x+y > D? No: we require that there is at least one z in [C, D] such that z < x+y. The smallest z is C, so if x+y <= C, then no z works. The largest z is D, so if x+y > D, then all z in [C, D] work. If C < x+y <= D, then the z must be from C to floor(x+y-1) (which is x+y-1) but note: we are allowed to choose any z from C to D, but only those < x+y.\n\n        Actually, the condition for (x,y) is that x+y > C (otherwise no z) and then the number of z is max(0, min(x+y-1, D) - C + 1).\n\n        So the splitting by y (for fixed x) is:\n\n          Condition: y must be at least y0 = max(B, C-x+1) [because if y < C-x+1, then x+y <= C, which fails]\n\n          Then, for y from y0 to C:\n\n            Let T = x+y-1\n\n            Then the number of z is: \n                If T < C: 0 (but we already ensured y>=C-x+1, so T=x+y-1>=x+(C-x+1)-1 = C, so T>=C) -> so we don't have to worry about T<C.\n\n            Then, the number of z is: \n                If T >= D: then all z from C to D (count = D-C+1)\n                Else: T from C to D (count = T-C+1)\n\n        So we can split:\n\n          Condition1: y <= D-x   -> then T = x+y-1 <= D, so count = T-C+1 = x+y-C\n          Condition2: y > D-x    -> then T = x+y-1 > D, so count = D-C+1\n\n        But note: the condition for Condition1 is y <= D-x, and Condition2 is y > D-x.\n\n        However, note: we must have y>=y0. So:\n\n          Part1: y from y0 to min(C, D-x)   [if D-x >= y0]\n          Part2: y from max(y0, D-x+1) to C\n\n        Then for x=500000, y0 = max(500000, 500000-500000+1)=max(500000,1)=500000\n        Then Part1: y from 500000 to min(500000, 0) -> no y, so part1=0.\n        Part2: y from max(500000, 0+1)=500000 to 500000: one y, and then count = 1*(D-C+1)=1.\n\n        Now, how to compute part1 and part2?\n\n        For fixed x:\n\n          y_low_bound = max(B, C-x+1)\n\n          Let y1 = min(C, D-x)   [if D-x >= y_low_bound, then part1 runs from y_low_bound to y1]\n          Let y2_low = max(y_low_bound, D-x+1)   [for part2: y from y2_low to C]\n\n          Then:\n\n          part1 = 0\n          if y1 >= y_low_bound:\n              n1 = y1 - y_low_bound + 1\n              # Sum_{y=y_low_bound}^{y1} (x+y-C)\n              # = n1*x - n1*C + (sum of y from y_low_bound to y1)\n              sum_y1 = (y_low_bound + y1) * n1 // 2\n              part1 = n1*x - n1*C + sum_y1\n\n          part2 = 0\n          if y2_low <= C:\n              n2 = C - y2_low + 1\n              part2 = n2 * (D - C + 1)\n\n          total += part1 + part2\n\n        Now, test with the third example: x=500000, y_low_bound=500000, y1=min(500000,0)=0, so part1=0.\n        Then y2_low = max(500000, 0+1)=500000, n2=1, part2=1*(500000-500000+1)=1.
