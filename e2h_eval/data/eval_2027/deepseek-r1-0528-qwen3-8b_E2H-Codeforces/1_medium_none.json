    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting from i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring is the border of that inner rectangle, and it has a width of 1 cell.\n\n The number of cells in the i-th ring is the perimeter of the inner rectangle (but note: the inner rectangle must be at least 1x1 to have a border? Actually, the problem states that k is limited by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so we don't get negative or zero dimensions.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n\n For the first ring (k=1):\n   inner rectangle: w0 = 3, h0 = 3.\n   The ring is the border of this 3x3. But note: the border of a 3x3 is the outermost layer. How many cells?\n     Top and bottom: 3 cells each, left and right: but the corners are shared. So total = 3*4 - 4 = 8? \n     Alternatively, we can think: \n        top row: 3, bottom row: 3, then the sides without the corners: left and right for the middle row: 1 on the left and 1 on the right -> 3+3+1+1 = 8.\n\n In general, for an inner rectangle of size a x b (where a = w - 4*(i-1) and b = h - 4*(i-1)), the number of cells in the ring is:\n   If a <= 0 or b <= 0, then 0 (but our k is chosen so that we don't get negative? Actually, the problem says k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4) so the inner rectangle for the last ring must have positive dimensions).\n\n However, note: the formula for the border of an a x b grid (with a>=1, b>=1) is: \n   If a==1 and b==1: then 1 (a single cell) but wait, the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate. For a 1x1? Actually, the plate must be at least 3x3 because w,h>=3.\n\n But let's derive the formula:\n\n   The ring consists of:\n     Top: b cells\n     Bottom: b cells\n     Left: a - 2 cells (because the top and bottom rows' left and right ends are already counted)\n     Right: a - 2 cells\n\n   So total = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, wait: what if a==1? Then we subtract 4 from 2*1+2*b, which would be 2+2b-4 = 2b-2. But if a==1 and b==1: then 2*1+2*1-4 = 0, which is incorrect.\n\n Let's check the example: 3x3 -> a=3, b=3: 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n But consider a 5x5 (second ring for a plate that is at least 5x5). The second ring is the border of a 5x5? Actually, no: the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle that is 5x5? Wait, no: the first ring uses the entire 3x3? Actually, the problem states:\n\n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1))×(h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n For the first ring: i=1 -> w0 = w - 0 = w, h0 = h - 0 = h.\n\n Actually, wait: the example says the first ring goes along the edge. Then the next ring is 2 cells away. So the first ring is for the whole plate (w x h). Then the second ring is for the inner rectangle of size (w-4) x (h-4).\n\n So the second ring: \n   inner rectangle: (w-4) x (h-4). Then the ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n Therefore, the second ring has:\n   a = w-4, b = h-4.\n\n And the number of cells for the second ring: 2*(w-4) + 2*(h-4) - 4? \n\n But wait, let me recalc: \n   For a rectangle of size a x b, the border is:\n      top: b\n      bottom: b\n      left: a-2 (because the two ends of the top and bottom are already counted)\n      right: a-2\n   So total = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2a + 2b - 4.\n\n Now, let's test with the example: \"7 9 2\"\n   First ring: i=1 -> a0=w=7, b0=h=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=28. Then second ring: i=2 -> a1=7-4=3, b1=9-4=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4=12. Total gilded = 28+12=40.\n\n But the example input \"7 9 2\" gives output 40.\n\n However, wait: the example input \"7 9 1\" gives 28, which matches the first ring.\n\n But note: the problem says there are k rings. So we need to sum the rings from i=1 to i=k.\n\n However, the example input \"3 3 1\" gives 8.\n\n But wait, the problem says the first ring is the edge of the plate. Then the next ring would be 2 cells away, so the inner rectangle for the second ring is (3-4) which is negative. Hence, k is limited so that we don't go below.\n\n So the approach:\n\n   Read w, h, k.\n\n   total = 0\n   for i from 1 to k:\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        # But if a <= 0 or b <= 0, then we break? Actually, the problem states k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) so we won't get negative, but we still need to check because if the inner rectangle becomes too small, then the ring might not exist?\n\n        However, note: even if a>=1 and b>=1, the formula 2*a+2*b-4 works for a>=1 and b>=1? \n        What if a=1 and b>=1? Then the top and bottom rows are both of length b, and then the sides: we subtract 2 from a, so a-2 = -1 -> negative? \n\n        Let me clarify: the ring is the border. For a 1x1: \n          There is only one cell, but the border should be that one cell? But according to the problem, the first ring is the edge of the plate. Our plate is at least 3x3, so we don't get 1x1 for the first ring.\n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1))×(h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n        The inner rectangle must be at least 1x1. The border of a 1x1 is the entire cell, so 1 cell. But the formula 2*a+2*b-4 for a=1, b=1: 2+2-4=0 -> incorrect.\n\n        So we must adjust: the formula for the border of an a x b grid (with a>=1, b>=1) is:\n\n          If a==1 and b==1: then 1.\n          Otherwise, the border is 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n        But note: if a==1 and b>1, then we have a grid of 1 row and b columns. The border is the entire grid? Actually, the border is the entire grid because the grid has only one row, so the top and bottom are the same row, and the sides are the entire row. However, wait: the definition says \"bordering cells\" meaning the outer layer. In a 1x2 grid, the border is the entire grid (both cells). Similarly, 1x3: the entire grid.\n\n        Actually, the border of a grid is defined as the set of cells that are in the first row, last row, first column, or last column.\n\n        So for a 1x1: 1 cell.\n        For a 1x2: 2 cells.\n        For a 1x3: 3 cells.\n\n        In general, the border of a grid of size a x b is:\n          top row: b cells\n          bottom row: b cells\n          left column: a-2 cells (if a>=2, then the two ends are already counted in the top and bottom; if a==1, then the left column is the entire column which is 1 cell, but wait: if a==1, then we've already counted the entire top and bottom which are the same row, so we shouldn't count the left column again? Actually, the standard way to compute the border is:\n\n          total_border = 2*a + 2*b - 4   [when a>=2 and b>=2]\n\n          But when a==1, then the entire grid is the border, so it's b.\n          Similarly, when b==1, then the entire grid is the border, so it's a.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the border is the grid minus the inner part (if any). The inner part is (a-2) x (b-2) if a>=2 and b>=2, so the border is a*b - (a-2)*(b-2) if a>=2 and b>=2.\n\n        But for a=1, b=any: the inner part doesn't exist (since we cannot have negative), so the border is a*b.\n\n        Actually, the formula for the border of a grid (without assuming minimum 2x2) is:\n\n          border = a * b - max(0, (a-2)) * max(0, (b-2))\n\n        However, wait: if a==1 and b==1: then 1 - 0 = 1.\n        If a==1 and b==2: then 2 - 0 = 2.\n        If a==2 and b==2: then 4 - 0 = 4? But wait, the border of a 2x2 is 4 (each cell is a border) -> correct.\n        If a==3 and b==3: then 9 - 1*1 = 8 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, the inner part for a grid a x b is (a-2) x (b-2) only if a>=2 and b>=2. If either is less than 2, then there is no inner part. So:\n\n          border = a * b - ( (a-2) * (b-2) )   [but if (a-2) < 0, then we consider 0 for the inner part? Actually, we can do: inner_area = max(0, a-2) * max(0, b-2)\n\n        Then border = a*b - max(0, a-2)*max(0, b-2)\n\n        This formula works for any a,b >= 1.\n\n        Let me test:\n          a=1, b=1: 1 - 0 = 1 -> correct.\n          a=1, b=2: 2 - 0 = 2 -> correct.\n          a=2, b=2: 4 - 0 = 4 -> correct.\n          a=3, b=3: 9 - 1*1 = 8 -> correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the original formula: \n          If a>=2 and b>=2: 2*a+2*b-4\n          Else: a*b\n\n        But note: the problem says the i-th ring uses the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). \n\n        However, we must note that the inner rectangle must have non-negative dimensions, and the problem constrains k so that the inner rectangle for the last ring has positive dimensions (at least 1x1).\n\n        So we can use:\n\n          a = w - 4*(i-1)\n          b = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n          if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n              # But k is constrained so that we shouldn't get here, but just in case, we break or skip.\n              break\n\n          else:\n              ring_cells = a * b - max(0, a-2) * max(0, b-2)\n\n        But wait: what if a=0 or negative? Then we break.\n\n        However, the problem says k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So for example, if w=3, h=3, then min(w,h)=3, floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> k<=1. Then we only do i=1: a=3, b=3 -> valid.\n\n        Example: w=7, h=9, k=2: \n          i=1: a=7, b=9 -> ring1 = 7*9 - (5)*(7) = 63 - 35 = 28.\n          i=2: a=3, b=5 -> ring2 = 3*5 - (1)*(3) = 15 - 3 = 12.\n\n        Then total = 28+12 = 40.\n\n        But wait, the example input \"7 9 1\" gives 28, which is correct.\n\n        However, let's compare with the previous method for the second ring (a=3, b=5): \n          Using the alternative formula: 2*a+2*b-4 = 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4=12 -> same.\n\n        Why? Because for a=3, b=5: \n          Original formula: 2*3+2*5-4 = 12, and the other formula: 3*5 - (3-2)*(5-2) = 15 - 1*3 = 12.\n\n        Now, why does the alternative formula work for a=3, b=5? \n          The grid is 3x5. The inner part is (3-2)x(5-2)=1x3, so the border is 15-3=12.\n\n        But also, the border can be computed as:\n          top: 5\n          bottom: 5\n          left: 3-2 = 1 (the middle column)\n          right: 3-2 = 1\n          total = 5+5+1+1 = 12.\n\n        So both formulas are equivalent.\n\n        Therefore, we can use either:\n\n          Option 1: \n            ring_cells = 2*a + 2*b - 4   [but this only works for a>=2 and b>=2]\n\n          Option 2: \n            ring_cells = a*b - max(0, a-2)*max(0, b-2)\n\n        Since the problem states that k is chosen such that the inner rectangle has positive dimensions (at least 1x1), and the constraint is that k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), then for the i-th ring, a = w-4*(i-1) and b = h-4*(i-1) must be at least 1. However, note that the formula for the border using subtraction of the inner area requires the inner rectangle to be non-negative, and the original formula (2a+2b-4) requires a>=2 and b>=2.\n\n        But wait, what if a=1 and b>=1? Then the inner area is (a-2)*max(0, b-2) = (-1)*max(0, b-2) -> negative? So we use max(0, ...) to avoid negative. Actually, the inner area is only subtracted if a>=2 and b>=2.\n\n        However, if a=1 and b=1, then inner area = 0, so border=1*1-0=1.\n        If a=1 and b=2, then inner area = 0, so border=2-0=2.\n\n        So the second formula is safe.\n\n        But note: the condition for the ring to exist is that the inner rectangle must have at least one cell. The problem says k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), so the last ring's inner rectangle has min_dimension = min(w-4*(k-1), h-4*(k-1)) >= 1. So we don't have to worry about negative a or b.\n\n        However, we must also note that the ring might be defined for a rectangle that is 1x1, 1x2, etc., and the second formula handles that.\n\n        Therefore, we can use:\n\n          total = 0\n          for i in range(1, k+1):\n              a = w - 4*(i-1)\n              b = h - 4*(i-1)\n              # Since k is bounded, a and b are at least 1, but we still need to compute the border correctly.\n\n              inner_a = max(0, a-2)\n              inner_b = max(0, b-2)\n              cells_in_ring = a * b - inner_a * inner_b\n\n              total += cells_in_ring\n\n        Then print(total)\n\n        Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 3 1\"\n          i=1: a=3, b=3 -> inner_a=1, inner_b=1 -> 9-1=8 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n          i=1: a=7, b=9 -> inner_a=5, inner_b=7 -> 63 - 35 = 28 -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n          i=1: 28\n          i=2: a=3, b=5 -> inner_a=1, inner_b=3 -> 15-3=12 -> total=40 -> correct.\n\n        Example 4: Consider a 5x5 plate and k=1: \n          a=5, b=5 -> 25 - (3*3)=25-9=16.\n\n        Check: the first ring of a 5x5 plate: \n          top: 5, bottom:5, left:3, right:3 -> 5+5+3+3 = 16 -> correct.\n\n        Example 5: a 4x4 plate and k=1: \n          a=4, b=4 -> 16 - (2*2)=16-4=12.\n\n        Check: 4x4 plate, the border: \n          top:4, bottom:4, left:2, right:2 -> 4+4+2+2=12 -> correct.\n\n        Example 6: a 2x2 plate? But the input constraints say w,h>=3, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the plate is at least 3x3 and k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So we don't have to handle cases where the inner rectangle becomes 0 or negative.\n\n        But wait, what if the inner rectangle becomes 0? For example, if w=3, h=3, k=2: \n          i=1: a=3, b=3 -> valid.\n          i=2: a=3-4=-1, b=3-4=-1 -> invalid. But the problem says k<= floor((min(3,3)+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1, so k=2 is not provided.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Code:\n\n        Read the input line, split into three integers: w, h, k.\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            # But wait: the problem says the i-th ring uses (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), so for i=1: subtract 0, i=2: subtract 4, etc.\n            # However, in our loop we are going from i=0 to k-1. Then we subtract 4*i. But the problem says the first ring subtracts 0, second subtracts 4, so we should use:\n\n            # Actually, the problem: i-th ring: subtract 4*(i-1). So for the first ring (i=1): subtract 0, for the second (i=2): subtract 4, etc.\n\n            # We can do:\n\n            # Option 1: loop from i=1 to k, then use a = w - 4*(i-1) and b = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n            # Or, we can index from 0 to k-1 and use j = i+1, then a = w - 4*i, but wait: for i=0, then a = w, then for i=1, a=w-4, which corresponds to the second ring.\n\n            # But the problem: the first ring is i=1, so we want the first ring to be i=0 in zero-indexed? \n\n            # Actually, the problem states: the first ring (i=1) uses the original plate. So we can do:\n\n            # for i in range(k):\n            #   a = w - 4*i\n            #   b = h - 4*i\n\n            # But then the first ring (i=0) is w x h, the second ring (i=1) is (w-4)x(h-4). That matches.\n\n            # However, wait: the problem says the i-th ring uses (w - 4*(i-1)), so for the first ring (i=1) we use (w - 0) = w, for the second ring (i=2) we use (w-4). \n\n            # So if we use i from 0 to k-1, then the ring index is i+1, and the dimensions are (w - 4*i) and (h - 4*i). \n\n            # But note: the problem says the first ring is the one that goes along the edge, which is the outermost. Then the second ring is 2 cells away, so the inner rectangle is reduced by 4 (because we remove one cell from each side: top, bottom, left, right).\n\n            # So the above is consistent.\n\n            # Therefore, we can use:\n\n            #   a = w - 4*i\n            #   b = h - 4*i\n\n            # But note: the problem's i-th ring is the (i+1)-th ring in our zero-indexed loop. But we are summing k rings.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            #   for i in range(k):\n            #       a = w - 4*i\n            #       b = h - 4*i\n\n            # However, wait: the example \"3 3 1\": \n            #   i=0: a=3, b=3 -> 3*3 - (max(0,1))*(max(0,1)) = 9-1=8 -> correct.\n\n            # But the problem says the first ring (i=1) uses the entire plate. So we are matching.\n\n            # However, the problem says the second ring uses 4*(2-1)=4, so for the second ring we subtract 4. But in our loop, the second ring is i=1 (if k>=2) and we subtract 4*1=4, which is correct.\n\n            # So we can use:\n\n            #   for i in range(k):\n            #       a = w - 4*i\n            #       b = h - 4*i\n            #       inner_a = max(0, a-2)\n            #       inner_b = max(0, b-2)\n            #       cells_in_ring = a * b - inner_a * inner_b\n            #       total += cells_in_ring\n\n            # But wait, the problem states the i-th ring (for i from 1 to k) uses (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n            # In our loop, for i=0 (first ring) we use (w-0, h-0) -> correct.\n            # for i=1 (second ring) we use (w-4, h-4) -> correct.\n\n            # So the loop variable i (from 0 to k-1) corresponds to the (i+1)-th ring, and we subtract 4*i, which is 4*(i) = 4*( (i+1)-1 ) -> exactly.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            # If a or b becomes negative, we break. But the problem constraints ensure they are positive, but let's be safe.\n            if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n                # According to the problem, k is bounded, so we shouldn't get here, but just in case.\n                # We break out of the loop since subsequent rings will be even smaller.\n                break\n            inner_a = max(0, a-2)\n            inner_b = max(0, b-2)\n            total += a * b - inner_a * inner_b\n\n        print(total)\n\n        However, note: the problem says k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So if we break, we break early. But the input k might be larger than the maximum allowed? The problem says k is at most that value, so we assume valid input.\n\n        But the problem says: \"1 ≤ k ≤ floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\"\n\n        So we can rely on the input k being within the bounds. However, if the input k is larger, we break and then the total will be less. But the problem says k is in that range.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                # But note: the problem requires positive dimensions, and the constraint ensures we don't hit this, but if we do, we break.\n                break\n            ...\n\n        But the problem says the constraint, so we assume k is valid.\n\n        However, let's stick to the above.\n\n        But wait: the example \"3 3 1\" is correct, \"7 9 1\", \"7 9 2\" are correct.\n\n        One more example: \"5 5 1\" -> 16, \"5 5 2\": \n          i=0: a=5, b=5 -> 25 - 9 = 16\n          i=1: a=1, b=1 -> 1 - 0 = 1 -> total=17.\n\n        But wait, the second ring: \n          The inner rectangle is (5-4)=1x1. The border of a 1x1 is 1. So total 16+1=17.\n\n        However, the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. In a 5x5 plate, the second ring is the border of the inner 1x1? Then that border is the entire cell. \n\n        But the problem says the rings are drawn from the edge inward. The first ring is the outermost, then the second ring is the next one (which is the innermost part of the remaining). In a 5x5, after removing the outermost ring (which is 16 cells), the remaining is a 3x3 in the center? Actually, no: the second ring is defined as the border of the inner rectangle of size (5-4)=1x1. So yes, the second ring is the entire 1x1.\n\n        So 17 is correct.\n\n        But wait, the example input constraint for k: \n          k <= floor((min(5,5)+1)/4) = floor(6/4)=1. So k=2 is not allowed for a 5x5 plate.\n\n        Therefore, the example \"5 5 2\" would not be provided because k must be <=1.\n\n        So the problem's constraint on k is important.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Read w, h, k.\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                # We break because the next rings will be even smaller.\n                break\n            inner_a = max(0, a-2)\n            inner_b = max(0, b-2)\n            total += a * b - inner_a * inner_b\n\n        print(total)\n\n        However, note: the condition for breaking is a<1 or b<1. But the problem says k is at most the bound, so we don't expect to break. But if we break, we stop adding rings.\n\n        This code meets the problem requirements.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, so the first ring always exists. And k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So we are safe.\n\n        Let's run the provided examples:\n\n        Example: ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n        For \"3 3 1\":\n          w=3, h=3, k=1\n          i=0: a=3, b=3 -> inner_a=1, inner_b=1 -> 9-1=8 -> output 8.\n\n        For \"7 9 1\":\n          w=7, h=9, k=1\n          i=0: a=7, b=9 -> inner_a=5, inner_b=7 -> 63-35=28 -> output 28.\n\n        For \"7 9 2\":\n          i=0: 28\n          i=1: a=7-4=3, b=9-4=5 -> inner_a=1, inner_b=3 -> 15-3=12 -> total=40 -> output 40.\n\n        All match.\n\n        We'll submit this code.\n\n        Note: There is an alternative formula for the border (when a>=2 and b>=2) as 2*a+2*b-4, but we use the general formula that works for any a,b>=1.\n\n        We choose the general formula because it's simpler and covers the edge cases (like 1x1, 1x2, etc.).\n\n        Let me test with a 1x1 plate? But the problem says w,h>=3, so we don't have to.\n\n        Code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4 * i\n            b = h - 4 * i\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                break\n            # Calculate the inner part: if a>=2 and b>=2, then inner part is (a-2)*(b-2), else 0.\n            inner_a = a - 2\n            inner_b = b - 2\n            if inner_a < 0:\n                inner_a = 0\n            if inner_b < 0:\n                inner_b = 0\n            # But note: inner_a and inner_b can be negative, so we set them to 0 if negative.\n            # Alternatively, we can use max(0, a-2) and max(0, b-2) as above.\n            total += a * b - inner_a * inner_b\n\n        print(total)\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        inner_a = max(0, a-2)\n        inner_b = max(0, b-2)\n\n        I'll use the max function for clarity.\n\n        Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed inside the previous one, starting from the edge of the plate and moving inward. The key insight is to determine the dimensions of each inner rectangle for each ring and then compute the number of cells in its border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into `w x h` cells. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells inward from the previous one. The i-th ring is defined by the inner rectangle of size `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`. The number of cells in each ring's border is calculated as the area of the current rectangle minus the area of the next inner rectangle (if it exists). \n\n2. **Key Insight**: For any rectangle of size `a x b`, the number of cells in its border is given by `a * b - max(0, (a-2)) * max(0, (b-2))`. This formula accounts for the entire rectangle's area minus the inner part that forms the next concentric ring (if the rectangle is large enough).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each ring from 1 to k. For each ring, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. If the dimensions become invalid (negative or zero), break the loop early. Otherwise, calculate the border cells using the formula mentioned above and accumulate the total.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The loop runs k times, and each iteration involves simple arithmetic operations. Since k is constrained by the problem (k ≤ floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)), the complexity is O(k), which is efficient given the constraints (w, h ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(k):\n    a = w - 4 * i\n    b = h - 4 * i\n    if a < 1 or b < 1:\n        break\n    inner_a = max(0, a - 2)\n    inner_b = max(0, b - 2)\n    total += a * b - inner_a * inner_b\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: `total` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the cumulative number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 0 to k-1:\n   - Compute the dimensions of the current inner rectangle (`a` and `b`) by subtracting `4*i` from the original width and height.\n   - Check if the dimensions are positive; if not, break the loop early.\n   - Calculate the inner dimensions for the next ring (if applicable) using `max(0, a-2)` and `max(0, b-2)`.\n   - Add the difference between the current rectangle's area and the next inner rectangle's area to `total`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required number of cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and their borders, ensuring optimal performance and correctness within the problem constraints.",
