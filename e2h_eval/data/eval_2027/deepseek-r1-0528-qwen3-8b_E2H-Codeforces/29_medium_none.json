Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are going to process up to 10^5 queries and the initial string can be up to 10^5 in length.\n The idea: We cannot do naive string replacement (which would be too slow) because each query could replace many digits and the replacements might chain.\n\n However, note that there are only 10 digits (0-9). We can precompute for each digit what transformation it goes through in the entire sequence of queries.\n\n But note: the queries are applied in order. So a digit might be replaced by a string containing other digits, and then those other digits might be subject to subsequent queries.\n\n We need to consider that the transformation is done from left to right, and multiple queries.\n\n Observation:\n Since the total length of all ti in the queries is <= 10^5, we can process the transformations for each digit independently, but the catch is that the queries are sequential and each query replaces one specific digit.\n\n However, note: the problem says the queries are performed in the given order.\n\n Alternate approach: \n Instead of processing the entire string for each query (which would be too slow), we can precompute a transformation for each digit that accounts for all the queries.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We have 10 digits (0-9). We want to know, after applying all queries, what does a digit 'd' become?\n\n 2. But note: a query \"d -> t\" means: whenever we see the digit d, we replace it by the string t. And this happens in the order of the queries.\n\n 3. However, the same digit might appear in the replacement string and then be subject to later queries? Actually, no: because the queries are applied sequentially to the entire string. But when we do a replacement, the new string is the entire string with every occurrence of the digit replaced. Then the next query operates on the entire string (which may now contain more occurrences of the digits being replaced).\n\n 4. But if we think about the entire process, we can model the transformation for each digit as a function that maps a digit to a string (which is the result of replacing that digit by the query's ti, and then recursively applying all subsequent queries to that ti).\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in order, so the first query is applied first, then the second, etc. Therefore, the effect of a query is only applied once, but if the replacement string of an earlier query contains a digit that is the target of a later query, then that digit in the replacement string will be subject to the later query.\n\n But wait: the queries are applied to the entire current string. So if we have:\n\n   s = \"2\"\n   Query1: \"2->34\"\n   Query2: \"3->5\"\n\n Then after Query1: s becomes \"34\", then Query2: we replace every '3' in \"34\" with \"5\", so we get \"54\".\n\n However, if we try to precompute for each digit, we must account for the fact that the transformation for digit '2' in the first query leads to the string \"34\", and then the entire string is processed by the next query. But note: the next query only replaces '3', so we have to break down the transformation for each digit.\n\n We can do:\n\n   Let f_i(d) be the transformation of digit d after i queries.\n\n   But we have 10^5 queries and 10 digits, so we can store for each digit a transformation function that maps the original digit to a string, but we cannot do string operations for each query because the string might become long.\n\n Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming and process the queries backwards.\n\n Insight: We can start from the last query and go backwards, updating the transformation for each digit.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in the given order. But observe:\n\n   Each query is: \"d -> t\", meaning that at the time of the query, we replace every occurrence of d with t.\n\n   Then, after the query, the subsequent queries will operate on the entire string (including the part that was originally t). \n\n   Therefore, if we process the queries from last to first, we can update the transformation for the digit d by considering that the string t (from the query) is then transformed by all the following queries.\n\n   Specifically, for a given query (at step i): \"d -> t\", then the effective transformation for d is: \n        t_transformed = apply_all_queries_after_i_to_string(t)\n\n   But how do we compute \"apply_all_queries_after_i_to_string(t)\"? \n\n   We can precompute a transformation for each digit for the entire set of queries (from the beginning to the end) by processing the queries backwards and updating a mapping for each digit.\n\n   Let's define an array (or list) `mapping` for digits 0-9. Initially, each digit d maps to itself (a string of length 1: the digit d).\n\n   Then, we process the queries from last to first. For a query \"d->t\", we want to update the transformation for d.\n\n   However, note: the query \"d->t\" is applied at a certain time, and then the subsequent queries are applied to the entire string. Therefore, the transformation for d is not just t, but t transformed by all the queries that come after.\n\n   But we don't know the transformation for all digits for the subsequent queries until we process them.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      Let `trans` be a dictionary (or list) for each digit: which initially is the identity (each digit maps to itself).\n\n      Then, for each query from last to first (i.e., from n-1 down to 0):\n\n          Let the query be (d, t) = (query_digit, replacement_string)\n\n          Now, the replacement_string t is composed of digits. Each digit in t has already been transformed by the subsequent queries (because we are processing backwards). So we can break t into its digits, and for each digit c in t, we use the current transformation of c (which includes all queries after the current one) to get the transformed string for that digit.\n\n          Then, the transformation for d becomes the concatenation of the transformed strings for each digit in t.\n\n          But note: the transformation for d is defined as: wherever we see d, we replace it by the transformed version of t (with each character in t transformed by the subsequent queries).\n\n      However, we cannot store the entire transformed string for each digit because the length might be huge (but note the constraint: the total length of all ti is <= 10^5, and we are processing backwards, and we are only storing the transformation for each digit as a string? Actually, the total length of the transformed strings might blow up? But note: the problem says the sum of the lengths of the original ti is <= 10^5. However, the transformation might expand the string arbitrarily? But wait: we are only doing up to 10^5 queries and the expansion factor per query is the length of ti. However, if we do multiple expansions, the string could become very long.\n\n      But note: the problem does not require us to output the string, only the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n      So we don't actually need the entire string. We need to compute the number represented by the entire transformed string, modulo 1000000007.\n\n      How to compute the number without building the entire string?\n\n      We can represent the transformation for each digit as two things:\n\n          - The numeric value of the entire transformed string (mod 1000000007)\n          - The length of the transformed string (because when we append digits, the power of 10 depends on the length)\n\n      Why is that useful?\n\n          Consider: \n            Original digit d is replaced by a string t (which is then transformed by subsequent queries to become T).\n            Then, the entire transformed string for d is T.\n\n          Now, if we have two digits a and b, and they are transformed to T_a and T_b, then the entire string is the concatenation of T_a and T_b (if the original string was \"ab\").\n\n          The number represented by T_a is, say, x, and T_b is y, and T_a has length L_a, then the entire number is: x + y * (10^(L_a)) [if we were reading left to right] but note: the entire string is built by the original order.\n\n          Actually, the transformation is applied to each digit independently, and then the digits are concatenated. So the entire string is the concatenation of the transformed strings for each original digit.\n\n          Therefore, if we break the original string s into digits, then the final number is:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each digit d in s (in order):\n                Let T_d be the transformed string for d (which is a string, but we have stored its numeric value and its length)\n                Then, result = (result * (10^(length(T_d))) + numeric_value(T_d)) % mod\n\n          But note: the transformation for d is stored as:\n\n            value[d] = the number represented by the transformed string for d (mod mod)\n            len[d] = the length of the transformed string for d (which is the total number of digits)\n\n      Now, how to update the transformation for a digit d in a query (d, t) when processing backwards?\n\n          Let the current state (for subsequent queries) have for each digit c, value[c] and len[c].\n\n          Then, for the query (d, t):\n\n          We want to compute the transformed version of t (which is the replacement string) using the current state (which is the state after the current query, i.e., including the effect of all subsequent queries).\n\n          Then, the transformation for d becomes:\n\n            value_new[d] = 0\n            len_new[d] = 0\n\n          For each character c in t:\n              value_new[d] = (value_new[d] * (10^(len_current[c])) + value_current[c]) % mod\n              len_new[d] = (len_new[d] + len_current[c]) % (mod-1)?  -> Wait, but note: the modulus for the exponentiation is tricky because we are dealing with powers of 10.\n\n          However, note: the length is just the count of digits (an integer). But the exponentiation base 10 can be very large (like 10^k, where k is the total length). But the modulus is 1000000007, and we cannot compute 10^(very big) directly.\n\n          Alternative: we don't store the entire transformed string, but we store:\n\n            value[d] = the numeric value of the transformed string for d (mod 1000000007)\n            len[d] = the length of the transformed string for d (as an integer, but note: the length can be up to ...? The total length of all replacement strings is <= 10^5, but the transformation can chain. However, the problem states that the total length of the original ti (the replacement strings) is <= 10^5, but the transformed string might be longer because of the chaining.\n\n          But note: the queries are applied sequentially, and the same digit might be expanded multiple times. However, the total length of the replacement strings is bounded by 10^5, but the expansion might lead to exponential growth? Actually, worst-case: if we have a query that replaces a digit by a string containing the same digit, then it could blow up. But the problem constraints say the sum of the lengths of the original ti (the ones given in the queries) is <= 10^5. However, the transformation of a digit might produce a string that is the concatenation of several transformed digits, and the length of that string is the sum of the lengths of the transformed digits for each character in the original ti.\n\n          But note: the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. However, the transformation of a digit might involve multiple steps, and the intermediate ti might be long. But the initial total length of the replacement strings is 10^5, and we are processing backwards. \n\n          However, we cannot store the entire transformed string because the length might be huge (exponential in the number of queries). We need to store only the value (mod 1000000007) and the length (as an integer, but the length might be huge, but note: we are only using the length for exponentiation, and we are going to do exponentiation with base 10 modulo 1000000007? Actually, we don't need the exact exponent, but we need to compute 10^(L) mod 1000000007 for L being the length. However, the length L might be astronomically huge (like 10^5 * (some factor) over 10^5 queries). But note: the problem does not require the exact length, only the value of the number mod 1000000007.\n\n          However, the way we combine:\n\n            Suppose we have two transformed strings A and B. Then the number for the concatenation is: A * (10^(len(B))) + B.\n\n          But we don't know the length of B as an integer if B is very long. But we are storing the length as an integer. However, the length can be very large (exponentially growing). But note: the total length of the original ti is 10^5, and we are processing 10^5 queries. The maximum length we might get is bounded by the fact that the replacement strings are fixed. However, worst-case: if we have a query that replaces '0' by \"10\", and then another query that replaces '1' by \"10\", then the length grows exponentially. But the problem says the sum of the lengths of the replacement strings (the ti) is <= 10^5, so the initial replacement strings are limited. However, the chaining might still cause the length to become huge.\n\n          But note: the problem does not specify a bound on the length of the transformed string, so we must avoid storing the entire string or the exact integer for the length.\n\n          Alternative: we can use logarithms? No, because we need the exact power for modular exponentiation.\n\n          However, note: we are only interested in the value mod 1000000007. The exponentiation 10^L mod 1000000007 can be computed with modular exponentiation if we know L modulo (phi(1000000007))? But wait, Euler's theorem requires that 10 and 1000000007 are coprime (they are, since 1000000007 is prime and doesn't divide 10). The modulus for exponents is phi(1000000007)=1000000006.\n\n          But we cannot reduce the exponent L modulo 1000000006 because the operation is base 10, and the exponentiation is in the ring of integers mod 1000000007. However, the standard method for modular exponentiation is to use pow(base, exponent, modulus). But the exponent L might be huge (say, 10^18) and that is acceptable in Python with pow, but the issue is: we must store the length as an integer, and the length might be too big (like having 10^5 queries and each replacement string being of length 10, then the length could be 10^5 * (exponential factors) and we cannot store such a big integer.\n\n      Another idea: we don't need the exact length for the purpose of modular arithmetic. We can use the fact that the entire transformation is linear and we can break down the transformation for each digit by storing:\n\n          val[d] = the number (mod 1000000007) that the digit d becomes after all queries.\n          mult[d] = the multiplier factor (base 10^(length of the transformed string for d)) mod 1000000007.\n\n      Then, when we have two transformed strings A and B (from two consecutive digits), the entire number is A * (10^(len(B))) + B.\n\n      But note: we are storing for each digit d: \n          val[d] = the numeric value of the entire transformed string for d (mod mod)\n          mult[d] = 10^(len(transformed_string_of_d)) mod mod   [but wait, no: actually, we don't store the multiplier for the entire string, but we store the base for the entire string's length. However, if we have a digit d that transforms to a string of length L, then when we use this d in a larger number, we need to shift the existing number by L digits and then add the value of d.\n\n      Actually, we can store:\n\n          Let F(d) = (value, length) for digit d.\n\n      Then, for a query (d, t) (processing backwards, so t is transformed by the subsequent queries):\n\n          value_new = 0\n          length_new = 0\n          for each char c in t:\n              value_new = (value_new * (10^(F(c).length)) + F(c).value) % mod\n              length_new = (length_new + F(c).length)   # but wait, we cannot store the length as an integer because it might be too big.\n\n      However, note: the modulus for the exponentiation is 1000000007, but the exponent (the length) is used in the exponentiation base 10. The exponentiation 10^(L) mod 1000000007 can be computed by pow(10, L, 1000000007) if we know L. But if L is too big, we can use Euler's theorem: since 10 and 1000000007 are coprime, then 10^L mod 1000000007 = 10^(L mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007, provided that L >= 0 and 1000000007 is prime.\n\n      But wait: Euler's theorem says a^(phi(m)) ≡ 1 (mod m) if gcd(a,m)=1. Then, a^L mod m = a^(L mod phi(m)) mod m, provided that L >= phi(m). However, note that if L < phi(m), then we cannot reduce. But the exponent L (the length) might be huge, but we don't know. However, we don't actually need the exponent for the entire transformation of d, because we are breaking t down into characters and then combining them.\n\n      But note: we are storing the value for each digit as:\n\n          value[d] = (concatenation of the transformed strings of each character in t) mod mod\n\n          and we also need to know the length (so that when we use d in a bigger context, we know how many digits to shift). \n\n      However, the problem: the length might be astronomical. But note: we are only storing the value and the length, and then we use the length only for exponentiation (to shift). But we cannot store the exact length as an integer if it is too big.\n\n      Alternative: we store the value and the length modulo something? \n\n      But wait: the shifting operation is: \n          If we have a current number X (which is the number formed by the digits so far) and then we append a digit (or a transformed string) D, then the new number is: X * (10^(len(D))) + value(D)\n\n      However, we are processing the entire string from left to right. But we are precomputing for each digit. Then, when we process the original string, we do:\n\n          result = 0\n          for each digit d in the original string s:\n              result = (result * (10^(len[d])) + value[d]) % mod\n\n      But here, we need the exact length for the exponentiation. However, the length of the transformed string for d might be huge (like 10^100000) and we cannot store that.\n\n      We must find a way to compute the value without knowing the exact length, but we are forced to use the length for the exponentiation.\n\n      However, note: we can store the length modulo (phi(mod))? But the modulus for the exponentiation is 1000000007, and the exponentiation is 10^(L) mod 1000000007. We can use:\n\n          exponent = L % (1000000006)   [because 1000000007 is prime, so phi(1000000007)=1000000006]\n\n      Then, 10^L mod 1000000007 = 10^(L mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007, provided that L >= 0.\n\n      But wait, Euler's theorem requires that 10 and 1000000007 are coprime (which they are) and that we are raising to a positive integer exponent. However, the exponentiation in modular arithmetic for base and modulus coprime: yes, we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006.\n\n      Therefore, we can store for each digit d:\n\n          value[d] = the numeric value of the transformed string (mod 1000000007)\n          exp_len[d] = the length of the transformed string (the total number of digits) modulo 1000000006   [because 10^(L) mod 1000000007 = 10^(L mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007]\n\n      Then, when processing a query (d, t) (from last to first):\n\n          Let L_total = 0   (this will be the total length mod 1000000006)\n          V_total = 0       (the numeric value mod 1000000007)\n\n          For each character c in t:\n              Let c_digit = int(c) but we don't need to, we use the mapping for c (which is the current state for c, i.e., the transformation after this query)\n\n              The transformation for c is (value[c], exp_len[c])\n\n              Then, we need to shift V_total by the length of c's transformation (which is stored in exp_len[c]), and then add value[c].\n\n              But note: the shifting is: \n                  V_total = V_total * (10^(exp_len[c]) + value[c]   (mod 1000000007)\n\n              And the length increases by (exp_len[c] mod 1000000006) ? \n\n              However, we are storing the length modulo 1000000006 (the totient). But the actual length is the sum of the lengths of the transformed digits, and we are storing the sum modulo 1000000006.\n\n          But wait: the exponentiation base 10: we are storing the exponent (the length) modulo 1000000006. Then, when we combine two digits, the length of the entire string is the sum of the lengths of the individual digits. And the exponentiation for the entire string is the product of the individual exponents? Actually, no: the entire string is the concatenation. The value is computed as:\n\n              value = 0\n              for each part (each character in t, transformed to a string of length L_i and value V_i):\n                  value = value * (10^(L_i)) + V_i\n\n          And the total length is L_1 + L_2 + ... + L_k.\n\n          Now, the shifting factor for the entire string is 10^(L_1+L_2+...+L_k). And by the property of exponents:\n\n              10^(L_1+L_2+...+L_k) = (10^(L_1)) * (10^(L_2)) * ... * (10^(L_k))\n\n          But note: the order of concatenation: the first part is the most significant. So we do:\n\n              value = 0\n              for each part (from left to right):\n                  value = (value * (10^(L_i)) + V_i) % mod\n\n          And the total length is the sum of the L_i.\n\n          Now, the exponentiation factors: 10^(L_i) mod mod can be computed using:\n\n              factor_i = pow(10, L_i_mod, mod)\n\n          where L_i_mod = (the stored exp_len for the digit c) mod 1000000006? Actually, we store the length of the transformed string for c modulo 1000000006 (the totient). Then, we can compute 10^(L_i) mod mod as pow(10, L_i_mod, mod) because of Euler's theorem.\n\n          However, note: if L_i is the actual length, then 10^(L_i) mod mod = 10^(L_i mod 1000000006) mod mod, provided that 10 and mod are coprime (which they are).\n\n          But wait: Euler's theorem requires that the exponent can be reduced modulo phi(mod) only when the base and modulus are coprime. Here, base 10 and modulus 1000000007 are coprime, so yes.\n\n      Therefore, we can store for each digit d:\n\n          value[d] = the numeric value (mod 1000000007)\n          len_exp[d] = the length of the transformed string (the total number of digits) modulo 1000000006\n\n      Then, for a query (d, t) (processing from last query to first):\n\n          We break t into characters. For each character c in t:\n\n              We use the current value[c] and len_exp[c] (which are the values for the state after the current query).\n\n          Then, we combine these:\n\n          Let new_value = 0\n          Let new_len = 0   (but we store modulo 1000000006)\n\n          However, note: the length is additive modulo 1000000006? \n\n          Example: \n            Lengths: L1, L2, ... Lk.\n            Total length = L1 + L2 + ... + Lk.\n\n          But we are storing each Li mod 1000000006. Then, the total length mod 1000000006 is (L1 + L2 + ... + Lk) mod 1000000006.\n\n          Similarly, the value is computed by:\n\n            new_value = 0\n            for each c in t:\n                # First, we shift the current new_value by the length of c's transformed string (using the exponentiation with base 10 and exponent = len_exp[c] mod 1000000006)\n                shift_factor = pow(10, len_exp[c], mod)   # This is 10^(L_c) mod mod, where L_c is the actual length (but we only know L_c mod 1000000006)\n                new_value = (new_value * shift_factor + value[c]) % mod\n\n            new_len = (sum of len_exp[c] for c in t) % 1000000006\n\n          Then, set value[d] = new_value, and len_exp[d] = new_len.\n\n      But note: the above computation for the value is correct because the transformation for t is the concatenation of the transformed strings for each c in t, and we are doing the shifting and adding in the correct order.\n\n      However, we must update the state for the digit d. Then, when processing the next (earlier) query, the digit d will be considered as having the transformed string we just computed.\n\n      But note: the queries are given in order, so we process from last to first, and the current state (for the subsequent queries) is the state we've updated so far (from the last query to the current one).\n\n      Steps:\n\n        mod = 1000000007\n        phi_mod = 1000000006   (since mod is prime)\n\n        Initialize for each digit d (0-9):\n            value[d] = d   (as integer, but then mod mod? but d is a single digit, so value[d] = d % mod)\n            len_exp[d] = 1   (because the digit d is one digit, so length=1, and 1 mod 1000000006 is 1)\n\n        Read the initial string s and the number of queries n.\n\n        Then, read the n queries. We'll store the queries (each is (digit, string)).\n\n        Then, process the queries from last to first (i.e., reverse the list of queries).\n\n        For each query (d_str, t_str) in reversed_queries:\n\n            d = int(d_str)   # but wait, d_str is a string of one digit, so we can use d = d_str[0] and then convert to int? Actually, we are storing by digit index (0-9). So we use the digit as an integer to index.\n\n            Actually, we can store the digits as characters and then map to an integer index (0-9). Or we can store an array for 10 digits.\n\n            Let d_int = int(d_str)\n\n            Then, we want to compute the transformation for d_int.\n\n            We break t_str into characters. For each character c in t_str:\n\n                c_int = int(c)   # but wait, we have to use the transformation for the digit represented by c. However, note: our mapping is by the digit (0-9). But the character c is a digit, so we can convert it to an integer to index.\n\n            Then, combine:\n\n                new_value = 0\n                new_len = 0\n\n                for c in t_str:\n                    c_int = int(c)\n                    # Get the current value and length for c_int (from the state we have so far, which includes all queries after the current one)\n                    shift_factor = pow(10, len_exp[c_int], mod)   # This is 10^(actual_length) mod mod, but we are using len_exp[c_int] (which is the length mod 1000000006) as the exponent. Is that valid?\n                    # Actually, we are storing the length mod 1000000006, so we can use that as the exponent for base 10 mod mod.\n\n                    new_value = (new_value * shift_factor + value[c_int]) % mod\n                    new_len = (new_len + len_exp[c_int]) % phi_mod   # because the total length is the sum, and we only care about the exponent mod phi_mod.\n\n                Then, set value[d_int] = new_value\n                set len_exp[d_int] = new_len\n\n        Then, after processing all queries backwards, we process the original string s:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each char in s:\n                d_int = int(char)\n                shift_factor = pow(10, len_exp[d_int], mod)\n                result = (result * shift_factor + value[d_int]) % mod\n\n            Print result.\n\n      But wait: is the above backward processing correct?\n\n        Example: \n          Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\"\n\n          Queries: \n            Query1: \"2->00\"\n            Query2: \"0->7\"\n\n          We process backwards: first process the last query, then the first.\n\n          Step 1: Process query2: \"0->7\"\n\n            d_int = 0\n            t_str = \"7\"\n\n            For each c in \"7\": c_int = 7.\n            Then, shift_factor = pow(10, len_exp[7], mod) = pow(10, 1, mod) = 10\n            new_value = (0 * 10 + value[7]) % mod = 7\n            new_len = (0 + len_exp[7]) % phi_mod = 1\n\n            So update: value[0] = 7, len_exp[0] = 1.\n\n          Step 2: Process query1: \"2->00\"\n\n            d_int = 2\n            t_str = \"00\"\n\n            Break into two characters: '0' and '0'\n\n            For the first '0': \n                shift_factor1 = pow(10, len_exp[0], mod) = pow(10,1,mod)=10\n                value0 = 7\n                new_value = 0 * 10 + 7 = 7\n\n            Then, for the second '0':\n                shift_factor2 = 10\n                value0 = 7\n                new_value = (7 * 10 + 7) = 77\n\n            new_len = (len_exp[0] + len_exp[0]) % phi_mod = (1+1) % 1000000006 = 2\n\n            Then, update value[2]=77, len_exp[2]=2.\n\n          Then, the original string s is \"222\"\n\n          result = 0\n          for each '2' in \"222\":\n            shift_factor = pow(10, 2, mod)   # because for digit 2, len_exp[2]=2\n            result = (result * 100 + 77) % mod\n\n          First digit: result = (0 * 100 + 77) % mod = 77\n          Second digit: result = (77 * 100 + 77) % mod = (7700+77)=7777\n          Third digit: result = (7777 * 100 + 77) % mod = 777700+77 = 777777\n\n          But the expected output is 777.\n\n          What's the issue?\n\n          The example input: \n            ['222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n          Expected outputs: \n            ['777', '1']   (from the third sample)\n\n          But wait, the example input has two samples.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing each occurrence of a specific digit with another string of digits. The final transformed string represents a number, and we need to compute this number modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). The challenge lies in efficiently handling the transformations without explicitly processing the entire string for each query, especially since the number of queries and the string length can be very large (up to 10^5).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple queries where each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with a given string. The key observation is that each query's effect must be applied in sequence, and subsequent queries can affect the results of previous replacements. Directly applying each query to the string for every query would be computationally expensive due to the potentially exponential growth in string length.\n\n2. **Insight**: Instead of processing the string sequentially for each query, we can precompute the final transformation for each digit (0-9) after all queries have been processed. This involves working backward through the queries, updating the transformation for each digit based on the transformations applied by subsequent queries.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Backward Processing**: Process the queries in reverse order. For each query, determine how the digit to be replaced (d) transforms into a string (t) that has already been processed by all subsequent queries.\n   - **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result can be extremely large, all operations are performed modulo 1000000007. Additionally, the length of the transformed strings is tracked modulo 1000000006 (Euler's totient function value for 1000000007), leveraging properties of exponents in modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach processes each query once in reverse order, and for each query, it processes each character in the replacement string. Given that the total length of all replacement strings across queries is up to 10^5, the overall complexity is O(N + M), where N is the length of the initial string and M is the total length of all replacement strings. This is efficient and feasible for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 1000000007\nphi_mod = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n_line = data[1].strip()\n    n = int(n_line) if n_line else 0\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        line = data[i].strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        parts = line.split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_str = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip()\n        queries.append((d_str, t_str))\n        \n    value = [i % mod for i in range(10)]\n    len_exp = [1] * 10\n    \n    if queries:\n        for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n            d_str, t_str = queries[i]\n            d_int = int(d_str)\n            new_value = 0\n            new_len = 0\n            for c in t_str:\n                c_int = int(c)\n                shift_factor = pow(10, len_exp[c_int], mod)\n                new_value = (new_value * shift_factor + value[c_int]) % mod\n                new_len = (new_len + len_exp[c_int]) % phi_mod\n            value[d_int] = new_value\n            len_exp[d_int] = new_len\n            \n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d_int = int(char)\n        shift_factor = pow(10, len_exp[d_int], mod)\n        result = (result * shift_factor + value[d_int]) % mod\n        \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input. Each query is parsed into a digit to replace and its replacement string.\n2. **Backward Processing**: The queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the digit to be replaced is transformed based on the current state of transformations (which includes all subsequent queries). The transformation involves computing the numeric value and the effective length (modulo 1000000006) of the replacement string after all subsequent queries.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The numeric value of the transformed string is computed using modular exponentiation to handle large numbers. The length of the transformed string is tracked modulo 1000000006 to leverage Euler's theorem for efficient exponentiation during the final number computation.\n4. **Result Computation**: After processing all queries, the original string is transformed by replacing each digit with its precomputed transformed value. The final result is computed by combining these values using modular arithmetic to ensure the result fits within standard integer limits and is presented modulo 1000000007.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially massive transformations by leveraging modular arithmetic and backward processing, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
