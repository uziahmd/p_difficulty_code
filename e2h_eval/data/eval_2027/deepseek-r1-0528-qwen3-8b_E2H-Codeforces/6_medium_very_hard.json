Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of (l, r, cost)\n We need two vouchers i and j such that:\n   (1) They don't intersect: either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.\n   (2) The sum of their durations is exactly x: (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x.\n\n Let d_i = r_i - l_i + 1 (duration of voucher i)\n\n Then we require d_i + d_j = x.\n\n We want to minimize cost_i + cost_j.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since the total duration is fixed (x), for each voucher i with duration d, we need a voucher j with duration x-d.\n\n However, we have two conditions for non-overlapping. The condition is: \n   Condition 1: r_i < l_j   -> meaning the first voucher ends before the second starts.\n   Condition 2: r_j < l_i   -> meaning the second voucher ends before the first starts.\n\n But note: the two vouchers are chosen arbitrarily (order doesn't matter). So we can consider two cases:\n\n Case 1: The first voucher (i) ends before the second (j) starts: r_i < l_j.\n Case 2: The second voucher (j) ends before the first (i) starts: r_j < l_i.\n\n However, since we are free to assign which one is first, we can also think of it as:\n\n   Without loss of generality, we can assume that we order the two by time? Actually, the condition is symmetric.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the two vouchers are taken in a particular order. However, the non-overlapping condition is defined with at least one of the two possibilities.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We are going to group the vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we have multiple vouchers, and for each voucher we have (l, r, cost).\n\n   We need to find two different vouchers (i and j) such that:\n        d_i + d_j = x, and \n        either (voucher i: [l_i, r_i] and voucher j: [l_j, r_j] satisfy r_i < l_j OR r_j < l_i)\n\n   Since the condition is symmetric, we can fix one voucher and look for the other.\n\n   However, n and x up to 200,000, and the days also up to 200,000.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Precompute the duration for each voucher.\n   2. Group the vouchers by duration. We'll create a dictionary mapping duration -> list of (l, r, cost) for vouchers with that duration.\n\n   3. We note that the two vouchers must have durations d1 and d2 such that d1 + d2 = x.\n\n   4. Now, for each duration d, we are interested in the other duration x-d.\n\n   5. How to check non-overlapping? We have two sets of intervals (for durations d and x-d). We need to check if there exists a pair (one from d and one from x-d) that do not overlap.\n\n   6. But note: we cannot check all pairs because the lists might be long.\n\n   Alternate idea:\n\n   Instead of grouping by duration, we can also consider storing the intervals by their start and end.\n\n   However, we have two conditions: either the first ends before the second starts or the second ends before the first starts.\n\n   We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n   Part 1: Consider the case where the first voucher (with duration d) ends before the second (with duration x-d) starts.\n\n        Condition: r1 < l2.\n\n   Part 2: Consider the case where the second voucher (with duration x-d) ends before the first (with duration d) starts.\n\n        Condition: r2 < l1.\n\n   But note: the two vouchers are independent. However, we are allowed to choose any two. So we can consider both orders.\n\n   However, note: the condition is symmetric. So if we consider the two vouchers without order, then the condition is satisfied if the two intervals do not overlap. This is equivalent to: \n        [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] do not overlap <=> r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n   But note: if we fix the two vouchers, we don't know which one is first. However, we can try to consider one as the \"first\" and the other as the \"second\", but then we have two cases.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to precompute for each duration d:\n\n        We store the vouchers for duration d in a structure that allows efficient query for a voucher with duration d and then check against the set of vouchers with duration x-d.\n\n   However, the constraints are high (n up to 200000, and days up to 200000). We need an efficient way.\n\n   Let's denote:\n        d1 = d, d2 = x-d.\n\n   We have two sets of vouchers: A (d1) and B (d2).\n\n   We want to find two vouchers (a in A, b in B) such that either:\n        a.r < b.l   OR   b.r < a.l\n\n   And minimize cost_a + cost_b.\n\n   We can split the problem into two separate queries:\n\n        Query 1: For each voucher a in A, we want to find a voucher b in B such that b.l > a.r, and minimize (cost_a + cost_b).\n        Query 2: For each voucher a in A, we want to find a voucher b in B such that b.r < a.l, and minimize (cost_a + cost_b).\n\n   Then the answer would be the minimum over both queries.\n\n   However, note: the same two vouchers might satisfy both conditions? But the condition is exclusive: if one condition holds then the other does not necessarily hold. Actually, the condition for non-overlap is OR, so we only need one to hold.\n\n   But wait: we cannot use the same voucher twice. So we are considering two distinct vouchers.\n\n   How to do these queries efficiently?\n\n   We can preprocess the sets for each duration. But note: the durations are from 1 to 200000, and the total n is 200000, so we will have at most 200000 distinct durations? Actually, no: the duration is between 1 and 200000 (since li, ri up to 200000). But the number of distinct durations is at most 200000.\n\n   However, the total n is 200000, so we can have at most 200000 distinct durations, but actually we have n vouchers and each has a duration, so the distinct durations are at most 200000.\n\n   But note: we are grouping by duration. So we can have a dictionary `groups` such that:\n        groups[d] = list of (l, r, cost) for all vouchers with duration d.\n\n   Then, for each duration d, we know the other duration is x-d.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Group the vouchers by duration.\n\n        Step 2: For each duration d that exists and for which x-d also exists, consider:\n\n            Case 1: We want to find a voucher a in group[d] and a voucher b in group[x-d] such that a.r < b.l.\n\n            Case 2: We want to find a voucher a in group[d] and a voucher b in group[x-d] such that b.r < a.l.\n\n        However, note: in Case 1, the voucher a (from d) must end before the voucher b (from x-d) starts. In Case 2, the voucher b (from x-d) must end before the voucher a (from d) starts.\n\n        But note: the two vouchers are distinct and we are iterating over the same two groups. However, we have to remember that the two groups are for two different durations (unless d == x-d, then we are taking two vouchers from the same group). \n\n        Important: when d == x-d, then we are taking two vouchers from the same group. But note the condition: two vouchers must be distinct. Also, we have to ensure they don't overlap.\n\n        But wait: the condition for non-overlap in the same group: two intervals from the same group (same duration d) must not overlap. The condition is: either the first ends before the second starts, or the second ends before the first starts.\n\n        However, we are grouping by duration and then we are checking two distinct vouchers.\n\n   However, the problem: how to quickly query the minimal cost for a voucher in group[x-d] that satisfies a condition on its (l or r) relative to a voucher in group[d]?\n\n   We can precompute for each group (each duration) some data structures.\n\n   For a given group (say for duration d), we have a list of (l, r, cost). We can sort this list by l and by r.\n\n   Similarly, for the other group (duration x-d) we do the same.\n\n   Then:\n\n        Case 1: For each voucher a in group[d] (with attributes (l1, r1, cost1)), we want to find in group[x-d] a voucher b with l2 > r1, and we want the minimal cost in group[x-d] for such b.\n\n        Case 2: For each voucher a in group[d] (with attributes (l1, r1, cost1)), we want to find in group[x-d] a voucher b with r2 < l1, and minimal cost.\n\n   But note: in Case 1, we are using the group[x-d] as the second voucher, and in Case 2 we are using the same group[x-d] but the condition is reversed.\n\n   However, we must consider that the two groups might be the same (if d = x-d) or different.\n\n   How to handle the same group? Actually, if d == x-d, then we are looking for two distinct vouchers in the same group. Then we have to avoid using the same voucher twice.\n\n   But note: the condition for non-overlap in the same group: two distinct intervals from the same group. We have to make sure they don't overlap.\n\n   However, the problem does not require the two vouchers to be from different groups. They can be from the same group if the group's duration is half of x (and x is even). But note: the total duration is x, so if d = x-d then 2*d = x. So x must be even.\n\n   Steps for efficient querying:\n\n        For each group (for each distinct duration d) we do:\n\n            Sort the list of vouchers by l (and maybe by r as well) and then preprocess for range minimum queries.\n\n        Specifically:\n\n            For a group with duration d (for the other group being x-d):\n\n                We want to quickly query for a given value (say threshold T) the minimal cost for a voucher in group[x-d] that has l > T (for Case 1) or r < T (for Case 2).\n\n        We can do:\n\n            For group[x-d]:\n                Create an array of l values (for Case 1) and an array of r values (for Case 2). Then sort by l and by r.\n\n            Then, we can create a segment tree or a Fenwick tree for the costs, but note: we are going to query by l (or by r) and we want the minimal cost for a voucher that has l >= some value (for Case 1) or r <= some value (for Case 2).\n\n        Alternatively, we can use two arrays:\n\n            For Case 1 (query by l): \n                We want to consider all vouchers in group[x-d] with l > T (where T = r1 from voucher a). Then we want the minimal cost among those.\n\n            We can preprocess the group[x-d] by:\n\n                Sort by l, and then for each l, we store the minimal cost for any voucher with that l (or we can store multiple and then take the minimal cost for a given l). Then, we can build a suffix minimum array (from right to left) for the sorted-by-l array: so that for a given l, we know the minimal cost for any voucher with l >= current_l.\n\n            Similarly, for Case 2 (query by r):\n                We want to consider all vouchers in group[x-d] with r < T (where T = l1 from voucher a). Then we want the minimal cost.\n\n            We can sort the group[x-d] by r, and then build a prefix minimum array (from left to right) for the sorted-by-r array.\n\n        Steps for a fixed duration d (and let g1 = group[d], g2 = group.get(x-d, [])):\n\n            If g2 is empty, skip.\n\n            Precomputation for g2 (if not done already) for Case 1 and Case 2.\n\n            For Case 1 (using g2 for the second voucher, condition: l2 > r1):\n\n                Sort g2 by l (the start day). Then, we create an array for the minimal cost for vouchers from a certain l onwards.\n\n                Steps for Case 1 for g2:\n\n                    Sort g2 by l: sorted_g2_by_l = sorted(g2, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                    Then, we want for a given threshold T (which is the r1 of a voucher in g1) to get the minimal cost for any voucher in g2 with l >= T+1? Actually, the condition is l2 > r1, so we need l2 >= r1+1.\n\n                    Actually, condition: l2 > r1 -> so l2 must be at least r1+1.\n\n                    Then, we can build an array for sorted_g2_by_l: \n                        Let arr_l = sorted_g2_by_l, and we extract the l values and the costs.\n                    Then, we build an array min_cost_from[i] for the minimal cost from index i to the end (suffix minimum).\n\n            Similarly, for Case 2 (condition: r2 < l1):\n\n                Sort g2 by r (the end day). Then, we build a prefix minimum array for the costs.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                    Sort g2 by r: sorted_g2_by_r = sorted(g2, key=lambda x: x[1])\n                    Then, we build an array min_cost_to[i] for the minimal cost from the beginning to index i.\n\n            Then, for each voucher a in g1 (with duration d):\n\n                For Case 1: \n                    Let T = a.r (the end of voucher a)\n                    We want to consider g2 with l2 > T. In the sorted_g2_by_l, we need the smallest l2 that is > T. Then we can binary search for the first index in sorted_g2_by_l where l >= T+1.\n\n                    Then, if there is any, the minimal cost for such voucher is min_cost_from[index].\n\n                    Then candidate = a.cost + min_cost_from[index]\n\n                For Case 2:\n                    Let T = a.l (the start of voucher a)\n                    We want to consider g2 with r2 < T. In the sorted_g2_by_r, we need the largest r2 that is < T. Then we can binary search for the last index in sorted_g2_by_r where r < T.\n\n                    Then, if there is any, the minimal cost for such voucher is min_cost_to[index].\n\n                    Then candidate = a.cost + min_cost_to[index]\n\n            Then we take the minimum candidate over all a in g1 and both cases.\n\n        However, note: the two cases are independent. We are considering two different ways the two vouchers can be arranged. But note: the two cases are actually the two ways the non-overlap condition can hold. We don't need to consider both for the same pair. But we are just trying to cover all possibilities.\n\n        But wait: what if a voucher from g1 and a voucher from g2 satisfy both conditions? Then we are counting the same pair twice. However, the condition for non-overlap is OR, so if one condition holds then the pair is valid. But note: if both conditions hold, then the two intervals are disjoint and separated by at least one day in both directions? Actually, if both hold then we have two disjoint intervals and the order is fixed: one entirely to the left and the other entirely to the right. But that is acceptable and the same pair is found in both Case 1 and Case 2? Actually, no: in Case 1 we require the first voucher (from g1) ends before the second (from g2) starts. In Case 2 we require the second voucher (from g2) ends before the first (from g1) starts. These two conditions are mutually exclusive? Actually, no: consider if we have two intervals [1,2] and [3,4]. Then [1,2] ends at 2, and [3,4] starts at 3 -> condition1 holds. Also, [3,4] ends at 4, and [1,2] starts at 1 -> condition2: 4 < 1? No. So condition2 does not hold. \n\n        Actually, the two conditions are:\n\n            Condition1: r1 < l2\n            Condition2: r2 < l1\n\n        These conditions are not overlapping. If Condition1 holds, then Condition2 cannot hold because if r1 < l2 and r2 < l1, then we would have r1 < l2 and r2 < l1, so the intervals are separated by at least one day, but note: it is possible that both hold if the two intervals are separated by at least one day in both directions? Actually, no: Condition1 says the first ends before the second starts, Condition2 says the second ends before the first starts. But if Condition1 holds, then the first interval is [l1, r1] and the second is [l2, r2] with r1 < l2. Then the second interval must start after the first ends. Then the condition Condition2: r2 < l1? But l1 <= r1 (by definition) and r1 < l2, so r2 < l1 would imply that the second ends before the first starts, but then the entire second interval is to the right of the first. But wait: Condition1 already requires that the second starts after the first ends, so the second is entirely to the right. Then Condition2 requires that the second ends before the first starts, which is impossible because the first starts at l1 (which is <= r1) and the second starts at l2 (>= r1+1) and ends at r2 (>= l2) so r2 >= l2 >= r1+1 >= l1+? Actually, no: Condition2: r2 < l1. But from Condition1: r1 < l2 and l2 <= r2 (because the second interval is [l2, r2]), so r1 < r2. And Condition2: r2 < l1. Then we have r1 < l2 <= r2 < l1. But from the first interval: l1 <= r1. So we have l1 <= r1 < l2 <= r2 < l1, which is impossible because l1 <= r1 and r1 < l1. Contradiction.\n\n        Therefore, the two conditions are mutually exclusive. So we don't double count.\n\n        However, note: the two cases are for the same two groups, but the assignment of which group is first and which is second is fixed by the condition. But wait: in our grouping, we fixed d and x-d. In Case 1 we are assuming the first voucher is from g1 and the second from g2. In Case 2 we are assuming the first voucher is from g1 and the second from g2, but the condition is the other way. But note: the condition is symmetric in the sense that we are allowed to assign the two intervals arbitrarily. However, in our grouping, we fixed the durations: the first has duration d and the second has duration x-d. But the non-overlap condition does not depend on which is first. Actually, we can also consider the reverse: \n\n            Condition1: [g1] ends before [g2] starts -> which is the natural order (g1 then g2)\n            Condition2: [g2] ends before [g1] starts -> which is the reverse order (g2 then g1)\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify the order. However, the two conditions are the two ways the two intervals can be arranged without overlapping.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j)\" and the condition is \"don't intersect\" (at least one of the two conditions). So we are covering both orders.\n\n        However, in our method we are only considering one assignment: the first voucher from g1 and the second from g2. Then we are checking two conditions. But note: the two conditions are independent and cover both orders. \n\n        But what if we have two vouchers: one from g1 and one from g2, and they don't overlap? Then one of the two conditions must hold. So we are covering all possibilities.\n\n        However, we must consider that the two groups are fixed: g1 is for duration d and g2 for duration x-d. Then the two conditions are:\n\n            Condition1: (voucher from g1) ends before (voucher from g2) starts.\n            Condition2: (voucher from g2) ends before (voucher from g1) starts.\n\n        And these are the two possibilities.\n\n        But note: we are iterating over all vouchers in g1 and for each we query g2. Then we are covering all pairs.\n\n        However, what if we fix the roles: sometimes the voucher from g2 might be considered as the first and g1 as the second? But wait, the condition is symmetric and we are covering both orders by the two conditions.\n\n        But note: the condition for non-overlap is symmetric. Our grouping by duration d and x-d is fixed. However, we are not forcing the order of the two vouchers. We are just checking the two conditions. \n\n        But note: the two conditions are defined with a specific order. However, we are allowed to assign the two vouchers arbitrarily. But we have fixed the durations: the first voucher must be from g1 (duration d) and the second from g2 (duration x-d). But that is arbitrary: we could have assigned the first voucher to be from g2 and the second from g1. However, the condition is the same: the two intervals don't overlap.\n\n        But wait: the condition is defined without order. However, the two conditions we check are:\n\n            Condition1: r1 < l2   (here, voucher1 from g1, voucher2 from g2)\n            Condition2: r2 < l1   (here, voucher1 from g1, voucher2 from g2)\n\n        What if the two vouchers are swapped? Then we would need to check:\n\n            Condition1_swapped: r2 < l1   (this is Condition2 above) and Condition2_swapped: r1 < l2 (Condition1 above) -> same conditions.\n\n        So we are effectively covering the two orders by the two conditions.\n\n        However, note: we are iterating over g1 (duration d) and g2 (duration x-d). But what if we consider the reverse: g2 and g1? Then we would be doing the same thing again (with d and x-d swapped). But note: d and x-d are fixed. \n\n        But wait: if we consider d and x-d, then if we swap the two, we get the same pair of groups. However, we are iterating over all pairs (d, x-d) and (x-d, d) separately? \n\n        Actually, we are only considering the pair (d, x-d) once. But note: if d != x-d, then we will consider the pair (d, x-d) and the pair (x-d, d) separately? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n\n            We iterate over each distinct duration d that is present. Then we check if x-d is present.\n\n            If d < x-d, then we consider the pair (d, x-d). Then we consider the pair (x-d, d) when we get to x-d (and then d becomes x-d, and we check for duration x-d and then look for x-(x-d)=d, which is present). \n\n            Then we will process the same two groups twice.\n\n        To avoid double processing, we can iterate only for d <= x-d. But note: the two groups are distinct. However, the two conditions (Case1 and Case2) are independent of the order of the groups. \n\n        Alternatively, we can process each unordered pair {d, x-d} only once. But note: we are grouping by duration and we have a dictionary. We can do:\n\n            Let d_min = min(d, x-d) and d_max = max(d, x-d). Then we process the pair (d_min, d_max) only when d_min <= d_max.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: what if d == x-d? Then we process it once.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the two vouchers to be from distinct groups. They can be from the same group (if d = x-d). Then we are processing that group only once.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Let groups = dictionary mapping duration -> list of (l, r, cost)\n\n                We'll create a set of processed pairs (for durations) to avoid duplicate work.\n\n                Alternatively, we can iterate over the keys d in groups such that d <= x-d and x-d is in groups.\n\n            However, we must be careful: if d > x-d, we skip. But note: we want to consider every unordered pair (d, x-d) exactly once.\n\n        But note: the condition for non-overlap is symmetric. And the two groups are fixed by the durations. So we can do:\n\n            For d in groups:\n                d2 = x - d\n                if d2 < d: continue   # because we will process (d2, d) later\n                if d2 not in groups: continue\n                if d2 == d: \n                    # Then we are processing the same group. We have to be cautious: we cannot use the same voucher twice.\n                    # But note: the problem says two distinct vouchers. So we have to avoid using the same voucher twice. However, our query for the same group will naturally consider two distinct vouchers (because we are iterating over the same list). But we must ensure that the two vouchers are distinct. However, in the same group, we have multiple vouchers. Our method for Case 1 and Case 2 for the same group is still valid.\n\n            However, wait: if we process the same group (d == x-d) then we are considering the same list for both g1 and g2. Then we must avoid using the same voucher twice. But note: our method for Case 1 and Case 2 for the same group does not inherently prevent using the same voucher. \n\n            Example: same group, and we have two identical vouchers. Then when we consider a voucher a, we might find that the same voucher a satisfies the condition (if we are not careful). \n\n            But note: in Case 1, we require that the second voucher (from g2) has l2 > a.r. If a voucher is identical to a, then unless a.r < a.l (which is impossible because a.l <= a.r) then the same voucher won't satisfy the condition. But wait: if the same voucher is used twice, then we have two intervals [l, r] and [l, r] (same). Then the condition for non-overlap: either r < l (false) or r < l (false) -> fails. So we don't want to consider the same voucher twice.\n\n            However, our method for the same group: we are building two structures for the same list. Then when we query for a voucher a, we are querying the entire list (including a itself) for a condition that must hold for the other voucher. But note: the condition for the same voucher: \n                Case1: a.r < a.l -> false (unless the interval is empty, but duration>=1 so r>=l, so condition fails).\n                Case2: a.r < a.l -> false.\n\n            So the same voucher is never selected by the query. But wait: what if we have two distinct vouchers with the same (l, r, cost)? Then we are storing duplicates. Then the query might pick a different voucher that is the same as a? \n\n            Actually, we are storing (l, r, cost). If two vouchers are identical, then they are stored separately. Then when we query for the same group, we might pick one of the duplicates. That is acceptable because they are distinct vouchers.\n\n            However, we must ensure that we are not accidentally picking the same voucher instance. But we are storing the list of vouchers. Each voucher is distinct (even if they have the same attributes). \n\n            But note: the input: each voucher is given by three integers. There might be duplicates.\n\n            However, the problem does not say the vouchers are distinct. So we have to account for duplicates.\n\n            But our method: we are building two structures (for the same group) and then querying the entire structure. Then we might get a voucher that is the same as the current one? \n\n            Example: same group, and we have two identical vouchers. Then for a voucher a, we query the structure for the same group and get an identical voucher. But note: the condition for non-overlap is not satisfied by the same voucher (as above). So we are safe.\n\n            However, what if we have two different vouchers that have the same (l, r) but different cost? Then the condition is still about the intervals. The condition for non-overlap is based on the intervals. Two identical intervals (same l, same r) will always overlap with themselves (unless they are the same interval and then they are the same voucher, but distinct vouchers with the same interval are two different intervals and they do overlap). \n\n            Actually, two intervals [l, r] and [l, r] (same) will overlap. Therefore, they are not allowed. \n\n            So we must ensure that the two vouchers we pick are distinct and do not overlap. \n\n            But note: our condition for non-overlap is checked by the two conditions (either one). The two identical intervals do not satisfy either condition (because r1 < l2 -> r < l -> false, and similarly for the other). So they are excluded.\n\n            Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We'll do:\n\n                groups = defaultdict(list)\n                for i in range(n):\n                    l, r, cost = map(int, line.split())\n                    d = r - l + 1\n                    groups[d].append((l, r, cost))\n\n                ans = a big number (like 10**18)\n\n                # We'll create a set of processed durations to avoid duplicate pairs? Or we can iterate over the keys and mark which ones we've done.\n\n                Alternatively, we can iterate over the keys d such that d <= x-d and x-d is in groups.\n\n                But note: if d > x-d, then we skip. But we must consider the same pair (d, x-d) and (x-d, d) only once.\n\n                However, we can simply iterate over all d in groups, and if d <= x-d and x-d in groups, then process (d, x-d). \n\n                But wait: if d == x-d, then we process it once. If d < x-d, then we process the pair (d, x-d) and then when we get to x-d (which is greater than d) we skip because x-d (when d becomes x-d) is x-(x-d)=d, and then d < x-d is false (because d < x-d is false when d=x-d? Actually, no: if d = x-d, then d==x-d, so we process once. For d < x-d, we process and then when we get to the key x-d (which is greater than d) then we skip because d' = x-d (the current key) and x-d' = d, and then d < x-d'? Actually, d < x-d' is d < d? No. \n\n                Actually, we should use:\n\n                    We process a pair (d, x-d) only if d <= x-d.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                    Let's create a set of visited pairs (min(d, x-d), max(d, x-d)) to avoid processing twice. But wait, we are iterating by keys. Alternatively, we can iterate only over d in groups such that d <= x-d and x-d in groups.\n\n                Code:\n\n                    for d in list(groups.keys()):\n                        d2 = x - d\n                        if d2 not in groups:\n                            continue\n                        if d > d2:\n                            # Skip because we will process the pair (d2, d) when we get to d2 (if d2 is a key) and then d2<=d won't hold because d>d2 so d2<d, then we skip? Actually, we want to process the pair (d, d2) only once. So we can require that d <= d2.\n\n                            # But wait: if d>d2, then we skip. Then we process the pair (d, d2) only when d<=d2.\n\n                        else:\n                            # Then d<=d2, and we process the pair (d, d2)\n\n                    However, we must consider that d and d2 might be the same. Then we process when d<=d2 (which is true).\n\n                Then, we do:\n\n                    g1 = groups[d]\n                    g2 = groups[d2]\n\n                    Then, we build for g2 (the larger duration? not necessarily) the two structures: one sorted by l and one by r.\n\n                    But note: we are going to use g2 for the second voucher. And we are going to query g2 for two conditions.\n\n                    Then, for each voucher in g1, we query g2 for:\n\n                        Case1: l2 > voucher.r -> minimal cost in g2 for such l2.\n                        Case2: r2 < voucher.l -> minimal cost in g2 for such r2.\n\n                    Then update the answer.\n\n                Then, we must avoid processing the same pair twice. But note: if d != d2, then the pair (d, d2) is the same as (d2, d). We are processing it only once (when d<=d2). \n\n                However, what if d2 is not present? Then we skip.\n\n                But note: we are iterating over the keys of groups. We must ensure that d2 is in groups.\n\n            However, there is a catch: the same pair (d, d2) might be encountered again when we iterate to d2? \n\n                When d2 is a key, then we check: d2' = x - d2 = d, and then we check if d <= d2? But d2' = d, and then we compare d2 and d: if d2 >= d? Actually, if d<=d2, then d2>=d. But then we check if d2 > d? Then we skip. So we process the pair (d, d2) only when d<=d2.\n\n            Therefore, we are processing each unordered pair (d, d2) exactly once.\n\n            But note: what if d2 is not in the dictionary? Then we skip.\n\n        However, the memory and time: \n\n            We have up to 200000 distinct durations? Actually, the distinct durations are at most 200000, but the total number of vouchers is 200000. Then the groups dictionary has at most 200000 keys, but each key has a list of vouchers (so the total length is 200000).\n\n            Then, the outer loop runs at most 100000 times (because we skip half of the keys). For each key, we do:\n\n                Build two structures for g2 (if not built already) for the group d2. But wait: we are iterating by d, and d2 = x-d. Then we might build the same structure multiple times for the same d2? \n\n            We can cache the structures for each group. But note: d2 might be repeated (if x-d equals d2 for multiple d). Then we can precompute for each group the two structures (by l and by r) and store them in a dictionary.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Precomputation for a group (list L of (l, r, cost)):\n\n                    Structure1 (for Case1): \n                        sorted_by_l = sorted(L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                        Then, we extract the l values and the costs, and then build an array for the minimal cost from a given l onward.\n\n                    Structure2 (for Case2):\n                        sorted_by_r = sorted(L, key=lambda x: x[1])\n                        Then, we extract the r values and the costs, and then build an array for the minimal cost from the beginning to a given r.\n\n                Then, we can store:\n\n                    group_structures = {}\n                    for d, vouchers in groups.items():\n                        if d not in group_structures:\n                            # build the two structures for this group and store them\n                            sorted_by_l = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                            # Then, we want to build a suffix minimum array for the sorted_by_l by l.\n                            # But note: there might be multiple vouchers with the same l. We want the minimal cost for any voucher with l >= current_l.\n\n                            # Extract the l values and the costs, and then do:\n                            #   Let arr = sorted_by_l\n                            #   Let l_vals = [a[0] for a in arr]\n                            #   Let costs = [a[2] for a in arr]\n\n                            # Then, we can do:\n                            #   suffix_min[i] = min(costs[i:])\n                            #   But we want to query by a threshold T (minimal l",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently grouping the vouchers by their duration and then checking for compatible pairs that meet the non-overlapping condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration (i.e., the number of days they last). This helps in quickly accessing all vouchers that can form a pair with a given duration.\n2. **Processing Pairs**: For each duration `d`, we check if there exists another duration `d2 = x - d` in the groups. If such a duration exists, we process the pairs between vouchers of duration `d` and `d2`.\n3. **Non-Overlapping Conditions**: For each voucher in the first group, we check two conditions with all vouchers in the second group:\n   - **Condition 1**: The end date of the first voucher is before the start date of the second voucher (`r1 < l2`).\n   - **Condition 2**: The end date of the second voucher is before the start date of the first voucher (`r2 < l1`).\n4. **Efficient Querying**: To efficiently find the minimal cost voucher in the second group that meets either condition, we preprocess the second group by sorting it by start and end dates and building suffix and prefix minimum arrays for costs. This allows us to perform binary searches and fetch the minimal cost in logarithmic time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index]); r = int(data[index+1]); cost_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_val))\n        \n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for (l, r, cost_val) in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        groups[d].append((l, r, cost_val))\n        \n    ans = 10**18\n    \n    group_structures = {}\n    \n    def build_structures(v_list):\n        sorted_by_l = sorted(v_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        l_vals = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_l]\n        costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_l]\n        n2 = len(sorted_by_l)\n        suffix_min = [0] * n2\n        cur_min = 10**18\n        for i in range(n2-1, -1, -1):\n            if costs[i] < cur_min:\n                cur_min = costs[i]\n            suffix_min[i] = cur_min\n            \n        sorted_by_r = sorted(v_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        r_vals = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_r]\n        costs_r = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_r]\n        prefix_min = [0] * n2\n        cur_min2 = 10**18\n        for i in range(n2):\n            if costs_r[i] < cur_min2:\n                cur_min2 = costs_r[i]\n            prefix_min[i] = cur_min2\n            \n        return (l_vals, suffix_min), (r_vals, prefix_min)\n    \n    for d in list(groups.keys()):\n        d2 = x - d\n        if d2 not in groups:\n            continue\n        if d > d2:\n            continue\n            \n        key1 = (d, d2)\n        key2 = (d2, d)\n        \n        if d == d2:\n            g1 = groups[d]\n            g2 = g1\n            if d not in group_structures:\n                structures = build_structures(g1)\n                group_structures[d] = structures\n            else:\n                structures = group_structures[d]\n            struct1, struct2 = structures\n            l_arr, suffix_min_arr = struct1\n            r_arr, prefix_min_arr = struct2\n            \n            for (l1, r1, cost1) in g1:\n                pos1 = bisect.bisect_right(l_arr, r1)\n                if pos1 < len(l_arr):\n                    candidate1 = cost1 + suffix_min_arr[pos1]\n                    if candidate1 < ans:\n                        ans = candidate1\n                    \n                pos2 = bisect.bisect_left(r_arr, l1) - 1\n                if pos2 >= 0:\n                    candidate2 = cost1 + prefix_min_arr[pos2]\n                    if candidate2 < ans:\n                        ans = candidate2\n        else:\n            g1 = groups[d]\n            g2 = groups[d2]\n            if d2 not in group_structures:\n                structures_g2 = build_structures(g2)\n                group_structures[d2] = structures_g2\n            if d not in group_structures:\n                structures_g1 = build_structures(g1)\n                group_structures[d] = structures_g1\n                \n            struct1, struct2 = group_structures[d2]\n            l_arr2, suffix_min_arr2 = struct1\n            r_arr2, prefix_min_arr2 = struct2\n            \n            for (l1, r1, cost1) in g1:\n                pos1 = bisect.bisect_right(l_arr2, r1)\n                if pos1 < len(l_arr2):\n                    candidate1 = cost1 + suffix_min_arr2[pos1]\n                    if candidate1 < ans:\n                        ans = candidate1\n                    \n                pos2 = bisect.bisect_left(r_arr2, l1) - 1\n                if pos2 >= 0:\n                    candidate2 = cost1 + prefix_min_arr2[pos2]\n                    if candidate2 < ans:\n                        ans = candidate2\n                        \n    if ans == 10**18:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import bisect\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each characterized by start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration (end day - start day + 1) into a dictionary where keys are durations and values are lists of vouchers.\n3. **Building Structures**: For each duration, we build two structures:\n   - **By Start Date**: Sorted by start date and a suffix minimum array for costs to quickly find the minimal cost voucher starting after a given date.\n   - **By End Date**: Sorted by end date and a prefix minimum array for costs to quickly find the minimal cost voucher ending before a given date.\n4. **Checking Pairs**: For each duration `d` and its complement `d2 = x - d`, we check all pairs of vouchers from `d` and `d2` to see if they meet the non-overlapping conditions. Using binary search on the precomputed structures, we efficiently find the minimal cost pairs.\n5. **Output Result**: The minimal cost found during the checks is printed, or `-1` if no valid pair exists.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly find the optimal solution by leveraging grouping and preprocessing for quick lookups.",
