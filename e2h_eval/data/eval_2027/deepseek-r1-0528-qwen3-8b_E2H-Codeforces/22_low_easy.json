After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: first line has n and m, then n lines with m characters (each row is a string of m digits)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines (each containing m characters) and store as a list of strings.\n\n However, note: the input example is given as a string that includes the two integers and then the marks.\n But the problem says: \n   The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters...\n\n But the example input is provided as:\n   ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n However, in competitive programming, we usually read from stdin.\n\n Let's assume the input is provided in standard input. We can do:\n\n   import sys\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n Then the first line is split by space to get n and m.\n\n Alternatively, if we are reading from the console, we can use:\n\n   line1 = input().split()\n   n = int(line1[0]); m = int(line1[1])\n\n   Then for i in range(n):\n        s = input().strip()\n\n But note: the example input is given as a string that might have been split by newlines.\n\n Since the problem says the input format, we'll read accordingly.\n\n Approach:\n\n For each subject j (column), we want to know the maximum mark. Then, for each student i (row),\n we want to check if there exists at least one subject j such that:\n      grade[i][j] == max_mark[j]   [and note: there might be multiple students with the same max_mark, but that's okay because being best means having the max, even if shared]\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the best\" at a subject if there is no student with a higher mark. So having the same mark doesn't prevent being best? Actually, the definition is: \n      \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\n This means that if the maximum mark in the subject is x, then every student with mark x is considered best at that subject.\n\n Therefore, a student is successful if he is best in at least one subject.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n and m.\n 2. Read the grid of marks (list of n strings, each of length m)\n\n 3. For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark (as an integer or character, but we can compare characters since '9' > '1').\n\n 4. For each student i (from 0 to n-1), check for any subject j (from 0 to m-1) such that:\n        grid[i][j] == max_mark[j]   (but note: we must compare the character version? Actually, the marks are given as characters, so we can compare the characters)\n\n    However, we computed the maximum for each subject by looking at the characters? But the problem uses digits from '1' to '9'. \n\n    Alternatively, we can convert to integers or keep as characters. Since the characters '1' to '9' are lexically ordered the same as numerically, we can use either.\n\n 5. Count the number of students for which there exists at least one subject j where the student's mark is equal to the maximum mark of that subject.\n\n Example: \n     Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n     Step 3: For each column (subject) j:\n        j=0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n        j=1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n        j=2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n     Step 4: For each student (row):\n        Student0: \"223\"\n            subject0: '2' == '2' -> True, so successful (we break for this student)\n        Student1: \"232\"\n            subject0: '2' == '2' -> True\n        Student2: \"112\"\n            subject0: '1' != '2'; subject1: '1' != '3'; subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n     So output is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Note: There might be multiple students achieving the same maximum, so we just need to know for each subject what the maximum is.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The first line contains two integers, `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent `n` lines each contain a string of `m` characters representing the marks of each student in all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject:** For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students:** For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result:** Print the total number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    max_marks = [max(grid[j][k] for j in range(n)) for k in range(m)]\n    \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for k in range(m):\n            if grid[i][k] == max_marks[k]:\n                count += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read from standard input. The first line is split into `n` and `m`. The next `n` lines are read as strings representing each student's marks.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks:** For each subject (each column in the grid), the maximum mark is determined by comparing all marks in that column across all students.\n3. **Counting Successful Students:** Each student is checked against the maximum marks of all subjects. If a student has the highest mark in any subject, they are counted as successful. The loop breaks early for each student once a successful subject is found to optimize performance.\n4. **Output:** The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects, leveraging early termination during the inner loop to optimize the solution. The complexity is O(n*m), which is optimal given the constraints (n and m up to 100).",
