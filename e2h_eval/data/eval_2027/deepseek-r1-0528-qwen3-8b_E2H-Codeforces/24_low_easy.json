She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The cursor starts at `pos` and we need to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r`.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor left or right (if there are unclosed tabs in that direction) one tab per second.\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (one operation per second).\n\n After closing, the segment [a, b] is defined by the remaining tabs. Initially, a=1, b=n.\n\n However, note that we can also consider that we must close all tabs outside [l, r]. There are two parts to close:\n   - All tabs with indices < l (left part)\n   - All tabs with indices > r (right part)\n\n The problem can be broken down as:\n   Option 1: Close the left part first and then the right part.\n   Option 2: Close the right part first and then the left part.\n   Option 3: If the cursor is already inside [l, r] and we don't have to move, then we might do nothing.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the entire set of tabs is already the desired segment [l, r] (i.e., if l == 1 and r == n), then answer 0.\n\n 2. We consider two main strategies:\n    a) Go to the left boundary (l) and then close the left side (if any) and then close the right side (if any) from the left boundary?\n        Actually, we can break it into two independent closures: left closure and right closure.\n\n    However, note the operations:\n      - Closing the left side: requires being at a position i such that i <= l (but actually, we can close the left side from any position, but the condition for closing the left side is that we must have some tabs to the left? The problem states: \"close all the tabs to the left\" meaning the tabs from [a, i-1] (current minimum index to i-1). Similarly for the right.\n\n    But note: the problem allows us to move the cursor arbitrarily (within the current unclosed tabs) and then perform a closure.\n\n    Since the goal is to leave [l, r], we must close everything outside. We can think:\n\n    We have two boundaries to close: \n        Left boundary: we must close all tabs from 1 to l-1.\n        Right boundary: we must close all tabs from r+1 to n.\n\n    How to close the left part?\n        We must move the cursor to a tab that is at least l (so that when we close the left, we don't accidentally close part of [l, r])? Actually, note: the closure operation doesn't require that the cursor is exactly at l. It will close from the current minimum index (which is initially 1) to i-1. So if we are at a tab i (which must be >= l) and we close the left, then we close from the current a (which is 1) to i-1. But we want to leave [l, r], so we cannot close anything below l. Therefore, we must ensure that we don't close below l until we are sure that we've closed the left part appropriately.\n\n    Actually, the problem says: we start with all tabs open, and after each closure the segment becomes [a, b] where a is the smallest index of an unclosed tab and b the largest.\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to close only the left or the right, and the closure operation uses the current a and b (the current remaining tabs). But wait, the problem says: \"In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively.\"\n\n    So after closing, the segment is updated.\n\n    We can consider two ways:\n\n    Approach 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n\n        Steps:\n          1. Move the cursor from `pos` to `l` (if `pos` is to the left of `l`, then we move right; if to the right, then we move left). But wait, if we are going to close the left part, we must be at a tab that is at least `l` (because if we are at a tab < l, then closing the left would close from a (which is 1) to i-1, which includes [l-?] and we might close too much). Actually, no: the closure operation does not require the cursor to be at the boundary. However, if we are at a tab i (which is < l) then closing the left would close from 1 to i-1, and then the new a becomes i (if i>=1) and the segment becomes [i, b]. Then we still have to close",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target segments and considering the most efficient sequence of operations (moving the cursor or closing tabs) to achieve the desired result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires closing all tabs outside the segment [l, r]. The cursor starts at a given position, and each operation (moving left/right or closing left/right) takes one second. The key observation is that the optimal strategy involves either:\n   - Closing the left part first, then the right part.\n   - Closing the right part first, then the left part.\n   \n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - If the entire range of tabs is already within [l, r], no operations are needed.\n   - Otherwise, calculate the time required for both strategies (closing left first vs. closing right first) and choose the minimum.\n   - The time to move the cursor to the boundary (either l or r) and perform the closure operations must be considered.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Case 1**: If the cursor is already within [l, r], the answer is the minimum time to close either the left or right segment without moving the cursor.\n   - **Case 2**: If the cursor is outside [l, r], compute the time required to move to the nearest boundary (l or r) and then close the respective segments.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    ans = float('inf')\n    \n    if l < r:\n        # Case when there are tabs to close on both sides.\n        # Option 1: Close the left part first.\n        moves_left = abs(pos - l)\n        time_left_first = moves_left + 1  # Move to l and then close left\n        \n        # Option 2: Close the right part first.\n        moves_right = abs(pos - r)\n        time_right_first = moves_right + 1  # Move to r and then close right\n        \n        ans = min(time_left_first, time_right_first)\n    else:\n        # Only one side needs to be closed.\n        if pos < l:\n            time_needed = l - pos + 1\n        elif pos > r:\n            time_needed = pos - r + 1\n        else:\n            time_needed = 0\n            \n        ans = time_needed\n\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If the segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., l is 1 and r is n), the answer is 0 since no operations are needed.\n- **Both Sides to Close**: If both left and right segments need closing, the solution calculates the time required to move the cursor to either l or r (whichever is closer) and then close the respective segments. The minimum time between these two options is chosen.\n- **One Side to Close**: If only one side needs closing (either left or right), the solution directly computes the time to move the cursor to the boundary (l or r) and close the segment. If the cursor is already within [l, r], no operations are needed (time 0).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to two primary strategies, ensuring the minimal time is always selected by comparing the results of both strategies.",
