    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000) and we need to output two integers: \n   n = minimum number of nodes required to have exactly p pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability.\n   m = maximum number of unidirectional pairs (over all edges in the graph) in such a graph with n nodes.\n\n Note: The condition for p-reachable is that the graph must contain exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) (with u < v) such that u and v are mutually reachable.\n\n Observation:\n In a directed graph, mutual reachability forms equivalence classes (strongly connected components). However, note that the problem counts only pairs (u, v) with u < v.\n\n Let the graph have k strongly connected components (SCCs). Then, within each SCC, every pair (u, v) with u != v is mutually reachable. So the number of mutual pairs inside one SCC of size s is C(s,2) = s*(s-1)//2.\n\n But note: the problem says \"exactly p\" ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability.\n\n Also, there might be edges between different SCCs? However, if we have a DAG of SCCs, then there are no mutual reachabilities across different SCCs (by definition). Therefore, the total mutual pairs is the sum over each SCC of C(s_i,2).\n\n Moreover, we can arrange the graph as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of these SCCs, and we can even choose the DAG structure arbitrarily (as long as it's a DAG). However, note that the problem does not require the entire graph to be strongly connected; just that the number of mutual pairs (i.e., pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability) is exactly p.\n\n How do we form the graph?\n\n We are free to design the graph. We want the minimum number of nodes n (so the sum of the sizes of the SCCs) such that there exists a decomposition of n into k positive integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_k (each at least 1) so that:\n      sum_{i=1}^{k} [s_i*(s_i-1)//2] = p\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the entire graph is decomposed into SCCs and then connected arbitrarily (but without cycles between the SCCs). Actually, we can also have multiple SCCs and then connect them arbitrarily (without creating new mutual pairs). The condition is that the mutual pairs are exactly the ones within the SCCs.\n\n But wait: what if we have two SCCs and we add an edge from one to the other and vice versa? Then they would merge into one SCC. So to keep the mutual pairs as the sum of the C(s_i,2) we must have no edges between SCCs (or if we do, then they would become one component). Alternatively, we can have a DAG structure (with edges only from one component to another but not back) so that the mutual pairs remain only within the SCCs.\n\n So the problem reduces to: Represent p as the sum of triangular numbers (each triangular number T(s) = s*(s-1)//2) from parts that are positive integers (the sizes of the SCCs). We wish to minimize the total number of nodes, which is the sum of the sizes. However, note: the same node cannot be split. We are forming disjoint SCCs (each node belongs to exactly one SCC). \n\n But note: the condition of the problem is that the graph is p-reachable, meaning the total number of mutual pairs (each mutual pair being an unordered pair {u,v} with u<v, but counted once because we consider u<v) is p. However, we can also have multiple SCCs.\n\n However, note: the problem does not say that the graph must be connected. We can have multiple SCCs.\n\n Now, we wish to minimize the total number of nodes (n) such that we can write p as the sum of some triangular numbers (each corresponding to an SCC). But note: the triangular numbers are defined for integers s>=1: T(1)=0, T(2)=1, T(3)=3, T(4)=6, etc.\n\n So, we are to represent p as the sum of several triangular numbers (each term is T(s_i) for s_i>=1). And we want to minimize the total n = s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_k.\n\n Why is this minimal? Because if we use an SCC of size s, then we get T(s) = s*(s-1)//2 mutual pairs and we use s nodes.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to break the graph arbitrarily. But we must use the minimal total nodes. \n\n Example: p=3. We can use one SCC",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable, meaning it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) where u < v and u and v are mutually reachable. Additionally, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we need to find the maximum number of unidirectional node pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Mutual Reachability**: In a directed graph, mutual reachability between two nodes u and v (u ≠ v) means there exists a path from u to v and from v to u. These pairs form strongly connected components (SCCs). The number of such pairs for an SCC of size s is given by the triangular number T(s) = s*(s-1)/2.\n\n2. **Problem Transformation**: The problem reduces to finding a set of integers (sizes of SCCs) such that the sum of their triangular numbers equals p, and the sum of these integers (total nodes) is minimized. \n\n3. **Greedy Algorithm for Minimal Nodes**: To minimize the total number of nodes, we should use as many large SCCs as possible because larger SCCs contribute more triangular numbers per node. Specifically, we use SCCs of size 2 (contributing 1 pair per 2 nodes), size 3 (contributing 3 pairs per 3 nodes), etc.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: \n   - If p is 0, the graph has no edges, so the minimal node count is 0 or 1 (depending on interpretation, but typically 0 nodes).\n   - For small values of p (like 1 or 2), specific checks are needed since triangular numbers start from 0 (for size 1) and increase.\n\n5. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: After determining the minimal node configuration, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is calculated by considering all possible edges not present in the SCCs. This involves counting edges between different SCCs in a way that maximizes unidirectional pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    try:\n        p = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    if p == 1:\n        print(\"2 0\")\n        return\n        \n    if p == 2:\n        print(\"3 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = 0\n    remaining = p\n    while remaining > 0:\n        if remaining >= 3:\n            n += 3\n            remaining -= 3\n        elif remaining == 2:\n            n += 2\n            remaining -= 2\n        elif remaining == 1:\n            n += 2\n            remaining -= 1\n            break\n        else:\n            n += 1\n            remaining -= 0\n            break\n            \n    if remaining == 0:\n        print(f\"{n} 0\")\n    else:\n        n += 2\n        print(f\"{n} {n*(n-1)//2}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which is a single integer p.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: Directly handle cases where p is 0, 1, or 2 by printing specific results.\n3. **Main Loop**: The loop calculates the minimal number of nodes by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible triangular number (3) from p until the remaining value is less than 3. For remaining values 1 or 2, it adjusts the node count accordingly.\n4. **Output**: If the remaining value is zero after the loop, the node count is printed with zero unidirectional pairs. Otherwise, the node count is adjusted, and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is calculated using the formula for triangular numbers.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal node configuration and maximizes unidirectional pairs by leveraging properties of triangular numbers and greedy selection of SCC sizes.",
