For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (tone index) in a 12-note circle.\n    Let's assign:\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 11   # Note: In some systems, H is B, but here we have 12 notes and the problem says after H is C, so we use 0-based index.\n\n 2. However, note that the input might have different representations. For example, the note \"B\" is 10 and \"H\" is 11, and then back to C=0.\n\n 3. Since the chord is unordered, we can consider all permutations of the three notes.\n\n 4. For each permutation (x, y, z) (which we will consider as an ordered triplet for checking the condition), we require that the distances (in semitones) from x to y and y to z are such that:\n    - For major: (y - x) % 12 == 4 and (z - y) % 12 == 3, and then (z - x) % 12 should be 7 (but the condition is on consecutive steps).\n    - For minor: (y - x) % 12 == 3 and (z - y) % 12 == 4.\n\n 5. But note: because the musical scale is cyclic, we need to compute the distance modulo 12. However, when we subtract, we might get negative. So we do:\n\n    Let d1 = (index(y) - index(x)) % 12\n    But if negative, we adjust: we can use (index(y) - index(x)) % 12, but note that modulus for negative? Actually, we can compute the circular distance by:\n\n    Instead, let's map the notes to numbers and then for two notes a and b, the distance from a to b going upwards (without wrapping) might not be the same as going downwards. However, the problem states: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n\n    But note: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we don't wrap backwards? Actually, wait: the example says between E and C is 8 semitones. That means that when we go from E to C, we are actually going up 8 semitones (because from E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, ... until C). So the distance is defined as the smallest non-negative steps in the forward direction (cyclically) until we reach the note again, but the problem does not specify minimal distance. \n\n    However, the definition for the chord is: \n        Major: there exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3 (so total from X to Z is 7). \n        Minor: distance from X to Y is 3 and from Y to Z is 4.\n\n    But note: the entire octave is 12 semitones. The distance from E to C is 8, because we go E->F(1)->F#(2)->G(3)->G#(4)->A(5)->A#(?) Wait, no, let me count:\n\n    E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C -> that's 8 steps (from E to C: E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, F# to G is 3, G to G# is 4, G# to A is 5, A to A# is 6, A# to B is 7, B to C is 8). \n\n    However, the problem states the distance from E to C is 8. So we must compute the distance from a lower note to a higher note (without wrapping) in the cyclic scale? But wait, if we have two notes, say E and C, and we are considering the ordering, we must consider the entire circle.\n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Each note is mapped to a numerical value representing its position in the 12-note musical scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11). This mapping helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation of the three notes, compute the semitone distances between consecutive notes. The chord is considered major if there exists an ordering where the first interval is 4 semitones and the second is 3 semitones. Conversely, it is minor if the first interval is 3 semitones and the second is 4 semitones.\n3. **Chord Classification**: If any permutation meets the major or minor criteria, the chord is classified accordingly. If no permutation meets either criterion, the chord is labeled \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes = input().split()\n    note_to_index = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1, 'Db': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3, 'Eb': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6, 'Gb': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8, 'Ab': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n    n = len(indices)\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `note_to_index` dictionary maps each musical note to its corresponding position in the 12-note scale. This allows us to convert the input notes into numerical values for distance calculations.\n2. **Permutations Handling**: The code generates all possible permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, it calculates the semitone distances between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Chord Check**: For each permutation, the code checks if the distances between the notes match the criteria for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones).\n4. **Result Determination**: Based on the checks, the code outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if none of the permutations meet the criteria. The solution efficiently handles all edge cases by considering all possible orderings of the input notes.",
