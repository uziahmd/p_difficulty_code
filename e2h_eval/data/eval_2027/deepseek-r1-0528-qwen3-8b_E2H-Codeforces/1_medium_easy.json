    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n Conditions: \n   The plate is w x h.\n   We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), the second 2 cells away, etc.\n   Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n How to compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n   The i-th ring is defined on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n   However, note that the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n   But note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (so the outermost ring) and the second one 2 cells away.\n\n   The formula for the perimeter (which is the number of cells) of a rectangle of size a x b is: 2*a + 2*b.\n   However, note that in a grid, the border of an a x b grid actually has:\n        top and bottom: a * 2\n        left and right: but note that the corners are counted twice? Actually, no: if we break it down:\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: \n        The total cells in the border = (a * b) for the entire rectangle, but wait, we don't want the entire rectangle, just the border.\n\n   Actually, the border of an a x b grid is: \n        top row: a\n        bottom row: a\n        the two middle rows: each has (b-2) for the non-corner parts, so two sides: (b-2)*2\n\n        Total = a + a + (b-2)*2 = 2*a + 2*(b-2) = 2*(a + b - 2)\n\n   However, wait: let me check with a 3x3: \n        Using the formula: 2*(3+3-2) = 2*(4) = 8 -> which matches the example.\n\n   But note: the example input \"3 3 1\" gives output 8.\n\n   However, the problem says: the first ring is the edge of the plate (which is 3x3). So the first ring is the border of 3x3.\n\n   But then what about the second ring? It is 2 cells away from the edge. Then the inner rectangle would be (w-4*(2-1)) = w-4 = 3-4 = -1? \n\n   Wait, the condition also says: k must be at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). For 3x3, min(w,h)=3, then (3+1)//4 = 4//4=1, so k=1 is allowed.\n\n   For the next example: \"7 9 1\" -> output 28.\n\n   Let's compute for 7x9 with k=1 (first ring):\n        The first ring is the border of the 7x9 grid.\n        Using the formula: 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28 -> correct.\n\n   Now, the third example: \"7 9 2\" -> output 40.\n\n   The second ring: \n        The inner rectangle is (7-4*(2-1)) x (9-4*(2-1)) = (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n        Then the border of 3x5: 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6 = 12.\n\n        But wait, the total gilded cells should be the first ring plus the second ring? \n        First ring: 28, second ring: 12 -> 40. Correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not say that the rings are disjoint? Actually, they are concentric and the rings are 1 cell wide, so they are adjacent.\n\n   But wait: the example picture (third example) shows two rings. The first ring is the outer border, then the second ring is inside and doesn't overlap.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of cells for k rings is the sum for i from 1 to k of [the border of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))].\n\n   However, note: the rectangle for the i-th ring must be valid. The problem states k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). This ensures that we don't go beyond zero.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read w, h, k.\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        # Check if w_i and h_i are positive? The condition on k ensures that we stop when the rectangle becomes too small (since k is limited by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)), but note: the rectangle might become negative? \n        # But the condition: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) means that the smallest rectangle we consider is when i=k: \n        #   min_side = min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - 4*((min(w, h)+1)//4 - 1) ... but we don't need to worry because k is bounded.\n\n        # Calculate the border of the rectangle w_i x h_i: \n        #   If w_i or h_i is less than 2, then the border formula doesn't hold (because we subtract 2 for the inner part). However, the condition on k ensures that the rectangle is at least 3x3? Actually, the minimal side is at least 3 (from the problem statement w,h>=3) but then we subtract 4*(k-1). The condition k<=floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) ensures that the minimal side is at least 3 (if k=1) and for k>=2, the minimal side is at least 3-4*(k-1). But wait, the condition k is bounded so that the minimal side is positive.\n\n        # But note: if the rectangle becomes 1x? or 2x?, the border formula still holds? \n        #   For a 1x1: border is 1? But our formula: 2*(1+1-2)=0 -> incorrect.\n        #   For a 2x2: 2*(2+2-2)=4 -> which is correct (each cell is adjacent to the border, but actually a 2x2 has 4 borders). However, the problem says the rings are 1 cell wide and the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. But the definition says: the i-th ring is defined on the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). And the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. \n\n        # However, note the problem says: the first ring goes along the edge of the plate. The plate is at least 3x3. The condition on k ensures we don't get negative dimensions.\n\n        # Since the input constraints guarantee that k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), we know that the smallest side of the inner rectangle for the last ring is at least:\n        #   min_side = min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - 4*((min(w, h)+1)//4 - 1) \n        #   But note: floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) is the maximum k. Let m = min(w, h)\n        #   Then m - 4*(k-1) >= m - 4*((m+1)//4 - 1) \n        #   Let t = (m+1)//4, then k <= t, so k-1 <= t-1.\n        #   Then m - 4*(k-1) >= m - 4*(t-1) = m - 4*((m+1)//4 - 1)\n\n        #   What is m - 4*((m+1)//4 - 1)? \n        #   Example: m=3 -> t=(3+1)//4 = 1 -> then 3-4*(0)=3 (for k=1) -> ok.\n        #   Example: m=7 -> t=(7+1)//4=8//4=2 -> then for k=2: 7-4*(1)=3 -> which is positive.\n\n        #   But note: the minimal value of m is 3, and the formula ensures that the inner rectangle has at least 3 (or 3x something) but wait, if m=4, then t=(4+1)//4=5//4=1 -> so k=1, then the inner rectangle is 4x(h) which is valid.\n\n        #   However, the problem says: the plate is at least 3x3. We don't have to worry about negative or zero because k is bounded.\n\n        #   But note: the formula for the border of an a x b grid (with a>=1, b>=1) is:\n        #       If a==1 and b==1: then border is 1.\n        #       Otherwise, if a>=2 and b>=2, then the border is 2*a + 2*b - 4 (because the four corners are shared by two sides and we subtract the double-counted corners? Actually, we can use: \n        #           border = (a * b) - ((a-2)*(b-2))   [if a>=2 and b>=2] because the inner part is (a-2)*(b-2) and subtract from the whole, but wait: the whole is a*b, so the border is a*b - (a-2)*(b-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n        #   However, if a==1 and b>=1: then the border is b (all cells are on the border). Similarly, if b==1 and a>=1: then the border is a.\n\n        #   But note: the problem states that the ring is defined as the border of the inner rectangle. The inner rectangle must have at least 3x3? Actually, no: the condition only bounds k by the original min(w,h). \n\n        #   However, the problem says: \"the second one — 2 cells away from the edge\", meaning we remove 2 cells from each side. But if we start with a 3x3 and do one ring, then the next ring would require removing 2 from each side, so 3-4= -1, so we don't do that.\n\n        #   But note: the condition on k is given, so we are safe from negative dimensions.\n\n        #   However, we must account for the case when the inner rectangle has a dimension less than 2. \n\n        #   According to the problem, the rings are defined for i from 1 to k, and k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        #   Let's define a function to compute the border of a rectangle of size a x b:\n\n        def border(a, b):\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                return 0\n            if a == 1 or b == 1:\n                # Then the entire rectangle is a single row or column, so the border is the entire rectangle.\n                return a * b\n            else:\n                # Both a and b are at least 2.\n                return 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        But wait, the example 3x3: \n            a=3, b=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n        Example 7x9: \n            a=7, b=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=28 -> correct.\n\n        Example 3x5 (for the second ring in 7x9):\n            a=3, b=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4=12 -> correct.\n\n        However, consider a 1x1: \n            returns 1*1 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        Consider a 1x2: \n            returns 1*2=2 -> correct.\n\n        Consider a 2x2: \n            returns 2*2-4? No, wait: our condition: if a>=2 and b>=2, then use 2*a+2*b-4 -> 2*2+2*2-4 = 4+4-4=4 -> correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the general formula: \n            border = a * b - max(0, (a-2)) * max(0, (b-2))\n\n        But let's test with 1x1: \n            a=1, b=1: 1 - max(0, -1)*max(0,-1) = 1 - 0 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the inner part is (a-2)*(b-2) but only if a>=2 and b>=2. Otherwise, the inner part is 0.\n\n        So we can write:\n            if a < 2 or b < 2:\n                inner = 0\n            else:\n                inner = (a-2)*(b-2)\n            border = a*b - inner\n\n        But wait: for a=1, b=1: 1*1 - 0 = 1 -> correct.\n        For a=2, b=2: 4 - 0 = 4 -> correct.\n        For a=3, b=3: 9 - (1*1)=8 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem states that the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. The inner rectangle is defined by the given dimensions. \n\n        But there is another way: the border of an a x b grid is the entire grid minus the inner (a-2) x (b-2) grid (if a>=2 and b>=2). But if a<2 or b<2, then there is no inner grid (we don't subtract anything).\n\n        So we can use:\n\n        def border(a, b):\n            if a < 2 or b < 2:\n                return a * b\n            else:\n                return a*b - (a-2)*(b-2)\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        border = 0\n        if a>=2 and b>=2:\n            border = 2*a + 2*b - 4\n        else:\n            border = a*b\n\n        But note: the above two formulas are equivalent for a>=2 and b>=2.\n\n        However, we must ensure that the inner rectangle dimensions are positive. Since k is bounded, we don't have to worry about negative, but we do have to worry about zero or one.\n\n        But the problem says: w, h>=3, and k is bounded such that the inner rectangle has positive dimensions? Actually, the inner rectangle for the last ring must be at least 1x1 (if we take the condition: \n            min_side = min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= 1 (because k<=floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) and the minimal side is at least 1). \n\n        However, if the inner rectangle becomes 1x something, then we use the entire rectangle (because we don't subtract an inner part). \n\n        But note: the problem says the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. The border of a 1xN rectangle is the entire rectangle (since there are no inner cells). Similarly for Nx1.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the i-th ring as:\n            a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n            if a_i < 1 or b_i < 1:\n                # Then this ring doesn't exist? But k is bounded so we don't get here. However, to be safe, we break if the dimensions become too small.\n                break\n\n            Then compute the border for a_i x b_i.\n\n        But note: the problem condition on k ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has positive dimensions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate from i=1 to k, and for each i, set a_i and b_i and compute the border.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: if during the iteration one of the dimensions becomes zero or negative, we should break because the ring wouldn't be complete. But the problem condition on k prevents that.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read w, h, k.\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            a = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n            # If either a or b is less than 1, then we break (but k is bounded so normally we don't break, but if k is too large we break early)\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                break\n\n            # Compute the border of the rectangle a x b\n            if a < 2 or b < 2:\n                # Then the entire rectangle is the border\n                total += a * b\n            else:\n                total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        Print(total)\n\n   Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 3 1\"\n            i=1: a=3, b=3 -> else: 2*3+2*3-4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n            i=1: a=7, b=9 -> else: 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=28 -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n            i=1: 7,9 -> 28\n            i=2: a=7-4=3, b=9-4=5 -> else: 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12 -> total=40 -> correct.\n\n        Example 4: \"3 3 2\" -> but wait, k=2: \n            Condition: k<=floor((min(3,3)+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed. So we don't need to test.\n\n        Example 5: \"4 4 1\"\n            k<=floor((4+1)/4)=floor(5/4)=1 -> so k=1 is allowed.\n            a=4, b=4 -> border=2*4+2*4-4=8+8-4=12.\n\n        Let me verify 4x4: \n            The border of 4x4: \n                total cells: 16\n                inner part (without border): (4-2)x(4-2)=2x2=4\n                so border = 16-4=12 -> correct.\n\n        Example 6: \"4 4 2\" -> not allowed because k must be <=1.\n\n        Example 7: \"1x1 is not possible\" because w,h>=3.\n\n        Example 8: \"2x2 is not possible\" because w,h>=3.\n\n        Example 9: \"3x4, k=1\"\n            k<=floor(min(3,4)+1)/4 = floor(4/4)=1 -> allowed.\n            a=3, b=4 -> border=2*3+2*4-4=6+8-4=10.\n\n        Let me check 3x4: \n            Total cells: 12\n            Inner part: (3-2)*(4-2)=1*2=2\n            Border: 12-2=10 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Note: the problem says the plate is w x h, and we are subtracting 4*(i-1) from both dimensions.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the rings are placed 2 cells away from the edge. The first ring is the outer edge (so subtract 0). The second ring is 2 cells away (so subtract 4 from each dimension: 2 from the top, 2 from the bottom, 2 from the left, 2 from the right). This matches.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Read the input line and split into w, h, k.\n\n   Then do the loop.\n\n   But note: the input k is given and we must not exceed k.\n\n   Since the condition on k ensures we don't break the dimensions, we can simply iterate k times.\n\n   However, if k is 0? The problem says k>=1.\n\n   So:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   w = int(data[0])\n   h = int(data[1])\n   k = int(data[2])\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(k):\n        a = w - 4*i\n        b = h - 4*i\n        if a < 1 or b < 1:\n            # We break early if the current ring's rectangle is invalid.\n            # But note: the problem condition ensures k is valid, but if we break early, we are done.\n            break\n        if a < 2 or b < 2:\n            total += a * b\n        else:\n            total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   Print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the problem defines the i-th ring with inner rectangle (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). In our loop above, for i=0 (first ring) we use 4*0=0, then i=1 (second ring) we use 4*1=4. That matches.\n\n   But note: the problem indexes from 1 to k, and we are using i from 0 to k-1, so the i-th ring (starting at i=0) is the (i+1)-th ring.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            a = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   But the above code uses i from 0 to k-1, which is equivalent.\n\n   Let me test with k=1: \n        i=0: a = w - 0, b = h - 0 -> correct.\n\n   So both are equivalent.\n\n   However, I prefer the direct indexing by the ring number. But the above loop is also correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says the first ring is the outer one, then the second is 2 away, etc. So the i-th ring (with i starting at 1) is the one that is (i-1)*2 cells away from the edge.\n\n   Our loop with i from 0 to k-1: \n        Ring number 1: i=0 -> subtract 0.\n        Ring number 2: i=1 -> subtract 4.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let's run the example \"7 9 2\": \n        i=0: a=7, b=9 -> add 2*7+2*9-4=28\n        i=1: a=7-4=3, b=9-4=5 -> add 2*3+2*5-4=12, total=40.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem condition says k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n   But we break early if the inner rectangle becomes invalid (a<1 or b<1). This is safe.\n\n   But note: the condition on k ensures that we don't break until the last ring, so we will always do k rings if k is within the bound. However, if k is too large (like k=2 for a 3x3, which is not allowed by the condition but the input condition says k is bounded) then we break early.\n\n   The problem says: \"where ⌊ x ⌋ denotes the number x rounded down\", so the input k satisfies 1<=k<=floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n   Therefore, we don't need to worry about breaking early due to invalid k? Because k is provided as per the condition.\n\n   But to be safe, we break early if the rectangle becomes invalid (which could happen if k is larger than the condition, but the problem says k is bounded). However, the problem states the input constraints, so we assume k is valid.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Let me write the code.\n\n   One more thing: the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, so we don't have to worry about w or h less than 3.\n\n   Code:\n\n   w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(k):\n        a = w - 4*i\n        b = h - 4*i\n        if a < 1 or b < 1:\n            break\n        if a < 2 or b < 2:\n            total += a * b\n        else:\n            total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   print(total)\n\n   Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> 8\n   Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> 28\n   Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> 40\n\n   All correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the plate is 10x10 and k=2?\n        First ring: 10x10 -> 2*10+2*10-4 = 20+20-4=36\n        Second ring: 10-4=6, 10-4=6 -> 2*6+2*6-4=12+12-4=20\n        Total=56.\n\n   Let me verify: \n        Entire 10x10: 100 cells.\n        First ring: 36\n        Then the second ring is the border of the 6x6: which is 6*6 - (4*4)=36-16=20 -> correct.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. In a 10x10, the first ring is the outer edge, the second ring is the next inner edge (so 2 cells in from each side) and the inner rectangle is 6x6. Then the border of 6x6 is 20.\n\n   Therefore, we output 56.\n\n   Another test: 5x5, k=1: \n        a=5, b=5 -> 2*5+2*5-4=10+10-4=16.\n\n   Entire 5x5: 25 cells, inner 3x3=9, so border=16 -> correct.\n\n   So the code is ready.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. Our calculation is based on the entire grid being w x h.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Let's run the provided examples again.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: 3 3 1 -> 8\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: 7 9 1 -> 28\n\n   Example 3: \n        Input: 7 9 2 -> 40\n\n   We output these numbers.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings: ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2'] but our code reads one line.\n\n   The problem says: \"The only line contains three integers\"\n\n   So we read one line.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is defined by its distance from the edge of the plate, and each ring has a width of 1 cell. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the total number of cells covered by `k` concentric rings. Each ring is the border of an inner rectangle formed by reducing the original plate dimensions by 4 cells (2 cells from each side) for each subsequent ring. \n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring, the number of cells in its border can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted for grid cells. Specifically, for a rectangle of size `a x b`, the border cells are given by `2*a + 2*b - 4` if both dimensions are at least 2. If either dimension is less than 2, the entire rectangle's cells are considered part of the border.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each ring from 1 to `k`. For each ring, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from the original width and height. Then, use the appropriate formula to calculate the border cells for that rectangle and accumulate the total count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, where `k` is the number of rings. Since `k` is bounded by the problem constraints (specifically, `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4`), this approach is efficient and handles all edge cases within the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        a = w - 4 * i\n        b = h - 4 * i\n        if a < 1 or b < 1:\n            break\n        if a < 2 or b < 2:\n            total += a * b\n        else:\n            total += 2 * a + 2 * b - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` from standard input, representing the plate's dimensions and the number of rings.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 0 to `k-1` (since Python uses 0-based indexing), the code calculates the dimensions of the current inner rectangle by subtracting `4*i` from both the width and height (accounting for 2 cells from each side).\n3. **Check Validity**: If either dimension becomes negative or zero, the loop breaks early as further rings would not be valid.\n4. **Calculate Border Cells**: Depending on whether the current dimensions are less than 2, the code either adds the product of the dimensions (if the rectangle is entirely a border) or uses the perimeter formula `2*a + 2*b - 4` to count the border cells.\n5. **Output Result**: The accumulated total of gilded cells is printed after processing all valid rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the problem constraints.",
