Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of old candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour and then becomes one burned candle.\n   - After using the initial candles, we can collect all the burned ones to make new candles.\n\n However, note that we can also use the newly made candles and when they burn out, we can combine their leftovers to make even more.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Start with 'a' candles. This gives us 'a' hours of light and produces 'a' burned candles.\n 2. Then, we can use the burned candles to create new candles. Specifically, for every 'b' burned candles, we get one new candle.\n\n But note: we don't have to wait until we run out of new candles to start burning them? Actually, we can use the burned candles from the initial set to make new ones, and then burn those new ones and collect their burned ones as well.\n\n We can simulate:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   burned = 0\n\n However, there is a more efficient way:\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n   total_hours = a   (because we start with a candles)\n   Then, we have a burned candles. We can turn these into floor(a / b) new candles, and we have leftover = a % b burned candles.\n\n Then, we can burn these new candles, which will give us additional floor(a/b) hours and also floor(a/b) more burned candles.\n\n So the recurrence is:\n   total_hours = a + (a // b) + (a // (b * ?)) ... but note that after the first cycle, the number of candles we have for the next cycle is (a // b) [the new candles] plus the leftover (a % b).\n\n Actually, we can use a while loop:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current = a\n   while current > 0:\n        hours += current   # because we burn all current candles\n        # Now we have current burned candles (from the ones we just burned)\n        # How many new candles can we make?\n        current = current // b   # integer division, but note: we can also keep the remainder\n        # However, we must account for the fact that we might have leftover burned candles from previous cycles.\n\n But wait, in the above simulation, we are not accounting for the leftover. Let's break down:\n\n   Step 1: Start with a candles -> burn them: hours += a, then we have a burned candles.\n        Then, we make a // b new candles, and we have a % b burned candles left.\n\n   Then, the next cycle: we have (a // b) new candles and (a % b) leftover burned candles. So the total available for burning in the next cycle is (a // b) + (a % b) ?\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use the leftover burned candles from the previous cycle. So we should combine the burned candles from the entire process.\n\n Another approach is to use a variable for the total burned candles and then the total candles we can get from recycling.\n\n We can do:\n\n   total = a   # this is the initial burning\n   candles = a\n   while candles >= b:\n        # We can convert 'candles' burned candles into new candles: how many? candles // b, and we leave remainder (candles % b)\n        new_candles = candles // b\n        total += new_candles   # because we burn these new_candles for new_candles hours\n        # Then, we have new_candles burned candles from this burning, but also we have the leftover from the division (candles % b) which are burned candles we haven't used yet.\n        # Actually, we need to consider: the total burned candles from the previous cycles is stored in 'candles'. Then we use some of them to make new_candles, so we update:\n        # The leftover burned candles from the current set is (candles % b) and the new burned candles from the new_candles we just burned is new_candles, so total burned candles for the next cycle is (candles % b) + new_candles.\n\n        candles = candles // b + candles % b   # This is incorrect because the next cycle's candles are actually the new_candles we made and the leftover from the previous set.\n\n Wait, let me clarify: \n   In the first cycle: we start with 'a' candles. We burn them and get 'a' burned candles.\n   Then we make a//b new candles and have a % b leftovers.\n\n   Now, the next cycle we have (a//b) new candles to burn and we also have the leftover (a % b) burned candles. So the total candles we have for the next cycle is (a//b) + (a % b). \n\n But note: the burning process in the second cycle will burn (a//b + a % b) candles and then we get (a//b + a % b) burned candles again.\n\n However, the problem is that the leftover burned candles from the first cycle are not part of the candles we can burn until we combine them with the new ones.\n\n Actually, we can model it by:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_burned = 0\n   current_new = a\n\n   But that might be complicated.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a mathematical formula or iterative method.\n\n Here's a better iterative method:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current = a\n   while current > 0:\n        hours += current\n        # Now, we have 'current' burned candles (from the ones we just burned)\n        # We can make new_candles = current // b, and then the remaining burned candles are current % b.\n        # But note: the new_candles are going to be burned in the next iteration, and we will have the current % b leftover.\n        # So the total candles we have for the next iteration is new_candles (which we will burn) plus the leftover (current % b) which we carry over.\n\n        # However, the problem is that we cannot separate the current burned candles arbitrarily. Actually, we are allowed to use any burned candles to make new ones.\n\n        # But note: the process is: we burn all available candles (so we burn the current candles, which are the ones we had at the beginning of the iteration). Then we form as many new candles as possible from the total burned ones (which is the same as current) and then we have leftover = current % b.\n\n        # However, the above while loop would then set current to the number of new candles we just made (without adding the leftover) because we did:\n\n        #   new_candles = current // b\n        #   leftover = current % b\n        #   then we set current to new_candles, and then we lose the leftover?\n\n        # Actually, we need to remember that we have leftover burned candles that we didn't use. So we should update current to be new_candles (because we just made new_candles) and then add the leftover to the next cycle's burned candles.\n\n        # But wait: in the next cycle, we are going to burn the new_candles, and then we will have new_candles burned candles. Then we combine the leftover from the previous cycle with the new burned ones.\n\n        # However, the above while loop does not account for the leftover from the previous cycle. We are only using the current value (which is the number of candles we burned in the last step) to compute the new candles, but we lost the leftover from the previous cycle.\n\n        # Let's try with the example: \"4 2\"\n\n        #   Start: current = 4, hours=0\n        #   Iteration1: hours becomes 4.\n        #        new_candles = 4//2 = 2, leftover = 0.\n        #        Then set current = 2.\n        #   Iteration2: hours becomes 4+2 = 6.\n        #        new_candles = 2//2 = 1, leftover = 0.\n        #        Then set current = 1.\n        #   Iteration3: hours becomes 6+1 = 7.\n        #        new_candles = 1//2 = 0, leftover = 1 -> then current becomes 0, and we break.\n        #   Then we output 7.\n\n        # That matches the example.\n\n        # But wait, what about the leftover from the first cycle? In the first cycle, we had 4 burned candles, and we used them to make 2 new candles. There was no leftover. Then in the second cycle, we burned 2 candles and got 2 burned candles, which we then turned into 1 new candle and had 0 leftover. Then the third cycle we burned 1 candle and then we have 1 burned candle (leftover) and we cannot make a new candle (since 1 < 2) so we stop.\n\n        # However, note: in the example, the problem says: \n        #   For the first four hours, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out, Vasily can make another candle.\n\n        # So the total is 4 (first four hours) + 2 (next two hours) + 1 (last hour) = 7.\n\n        # But in our simulation, we did:\n        #   First iteration: 4 hours, then we set current to 2 (the new candles).\n        #   Second iteration: 2 hours, then we set current to 1 (the new candle from 2 burned ones).\n        #   Third iteration: 1 hour, then we set current to 0.\n\n        # So the total hours is 4+2+1 = 7.\n\n        # However, note that the example says \"Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\"\n\n        # But why did we lose the leftover from the second cycle? Actually, in the second cycle we burned 2 candles and then we had 2 burned candles, then we converted 2 burned candles to 1 new candle and leftover 0. Then the third cycle: we burned 1 candle and then we have 1 burned candle, but we don't use that 1 because 1 < 2.\n\n        # So the code for the example is:\n\n        #   hours = 0\n        #   current = a   # 4\n        #   while current > 0:\n        #       hours += current\n        #       current = current // b   # 4//2 = 2, then 2//2 = 1, then 1//2=0\n        #       # But wait, we are not accounting for the leftover. In the example above, we did not use the leftover because it was zero.\n\n        # However, the above simulation does not account for leftover. But note: the problem allows us to use the burned candles from the entire history. In the above simulation, we are effectively assuming that we can only use the burned candles from the last batch? \n\n        # Actually, the problem doesn't specify the order, so we can use all burned candles together. But the above simulation is valid because:\n\n        #   In the first cycle: we use all a burned candles to make a//b new candles, and we have a % b leftover. Then the next cycle we use the a//b new candles and the leftover (a % b) together? \n\n        # But wait, in our simulation we are not including the leftover from the previous cycle. \n\n        # Let me adjust: we need to keep track of the total burned candles from the entire process, but we can also use the following:\n\n        #   We start with a candles, which burn and become a burned candles.\n        #   Then, we can form a//b new candles, and we have a % b burned candles left.\n\n        #   Then, the next cycle: we have (a//b) + (a % b) burned candles? Actually, no: the next cycle we burn the new candles (which are a//b) and then we get a//b burned candles, and then we add the leftover (a % b). Then we form ( (a//b) + (a % b) ) // b new candles, and leftover = (a//b + a % b) % b.\n\n        # However, note: we don't have to wait until the entire first cycle is done to use the leftover. The process is continuous.\n\n        # But the above simple while loop (using current = current // b) does not account for the leftover, so why did the example work?\n\n        # Because in the example, the leftover was zero at each step. What if we have a non-zero leftover?\n\n        # Example: ['6 3'] -> expected output is 8.\n\n        # Let's simulate with the simple while loop (without leftover):\n\n        #   a=6, b=3\n        #   hours = 0\n        #   current = 6\n        #   Iteration1: hours=6, current = 6//3 = 2\n        #   Iteration2: hours=6+2=8, current=2//3=0 -> stops. Output 8. Matches.\n\n        # Now, consider a different example: a=10, b=3\n\n        #   Expected: \n        #       10 candles -> 10 hours, then 10//3 = 3 new candles and leftover 1.\n        #       Then burn the 3 new candles: 3 hours, then we have 3 burned candles from these, and we also have the leftover 1, so total burned candles for next cycle = 3+1 = 4.\n        #       Then 4//3 = 1 new candle and leftover 1.\n        #       Then burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour, then we have 1 burned candle and leftover 1 (from previous) so total 2, which is less than 3 -> stop.\n        #       Total hours = 10 + 3 + 1 = 14.\n\n        #   Using the simple while loop (without leftover):\n        #       current = 10\n        #       hours += 10 -> 10, current = 10//3 = 3\n        #       hours += 3 -> 13, current = 3//3 = 1\n        #       hours += 1 -> 14, current = 1//3 = 0 -> stop.\n\n        #   So the simple while loop (current = current // b) gives 14, which is correct.\n\n        # Why is that? \n\n        # Explanation: In the first cycle, we start with 10 candles. We burn them (10 hours) and then we have 10 burned candles. We can make 10//3 = 3 new candles and have 1 leftover. But note: the next cycle we are going to use the 3 new candles. The leftover burned candle is still there. However, the simple while loop does not explicitly account for the leftover, but it is implicitly accounted for because the next cycle's candle count is set to 3 (which is the number of new candles). Then after burning these 3, we have 3 burned candles. Now, the total burned candles we have is the 1 leftover from the first cycle plus the 3 from the second cycle. But wait, in the while loop we are not adding the leftover from the first cycle to the second cycle's burned candles.\n\n        # However, in the while loop, the next cycle's candle count is set to the number of new candles we made (which is 3). Then when we burn these 3, we get 3 burned candles. Then we make 3//3=1 new candle. But we are not accounting for the leftover from the first cycle (which is 1) in the second cycle.\n\n        # But note: the problem allows us to use the burned candles from the entire time. However, the way we are simulating is:\n\n        #   We start with a new candles (burned candles = 0 initially, then we burn a and get a burned candles).\n        #   Then we use the burned candles to make a//b new candles, and then we consider the next cycle as having (a//b) new candles. But the leftover burned candles (a % b) are still available and we can use them in the next cycle.\n\n        # In the example above, the leftover (1) is not included in the next cycle's candle count (which is 3). Then after burning the 3, we have 3 burned candles, and then we use the 3 to make 1 candle (and leftover 0) and then we have 1 (from the previous leftover) plus 0? Actually, we are not keeping the leftover.\n\n        # How did we get 14 then? \n\n        # Let's break down the example with the simple while loop:\n\n        #   Step1: current = 10, hours=0 -> add 10, then current = 10//3 = 3.\n        #   Step2: current=3, add 3, then current=3//3=1.\n        #   Step3: current=1, add 1, then current=1//3=0.\n\n        #   Total = 10+3+1=14.\n\n        # But the actual process is:\n\n        #   Cycle1: burn 10 -> 10 hours, then we have 10 burned. Make 10//3 = 3 new candles, and we have 1 burned left.\n        #   Cycle2: burn 3 -> 3 hours, then we have 3 burned from these. Now, we have the leftover 1 from cycle1, so total burned now is 1+3=4. Then we make 4//3=1 new candle, and leftover 1 (from 4%3=1).\n        #   Cycle3: burn 1 -> 1 hour, then we have 1 burned. Now, total burned is 1 (from cycle3) + 1 (leftover from cycle2) = 2, which is less than 3, so we stop.\n\n        #   Total hours = 10+3+1=14.\n\n        # The while loop did not account for the leftover from the first cycle in the second cycle, but it also did not account for the leftover from the second cycle in the third cycle? \n\n        # However, note: the while loop uses the value of current to represent the number of candles we are going to burn. In the second cycle, we set current=3 (the new candles). Then we burn them and set current=1 (the new candles from 3). But we are missing the leftover from the first cycle (1) in the second cycle. \n\n        # But wait, the second cycle starts with 3 candles (the new ones) and then we burn them and get 3 burned. Then we combine the 3 burned with the leftover 1 from the first cycle to get 4 burned. Then we make 4//3=1 new candle and leftover 1. Then the third cycle we burn the 1 new candle and get 1 burned, then we combine the 1 burned with the leftover 1 from the second cycle to get 2 burned (which isn't enough for a new candle).\n\n        # How did the while loop capture that? \n\n        # The key is that the while loop does not require the leftover from the previous cycle to be passed in because the number of candles we are going to burn in the next cycle is determined by the new candles we made. However, the total burned candles (which are the ones we are going to use for the next cycle) are being represented by the new candles we made and the leftovers are being implicitly carried over by the fact that we are using integer division.\n\n        # Actually, the while loop is not capturing the entire picture. The above example shows that we need to account for leftovers. But wait, the while loop gave the correct answer for 10,3. Why?\n\n        # Because the process is:\n\n        #   In the first cycle: we have 10 candles -> burn them, then we make 3 new candles (so we are effectively using 9 of the 10 burned candles). The 10th burned candle is leftover. Then the next cycle we have 3 candles (the new ones). Then we burn them and get 3 burned candles, and then we combine these 3 with the leftover 1 to get 4 burned candles. Then we make 1 new candle from the 4 (using 3 of them) and have 1 leftover.\n\n        #   Then the next cycle we have 1 candle (the new one) and we burn it and get 1 burned, then we combine that 1 with the leftover 1 to get 2, which is not enough.\n\n        # The while loop:\n\n        #   Step1: hours += 10, then current = 10 // 3 = 3.\n        #   Step2: hours += 3, then current = 3 // 3 = 1.\n        #   Step3: hours += 1, then current = 1 // 3 = 0.\n\n        # It counts 10+3+1=14.\n\n        # Why is that? Because the number of candles we burn in the next cycle is the number of new candles we made from the previous cycle's burned candles (including the leftover). But note: the leftover from the first cycle is not added to the current candles for the next cycle. However, the while loop does not need to because:\n\n        #   The total burned candles from the first cycle is 10, and we use 9 to make 3 new candles (leaving 1). Then the second cycle: we burn the 3, which gives 3 burned, and then we use those 3 and the leftover 1 to make 1 new candle. \n\n        #   But the while loop is effectively doing:\n\n        #       Cycle1: 10 -> 10 hours, then we set current to 3 (which is the number of new candles we made from 10).\n        #       Cycle2: 3 -> 3 hours, then we set current to 1 (the new candles we made from 3, but wait we actually had 4 burned candles (3 from cycle2 and 1 leftover) so we should have made 4//3=1.\n\n        #   However, the while loop uses 3 (the current) to compute the next current, and then we lose the leftover. \n\n        #   But wait, the next current is set to 3//3 = 1, which is the same as if we had 4 burned candles: 4//3=1. \n\n        #   Why is that? Because the leftover from the first cycle (1) is effectively already included in the next cycle's candle production? \n\n        #   Actually, no: the next cycle's candle production should be (3 + 1) // 3 = 4//3 = 1. But the while loop does 3//3=1, which is the same. \n\n        #   The reason is that the leftover from the previous cycle is not being stored separately, but when we use the new candles (3) we are effectively using the 9 burned candles from the first cycle (to make the 3) and leaving 1. Then the second cycle produces 3 burned candles, which together with the leftover 1 gives 4. Then 4//3=1.\n\n        #   However, the while loop does not use the leftover from the previous cycle in the next iteration. It only uses the new candles (which are the result of the previous cycle's burned candles) to determine the next cycle's candles. \n\n        #   But note: the total burned candles for the next cycle is the new candles (which we burned) plus any leftover from before. However, the leftover from the previous cycle is not added to the current candles for the next cycle. \n\n        #   Let me reframe: \n\n        #   We have two types of candles: \n        #       Type A: the original and all the new ones we make (until they burn out).\n        #       Type B: the burned ones.\n\n        #   The process is: \n        #       We start with a Type A candles.\n        #       We burn all Type A candles, so we get a Type B candles.\n        #       Then we convert as many Type B candles as possible (each b Type B candles make one Type A) to Type A.\n\n        #   And we can use the leftover Type B candles in subsequent cycles.\n\n        #   The while loop above is:\n\n        #       hours += current   [current is the number of Type A candles we are burning]\n        #       current = current // b   [then we are making current//b Type A candles from the burned ones (which are exactly current)]\n\n        #   But wait, the burned ones from the current cycle are current, and we use them to make current//b Type A candles. Then the leftover from this cycle's burned candles is current % b. \n\n        #   However, we have not accounted for any leftover from previous cycles. \n\n        #   The problem is that the total burned candles for the next cycle is the leftover from previous cycles plus the current cycle's burned candles. But in the while loop, the current cycle's burned candles are exactly the current value (which we just burned). \n\n        #   But note: the previous cycles' leftovers are not stored. \n\n        #   However, the above examples (4,2) and (6,3) and (10,3) work without storing the leftover. Why?\n\n        #   Because the total burned candles from the entire process is the sum of all the candles we have ever burned. But we are not required to know the exact composition, we only care about the total hours.\n\n        #   Consider: the entire process stops when we don't have enough burned candles to make a new candle (i.e., current < b). \n\n        #   The total hours is the sum of the candles we burned at each step.\n\n        #   And the number of candles we burn at step i is the number of new candles we made at step i-1 (or the initial a at step0).\n\n        #   But note: the burned candles from step i are the same as the candles we burned at step i, and then we use those burned candles (along with any leftovers from previous steps) to make new candles.\n\n        #   However, the while loop does not store the leftover. But observe: \n\n        #       In the first cycle: we burn a candles, and then we make a//b new candles.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, given that he starts with `a` candles and can create a new candle from `b` burned-out candles. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and recycling the burned ones until it's no longer possible to create new candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start by reading the input values for `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed to create a new one).\n2. **Simulation Loop**: Use a loop to simulate the burning process:\n   - **Burning Phase**: Burn all available candles (either initial or recycled) to accumulate hours.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: Convert the burned candles into new ones. For every `b` burned candles, create one new candle. The remainder (if any) is stored as leftover burned candles for future use.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are fewer than `b` burned candles left, meaning no more new candles can be created.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem by iteratively burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal usage of all available resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    current_candles = a\n    \n    while current_candles >= b:\n        total_hours += current_candles\n        new_candles = current_candles // b\n        total_hours += new_candles\n        current_candles = new_candles + (current_candles % b)\n    \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers, `a` and `b`, from standard input.\n2. **Initialization**: `total_hours` keeps track of the total burning time, and `current_candles` starts with the initial number of candles.\n3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as there are at least `b` candles to burn:\n   - **Burning**: The current number of candles is added to `total_hours`.\n   - **Recycling**: The number of new candles created is calculated by integer division of `current_candles` by `b`. The remaining burned candles (modulus operation) are added to the leftover count for the next iteration.\n4. **Output**: Once the loop exits, the total hours are printed.\n\nThis method ensures that all possible candles are utilized optimally, maximizing the burning time by continuously recycling burned candles into new ones.",
