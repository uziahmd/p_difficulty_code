Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an initial string s and then n queries. Each query is of the form \"di->ti\", meaning replace every occurrence of the digit di with ti.\n\n However, note: the replacements are done sequentially, and the total length of all ti's is at most 10^5, but the initial string can be up to 10^5 and there can be up to 10^5 queries.\n\n But note: if we do direct string replacement naively for each query (like using a loop for each occurrence), then in worst-case we might have a chain reaction: replacing one digit by a long string, which then contains digits that are replaced by subsequent queries. And the total length of the string might become huge (exponential growth) so we cannot actually build the entire string.\n\n Instead, we need to use dynamic programming or some form of transformation that works on the digits and the effect of the replacements.\n\n Observation:\n The problem requires the number modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7). We can consider processing the string from left to right, and for each digit we know what it will eventually become after all the queries.\n\n However, the queries are applied in sequence, and each query replaces a digit by a string (which may contain multiple digits). Then the next query might replace some of those digits.\n\n We can think backwards: \n Let's define f(d) for a digit d as the string that the digit d becomes after applying all the queries that are relevant to it.\n\n But note: the queries are sequential and might refer to digits that themselves are subject to later replacements.\n\n Alternate idea: process the queries in reverse order? Or use memoization and update the transformations for digits.\n\n However, note: the problem says the queries are performed in the given order.\n\n Another idea: we can use a list for each digit (0-9) that initially maps to itself (as a string). Then, for each query, we update the mapping for that digit to be the string ti. But wait, the catch: the replacement of a digit di by ti happens at the time of the query, and then the digits in ti might be subject to the following queries.\n\n Actually, the problem is: after a query, the string changes and then the next query operates on the updated string.\n\n But note: the queries are independent in the sense that they specify a digit to replace. However, the replacement string might contain digits that are to be replaced by subsequent queries.\n\n So, we need to simulate the effect of the queries in order, but without building the entire string (because the string might become too large).\n\n Insight: we don't care about the entire string, we care about the resulting number modulo 10^9+7.\n\n How to compute the number from the string? We can break the string into digits and use the fact that the decimal number is built by:\n\n   num = 0\n   for each digit d in the string (from left to right):\n        num = (num * 10 + int(d)) % mod\n\n But the problem: the string is transformed by replacements, and the replacement for a digit d is a string (which may contain multiple digits). And these digits are then transformed by subsequent queries.\n\n We can precompute the final value for each digit (after all queries) and also the length (in terms of digits) that the digit expands to, because the modulus operation depends on the base (10) and the power.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation is not linear for concatenation. We can use:\n\n   Let F(d) be the value (mod 10^9+7) and L(d) be the length (number of digits) of the final string representation of the digit d after all queries.\n\n Then, when we see a digit d in the original string, we can replace it by F(d) and account for the shifting.\n\n But how to compute F and L for each digit?\n\n We have to process the queries in reverse order because the last query is the one that is applied last. However, note that a query replaces a digit by a string, and then that string is processed by the remaining queries.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are going to process the queries from last to first. Why? Because the last query is the last transformation, so we can start with the initial state (each digit maps to itself) and then update the mappings as we go backwards.\n\n 2. Initially, for each digit d, we set:\n        F[d] = d (as a string, but we want to store the numeric value and the length)\n        L[d] = 1\n\n 3. Then, for each query (in reverse order) of the form \"d->t\":\n        We are going to update the mapping for the digit d.\n\n        However, note: the query says \"replace all occurrences of d by t\" at this step. But then after that, the digits in t are transformed by the subsequent (remaining) queries. But wait: we are processing backwards, so the remaining queries (the ones that were earlier) have been accounted for? Actually, we are going backwards so we start from the last query and go to the first. Therefore, the current state of F and L for each digit already includes the effect of all queries that come after the current one.\n\n        So, for the current query (which is the i-th query from the last), we are going to update the mapping for d:\n\n        Let the current mapping for each digit in t be known (because we've processed the later queries). Then:\n\n            The new value for d is the concatenation of the values of each digit in t (with the transformation already applied for the later queries).\n\n            Specifically, if t has k digits, say t = t0 t1 ... t_{k-1}, then:\n\n                F_new[d] = (F[t0] * (10^(L[t1]+...+L[t_{k-1}]}) ) + F[t1] * (10^(L[t2]+...+L[t_{k-1}]}) + ... + F[t_{k-1}]\n\n            And the new length for d is L_new[d] = L[t0] + L[t1] + ... + L[t_{k-1]]\n\n        But note: the value F_new[d] is computed modulo 1000000007, and the lengths are just the counts (they can be very big, but we can keep them modulo something? Actually, we need the exponents for the base 10. However, the exponentiation base 10 must be done modulo 1000000007? But note: the length tells us the number of digits, which determines the power of 10.\n\n        Example: \n          Suppose we have two digits: 'a' and 'b'. After processing, we know:\n            F[a] = x, L[a] = l1\n            F[b] = y, L[b] = l2\n\n          Then the value for \"ab\" is: x * (10^l2) + y.\n\n        How to compute 10^l2 mod 1000000007? But note: l2 can be up to ... the total length of the string might be huge, but note the constraint: the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. However, when we update, the length of a digit might become large (but note: the initial length is 1, and then each replacement uses the current length). But the total length of the entire string is not bounded by 10^5 because we are storing the length (number of digits) for each digit, and we are updating the mappings.\n\n        But note: the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. This is the input constraint. However, when we update the mapping for a digit, we are effectively building a transformation that might be used many times.\n\n        However, we must note that the same digit might appear in multiple queries, and we are updating the mapping for the digit. The length and value for a digit might be updated multiple times (for each query that targets that digit, but note: we are processing queries in reverse order, so we update the mapping for the digit only once (if we process all queries backwards) unless the same digit appears in multiple queries? Actually, the problem does not specify that the same digit cannot appear in multiple queries.\n\n        Important: the queries are given in the order they are applied. When processing backwards, we start from the last query and update the mapping for the digit in that query, and then the previous queries. But if a query updates a digit that was updated by a later (i.e., already processed) query, then we use the updated value.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let F = [0]*10   # F[i] is the value (int) for digit i (initially, F[i] = i, but note: we have digits from '0' to '9', so we map '0'->0, etc.\n          Let L = [1]*10   # L[i] is the length (number of digits) for the final representation of digit i.\n\n          However, we are going to process the queries in reverse order.\n\n          We are given:\n            s0 = initial string\n            n = number of queries\n            queries = list of n strings, each of the form \"d->t\"\n\n          We'll store the queries in a list, then process from last to first.\n\n          For each query (from last to first): \n            Parse the query: it's a string that has the format \"d->t\", where d is a single digit, and t is a string (which can be empty).\n\n            Let d0 = the digit (convert to int? or keep as char? Actually, we have 10 digits, so we can index by the digit character. But our arrays F and L are for digits 0 to 9.\n\n            Steps for the query \"d->t\":\n\n              We are going to update the mapping for digit d.\n\n              First, we compute the total value and total length for the string t (using the current mappings for each digit in t).\n\n              How to compute the value for t?\n                  value_t = 0\n                  len_t = 0\n                  For each char c in t:\n                      digit_val = int(c)\n                      value_t = (value_t * (10 ** L[digit_val]) + F[digit_val]) % mod   -> NO, wait: we need to use the current mappings (which are for the state after this query, i.e., the queries that occur later). But we are processing backwards, so we have already updated the mappings for the digits that are in t (from the later queries). \n\n              However, note: the query is applied and then the subsequent queries (which we haven't processed yet) are the ones that we have already accounted for (because we are going backwards). Actually, we are updating the mapping for the digit d to be the result of replacing d by t, and then the subsequent queries (earlier ones) are going to use this updated mapping. But wait: we are processing from last to first, so we have updated the mappings for the queries that occur after the current one. Now, the current query is the one we are processing, and then we update the mapping for d. Then the next (previous) query will use the updated mapping (including the current one and the ones we've already processed).\n\n              So, for the current query, we want to set:\n\n                  F_new[d] = the value of the string t after all the queries that were applied after the current one (which we have already processed)\n\n                  Similarly, L_new[d] = the length (in digits) of the string t after all the queries that were applied after the current one.\n\n              How to compute the value and length for t?\n\n                  Since t is a string, we can break it into characters. For each character c in t:\n\n                      Let d_char = int(c)   [But note: we have stored F and L for each digit (0-9)]\n\n                  Then, the entire string t is transformed by the subsequent queries (which we have already updated) and we can compute:\n\n                      value_t = 0\n                      len_t = 0\n\n                  But wait, we don't know the value and length of t until we break it down. We can do:\n\n                      value_t = 0\n                      len_t = 0\n                      for c in t:\n                          digit = int(c)\n                          # The current mapping for digit gives the value and length after the subsequent queries.\n                          # Then, we treat the entire representation of this digit as a base-10 number, so we need to shift the existing value_t by the length of this digit's representation (i.e., multiply by 10^(L[digit])) and then add the value F[digit].\n\n                          # However, note: the representation of the digit is a string of L[digit] digits. So the shifting factor is 10 raised to the power of L[digit].\n\n                          # But: we cannot compute 10^(L[digit]) directly if L[digit] is very large (like thousands or more) because exponentiation would be expensive and the exponent might be huge.\n\n                  Alternative: we can precompute powers of 10 modulo 1000000007 for exponents up to the maximum length? But the maximum length might be very high (since the total length of ti's is 10^5, but the expansions can be exponential?).\n\n                  However, note: the problem constraints say the sum of the lengths of the ti's (the input) is at most 10^5. But the expansions (the length of the final representation) might be much larger. We cannot store exponents for such large numbers.\n\n                  We must use modular exponentiation, but the modulus is 1000000007. However, the exponent L[digit] might be in the order of millions? Actually, the length is the total number of digits, and we are building the string by replacing digits. The length can grow exponentially with the number of queries. But note: the total length of the input ti's is 10^5, so the expansion is limited by the fact that we have at most 10^5 queries, but the length of the entire string might be astronomical.\n\n                  However, we are only storing the value (mod 1000000007) and the length (as an integer, but modulo what? Actually, we need the length to compute the exponent for the next digits. But the exponent is the length (number of digits) and we need to compute 10^(L) mod 1000000007.\n\n                  But note: Euler's theorem? We can compute 10^k mod 1000000007 for k up to ... the modulus is 1000000007, and the exponent k can be reduced modulo phi(1000000007) for Euler? However, 1000000007 is prime, so phi(1000000007)=1000000006. But k can be huge (like 10^9) so we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006? \n\n                  However, the problem: the length L[digit] is the total number of digits, which is an integer that might be extremely large (like 10^5 queries, each replacing a digit by a string of length up to 10^5, and then recursively, the length could be exponential). But note: the constraint on the input is that the sum of the lengths of the ti's is <= 10^5. This is the raw input. The expansion is done by the queries, and the same digit might be replaced multiple times.\n\n                  But note: we are storing the length for each digit. The length for a digit d is the total number of digits that d expands to after all the queries (from the current state). We update the length for a digit d by:\n\n                      L[d] = (L[t0] + L[t1] + ... + L[t_{k-1}])\n\n                  and similarly, F[d] = (F[t0] * (10^(L[t1]+...+L[t_{k-1}]) ) + ... + F[t_{k-1}]\n\n                  The problem: the exponent for the base 10 is the total length of the remaining part. And the total length might be huge (exponential in the number of queries). But note: the modulus for the exponent is 1000000006 (if we use Euler) for modulus 1000000007. However, the exponent reduction is valid only when the base and modulus are coprime (which they are, since 10 and 1000000007 are coprime). So we can compute:\n\n                    base = 10\n                    exponent = L_rest   (the total length of the rest of the string, which is the sum of the lengths of the subsequent digits)\n\n                    Then, 10^(exponent) mod 1000000007 = pow(10, exponent, 1000000007) but we can reduce exponent modulo 1000000006? \n\n                  However, the exponent (length) is used in two ways:\n\n                    1. To compute the value: we need to compute 10^(exponent) mod 1000000007.\n                    2. To update the length: we just add the lengths.\n\n                  But note: the length is just an integer that we use as an exponent. The length itself might be huge (like 10^100000) so we cannot store it as an integer. We must find a way to represent the length modulo something? \n\n                  However, the problem: the length is used as an exponent in the modular exponentiation. We can use Euler's theorem to reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006 (phi(1000000007)), but note that the exponent (length) is the total number of digits, and we are going to use it in the exponentiation for the value computation.\n\n                  But here's the catch: the length is also being updated by the same process (it's the total digits of the expansion). We are storing the length as an integer. However, the length can be astronomically large (because we are doing 10^5 queries, each one potentially doubling the length). We cannot store such a big integer.\n\n                  We need to store the length modulo 1000000006 (if we are going to use Euler) for the exponentiation? But wait, the length is not taken modulo 1000000006 for the purpose of the length itself (the expansion) but only for the exponentiation.\n\n                  However, the value computation for a digit d:\n\n                    F[d] = (F[t0] * (10^(L_rest0)) + F[t1] * (10^(L_rest1)) + ... + F[tk-1]) % mod\n\n                  where L_rest0 = (L[t1] + L[t2] + ... + L[tk-1]), and similarly for the others.\n\n                  The problem: the exponents L_rest0, etc. are huge. We can compute 10^(L_rest0) mod 1000000007 by using modular exponentiation with exponent reduced modulo 1000000006 (because 10 and 1000000007 are coprime). But note: Euler's theorem says:\n\n                    10^k ≡ 10^(k mod 1000000006) (mod 1000000007)\n\n                  provided that k >= 0. However, if k is 0, then 10^0=1.\n\n                  But wait, the exponent k (the length) might be 0 (if the replacement string is empty). \n\n                  However, the issue: we are storing the length as an integer. The length is the total number of digits. This integer might be huge (like more than 10^18). We cannot store such a big integer, and we cannot do exponentiation with such a big exponent without reduction.\n\n                  Therefore, we must store the length modulo 1000000006 (phi(1000000007))? But note: the length is used both as the exponent and as the sum of the lengths of the expanded digits. However, the length is additive, and we are only interested in the length modulo 1000000006 for the purpose of exponentiation. But the length itself is used in the exponentiation and in the addition for the next queries.\n\n                  However, the problem: the length is the total number of digits. The value of the digit expansion is computed by:\n\n                    value = 0\n                    for each digit d_i in the replacement string t (in order):\n                         value = value * (10^(L[d_i])) + F[d_i]\n\n                  and the new length is the sum of L[d_i] for each digit in t.\n\n                  We cannot store the actual length if it is too big, but we can store two things:\n\n                    - The value F[d] mod 1000000007.\n                    - The length L[d] mod 1000000006 (for exponentiation) and also we need the exact length for the next level? Actually, no: the next level (when processing a query) only needs the length for the exponentiation. And the exponentiation uses the length modulo 1000000006.\n\n                  But wait, the length is used to compute the next exponent. However, the exponent for a digit d in the current query is the sum of the lengths of the digits in the replacement string. And that sum is used as an exponent. So we need the exact value of the exponent? No, because we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006 (if we are computing 10^(exponent) mod 1000000007). But note: the exponentiation base 10 and modulus 1000000007: we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006 (Euler's theorem) only if the exponent is sufficiently large. However, even if the exponent is 10^100000, we can reduce it modulo 1000000006.\n\n                  However, the problem: the length is the sum of the lengths of the digits in the replacement string. We are storing the length for each digit modulo 1000000006? Then, when we update a digit d, we set:\n\n                    L[d] = (L[t0] + L[t1] + ... + L[tk-1]) % 1000000006\n\n                  But wait, the length is additive, and the modulus for the exponent is 1000000006. However, the length is used in two places:\n\n                    1. As the exponent in the modular exponentiation (so we need the exponent modulo 1000000006).\n                    2. As the length of the string (to be used in the next query as the exponent for the next digits).\n\n                  But note: the exponent for the next digits is the actual length (the total number of digits) because the next query will break the string into digits and then use the length of each digit's expansion. However, the next query (if any) will use the updated length (which we are storing modulo 1000000006). Is that okay?\n\n                  The issue: the length is used in the exponentiation, and we are storing the length modulo 1000000006, but the exponentiation requires the exponent modulo 1000000006. However, the length is the total number of digits, and the exponentiation is 10^(length) mod 1000000007. Since we are storing the length modulo 1000000006, we can use that for the exponentiation.\n\n                  But note: the length is also used to compute the next length. The next length is the sum of the lengths (each stored modulo 1000000006). However, the length is the actual total number of digits, and we are storing it modulo 1000000006. This is acceptable because:\n\n                    In the value computation: we need 10^(length) mod 1000000007, and we can compute that using the stored length (mod 1000000006) as exponent.\n\n                    In the length computation: we are storing the length modulo 1000000006, so when we add several lengths, we are adding modulo 1000000006. However, the actual length (the total number of digits) is the sum of the lengths (without modulus) and we are reducing modulo 1000000006. This is acceptable because the exponentiation only cares about the exponent modulo 1000000006.\n\n                  But wait: the length is used in the value computation as the exponent, and the exponent is reduced modulo 1000000006. However, the value computation must use the actual exponent (the total number of digits) to shift the current value? \n\n                  Let me clarify:\n\n                    Consider we have a current value V and we are going to append a string of length L (in digits). Then the new value is:\n\n                      V * (10^L) + (value of the appended string)\n\n                    But the value of the appended string is computed by the same process.\n\n                  However, the modulus is 1000000007. The operation is:\n\n                      new_value = (V * (10^L mod 1000000007) + (value of the appended string)) % 1000000007\n\n                  So we need 10^L mod 1000000007, and we can compute that by using L mod 1000000006 (if L is huge). \n\n                  But the length L is stored modulo 1000000006, so we can use that to compute 10^L mod 1000000007.\n\n                  However, the length is also used in the next query: the length for a digit is the total number of digits it expands to. We are storing that length modulo 1000000006. Then, when we use that length to compute the exponent for the next digit, we use the stored length (which is modulo 1000000006) and that is correct.\n\n                  But there is a caveat: the length is the total number of digits. The value of the digit expansion is computed correctly if we use the stored length (mod 1000000006) for the exponentiation. However, the length itself (the total number of digits) is not stored in full, but modulo 1000000006. This is acceptable because the exponentiation only requires the exponent modulo 1000000006.\n\n                  Steps:\n\n                    Let mod_val = 1000000007\n                    Let mod_exp = 1000000006   # because mod_val is prime, and 10 and mod_val are coprime.\n\n                    Initialize:\n                      F = [0]*10\n                      for i in range(10):\n                          F[i] = i   # the digit i (0 to 9) initially maps to the digit i, so value i, length 1.\n\n                      L = [1]*10   # but wait, we are going to store the length modulo mod_exp? Yes, and initially 1.\n\n                    However, we are going to update the mappings for the digits from the last query to the first.\n\n                    But note: the initial string s is given, and we are going to process the queries in reverse order.\n\n                    We must read the queries and store them.\n\n                    Then, for each query (in reverse order):\n\n                      Parse the query: it's a string that starts with a digit and then \"->\" and then a string t.\n\n                      Let d = int(query[0])\n                      Let t_str = the string after \"->\"\n\n                      Then, compute the value and length for t_str (using the current F and L arrays, which have been updated by the subsequent queries).\n\n                      For t_str, we break it into characters, and for each character c:\n\n                          digit_index = int(c)\n\n                          Then, the value for this character is F[digit_index] (which is the value of the expansion of c after the subsequent queries) and the length is L[digit_index] (the length of the expansion of c, modulo mod_exp).\n\n                      Then, we compute the total value for t_str:\n\n                          total_value = 0\n                          total_length = 0\n\n                          for c in t_str:\n                              d_i = int(c)\n                              # We need to shift the current total_value by (10^(L[d_i])) and then add F[d_i]\n\n                              # But note: the shifting factor is 10^(L[d_i]), but we don't have the actual L[d_i] (we have L[d_i] mod mod_exp). However, we can compute:\n\n                              shift = pow(10, L[d_i], mod_val)   # This uses modular exponentiation, and the exponent L[d_i] is an integer modulo mod_exp? Actually, the pow function in Python can handle exponents that are integers, and if L[d_i] is huge, it uses modular exponentiation with modulus mod_val, but the exponent is passed as an integer. However, the exponent is stored modulo mod_exp (1000000006) but we don't have the full exponent, we only have it modulo mod_exp. \n\n                          Wait, we are storing L[d_i] as an integer modulo 1000000006. But the actual exponent for 10 is the total number of digits, which is congruent to L[d_i] mod 1000000006. So:\n\n                            10^(L[d_i]) mod 1000000007 = 10^(L[d_i] mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007.\n\n                          However, note: the exponentiation base 10 and modulus 1000000007: the exponents are periodic with period 1000000006 (by Euler). So we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006.\n\n                          But we are storing L[d_i] as the total length modulo 1000000006. So we can use that stored value (which is the exponent modulo 1000000006) for the pow function.\n\n                          However, the pow function in Python can handle exponents that are reduced modulo 1000000006? It doesn't matter because the pow function does modular exponentiation, and we can pass the exponent as any integer, but if the exponent is huge, it uses the method of modular exponentiation (which is efficient) and internally reduces the exponent modulo the totient if we give the modulus? Actually, no: the pow(base, exponent, modulus) does not automatically reduce the exponent modulo the totient. But we know that 10^(k) mod 1000000007 is the same as 10^(k mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007, so we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006 first, then do the exponentiation.\n\n                          But note: the exponent we have is already stored modulo 1000000006. So we can use:\n\n                              shift = pow(10, L[d_i], mod_val)\n\n                          However, wait: we are storing L[d_i] as an integer modulo 1000000006. But the actual exponent is the total length, which is congruent to L[d_i] modulo 1000000006. Therefore, 10^(actual_length) mod mod_val = 10^(L[d_i]) mod mod_val.\n\n                          But note: the variable L[d_i] is stored as the length modulo 1000000006, so we can use that stored value (which is an integer between 0 and 1000000005) as the exponent.\n\n                          However, the problem: the length is the total number of digits, and we are storing it modulo 1000000006. Then, when we use it in the exponentiation, we are effectively using the exponent modulo 1000000006, which is correct.\n\n                      Similarly, the total_length for t_str is the sum of the lengths of the individual digits (each stored modulo 1000000006). But note: the length is additive, and we are storing the length modulo 1000000006, so the total_length is the sum of the stored lengths (each modulo 1000000006) modulo 1000000006? \n\n                      However, we are going to use the total_length (the stored value) to compute the exponent for the next digits (in the same query) and then update the digit d's length to be this total_length.\n\n                      So:\n\n                          total_value = 0\n                          total_length = 0\n                          for c in t_str:\n                              d_i = int(c)\n                              # Get the current value and length for d_i (which is stored in F[d_i] and L[d_i])\n                              # Shift the current total_value by 10^(L[d_i]) and add F[d_i]\n                              shift_factor = pow(10, L[d_i], mod_val)   # This is 10^(stored_length) mod mod_val, and stored_length is the total length of d_i's expansion (mod 1000000006)\n                              total_value = (total_value * shift_factor + F[d_i]) % mod_val\n\n                              total_length = (total_length + L[d_i]) % mod_exp   # But note: the length is stored modulo 1000000006 (mod_exp). However, the length is the total number of digits, and we are going to use it as an exponent (so we need it modulo 1000000006). Also, the length is additive, so we add the stored lengths (each modulo 1000000006) and then take modulo 1000000006.\n\n                          Then, update F[d] and L[d] for the digit d:\n\n                              F[d] = total_value % mod_val\n                              L[d] = total_length % mod_exp\n\n                    But wait: the length update: we are storing the length modulo 1000000006. However, the length is the total number of digits, and we are going to use it in the exponentiation for the next queries. And the exponentiation requires the length modulo 1000000006, so that's consistent.\n\n                    However, note: the length is the total number of digits, and when we update a digit, we set its length to the total_length (which is the sum of the lengths of the digits in t_str). Then, the next query (earlier) that uses this digit will use the stored length (which is modulo 1000000006) to compute the exponent.\n\n                    But there is a problem: the length is additive, and if we store the length modulo 1000000006, then the addition is modulo 1000000006. This is acceptable because the exponentiation only requires the exponent modulo 1000000006.\n\n                    However, the value computation is done correctly because we use the stored length (mod 1000000006) to compute the shift factor.\n\n                    But note: the initial length for each digit is 1 (so 1 mod 1000000006 is 1). Then, when we update a digit, we set its length to the sum of the lengths of the replacement string's digits (each stored modulo 1000000006). Then, when we use that length in the next query, we use the stored value (mod 1000000006) to compute the shift.\n\n                    However, the problem: the length is the total number of digits, and we are storing it modulo 1000000006. The value computation for the digit d is the concatenation of the expansions of the digits in t_str. The concatenation is defined by:\n\n                        value = (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of string replacement queries on an initial digit string and compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the replacements without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple queries where each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit in the current string with another string. The key observation is that each query's effect can be precomputed by considering the cumulative transformations from subsequent queries, allowing us to handle replacements in reverse order.\n2. **Insight**: By processing queries from last to first, we can dynamically update the value and length (number of digits) each digit maps to after all subsequent queries. This avoids the need for repeated string manipulations and leverages modular arithmetic to keep numbers manageable.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to maintain two arrays:\n   - `F[d]` stores the numeric value (mod 1000000007) of the final string representation of digit `d`.\n   - `L[d]` stores the length (number of digits) of the final string representation of digit `d`, modulo 1000000006 (Euler's totient function of 1000000007).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Processing each query involves iterating over the replacement string's characters, performing constant-time operations (modular exponentiation and addition). The total operations are linear with respect to the sum of the lengths of all replacement strings, making the solution efficient (O(total length of replacement strings)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod_val = 1000000007\nmod_exp = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n_line = data[1].strip()\n    n = int(n_line) if n_line != \"\" else 0\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        line = data[i].strip()\n        if '->' not in line:\n            continue\n        parts = line.split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_char = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((d_char, t_str))\n    \n    F = [i for i in range(10)]\n    L_arr = [1] * 10\n\n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        d_char, t_str = queries[i]\n        if d_char == '':\n            continue\n        d_digit = int(d_char)\n        total_value = 0\n        total_len = 0\n        for char in t_str:\n            d_i = int(char)\n            shift_factor = pow(10, L_arr[d_i], mod_val)\n            total_value = (total_value * shift_factor + F[d_i]) % mod_val\n            total_len = (total_len + L_arr[d_i]) % mod_exp\n        \n        F[d_digit] = total_value % mod_val\n        L_arr[d_digit] = total_len % mod_exp\n\n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d_i = int(char)\n        shift_factor = pow(10, L_arr[d_i], mod_val)\n        result = (result * shift_factor + F[d_i]) % mod_val\n\n    print(result % mod_val)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial string `s` and number of queries `n` are read from input. Each query specifies a digit to replace and the replacement string.\n2. **Reverse Processing**: Queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the replacement string is transformed using the current mappings of its digits (from subsequent queries), updating the target digit's value and length.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The value `F[d]` for a digit `d` is computed by concatenating the values of its replacement string's digits, using modular exponentiation to handle large powers of 10. The length `L[d]` is the sum of the lengths of the replacement string's digits, modulo 1000000006.\n4. **Result Computation**: After processing all queries, the initial string `s` is transformed by replacing each digit with its final value and length, again using modular arithmetic to compute the result efficiently.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging dynamic updates and modular arithmetic, avoiding the pitfalls of explicit string manipulation with large intermediate strings.",
