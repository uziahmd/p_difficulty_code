    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements (from 0 to n-1)\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string that is the binary representation of m (without spaces) of length n\n\n Note: The problem says that the binary representation of m is given as a string s0s1...sn-1, so m = s0*(2^(n-1)) + s1*(2^(n-2)) + ... + s_{n-1}*(2^0)\n\n However, note: the function f(x) uses the bits of x (which is up to 2n-1) to select indices. Specifically, if we consider the binary representation of x with exactly n bits (possibly padded with zeros on the left), then the i-th bit (from most significant to least? or vice versa?) corresponds to index i.\n\n But note: the example: n=4, x=11 (binary '1011') -> then the bits are at positions 0,1,3 (if we count from 0 to n-1, and the least significant bit is the 0th? or the most significant is the 0th?)\n\n Let's clarify the example: \n   x = 11 in base10, which is 1011 in base2.\n   The problem says: \"if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\", and for i=0,1,3 (so i goes from 0 to 3) we have 1s.\n\n How is the binary representation aligned?\n   The example says: x=11 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3.\n\n So, the i-th position is the coefficient for 2^i. Therefore, the binary representation is given in little-endian order? Actually, no: the standard way is that the rightmost bit is the least significant (2^0). \n\n In the problem, the array a has indices from 0 to n-1. And the function f(x) adds a_i for every bit i that is set in x.\n\n But note: the input for m is given as a string of n digits (each '0' or '1') without spaces. This string represents m in base-2, but the first character is the most significant bit? \n\n Example input: \n   \"5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010\"\n\n Here, n=5, so m has 5 bits. The binary string is \"11010\". Then m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26.\n\n However, the example says m=11 (in the sample explanation) but wait, the second sample input is:\n\n   Input: \n      5\n      17 0 10 2 1\n      11010\n\n   Output: 27\n\n And the example explanation says: \"m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\", but wait: 20+21+23 is not 11. Let me check again:\n\n   Actually, the example says: \"the maximum value of function equals f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27\".\n\n   And m is given by the binary string \"11010\", which is 26. So x must be between 0 and 26 (inclusive).\n\n   Why can we choose x=5? 5 in binary (with 5 bits) is 00101, so the bits set are at positions 0 and 2 (if we index from 0 to 4, with the least significant being 0). Then f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27.\n\n   Now, note: the array a has 5 elements: a0, a1, a2, a3, a4.\n\n   The problem: we are allowed x from 0 to m (inclusive). We want the maximum f(x) = sum_{i where the i-th bit is set} a_i.\n\n   But note: the i-th bit in x: the example uses the standard bit representation (LSB is 2^0, then 2^1, etc.). However, the input string for m is given in big-endian (first character is the highest power, 2^(n-1)).\n\n   Therefore, the binary representation of m is given as a string of n characters, where the first character is the most significant bit (corresponding to 2^(n-1)) and the last character is the least significant (2^0).\n\n   But our x is represented in n bits? Actually, x can be any integer from 0 to m, and m is given by that n-bit binary number.\n\n   However, note: the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x, but how many bits? The problem says x is from 0 to 2n-1? Actually, the problem states: \"x from 0 to 2^n - 1\" OR from 0 to m? The constraint says: 0<=x<=m, and m is given by the binary string.\n\n   But note: the binary string has n digits, so m < 2^n. Therefore, x has at most n bits.\n\n   How do we map the bits of x? The function f(x) considers the n bits (from 0 to n-1) of x. The i-th bit of x (for i from 0 to n-1) is the coefficient for 2^i.\n\n   However, in the example: \n        n=5, m=26 (binary '11010')\n        x=5: binary (5 bits) is 00101 -> so the bits are at positions 0 and 2 (from the least significant to the most). \n\n   But note: the problem does not specify the bit order. However, the example calculation for x=11 (in the first sample) was:\n        x=11, n=4, and they broke down 11 as 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3.\n\n   So, the i-th bit is the one that corresponds to 2^i, and the array a has an element for each bit position.\n\n   Therefore, the array a is indexed by the exponent: a[0] is for 2^0, a[1] for 2^1, ..., a[n-1] for 2^(n-1).\n\n   But wait: the input for m is given as a string of n bits, the first character being the most significant (2^(n-1)) and the last the least (2^0). \n\n   Then, when we consider x, we also represent x as an n-bit number, with the same bit order? Or should we reverse?\n\n   Actually, the problem does not say we pad x to n bits. But note: if x has more than n bits, then it wouldn't fit because m is an n-bit number. So x is at most n bits.\n\n   However, the problem says: the function f(x) uses the binary representation of x. But if x has less than n bits, then the higher bits (from n-1 down to the number of bits) are 0.\n\n   But note: the array a has n elements, so we need to consider all n bit positions. The function f(x) is defined for any x (from 0 to m) and uses the bits that are present in the binary representation of x (with leading zeros to make it n bits?).\n\n   Actually, the problem does not specify the bit-length for x. However, since m is given by an n-bit binary representation, we can assume that we are working with numbers that have at most n bits, and we consider the n bit positions (from 0 to n-1). Then, the i-th bit of x (for i from 0 to n-1) is defined as follows:\n\n        bit(i) = (x >> i) & 1\n\n   This is the standard way. Then, even if x is less than 2^(n-1), the higher bits (from i>= the bit-length of x) are 0.\n\n   So, the problem becomes: we have an array a[0..n-1] (each a[i] is the value for the i-th bit, i.e., 2^i) and a constraint m (given by an n-bit binary string, which we interpret as a number). We wish to choose x in [0, m] to maximize the sum: \n        f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} ( (x has the i-th bit set) * a[i] )\n\n   But note: the standard bit-shift definition: the i-th bit is the one that is 2^i. However, the binary string for m is given in big-endian (most significant first). \n\n   Let me reindex: \n        Let b[i] = the i-th character of the binary string (from the input). Then, the value of m is: \n            m = b[0]*2^(n-1) + b[1]*2^(n-2) + ... + b[n-1]*2^0.\n\n   But our function f(x) uses the bits of x: \n        f(x) = a[0]*(x mod 2) + a[1]*( (x//2 mod 2) ) + ... + a[n-1]*( (x//(2^(n-1)) mod 2) ) ?\n\n   However, wait: the standard bit representation of x (as an n-bit number) would be:\n\n        x = d0 * 2^0 + d1 * 2^1 + ... + d_{n-1} * 2^(n-1)\n\n   But the array a is given for indices 0 to n-1, and the i-th element a[i] is used for the bit that is 2^i. So:\n\n        f(x) = a[0]*d0 + a[1]*d1 + ... + a[n-1]*d_{n-1}\n\n   But note: the binary string for m is given in big-endian (first char is the highest power). So, the first character of the string corresponds to 2^(n-1) (the highest bit) and the last to 2^0.\n\n   Therefore, if we let x_bits = [d0, d1, d2, ..., d_{n-1}] (where d0 is the least significant and d_{n-1} the most), then the binary string for m is [d_{n-1}, d_{n-2}, ..., d0].\n\n   So, we can define an array b of the same length as a, but we need to align the bits.\n\n   Alternatively, we can reverse the given binary string to get the bits from least significant to most? \n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let m_str = input().strip()   # string of n characters, first is MSB (2^(n-1)), last is LSB (2^0)\n\n        Then, the bits of m (from LSB to MSB) would be: reversed(m_str)\n\n   But note: we are going to consider x as an n-bit number (with leading zeros). The function f(x) is:\n\n        f(x) = a[0] * (x & 1) + a[1] * ((x>>1)&1) + ... + a[n-1] * ((x>>(n-1))&1)\n\n   However, the problem does not require x to have exactly n bits. It can be represented in fewer. But we can always consider x in n bits (by padding zeros on the left). Then, the above formula holds.\n\n   But note: the constraint is 0<=x<=m. m is given by the n-bit binary string (big-endian). So we can use the n-bit representation for x.\n\n   Now, the problem: we wish to maximize f(x) for x in [0, m]. \n\n   We can think greedily: we want to set the bits that have high a[i] values. But we are constrained by the condition that x <= m.\n\n   We can use a digit dynamic programming (DP) on the bits (from the most significant to the least) to decide whether to set a bit or not, while keeping track of whether we are below m or equal.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let m_bits = list(map(int, list(input_string)))   # but wait, the input is given as a string of '0' and '1'\n\n        However, note: the input gives the binary representation of m as a string of n characters (without spaces). \n\n        We have two ways:\n\n        Option 1: work from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least (LSB). But our function f(x) is defined by the standard bit representation (LSB is 2^0). \n\n        But in the DP, we usually process from the highest bit (which is the leftmost in the big-endian representation) to the lowest.\n\n        Let me define:\n\n            Let the bits of m (in big-endian) be stored in an array M of length n: \n                M[0] = most significant bit (2^(n-1)), M[n-1] = least significant (2^0)\n\n            Then, the value of the i-th bit (from the function f) is the (n-1-i)-th element of M? \n\n            Actually, no: the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (for i from 0 to n-1) which is the bit for 2^i. In the n-bit representation, the bit for 2^i is the (n-1-i)-th bit from the left (if we store the entire n-bit number in big-endian). \n\n            Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n                Let the standard bit representation (LSB first) of x (with n bits) be: \n                    b0, b1, b2, ..., b_{n-1}   where b0 = x mod 2, b1 = (x//2) mod 2, etc.\n\n                Then, the given m is represented as: \n                    m = b_{n-1} * 2^(n-1) + b_{n-2} * 2^(n-2) + ... + b0 * 2^0\n\n                But wait, that is not the usual big-endian representation. \n\n            Actually, the given string is the big-endian representation of m (without leading zeros, but we are given exactly n bits). \n\n            So, if we let x_bits_std = [x0, x1, ..., x_{n-1}] (where x0 is the LSB, x_{n-1} is the MSB) then the given m is represented as:\n\n                m_str[0] = x_{n-1} (if x_{n-1} is 1) or '0'\n                m_str[1] = x_{n-2}\n                ...\n                m_str[i] = x_{n-1-i}\n                ...\n                m_str[n-1] = x0\n\n            Therefore, the array a is given for the exponents: \n                a[0] corresponds to x0 (LSB, 2^0)\n                a[1] corresponds to x1 (2^1)\n                ...\n                a[n-1] corresponds to x_{n-1} (2^(n-1))\n\n            But the given m is represented by the string in the order: [x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}, ..., x0]\n\n            So, we can create an array A for the bits in the standard little-endian representation (LSB to MSB) by reversing the given string and then converting to integers? \n\n            However, note: the array a is provided separately. We don't need to change a.\n\n            The catch: the constraint m is given by the string. We must ensure that the number x we choose is <= m.\n\n            How do we compare x and m? \n\n            Since m is given by an n-bit big-endian representation, and x is also represented as an n-bit number (we can consider x as having exactly n bits, with leading zeros), then we can compare the two by:\n\n                Let X = [x0, x1, ..., x_{n-1}] (standard: x0 is LSB, x_{n-1} is MSB) and M = [m0, m1, ..., m_{n-1}] (same representation) then:\n\n                Compare from the MSB to the LSB: \n                    For i from n-1 down to 0:\n                        if x_i < m_i, then x < m.\n                        if x_i > m_i, then x > m.\n\n            But note: the given string for m is in big-endian (from MSB to LSB). So we can store m as:\n\n                m_big = [int(bit) for bit in input_string]   # this is from MSB (index0) to LSB (index n-1)\n\n            Then, the corresponding standard little-endian representation for m is the reverse of m_big? \n\n            Actually, the standard representation (for the purpose of f(x)) is:\n\n                x_std = [x0, x1, ..., x_{n-1}]   (x0: LSB, x_{n-1}: MSB)\n\n            And the given m_big = [m_{n-1}, m_{n-2}, ..., m0] (if we let m0 be the LSB, then m_big[0] is the MSB, m_big[n-1] is the LSB)\n\n            So, to compare x (in standard representation) with m, we can:\n\n                Let x_big = [x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}, ..., x0]   (this is the big-endian representation of x)\n\n                Then, we compare x_big and m_big (both are n-bit numbers) as:\n\n                    Compare the first element (MSB): \n                        if x_big[0] < m_big[0] then x < m\n                        if x_big[0] > m_big[0] then x > m\n                        else, move to the next bit.\n\n            However, note: the standard representation for x (little-endian) is [x0, x1, ..., x_{n-1}], and the big-endian representation is [x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}, ..., x0].\n\n            Therefore, we can also store the constraint m_big (the given string converted to a list of integers) and then process the bits from the most significant (index0) to the least (index n-1) in the big-endian representation.\n\n   Approach:\n\n        We can use a DP that goes from the most significant bit (position 0 in big-endian) to the least (position n-1 in big-endian). \n\n        Let dp[i][tight] = the maximum sum we can achieve from the bits [0:i] (i bits processed) and the tight constraint (whether the prefix is equal to m's prefix or already strictly less).\n\n        But note: the array a is given for the standard little-endian representation. However, in the big-endian representation, the first bit (index0) is the MSB (which corresponds to a[n-1] in the array a) and the last bit (index n-1) is the LSB (which corresponds to a[0]).\n\n        So, we need to map the big-endian bit index j to the array a index: \n            In the big-endian representation, the j-th bit (at position j) corresponds to the (n-1-j)-th element in the array a.\n\n        Example: n=5, a = [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4] (a0: 2^0, a4: 2^4)\n            big-endian bit0 (j=0) -> a4\n            big-endian bit1 (j=1) -> a3\n            big-endian bit2 (j=2) -> a2\n            big-endian bit3 (j=3) -> a1\n            big-endian bit4 (j=4) -> a0\n\n        Therefore, the value for setting the j-th big-endian bit is a[n-1-j].\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let n = int(input())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          m_str = input().strip()\n\n          m_big = [int(char) for char in m_str]   # length n, big-endian: [MSB, ..., LSB]\n\n          Now, we want to consider the bits from the most significant (index0) to the least (index n-1).\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            dp[i][tight] = maximum total value from the bits [0:i] (i bits processed) and tight indicates that the first i bits are exactly the same as m_big[0:i]\n\n          Transition:\n\n            At bit position i (0-indexed, from 0 to n-1), we consider two possibilities for the current bit (big-endian) if tight is True:\n\n              Option 1: set the bit to 0.\n              Option 2: set the bit to 1, but only if m_big[i] is 1 (and if tight, we cannot set 1 if m_big[i] is 0).\n\n            However, note: if tight is True, then we cannot set a bit to 1 if the corresponding m_big[i] is 0.\n\n            But also, if we set a bit to 0 when m_big[i] is 1, then we become non-tight (tight=False) for the next state.\n\n            The value for this bit: \n                If we set the bit to 1, then we add a_value, where a_value = a[n-1-i] (because the big-endian bit i corresponds to the (n-1-i)-th element in a).\n\n          However, note: the above mapping of the big-endian bit i to a[n-1-i] is correct because:\n\n            The big-endian bit0 (first character) is the MSB, which is 2^(n-1) and that corresponds to a[n-1] (the last element in a) which is for 2^(n-1).\n\n          But wait: what if n is the length of the binary representation, and the array a has n elements? Then the exponents go from 0 to n-1.\n\n          Example: n=5, the exponents are 0,1,2,3,4. The MSB (big-endian bit0) is 2^4, so we use a[4]. Then the next is 2^3 -> a[3], etc.\n\n          This is consistent.\n\n          But note: the problem says the array a has n elements, and the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (for i from 0 to n-1) and the array a is given as a0, a1, ... a_{n-1}. \n\n          So, the mapping is: \n                bit0 (LSB) -> a0\n                bit1 -> a1\n                ...\n                bit_{n-1} (MSB) -> a_{n-1}\n\n          However, in the big-endian representation, we are storing the MSB first. So the first bit we process (big-endian bit0) is the MSB (bit_{n-1}) which is stored in a_{n-1}. \n\n          Therefore, we must use a[n-1-i] for the i-th big-endian bit.\n\n        Steps for DP:\n\n          Let dp[i][tight] = maximum sum from the remaining bits (from i to n-1) and the current tight constraint.\n\n          We process from i=0 to i=n.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            dp[i][tight] = maximum sum we can get from the bits [i:] (the remaining bits) under the tight constraint.\n\n          But typically, we do from the beginning to the end.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do from MSB to LSB (left to right) and then the state is the tight constraint.\n\n          Let:\n\n            dp[i][tight] = the maximum sum we can get from the bits from i to n-1 (remaining bits) given that the prefix is tight (if tight=True) or not (tight=False)\n\n          Then, we start from i=0 and tight=True.\n\n          However, note: the value of the bits we set in the past doesn't matter for the future, only the constraint.\n\n          Transition:\n\n            At step i (processing the i-th big-endian bit, which is the (n-1-i)-th element of a for the value):\n\n            Let current_bit_value = a[n-1-i]   (because the big-endian bit i is the (n-1-i)-th element of a)\n\n            Then, if tight is True, the bits we set so far are equal to m_big[0:i]. Then the current bit can be at most m_big[i]:\n\n                Option 0: set 0 -> then the new_tight = (tight and (0 == m_big[i]))\n                Option 1: set 1 -> then we can only set 1 if m_big[i] is 1, and then new_tight = (tight and (1==m_big[i]))\n\n            But if tight is False, then we can set 0 or 1 arbitrarily (since we are already below m).\n\n          Then, the recurrence:\n\n            dp[i][tight] = max(\n                dp[i+1][new_tight0] + (current_bit_value if set0 else 0)   for setting 0, \n                dp[i+1][new_tight1] + (current_bit_value if set1 else 0)   for setting 1 (if allowed)\n            )\n\n          But note: we are processing from the most significant to the least, and the value of the current bit is added immediately.\n\n          However, we can do:\n\n            Let:\n\n                if tight:\n                    low = 0\n                    high = m_big[i]\n                else:\n                    low = 0\n                    high = 1\n\n            Then, for each candidate bit d in [low, high]:\n\n                new_tight = tight and (d == m_big[i])\n\n                Then, if d==1, then we add current_bit_value.\n\n            Then, dp[i][tight] = max_{d in {0,1} (within the bounds)} { (dp[i+1][new_tight] + (current_bit_value if d==1 else 0)) }\n\n          Base case: when i == n, then no more bits, so return 0.\n\n          However, note: the array a is fixed and we are using the correct mapping.\n\n          But the state space is O(n*2) which is 10^5*2, which is acceptable.\n\n          But wait: the constraints say n up to 10^5, and we are doing a DP with two states per bit, so we need to do about 200,000 states, which is acceptable.\n\n          However, we must be cautious about recursion depth and memory. We can use iterative DP (from i=0 to i=n) and store two states (tight and not tight) for each i.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            dp[i][tight] for i in range(n+1) and tight in {0,1}. \n\n          But note: we don't need the entire table, we can do:\n\n            dp0 = maximum value for the remaining bits (from i to end) when the current state is tight (True) or not (False).\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] be the maximum value for the suffix starting at bit i, with the tight constraint being 0 (not tight) or 1 (tight).\n\n          However, we can do bottom-up from the last bit to the first.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do top-down (memoization) with recursion, but n=10^5 might cause recursion depth issues.\n\n          Let's do bottom-up (iterating from i=0 to i=n-1) is not the natural order. Actually, we process from the most significant (i=0) to the least (i=n-1). But the recurrence depends on the next state (i+1). So we can do:\n\n            dp[i][tight] depends on dp[i+1][new_tight]\n\n          We'll do from i=0 to i=n.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Initialize:\n                dp[n][0] = 0   # no bits left, no constraint, value 0.\n                dp[n][1] = 0\n\n            Then, for i from n-1 down to 0:\n\n                for tight in [0,1]:\n                    low = 0\n                    high = 1 if not tight else m_big[i]\n                    Actually, wait: if tight is True, then the maximum bit we can set is m_big[i] (which is either 0 or 1). If tight is False, then we can set 0 or 1.\n\n                    But note: the above definition of high is incorrect.\n\n                    Correction:\n\n                      If tight is True, then the current bit can be set to 0 or 1, but if we set 1 then we require that m_big[i] is 1, otherwise we break the constraint.\n\n                      Actually, the constraint is that the number we are building must be <= m. So:\n\n                          If tight is True, then the bits we have set so far are equal to m's prefix. Then the current bit can be set to at most m_big[i]. So:\n\n                              d_min = 0\n                              d_max = m_big[i]\n\n                          If tight is False, then we can set the current bit to 0 or 1 (no restriction).\n\n                    So, for each state (tight) at position i:\n\n                        candidates = [0, 1] if not tight else [0, 1] but capped at m_big[i] (so if m_big[i] is 0, then only [0]; if m_big[i] is 1, then [0,1])\n\n                    Then, for each candidate d:\n\n                        new_tight = tight and (d == m_big[i])\n\n                        value_add = (current_bit_value if d==1 else 0)\n\n                        Then, dp[i][tight] = max(dp[i][tight], dp[i+1][new_tight] + value_add)\n\n                    However, note: we are iterating over two states for tight, but the above transition requires knowing the next state's dp for the new_tight.\n\n            But wait: we are iterating from i from n-1 down to 0. Then, for a given i, we need the dp for i+1 for two states (tight and not tight). \n\n            Actually, we must consider: the state at i is defined by the tight constraint (which depends on the prefix). \n\n            However, we are processing from the most significant to the least, so we can do:\n\n                Let dp[i][tight] = maximum value from bit i to the end, given that the prefix (bits 0 to i-1) is tight (if tight is True) or not (if tight is False).\n\n            Then, for i from n-1 down to 0, we update:\n\n                for tight_flag in [0,1] (0 for False, 1 for True):\n\n                    low = 0\n                    high = 1 if not tight_flag else m_big[i]\n\n                    Actually, wait: if tight_flag is True, then the current bit can be at most m_big[i]. If tight_flag is False, then we can set 0 or 1.\n\n                    But note: if tight_flag is True, then we are bounded by m_big[i] (which is either 0 or 1). \n\n                    Then, for d in {0, 1} such that d <= high (if tight_flag is True, then d<=m_big[i]):\n\n                        new_tight = tight_flag and (d == m_big[i])\n\n                        value_here = (a[n-1-i] if d==1 else 0)\n\n                        candidate = value_here + dp[i+1][new_tight]\n\n                    Then, dp[i][tight_flag] = max(candidate for d in allowed)\n\n            However, we must note: the state for dp[i][tight_flag] depends on the next state (i+1) for two different tight conditions (new_tight). \n\n            But wait: we are iterating from i=n-1 down to 0, so we have computed dp[i+1] for both tight conditions.\n\n            But note: the state for dp[i][tight_flag] is defined by the constraint from the prefix (which is the first i bits). The next state (i+1) will consider the rest of the bits (from i+1 to n-1) and the new_tight (which is the updated constraint for the prefix including the current bit).\n\n            This is correct.\n\n          However, there is a caveat: the mapping from the big-endian bit i to the array a: we use a[n-1-i]. This is because:\n\n                i=0 (big-endian) -> a[n-1] (last element of a) which is the MSB (2^(n-1)).\n                i=1 -> a[n-2] (second last) which is 2^(n-2).\n\n          But wait: the array a is given for exponents 0 to n-1, so a[0] is 2^0, a[1] is 2^1, ... a[n-1] is 2^(n-1). \n\n          In the big-endian representation, the first bit (i=0) is the highest power (2^(n-1)), so we use a[n-1] for that.\n\n          But note: the function f(x) is defined as:\n\n                f(x) = a0 * (x0) + a1 * (x1) + ... + a_{n-1} * (x_{n-1})\n\n          and the big-endian representation of x is [x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}, ..., x0] (MSB first). \n\n          Therefore, the value for the big-endian bit0 (MSB) is a_{n-1} (because it corresponds to x_{n-1}), and so on.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          But note: the array a is provided in the input as:\n\n                a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}\n\n          and the example: \n                Input: \"5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010\"\n\n          Here, n=5, a = [17, 0, 10, 2, 1]\n\n          Then, for the big-endian bit0 (first bit) we use a[4] = 1, and for bit1 we use a[3]=2, bit2: a[2]=10, bit3: a[1]=0, bit4: a[0]=17.\n\n          Then, if we set the bits as in m (which is 11010) and then set the bits arbitrarily (but not exceeding m) we can get:\n\n          The maximum is achieved by setting the bits that have high a[i] values. In this example, the high values are 17 (a4, which is the MSB) and 10 (a2, which is the third bit from the left in the big-endian representation, i.e., the third bit from the left is the bit for 2^(5-1-2)=2^2).\n\n          However, note: the example solution sets the bits for x=5 (binary 00101) which in big-endian (5 bits) is 10100? Actually, wait:\n\n          Let me convert 5 to 5-bit binary (big-endian: MSB first):\n\n            5 in binary (5 bits) is 00101, but big-endian representation (most significant first) is written as 00101? \n\n          Actually, we write the binary representation from the highest power (2^4) to the lowest (2^0). 5 has:\n\n            2^4: 0\n            2^3: 0\n            2^2: 1\n            2^1: 0\n            2^0: 1\n\n          So the big-endian representation of 5 is \"00101\". \n\n          Then, the bits set in x=5 are the ones at positions 2 and 0 (in little-endian). \n\n          In our mapping, the big-endian bit0 (first char) is 0 -> corresponds to a[4] (which is 1) -> but we did not set it? Actually, we set the bit at position 2 (which is the third bit from the left) and 0 (the last bit). \n\n          In the big-endian representation, the bits are:\n\n            bit0: 0 -> corresponds to a[4] (2^4) -> not set -> no contribution.\n            bit1: 0 -> corresponds to a[3] (2^3) -> not set -> no contribution.\n            bit2: 1 -> corresponds to a[2] (2^2) -> set -> add 10.\n            bit3: 0 -> corresponds to a[1] (2^1) -> not set -> no contribution.\n            bit4: 1 -> corresponds to a[0] (2^0) -> set -> add 17.\n\n          Then, the total would be 10+17=27.\n\n          However, wait: the example output is 27, so that matches.\n\n          But note: in the example, the array a is [17,0,10,2,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of \\( x \\). The challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal \\( x \\) without checking every possible value up to \\( m \\), especially since \\( m \\) can be very large (up to \\( 2^n - 1 \\)).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function \\( f(x) \\) sums elements of array \\( a \\) at positions where the binary representation of \\( x \\) has a '1'. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible. Instead, we use dynamic programming (DP) to explore the binary digits of \\( x \\) from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB), keeping track of whether the current selection of bits is still within the bounds of \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We process each bit position from left to right (MSB to LSB). For each bit, we consider setting it to '0' or '1', ensuring that the number formed does not exceed \\( m \\). The DP state keeps track of two conditions: whether the current prefix matches the corresponding prefix of \\( m \\) (tight constraint) and the maximum sum achievable from the remaining bits.\n\n3. **Transition**: For each bit position, if the tight constraint is active, the bit can only be set to '1' if the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is '1'. Otherwise, it can be set to '0' or '1' freely. The DP transitions update the maximum sum by including the value from the array \\( a \\) if the bit is set.\n\n4. **Base Case**: Once all bits are processed, the sum is zero. The solution involves backtracking through the DP states to compute the maximum sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    m_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m_big = [int(bit) for bit in m_str]\n    \n    dp_tight = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp_loose = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    dp_tight[n] = 0\n    dp_loose[n] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        current_value = a_list[n - 1 - i]\n        tight_max = -1\n        loose_max = -1\n        \n        tight_options = [0, 1] if m_big[i] == 1 else [0]\n        for d in tight_options:\n            new_tight = (d == m_big[i])\n            add_val = current_value if d == 1 else 0\n            next_val = dp_tight[i + 1] if new_tight else dp_loose[i + 1]\n            total = add_val + next_val\n            if total > tight_max:\n                tight_max = total\n                \n        if m_big[i] == 0:\n            tight_options_loose = [0, 1]\n        else:\n            tight_options_loose = [0, 1]\n            \n        for d in tight_options_loose:\n            new_tight = (d == m_big[i])\n            add_val = current_value if d == 1 else 0\n            next_val = dp_tight[i + 1] if new_tight else dp_loose[i + 1]\n            total = add_val + next_val\n            if total > loose_max:\n                loose_max = total\n                \n        dp_tight[i] = tight_max\n        dp_loose[i] = loose_max\n        \n    result = max(dp_tight[0], dp_loose[0])\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n2. **Initialization**: Convert the binary string into a list of integers (`m_big`) for easier processing. Initialize two DP arrays (`dp_tight` and `dp_loose`) to store the maximum sum achievable under tight and loose constraints, respectively.\n3. **DP Processing**: Starting from the least significant bit (LSB) to the MSB, compute the maximum sum for each bit position. For each bit, determine the allowed values ('0' or '1') based on the tight constraint (whether the current prefix matches \\( m \\)'s prefix). Update the DP arrays by considering the contribution of the current bit if set.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the maximum value obtained from the first position (MSB) under both tight and loose constraints, printed as the solution.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using dynamic programming, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( n \\).",
