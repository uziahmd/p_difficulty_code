    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to check for each possible substring length (from the maximum possible down) whether there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate from the maximum possible substring length (which is n-1, because two non-overlapping would require at least double but note: they can overlap) and then check for each substring of that length if it appears at least twice.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. Let n = len(string). We are going to check from L = n//2 (because if we have two overlapping occurrences, the maximum length is floor(n/2) + something? Actually, the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice can be as long as n-1? But wait: if we have two occurrences, the first occurrence must start at index i and the second at j, and they must be the same. The condition for overlapping is that the starting indices are such that the two substrings of length L do not necessarily start at consecutive positions.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and they can overlap. So the maximum length of such substring cannot exceed n - 1? Actually, consider: \n   Example: \"aaa\" -> substring \"aa\" appears at [0:1] and [1:2]. So the maximum length is 2, which is n-1.\n\n But what is the maximum possible length? It must be at most floor((n+1)/2) ??? Actually, no. The substring can appear multiple times and the maximum length is limited by the entire string. However, note: the two occurrences must be contiguous in the sense that they are two distinct contiguous parts of the string.\n\n Actually, the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice can be as large as n-1. For example, the string \"abcde\": \n   The substring \"abcd\" appears only once? Then we look for smaller ones. But if we have \"aaaa\", then the substring \"aaa\" (length 3) appears three times: [0:2], [1:3], [2:4] (if the string is \"aaaa\", then n=4, so the substring \"aaa\" is of length 3, and it appears twice: [0:2] and [1:3]).\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least twice\". In \"aaa\", the substring \"a\" (length 1) appears 3 times, the substring \"aa\" (length 2) appears 2 times, and the substring \"aaa\" (length 3) appears 1 time (only once) in a string of length 4? Actually, in \"aaa\" (string of length 3): \n   \"aaa\": \n      substring \"a\": appears 3 times.\n      substring \"aa\": appears 2 times (from indices 0 and 1).\n      substring \"aaa\": appears 1 time.\n\n So the answer for \"aaa\" is 2.\n\n How about \"ababa\"? \n   Example: Input \"ababa\" -> output 3.\n   Why? Because the substring \"aba\" appears twice: at index0 and index2.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can iterate over possible lengths from the maximum possible (which is n-1) down to 1, and for each length, check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n However, we can break early when we find the maximum length.\n\n Steps:\n   Let s be the input string, n = len(s)\n   Let max_len = 0\n\n   For L in range(n-1, 0, -1):   # L is the length of substring we are checking, from largest to smallest.\n        Create a set (or dictionary) to record the substrings we've seen.\n        For i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substring = s[i:i+L]\n            If substring is already in the set, then we found one of length L -> then max_len = L and break out of both loops.\n            Else, add substring to the set.\n\n   But note: what if we don't find any duplicate for L? Then we go to L-1.\n\n   However, we must consider that the same substring might be found in multiple non-overlapping parts, but our set will catch duplicates.\n\n   But wait: what if we have the same substring appearing more than twice? That's okay, we just need at least two.\n\n   Example: \"aaaa\" -> \n        n=4, check L=3: \n          substrings: \"aaa\" (at",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, which adds a layer of complexity to the problem. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to determine the maximum length of any substring that repeats at least once in the input string. Given that the string length is at most 100, a brute-force approach is feasible. We can check all possible substrings from the longest possible down to the shortest, and for each length, verify if there are at least two distinct occurrences.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves iterating over possible substring lengths in descending order. For each length, we examine all possible substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return the current length as the answer since we are checking from the largest possible length downwards.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm starts with the maximum possible substring length (which is `n-1` for a string of length `n`) and decrements the length until it finds a substring that appears at least twice. This approach ensures efficiency by leveraging early termination once the solution is found.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to the nested loops (checking all substrings of decreasing lengths). However, given the constraint that the string length is at most 100, this approach is computationally feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        found_duplicate = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                found_duplicate = True\n                break\n            seen.add(substr)\n        if found_duplicate:\n            print(L)\n            return\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. If the string length is 1, the output is immediately 0 since no substring of length ≥ 2 can exist.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: The loop starts from the largest possible substring length (`n-1`) down to 1. For each length `L`, it checks all substrings of that length.\n3. **Tracking Substrings**: A set is used to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is found in the set more than once, the loop breaks, and the current length `L` is printed as the result.\n4. **Output Result**: If no duplicate substring is found for any length, the default output is 0, indicating no such substring exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination and set operations to detect duplicates, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
