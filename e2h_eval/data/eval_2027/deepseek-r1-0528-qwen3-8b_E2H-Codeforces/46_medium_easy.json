    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. So we can have a subsegment that is almost strictly increasing.\n\n Approach:\n We note that the entire sequence might be already strictly increasing, then we can change nothing and the answer is n.\n Otherwise, we are allowed to change one element. This means that in the subsegment, there can be at most one \"drop\" (i.e., a place where a[i] >= a[i+1]) and by changing one element we can fix one drop.\n\n However, note that sometimes we can fix two drops if they are adjacent? But wait, let's think:\n\n Example: [1, 3, 2, 4]\n Without changing: [1,3,2,4] has a drop at index1 (from 3 to 2). If we change the 2 to 3, then we get [1,3,3,4] which is not strictly increasing. Alternatively, if we change the 3 (at index1) to 0, then we get [1,0,2,4] -> drop from 1 to 0 and then 0 to 2. So that doesn't work.\n\n Actually, the problem requires strictly increasing. So we can only fix one drop if it is isolated. However, consider:\n\n Example: [1, 10, 9, 11] \n Here, we have a drop from 10 to 9. We can change the 9 to 10 (or something between 10 and 11) but note that 11 must be greater than the fixed number. Alternatively, we can change the 10 to something less than 9? But then the first part would break.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to change one number arbitrarily. So we can change the 9 to any integer. We want the entire segment to be strictly increasing.\n\n How about considering the following:\n\n We can precompute:\n   left[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without any change) \n   right[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment starting exactly at i (without any change)\n\n Then, for each position i, we can consider the possibility of having a subsegment that includes i and we change a[i] (or maybe an adjacent one) to fix the drop.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the changed element is necessarily the one that breaks the increasing condition. It could be that we change an element that is not the one causing the drop.\n\n Actually, the typical solution is:\n\n 1. Precompute arrays `left` and `right` for strictly increasing without any changes.\n\n   left[0] = 1\n   for i from 1 to n-1:\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left[i] = 1\n\n   Similarly, \n   right[n-1] = 1\n   for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right[i] = 1\n\n 2. Now, we can consider three cases for a subsegment that allows one change:\n\n    Case 1: The entire subsegment is already strictly increasing. Then we can take the maximum of left (which is the entire increasing run).\n\n    Case 2: There is exactly one drop (a violation) in the subsegment. Then by changing one element we can fix the subsegment.\n\n    But note: the drop might be fixed by changing one of the two elements involved, or even an element elsewhere? However, the typical approach is to consider the drop at index i (from a[i] to a[i+1]) and see what is the longest segment we can form that includes this drop and is strictly increasing after one change.\n\n    However, we cannot change two elements. So we must fix the entire segment by changing one element. This means that the segment must have at most two adjacent violations (if we fix one element, we can fix two adjacent violations if they are consecutive and the element is in the middle?).\n\n    Actually, consider: [10, 20, 30, 25, 35] \n    The drop is at index 3 (from 30 to 25). We can change 25 to something between 30 and 35, say 31, then the segment [20,30,25,35] becomes [20,30,31,35] which is strictly increasing. But note, the entire segment from 20 to 35 is 4 elements.\n\n    However, we can also consider: [10, 20, 30, 25, 35] without the first element? Actually, we are allowed to choose any contiguous subsegment.\n\n    How to handle?\n\n    We can consider for each index i (the one we are going to change):\n\n        Option 1: Change a[i] to some value. Then the left part (from ... to i-1) must be strictly increasing, and the right part (from i+1 to ...) must be strictly increasing, and also the connection from the left part to the changed element and from the changed element to the right part must hold.\n\n        Specifically, we can look at:\n\n          - The segment from j to k, where j is the start of the increasing run ending at i-1 (if exists) and k is the end of the increasing run starting at i+1 (if exists). Then we can set the changed element a[i] to be greater than a[i-1] (if i-1 exists) and less than a[i+1] (if i+1 exists). \n\n        Conditions for the change to be valid:\n\n          If i is not the first element and not the last:\n\n            We require:\n              left[i-1] > 0 and right[i+1] > 0\n              Then the new value must satisfy: a[i-1] < (new value) < a[i+1]\n\n            But note: we can choose any integer. So we can choose a value in the open interval (a[i-1], a[i+1]), provided that a[i-1] < a[i+1]. If a[i-1] < a[i+1], then we can always choose such a value.\n\n          Then the total length would be: left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1]\n\n        However, what if the segment we are considering is not symmetric? Also, we might not have both sides.\n\n        Actually, we can consider:\n\n          Case 1: Only left side exists (i is the last element). Then we require that the left side is strictly increasing. Then we can set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1]. So the entire segment from the beginning of the left run to i is valid. Then the length is left[i] (but wait, we are changing a[i]? Actually, if we are at the last element, then we can consider the segment from the start of the left run (which is the entire left side) and then we add the last element. But note: our left array is computed without change, so left[i] is the run ending at i. However, if we change a[i], then we are effectively making the segment from the start of the left run (of length left[i-1]) and then we add the changed element. But wait, the left run ends at i-1, so the segment we are considering is from (i - left[i-1]) to i. Then the length is left[i-1] + 1.\n\n          Similarly, if only the right side exists (i is the first element), then the length is 1 + right[i].\n\n        But note: we are allowed to change one element. So we can also consider changing an element that is not necessarily in the middle of two runs? Actually, the idea is to consider every index as candidate for the change.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Let ans = max(n, ...) because if the whole sequence is already strictly increasing, we can use n.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to change at most one number, so we can also have the entire sequence if it is already strictly increasing.\n\n        But wait, what if the entire sequence is strictly increasing? Then we don't need to change anything. Then the answer is n.\n\n        However, we can also consider that the entire sequence might not be strictly increasing, but a subsegment that is the entire sequence with one change can be longer than n? No, because the entire sequence is of length n.\n\n        So we can set:\n\n          ans = max(ans, left[i] for all i)   # without change\n\n        Then consider for each index i:\n\n          Option 1: Change a[i] (so the segment must include i, and we change a[i])\n\n          Let candidate = 0\n\n          Consider:\n\n            Without any adjacent runs, if i is isolated (like n=1) then candidate = 1.\n\n          Actually, we can break into:\n\n            If i is the first element (index0):\n                Then we can set a[0] to any value, and then the right side must be strictly increasing. So the length is 1 + right[1] (if exists). But wait, we can also set a[0] to a value that is less than a[1] (if we have only one element then no constraint, but if there is a next element then we require a[0] < a[1]). Since we can choose arbitrarily, we can set a[0] to a value less than a[1] (if exists) and then the entire segment from 0 to the end of the right run (starting at 0) is valid. However, note: the condition for the entire segment is that from 0 to j (where j is the end of the right run) is strictly increasing. But note: the right run is defined as the increasing run starting at index0? Actually, we didn't compute that.\n\n          Alternatively, we can define:\n\n            left_run[i] = the length of the strictly increasing sequence ending at i (without change)\n            right_run[i] = the length of the strictly increasing sequence starting at i (without change)\n\n          Then, when we change a[i], we can merge the left_run[i-1] (if i>0) and right_run[i+1] (if i<n-1) by ensuring that:\n\n            Condition 1: If i-1 exists, then a[i-1] < a[i+1] (if i+1 exists) OR if only one side exists, then we only require the condition for the existing side.\n\n          Actually, we can consider:\n\n            candidate_length = 0\n\n            If we change a[i], then the segment we consider must be from (start of left_run) to (end of right_run). The start of left_run is the start of the increasing sequence ending at i-1, and the end of right_run is the end of the increasing sequence starting at i+1.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to change a[i] arbitrarily, so we can set it to a value that fits between a[i-1] and a[i+1] if both exist, or just above a[i-1] if only right exists, or just below a[i+1] if only left exists.\n\n            Conditions:\n\n              - If i is the first element (i==0): Then we can set a[0] to any value, and then the entire segment from 0 to (right_run[0]-1) (which is the increasing run starting at 0) can be extended by one? Actually, no: because we are changing a[0] and then the segment from 0 to ... is strictly increasing. The length would be 1 (for the changed element) plus the right_run[1] (if we extend from index0 to the entire right_run) but wait, if we change a[0], then the condition for the next element is that a[0] < a[1]. Then the entire segment from 0 to the end of the right_run (which is from index0 to index0+right_run[0]-1) is still valid? \n\n            Actually, we have to reexamine:\n\n            We are allowed to change one element. We are considering changing a[i]. Then the entire segment we choose must be strictly increasing.\n\n            For i=0:\n                We change a[0]. Then we can choose a[0] to be less than a[1] (if the sequence has at least two elements). Then the entire segment from 0 to (the entire increasing run starting at 0) is valid? Actually, the increasing run starting at 0 (without change) is from index0 to index0+right_run[0]-1. But after changing a[0], we must ensure that the condition holds from index0 to index1: a[0] < a[1]. Then from index1 to index2: a[1] < a[2] (which is already true). So the entire segment from 0 to the end of the original right_run (which is index0+right_run[0]-1) is valid.\n\n                However, note: the original right_run[0] is the length of the increasing sequence starting at 0. After changing a[0], we are effectively extending the increasing sequence from the changed element to the entire right_run. But the condition at the boundary is fixed by our choice. So the total length is right_run[0] (because the original run starting at 0 was of length L, and we are including the same L elements, but we changed the first one). However, wait: the original run starting at 0 was from index0 to index0+L-1. After changing, we can still use the same L elements? Yes, because the condition from index0 to index1 is fixed, and the rest is unchanged.\n\n                But note: we are allowed to choose a subsegment arbitrarily. We don't have to take the entire right_run. However, we want the longest.\n\n                Actually, the segment we can form by changing a[0] is from index0 to index0+right_run[0]-1 (because beyond that, the original sequence breaks). So the length is right_run[0] (because we are using the entire right_run, and we changed the first element). But wait, the original right_run[0] was the length without change, but after change we are not affecting the rest. So we can use the entire right_run[0] (which is the same as the original increasing run from 0) and we are changing the first element to make it fit. Then the length is right_run[0] (because we are using the same indices, just the first element is changed).\n\n                However, we might be able to extend beyond the original right_run? No, because the original right_run is defined as the increasing run starting at 0, so beyond that there is a break. But note: we are allowed to change only one element. The break beyond the original right_run is not fixed by changing a[0]. So we cannot extend beyond.\n\n            Similarly, for i=n-1 (last element): we can set a[n-1] to be greater than a[n-2], then the segment from the start of the left_run (which is the increasing run ending at n-2) to n-1 is valid. The length is left_run[n-1] (but wait, the left_run at n-1 is 1, because we haven't considered the change). Actually, we should use:\n\n            For i=n-1: \n                The segment must end at n-1. We change a[n-1] so that it is greater than a[n-2]. Then the entire segment from (n-1 - left_run[n-2] + 1) to n-1 is valid? Actually, the increasing run ending at n-2 is of length left_run[n-2]. Then we add the last element. The length is left_run[n-2] + 1.\n\n            But wait, the left_run for n-1 without change is 1. With change, we are effectively merging the increasing run ending at n-2 (which is left_run[n-2]) and then we add one (the changed element). So the length is left_run[n-2] + 1.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            ans = max(ans, left[i] for all i)   # without change\n\n            Then for each index i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n            if i == 0:\n                candidate = 1 + right[1]   # if n>=2, otherwise skip\n            elif i == n-1:\n                candidate = left[i-1] + 1   # but wait, left[i-1] is the increasing run ending at i-1, then we change a[i] to be greater than a[i-1]. Then the entire segment from (i - left[i-1] + 1) to i is valid, so length = left[i-1] + 1.\n            else:\n                # We have both neighbors.\n\n                # Condition: we can change a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if a[i-1] < a[i+1]) then the entire segment from (start of left_run[i-1]) to (end of right_run[i+1]) is valid.\n\n                if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                    candidate = left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1]\n                else:\n                    candidate = 0   # meaning we cannot fix the drop at this i by changing a[i] alone? Actually, we can still consider if we change a[i] we might break the condition for the left side or the right side. But wait, if a[i-1] >= a[i+1], then even if we change a[i] arbitrarily, we cannot satisfy both a[i-1] < a[i] and a[i] < a[i+1] because there is no integer between a[i-1] and a[i+1] if a[i-1] >= a[i+1]. So candidate is invalid.\n\n            Then update ans = max(ans, candidate)\n\n          But wait, what if we change an element that is not the one breaking the increasing condition? Actually, the above candidate considers changing a[i] and then merging the left_run[i-1] and right_run[i+1]. However, note: the drop that we fix by changing a[i] is the one between i-1 and i+1 (if we consider the two sides). But what if the drop is actually between i and i+1? Then we are not fixing that drop by changing a[i] but by changing a[i] we are making sure that the left part (ending at i-1) and the right part (starting at i+1) are connected. However, note that the condition for the entire segment is that we have:\n\n            [ ..., a[i-1]] [changed a[i]] [a[i+1], ... ]\n\n          And the drop between i-1 and i+1 is the one we are fixing by changing a[i]. But note: the original sequence might have multiple drops. However, we are only allowed one change. So the entire segment must be strictly increasing. Therefore, the segment we are considering must not contain any other drops.\n\n          However, the left_run[i-1] is the increasing run ending at i-1, and right_run[i+1] is the increasing run starting at i+1. So the segment from (start of left_run[i-1]) to (end of right_run[i+1]) is originally:\n\n            [ strictly increasing until i-1 ] then [a[i]] then [strictly increasing from i+1]\n\n          But note: we are not considering the element at i in the original increasing runs. And the original sequence might have a drop at i-1 and i? Actually, the left_run[i-1] is defined without considering a[i]. Similarly, the right_run[i+1] is defined without considering a[i]. \n\n          But wait, the left_run[i] is defined as the increasing run ending at i. So if there was a drop at i (i.e., a[i] <= a[i-1]), then left_run[i] would be 1. Similarly, if a[i] >= a[i+1], then right_run[i] would be 1.\n\n          In our candidate for changing a[i] (when i is not at the boundary) we require that a[i-1] < a[i+1]. But note: the original condition for the increasing run might be broken at i (if a[i] <= a[i-1] or a[i] >= a[i+1]), but we are going to change a[i] so that it fits. However, the left_run[i-1] and right_run[i+1] are computed without change, so they are independent of a[i]. \n\n          But note: the entire segment we are forming must be strictly increasing. The left_run[i-1] ensures that from the start to i-1 is strictly increasing. The right_run[i+1] ensures that from i+1 to the end is strictly increasing. And we fix the middle by setting a[i] to be between a[i-1] and a[i+1]. Then the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n          However, there is a catch: what if the drop is at the boundary of the two runs? For example, if the original sequence has a drop at i (meaning a[i] <= a[i-1]) and we are changing a[i], then we are not concerned about the left_run ending at i-1 because that run is independent. But note: the left_run[i-1] is the increasing run ending at i-1, so the last element is a[i-1] and the one before that is a[i-2] which is less than a[i-1]. Then we set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1]. Then the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n          But wait, what if the drop is actually between i and i+1? That is, a[i] >= a[i+1]. Then we are going to change a[i] to be less than a[i+1]. Then the condition from i to i+1 is fixed, but what about the left side? The left_run[i-1] is the run ending at i-1, and we require that a[i-1] < (new a[i]) and (new a[i]) < a[i+1]. So if a[i-1] < a[i+1] then we can choose a value.\n\n          However, the problem is: the entire segment we are considering is from the start of the left_run[i-1] to the end of the right_run[i+1]. But note: the original sequence might have a drop at i (a[i] >= a[i-1]) and also a drop at i+1 (a[i+1] <= a[i+2])? Then the right_run[i+1] is the increasing run starting at i+1, so it doesn't matter because we are only concerned about the immediate next element (a[i+1]) for the connection.\n\n          So the candidate for changing a[i] (when i is not at the boundary) is valid if a[i-1] < a[i+1] and the entire segment from (start of left_run[i-1]) to (end of right_run[i+1]) is considered. The length is left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1].\n\n          But note: we are allowed to choose any contiguous subsegment. We are not forced to take the entire left_run[i-1] and the entire right_run[i+1]. However, we are trying to maximize the length. The idea is that by changing a[i] we can merge two increasing runs (if they are separated by a[i]). \n\n          However, what if the two runs are not adjacent? Actually, they are adjacent via a[i]. But note: the left_run[i-1] ends at i-1 and the right_run[i+1] starts at i+1. There is a gap at i. We are filling the gap by changing a[i]. So the entire segment is contiguous.\n\n          But wait: what if the increasing runs are not adjacent? Actually, we are taking the entire left_run[i-1] (which goes from i-left[i-1] to i-1) and the entire right_run[i+1] (from i+1 to i+right[i+1]-1). Then the total segment is from i-left[i-1] to i+right[i+1]-1, which is contiguous.\n\n          However, we must ensure that the entire segment is strictly increasing. We are changing a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if both exist) so that:\n\n            a[i-1] < a[i] < a[i+1]\n\n          Then, the entire segment is:\n\n            [elements from i-left[i-1] to i-1] (strictly increasing) then a[i] (greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1]) then [elements from i+1 to i+right[i+1]-1] (strictly increasing).\n\n          But note: the last element of the left_run (a[i-1]) is less than a[i] and a[i] is less than the first element of the right_run (a[i+1]), so the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n          But wait: what if the segment we are considering is not the entire left_run and right_run? We are forced to take the entire left_run and entire right_run because we are trying to maximize the length. However, we are allowed to choose any contiguous subsegment. So we can choose a shorter segment? But we want the longest. So we are taking the maximal possible extension.\n\n          However, we must consider that the entire segment must be strictly increasing. If we take a part of the left_run or the right_run, then we are shortening the segment. So the maximal candidate for changing a[i] is indeed left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1].\n\n          But what if we change an element that is not the one that causes a drop? Actually, the above candidate considers changing a[i] and merging the two runs. But note: the problem does not specify which element to change. We are iterating over every element as candidate for the change.\n\n          However, there is another possibility: we might fix a drop by changing an element that is not the one that breaks the increasing condition? Actually, the drop is defined by two consecutive elements. For example, if we have [1, 3, 2, 4] and we change the 2 to 3, then the segment [1,3,2,4] becomes [1,3,3,4] which is not strictly increasing. But wait, we can change the 3 (at index1) to 2? Then [1,2,2,4] -> not strictly increasing. Or change the 3 to 0: [1,0,2,4] -> then the first two are decreasing. \n\n          Alternatively, consider changing the 3 (at index1) to 2: [1,2,2,4] -> fails because 2==2. \n\n          Actually, the example [1, 3, 2, 4] has two drops? Actually, it has one drop: from 3 to 2. But note, the entire sequence is not increasing. We can change the 2 to something between 3 and 4, say 3.5, then [1,3,3.5,4] is strictly increasing. Then the segment [1,3,2,4] becomes [1,3,3.5,4] and the length is 4. But wait, the original segment we are considering is from index0 to index3, which is the entire array.\n\n          However, we can also consider changing the 3 (at index1) to 0, then [1,0,2,4] is not strictly increasing because 1>0.\n\n          So the key is: we must fix the entire segment we are considering to be strictly increasing.\n\n          But note: the above candidate considers changing a[i] and then the segment is from the beginning of the left_run[i-1] to the end of the right_run[i+1]. In the example [1,3,2,4] for i=2 (the element 2):\n\n            left_run[1] (at index1) is 2 (because [1,3] is increasing, so left_run[1]=2). Then we change a[2] (which is 2) to a value between a[1] (3) and a[3] (4). Then the entire segment from index0 to index3 is:\n\n                [1,3, (value between 3 and 4), 4] -> strictly increasing.\n\n            Then the length is left_run[1] (which is 2) + 1 + right_run[3] (which is 1, because the increasing run starting at index3 is just [4]). So total length = 2+1+1 = 4.\n\n          But wait, the original entire array is 4 elements, so that is the entire array.\n\n          However, what if we consider changing a different element? For example, changing a[1] (the 3) in [1,3,2,4]:\n\n            Condition for i=1 (not the boundary, so we require a[0] < a[2] -> 1<2, which is true. Then the candidate length is left_run[0] (which is 1) + 1 + right_run[2] (which is the increasing run starting at index2: [2,4] -> length=2). So candidate = 1+1+2 = 4.\n\n          So we have two candidates: changing a[1] and changing a[2] both yield 4.\n\n          But note: the entire array is 4, so the answer is 4.\n\n          However, the example input was:\n\n            Input: 6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6\n\n          Expected output: 5.\n\n          Let me test with the example:\n\n          Sequence: [7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n\n          Without change, the longest increasing subsegment is [2,3,5,6] (length 4) or [3,5,6] (length 3) etc.\n\n          But wait, the example says: change the 3rd element (which is the 1) to 4, then the subsegment [2,3,4,5,6] is strictly increasing. So the subsegment is from index1 to index5, which is length 5.\n\n          How does our method capture this?\n\n          We are considering changing an element. The example changes the element at index3 (0-indexed) which is 1.\n\n          Conditions for i=3 (the element 1):\n\n            left_run[2] (index2): the increasing run ending at index2: [2,3] -> length=2.\n            right_run[4] (index4): the increasing run starting at index4: [5,6] -> length=2.\n\n            Condition: a[2] < a[4] -> 3 < 5 -> true.\n\n            candidate = left_run[2] + 1 + right_run[4] = 2+1+2 = 5.\n\n          So we capture 5.\n\n          But wait, the entire segment we are considering is from index1 to index5? \n\n          Actually, the left_run[2] is the increasing run ending at index2, which starts at index1 (because [2,3] is two elements). Then the segment we are forming is from index1 to index5: [2,3,4,5,6] (with the change at index3). \n\n          However, note: the left_run[2] is from index1 to index2, and the right_run[4] is from index4 to index5. Then the entire segment is from index1 to index5, which is 5 elements.\n\n          But how do we know the left_run[2] starts at index1? Because:\n\n            left_run[0] = 1 (for 7)\n            left_run[1] = 1 (because 2<7 fails -> so 2 is the start of a new run)\n            left_run[2] = 2 (because 3>2 -> so left_run[2]=left_run[1]+1=2)\n\n          So the increasing run ending at index2 is [2,3] and starts at index1.\n\n          Similarly, right_run[4] is computed from the right:\n\n            right_run[5] = 1\n            right_run[4] = 2 (because 5<6 -> right_run[5]+1=2)\n\n          So the increasing run starting at index4 is [5,6].\n\n          Therefore, the candidate for changing a[3] is 5.\n\n          Also, we must consider the possibility of changing the element at index1 (the 2) or index2 (the 3) or index4 (the 5) or index5 (the 6). But the maximum candidate we get is 5.\n\n          However, what if we consider changing the first element (index0)? \n\n            i=0: candidate = 1 + right_run[1] (if exists). right_run[1] is the increasing run starting at index1: [2,3,1] -> wait, no: the increasing run starting at index1 is [2,3] then 3>1 fails, so the increasing run starting at index1 is just [2] (if we break at index1->index2: 3>2 -> then continue, but at index2->index3: 3>1 fails, so the increasing run starting at index1 is from index1 to index2 (two elements). \n\n            Actually, our right_run is computed from the right:\n\n                right_run[5] = 1\n                right_run[4] = 2 (because 5<6)\n                right_run[3] = 1 (because 1>=5 -> no, wait: the condition for right_run is: if a[i] < a[i+1] then right_run[i] = right_run[i+1]+1, else 1.\n\n                For i=3: a[3]=1, a[4]=5 -> 1<5 -> so right_run[3] = right_run[4]+1 = 3? \n\n            Let me recast the right_run computation:\n\n                We want the increasing run starting at i (without change). So:\n\n                right_run[i] = 1 + (if a[i] < a[i+1] then right_run[i+1] else 0) ?\n\n            Actually, standard way:\n\n                right_run[i] = 1\n                for i from n-2 down to 0:\n                    if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n                        right_run[i] = right_run[i+1] + 1\n                    else:\n                        right_run[i] = 1\n\n            Then for the example [7,2,3,1,5,6]:\n\n                right_run[5]=1\n                i=4: a[4]=5, a[5]=6 -> 5<6 -> right_run[4]=right_run[5]+1=2\n                i=3: a[3]=1, a[4]=5 -> 1<5 -> right_run[3]=right_run[4]+1=3\n                i=2: a[2]=3, a[3]=1 -> 3>=1 -> right_run[2]=1\n                i=1: a[1]=2, a[2]=3 -> 2<3 -> right_run[1]=right_run[2]+1=2\n                i=0: a[0]=7, a[1]=2 -> 7>=2 -> right_run[0]=1\n\n            Then for i=0: candidate = 1 + right_run[1] = 1+2 = 3.\n\n            But wait, if we change the first element 7, we can set it to a value less than 2 (the next element). Then the entire segment from 0 to the end of the increasing run starting at 0 (which is [7 (changed),2,3,1,5,6]) but wait, the increasing run starting at 0 (after change) must be strictly increasing. We change 7 to, say, 0. Then the sequence is [0,2,3,1,5,6]. Then the increasing run from 0 is [0,2,3] and then breaks at 3>1. So the entire segment we can form is from 0 to 2 (three elements). So candidate=3 is correct.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to choose any contiguous subsegment. We don't have to take the entire array. So for i=0, we can choose the entire array? No, because the entire array is not strictly increasing. But we are allowed to change one element. So the segment we choose must be strictly increasing. We are allowed to choose a subsegment that does not necessarily start at 0. However, we are considering the candidate for changing a[0] and then the segment we consider is from 0 to the end of the original increasing run starting at 0 (which is two elements: [2,3] because the change at 0 doesn't affect the rest). But wait, after changing a[0] to 0, the entire array is:\n\n            [0,2,3,1,5,6] -> which is not strictly increasing from 0 to 5. But we are only required to have the chosen contiguous subsegment to be strictly increasing. We can choose the contiguous subsegment [0,2,3] (which is strictly increasing) and that has length 3.\n\n          However, we are trying to maximize the length. So we are considering the entire increasing run that starts at 0 (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of a sequence where we can change at most one element to make the entire subsegment strictly increasing. The solution involves analyzing the sequence to determine the maximum possible length of such a subsegment by leveraging precomputed arrays that track increasing subsegments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Array (`left_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at each index without any changes.\n   - **Right Array (`right_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at each index without any changes.\n\n2. **Initial Maximum Length**: The initial maximum length is the maximum value in the `left_arr`, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes.\n\n3. **Check Each Element for Change**:\n   - For each element in the sequence, consider changing it to any integer. The goal is to merge adjacent increasing subsegments by ensuring the changed element fits between the preceding and succeeding elements.\n   - **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the element is the first or last in the sequence separately.\n   - **Middle Elements**: For elements not at the edges, check if the preceding and succeeding elements allow a valid merge (i.e., the preceding element is less than the succeeding element). If so, the candidate length is the sum of the lengths of the left and right subsegments plus one for the changed element.\n\n4. **Update Maximum Length**: Continuously update the maximum length found during the iteration over each element.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left_arr[i] = left_arr[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i+1] + 1\n            \n    ans = max(left_arr)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            candidate = 1 + right_arr[i+1] if n > 1 else 1\n            ans = max(ans, candidate)\n        elif i == n-1:\n            candidate = left_arr[i-1] + 1\n            ans = max(ans, candidate)\n        else:\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                candidate = left_arr[i-1] + 1 + right_arr[i+1]\n                ans = max(ans, candidate)\n                \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the sequence has only one element, the answer is trivially 1.\n3. **Left Array Calculation**: The `left_arr` is computed by iterating from left to right, incrementing the count if the current element is greater than the previous one.\n4. **Right Array Calculation**: The `right_arr` is computed by iterating from right to left, incrementing the count if the current element is less than the next one.\n5. **Initial Maximum**: The initial maximum length is set to the largest value in `left_arr`.\n6. **Element-wise Check**: For each element, the algorithm checks if changing it allows merging adjacent increasing subsegments. The candidate length is derived from the surrounding subsegments if the merge condition is met.\n7. **Output**: The maximum length found during the checks is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages precomputed subsegment lengths to determine the optimal subsegment length after at most one change, ensuring optimal performance even for large sequences.",
