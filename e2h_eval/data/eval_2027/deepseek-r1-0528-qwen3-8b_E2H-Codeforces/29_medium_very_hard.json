Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are going to process up to 10^5 queries and the initial string can be up to 10^5 in length.\n The idea: We cannot do naive string replacement (which would be too slow) because each query could replace many digits and the replacements might chain.\n\n However, note that there are only 10 digits (0-9). We can think of processing the queries in reverse order and use dynamic programming or memoization for the transformations.\n\n Important: The problem replaces a digit d by a string t. But note: the replacements are done in the given order, and the same digit might appear multiple times and also the replacement string might contain digits that are subject to later queries.\n\n But wait: the queries are applied in the given order. However, if we process from last query to first, we can combine the transformations.\n\n Alternative approach: We can use a transformation for each digit. However, note that the transformation of one digit might depend on the transformations of the digits in the replacement string.\n\n Observation: Since the queries are applied sequentially, and the total length of all ti is <= 10^5, we can precompute the final transformation for each digit.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We will process the queries from last to first. For each digit (0-9), we want to know what it eventually becomes after all the queries.\n\n 2. Let's define an array `replace` for digits '0' to '9'. Initially, `replace[d] = d` for each digit d (meaning no change).\n\n 3. Then, for each query (from last to first) of the form \"d -> t\":\n      We update the transformation for the digit d: \n          new_replace = t, but note: within t, every occurrence of a digit should be replaced by the transformation we have already computed (for digits in t, which might have been transformed by later queries, i.e., we are processing backwards).\n\n 4. However, we must consider that the replacement for a digit d might be a string that contains other digits, and these digits themselves may be transformed by subsequent queries. Therefore, we do:\n\n      For each digit from '0' to '9', we want to store the current transformation (as a string) that this digit will become after all the queries.\n\n 5. But note: the queries are applied in the given order. When we process backwards, we update the transformation for the digit d to be the string t, but then we also need to transform the string t by applying the transformations that we have already updated (for the digits in t) from the subsequent queries.\n\n 6. However, the catch: the transformation for a digit d might be updated multiple times (if there are multiple queries for the same digit? Actually, the input says \"the i-th query is described by string 'di->ti'\", so we don't know if the same digit appears multiple times. But note: the problem does not specify that the same digit won't be queried multiple times. So we must handle that.\n\n 7. We can do:\n\n     Let `f(d)` be the transformation of digit d (a string) after processing all the queries (from last to first). \n\n     Initially, for each digit d, `f(d) = d`.\n\n     Then, for each query from last to first (i.e., from the n-th query to the 1st query):\n\n        Let the query be `d0 -> t0`.\n\n        Then, set `f(d0)` to be the string obtained by replacing every digit in t0 by `f(that_digit)` (but note: we are updating `f(d0)` and then we don't update other digits again until we process their queries? Actually, we are processing queries in reverse order, so when we update `f(d0)`, we have already processed (and updated) the transformations for all digits that appear in later queries.\n\n     However, we must note: the same digit might appear in multiple queries. And we are updating the transformation for a digit only once (when we encounter its query) if we process from last to first.\n\n 8. But wait: if a digit d is queried multiple times, then we are updating it multiple times? Actually, we are processing the queries in reverse order. So the last query for d will set `f(d)` to the current transformation (which already includes the effect of the subsequent queries). Then, when we process an earlier query for d, we set `f(d)` to the transformation given by that earlier query, but then we must apply the transformations that were set by the queries that come after (which we have already processed) to the string t from that earlier query.\n\n 9. However, we cannot simply update `f(d)` for the same digit multiple times because the last query in the list is the one that is applied last. So we must ensure that the transformation for a digit is the one that is applied last. But note: the queries are applied in the given order, so the last query is the one that is applied first in reverse order.\n\n    Example: \n        Input: \n            s = \"2\"\n            n=2\n            Query1: \"2->0\"\n            Query2: \"0->7\"\n\n        Processing in reverse order:\n            First process Query2: \"0->7\", so set f('0') = \"7\" (and then we update any occurrence of '0' in the replacement string of Query1? Actually, we are updating the transformation for '0' and then when we process Query1, we use the updated f for digits in the replacement string.\n\n            Then process Query1: \"2->0\", so set f('2') = the string \"0\", but then we must transform the string \"0\" by replacing each digit with its transformation. So we replace '0' with \"7\", so f('2') becomes \"7\".\n\n        Then, the initial string \"2\" becomes \"7\".\n\n 10. How to update the transformation for a digit?\n\n        We can store an array `trans` for digits 0-9, initially `trans[i] = str(i)` for i from 0 to 9.\n\n        Then, we'll store the list of queries (each query is (d, t)), and process them from last to first.\n\n        For a query (d, t): \n            new_t = \"\"\n            for each char c in t:\n                # c is a digit, so we look up trans[int(c)]\n                # But note: the transformation for a digit is stored as a string. However, the transformation string might contain multiple digits, and we must expand each digit in t using the current `trans` (which has been updated for all digits that appear in queries that were processed, i.e., the ones that occur later).\n\n            Then, set trans[d] = new_t.\n\n        However, note: the transformation for a digit d might be very long, but the total length of all t in queries is <= 10^5, and we are doing at most 10^5 queries, but the expansion might lead to exponential growth? But wait: the problem states that the sum of the lengths of ti (the original strings) is <= 10^5. However, when expanding, the string might become long. But note: we are not storing the expanded string for each query, we are just updating the transformation for the digit.\n\n        But the catch: the transformation for a digit is the expansion after all queries. The expansion of a digit might result in a string that is long, but the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti (the original t's) is <= 10^5, but the expanded strings might be much longer. However, note that the total length of the expanded strings might be huge (like exponential) but the problem constraints say the initial string is up to 10^5, and the total length of the replacement strings (without expansion) is 10^5, but the expansion might be done for each occurrence.\n\n        Actually, we cannot store the expanded string for each digit because the string might become too long (like if we have a query \"1->11\", then \"1\" becomes \"11\", then \"11\" becomes \"1111\", and so on, and we have 10^5 queries? But wait, the total length of the original ti is bounded by 10^5, and we are processing 10^5 queries, but the expansion is done in reverse order and we are storing the entire expansion for each digit.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti (the replacement strings) is <= 10^5. But the expansion we do for a single query might be long, and then we store that as the transformation for that digit. Then, when we use that digit in a previous query, we expand it again.\n\n        This could lead to very long strings (in theory) and we are limited by memory and time.\n\n 11. Alternative: We cannot store the entire expanded string for each digit because the expansion might be huge (like repeated doubling). But note: the number of queries is 10^5, and each query is a transformation for one digit. However, the problem says the total length of the replacement strings (the original t's) is 10^5. But the expansion for a digit might be built from the concatenation of the expansions of the digits in the replacement string, and then we are storing that. The total length of all the expanded strings might be astronomical.\n\n 12. We must avoid storing the entire expanded string. Instead, we need to compute the value of the number modulo 1000000007 without building the entire string.\n\n 13. Another approach: Instead of storing the string, we store the numeric value (mod 1000000007) and the length (so we can shift digits) for each digit's transformation.\n\n    Let `value[d]` be the number represented by the transformed string of digit d (mod 1000000007)\n    Let `len[d]` be the length (number of digits) of the transformed string of digit d.\n\n    Then, how to combine two transformations?\n\n        If we have a transformation for a digit d that results in a string T, and then we see a digit e that is transformed to a string S, then the combined transformation for d (if we are replacing d by T and then within T, each digit is replaced by its own transformation) is the concatenation of the transformations.\n\n        But note: the transformation is applied in the order of the queries. However, we are processing from last to first.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            We are going to compute for each digit d:\n\n                value[d] = the number formed by the transformed string (mod 1000000007)\n                len[d] = the total number of digits in the transformed string\n\n            Then, for a query (d, t): \n                We want to set the transformation for d to the expansion of t (with the current transformations for each digit).\n\n                How to compute the expansion of t?\n                    Let the expansion of t be the concatenation of the expansions of each character in t.\n\n                Then, the value for d is the value of the entire concatenated string.\n\n                But note: if t is \"abc\", then the expansion is expansion(a) + expansion(b) + expansion(c). The value of the concatenated string is:\n\n                    value = (value[a] * (10^(len[b]+len[c])) + value[b] * (10^(len[c])) + value[c]) mod MOD\n\n                And the length is len[a] + len[b] + len[c].\n\n            However, we can precompute powers of 10 (mod 1000000007) for exponents up to ... what maximum length? The maximum length of the entire string is the initial length (<=10^5) multiplied by the maximum expansion factor? But note: the expansion is done by the queries, and the total length of the replacement strings is bounded by 10^5, but the expansion might be exponential.\n\n            But wait: the problem says the sum of the lengths of the original ti is <= 10^5, but the expansion factor for a single digit might be large. However, the total length of the entire transformed string might be huge (exponential in the number of queries) and we cannot compute powers of 10 for exponents that big.\n\n 14. We need to reconsider: the problem asks for the remainder of the number modulo 1000000007. We don't care about the actual digits, only the value mod 1000000007 and the length (for shifting) because the next transformation uses the length to compute the power.\n\n    However, the problem is that the expansion of a digit might produce a string that is very long (in terms of digit count) but we are only interested in the value mod 1000000007 and the length (to compute the shift for the next expansion). But note: the modulus is 1000000007, which is a prime, and we can use modular exponentiation for the shifts. However, the length might be huge (like 10^5 * 2^100000) and we cannot store such a big integer.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming that computes the value and the length for each digit, and update them as we process the queries. But the length is needed for the shifting, and we cannot store the entire string.\n\n    However, the problem says the total length of the original replacement strings is <= 10^5, but the expansion might be exponential. But note: the expansion is defined by the queries, and the queries are only 10^5. Each query expands one digit, and the expansion for a digit d is the concatenation of the expansions of the digits in the replacement string.\n\n    We can store for each digit d:\n\n        value[d] = the numeric value of the expansion (mod 1000000007)\n        length[d] = the number of digits (base 10) in the expansion\n\n    But the length might be too big to store as an integer (like 10^5 * 2^(number of queries that affect this digit)) and we cannot store such a big integer.\n\n 16. We must avoid storing the exact length if it is too big. But note: the modulus for the value is 1000000007, and the length is used to compute the power of 10. However, the power of 10 for shifting is:\n\n        value = (value1 * (10^(len2)) + value2) mod MOD\n\n    But the exponent (len2) might be huge. However, we can use Euler's theorem for modulus 1000000007? But note: 10 and 1000000007 are coprime, and we can compute 10^k mod 1000000007 for k up to ... but k is the length, and the length might be astronomical.\n\n    But wait: the modulus for the exponentiation base 10 is 1000000006? Because by Euler, 10^phi(1000000007) ≡ 1 mod 1000000007, and phi(1000000007) = 1000000006. However, the length might be so big that we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006? But note: the length is the exponent, and we are doing:\n\n        base = 10, exponent = L (the length)\n\n    Then, 10^L mod 1000000007 = pow(10, L % (1000000006), 1000000007)   [if L >= 1000000006, then we reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006, but actually we must use Euler's theorem only when 10 and modulus are coprime, and modulus is prime, so yes]\n\n    However, note: the length L is the number of digits. The number of digits can be huge (like 10^5 * 2^(100000)) which is way beyond 1000000006. But we can store the length modulo 1000000006? \n\n    BUT: the shifting operation requires the actual exponent (the length) to compute the power. However, we are only storing the value and the length (for shifting). We cannot store the entire length as an integer because it is too big.\n\n    Alternatively, we can store the length modulo (1000000006) for the purpose of exponentiation? But note: the shifting is:\n\n        value = (value1 * (10^(len2)) + value2) mod MOD\n\n    However, the exponentiation 10^(len2) mod MOD can be computed if we know len2 mod (phi(MOD)) = 1000000006. But then we can store the length as an integer modulo 1000000006? \n\n    However, there's a catch: the length is the exponent, and we are using the length to shift the value. The value is built by:\n\n        Let T1 and T2 be two transformed strings, then the value for T1+T2 is (value(T1) * (10^(len(T2))) + value(T2) mod MOD.\n\n    But if we only store the length modulo 1000000006, then:\n\n        Let L = len(T1) + len(T2)   [this is the total length]\n\n        And for the shifting of T1 by T2: we need 10^(len(T2)) mod MOD.\n\n    But wait, we don't need the entire length for the shifting, we only need the length of the part we are shifting by (which is the length of T2). So we only need to store for each digit d:\n\n        value[d] = the numeric value of the transformation (mod MOD)\n        shift[d] = the length of the transformation (the exponent for base 10, and we can store it modulo 1000000006 for the purpose of exponentiation)\n\n    Then, when combining two transformations (for example, two consecutive digits in the replacement string):\n\n        value_combined = (value1 * (10^(shift2)) + value2) mod MOD\n\n        shift_combined = shift1 + shift2   (but note: the shift_combined is the total length, so we must store the total length? However, the next transformation might use the total length as an exponent. But the total length might be huge, so we store the total length modulo 1000000006? \n\n        However, the shifting operation in the next step uses the exponent (the length) of the entire transformation. But the entire transformation's length is the sum of the lengths of the parts. So we must store the total length as an integer modulo 1000000006? \n\n    But wait: the shifting operation for a digit d that is replaced by a string T is:\n\n        value[d] = (value of T) mod MOD\n\n        and the length for d is (length of T) (the number of digits)\n\n    Now, if we have a replacement string t = \"ab\", then:\n\n        value[d] = (value[a] * (10^(len(b))) + value[b]) mod MOD\n\n        len[d] = len(a) + len(b)\n\n    But the problem: the length might be too big to store as an integer. However, we are storing the length modulo 1000000006 for the purpose of exponentiation? \n\n    However, note: the exponentiation base 10 for modulus MOD (1000000007) requires exponent modulo 1000000006 (Euler's totient). But the shifting operation in the next expansion uses the entire length (not modulo) because the next expansion will use the length to shift. But wait: the next expansion uses the length (the exponent) to compute the power. However, the length is used only in the exponent, and we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006 (because 10^k mod MOD = 10^(k mod 1000000006) mod MOD, provided k >= 0). \n\n    So, for the purpose of computing the value, we can store:\n\n        value[d] = the value mod MOD\n        exp_len[d] = the length of the transformed string, stored modulo 1000000006 (because we only need it for exponentiation)\n\n    But then, when combining two transformations:\n\n        value_combined = (value1 * pow(10, exp_len2, MOD) + value2) % MOD\n\n        exp_len_combined = (exp_len1 + exp_len2) % 1000000006   [since the total length is the sum, and we are storing modulo 1000000006 for the exponentiation in the future]\n\n    However, is that valid? \n\n        Let L = L1 + L2, then 10^L mod MOD = 10^(L1+L2) mod MOD = (10^L1 * 10^L2) mod MOD.\n\n        But note: we are storing L1 and L2 modulo 1000000006, so:\n\n            L1_mod = L1 % 1000000006\n            L2_mod = L2 % 1000000006\n\n        Then, 10^(L1+L2) mod MOD = 10^( (L1_mod + L2_mod) % 1000000006 ) mod MOD.\n\n        So yes, we can store the length modulo 1000000006.\n\n    But wait: the shifting in the current step uses the length (the exponent) of the next part. In the current step, we are using the length of the next part (which is stored modulo 1000000006) to compute the exponentiation. This is correct.\n\n    However, the entire transformation's length is the sum of the lengths of the parts, and we are storing that sum modulo 1000000006. That is correct for the purpose of exponentiation.\n\n    But note: the value_combined is computed as:\n\n        value_combined = (value1 * (10^(L2)) + value2) % MOD\n\n        and L2 is the length of the second part, which we store as exp_len2 (modulo 1000000006). \n\n    However, what if the second part's length is huge? Then, we use exp_len2 to compute 10^(exp_len2) mod MOD, which is correct.\n\n 17. Steps:\n\n        MOD = 1000000007\n        PHI = 1000000006   (Euler's totient for MOD, since MOD is prime)\n\n        Precompute an array for the initial state for digits 0-9:\n\n            value[d] = d (as integer)   [but note: if d is a digit, then the transformation initially is the digit itself]\n            exp_len[d] = 1   (because one digit)\n\n        Then, we store the list of queries (each query is (d, t)) and process them from last to first.\n\n        For each query (d, t):\n            new_value = 0\n            new_exp_len = 0   (this will be the total length of the expansion for d, modulo 1000000006)\n\n            For each char c in t:\n                digit_index = int(c)\n                # The current transformation for digit c is (value[digit_index], exp_len[digit_index])\n                # But note: we are processing from last query to first, so we have updated the transformations for all digits that appear in t (from later queries) already.\n\n                # The value contributed by this digit's expansion is value[digit_index], and it must be shifted by the total length of the following expansions.\n\n                # However, we are processing the string t from left to right. But the expansion of the entire string is the concatenation.\n\n                # We can do:\n\n                #   new_value = (new_value * (10^(exp_len_current)) + value[digit_index]) % MOD\n\n                # But wait, that would be incorrect: because the expansion of the current digit is the entire string for that digit, and we need to shift the existing part (which is the expansion of the previous digits) by the length of the current expansion.\n\n                # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                #   Let the current expansion for the digit c is a string of length L = exp_len[digit_index]. Then, the value of that expansion is value[digit_index].\n\n                #   Then, to append the expansion of c to the current new_value, we do:\n\n                #       new_value = (new_value * (10 ** L) + value[digit_index]) % MOD\n\n                #   and then add the length: new_exp_len = (new_exp_len + L) % PHI\n\n                # But note: the expansion of the entire string is the concatenation, so we must shift the current accumulated value by the length of the next expansion.\n\n                # However, we are processing from left to right. The leftmost digit's expansion comes first, so we need to shift the current new_value by the length of the next expansion.\n\n                # Example: t = \"ab\", then the expansion is expansion(a) + expansion(b). We start with a, then b.\n\n                # Step1: Process 'a': \n                #   current new_value = value[a], new_exp_len = exp_len[a]\n                # Step2: Process 'b':\n                #   new_value = value[a] * (10^(exp_len[b])) + value[b]\n                #   new_exp_len = exp_len[a] + exp_len[b]\n\n                # This is correct.\n\n            Then, set value[d] = new_value, exp_len[d] = new_exp_len.\n\n        However, note: the replacement string t might be empty. Then, we set the transformation for d to nothing (value 0 and length 0).\n\n 18. But wait: what about the initial string? After processing all queries, we need to compute the value of the entire string s.\n\n        We traverse each character c in s:\n\n            digit = int(c)\n            result = (result * (10 ** exp_len[digit]) + value[digit]) % MOD\n\n        However, we must initialize result = 0.\n\n        Example: s = \"12\", then:\n\n            Start with '1': \n                result = (0 * (10^(exp_len[1])) + value[1]) % MOD = value[1]\n\n            Then '2':\n                result = (value[1] * (10^(exp_len[2])) + value[2]) % MOD\n\n        This is the correct decimal representation.\n\n 19. However, note: the initial transformation for a digit d is the digit itself (value[d] = d, exp_len[d]=1). Then, when we update with a query, we set the transformation for d to the expansion of t.\n\n 20. But note: the queries are given in the order to be applied. We are processing from last to first, so we update the transformation for a digit d with the latest query (last one) first, and then the earlier ones.\n\n    Example: two queries for the same digit:\n\n        Query1: \"2->0\"\n        Query2: \"0->7\"\n\n        Process Query2 (last one): \n            d = '0', t = \"7\"\n            value['0'] = value[7] = 7, exp_len['0'] = 1\n\n        Then process Query1:\n            d = '2', t = \"0\"\n            Now, t is \"0\", so we take the transformation for '0' (which we just updated).\n            Then, value['2'] = value[0] = 7, exp_len['2'] = exp_len[0] = 1.\n\n        Then, for the string \"2\", we get 7.\n\n        But wait: the expected result is 7 (because the first query replaces 2 by 0, then the second replaces 0 by 7). So the entire string \"2\" becomes \"0\" then becomes \"7\". Correct.\n\n 21. Implementation:\n\n        MOD = 1000000007\n        PHI = 1000000006\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Read s and n.\n\n        Initialize:\n            value = [0]*10   # for digits 0 to 9\n            exp_len = [0]*10\n\n            For d in range(10):\n                value[d] = d\n                exp_len[d] = 1\n\n        Then, read n queries.\n\n        Store the queries in a list.\n\n        Then, process the queries from last to first:\n\n            for i from n-1 down to 0:\n                query = list_of_queries[i]\n                d_char = first character (e.g., '2')\n                d = int(d_char)\n                t_str = the rest (e.g., \"00\")\n\n                Now, we want to compute the expansion for t_str.\n\n                new_value = 0\n                new_exp = 0   (this is the total length, modulo PHI)\n\n                for each char in t_str:\n                    c = char\n                    digit_index = int(c)\n                    # Get the current transformation for digit_index\n                    v = value[digit_index]\n                    l = exp_len[digit_index]\n\n                    # Update new_value and new_exp\n\n                    # To append the expansion of this digit, we need to shift the current new_value by l digits and add v.\n\n                    # But note: the expansion of the entire t_str is the concatenation. We are processing from left to right.\n\n                    # So, the current new_value is the expansion for the part we've processed so far.\n\n                    # We do:\n                    #   new_value = (new_value * (10^l) + v) % MOD\n                    #   new_exp = (new_exp + l) % PHI\n\n                Then, set value[d] = new_value\n                set exp_len[d] = new_exp\n\n        Then, process the initial string s:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each char c in s:\n                d = int(c)\n                # Shift result by exp_len[d] and add value[d]\n                result = (result * pow(10, exp_len[d], MOD) + value[d]) % MOD\n\n            print(result)\n\n 22. But wait: the example \"123123\", then query \"2->00\", then we expect \"10031003\".\n\n        We have to check the transformation for '2':\n\n            Initially, value[2]=2, exp_len[2]=1.\n\n            Query: \"2->00\", so t_str = \"00\"\n\n            For the first '0' in \"00\": \n                digit_index=0, value[0]=0, exp_len[0]=1\n                new_value = 0 * (10^1) + 0 = 0\n                new_exp = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n            For the second '0' in \"00\":\n                digit_index=0, value[0]=0, exp_len[0]=1\n                new_value = 0 * (10^1) + 0 = 0\n                new_exp = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n            So value[2] becomes 0, exp_len[2] becomes 2.\n\n            Then, the string \"123123\" becomes:\n\n                '1': value[1]=1, exp_len[1]=1 -> result = 1\n                '2': now use value[2]=0, exp_len[2]=2 -> result = (1 * (10^2) + 0) = 100\n                '3': value[3]=3, exp_len[3]=1 -> result = (100 * (10^1) + 3) = 1003\n                '1': 1003 * 10 + 1 = 10031\n                '2': 10031 * 100 + 0 = 1003100\n                '3': 1003100 * 10 + 3 = 10031003\n\n            Which matches.\n\n 23. Another example: \"123123\", then query \"3->\" (empty string)\n\n            Query: \"3->\", so t_str = \"\"\n\n            Then, for d=3, we set new_value=0, new_exp=0.\n\n            Then, the string \"123123\" becomes:\n\n                '1': 1\n                '2': 1 * (10^1) + 2 = 12\n                '3': 12 * (10^0) + 0 = 12\n                '1': 12 * (10^1) + 1 = 121\n                '2': 121 * 10 + 2 = 1212\n                '3': 1212 * 1 + 0 = 1212\n\n            But expected is 1212.\n\n 24. However, note: the example input says:\n        Input: ['123123\\n1\\n3->', ...] \n        Output: 1212\n\n        But wait, our example above got 1212. However, the example output in the problem is printed as '1212'. \n\n        But note: the problem says \"Print a single integer\", so we print 1212.\n\n 25. One more example: \"222\", two queries: first \"2->0\", then \"0->7\"\n\n        We store queries: \n            query1: (\"2\", \"0\")\n            query2: (\"0\", \"7\")\n\n        Process from last to first:\n\n            Process query2: \"0->7\"\n                t_str = \"7\"\n                new_value = 7, new_exp = 1 (since digit '7' has length 1)\n\n                value[0] = 7, exp_len[0] = 1\n\n            Process query1: \"2->0\"\n                t_str = \"0\"\n                For the '0': value[0]=7, exp_len[0]=1\n                new_value = 7, new_exp = 1\n\n                value[2] = 7, exp_len[2] = 1\n\n            Then, the string \"222\" becomes:\n\n                Start: 0\n                First '2': 0*10^1 + 7 = 7\n                Second '2': 7 * 10^1 + 7 = 77\n                Third '2': 77 * 10^1 + 7 = 777\n\n            Expected output: 777.\n\n        The sample input: \n            ['222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', ...] -> output 777.\n\n 26. Edge: empty string. \n\n        If s is empty, then result = 0.\n\n        Also, if a digit is replaced by an empty string, then we set value[d]=0 and exp_len[d]=0.\n\n        Then, when processing a character d, we do: result = (result * (10^0) + 0) % MOD = result.\n\n        So the empty string remains.\n\n 27. However, note: the problem says \"ignore the leading zeroes\", but we are building the number from left to right. Our method naturally builds the number without removing leading zeros? \n\n        Example: \"000\" -> initially, each '0' is transformed to the expansion (if there's a query for '0') or remains 0 (if no query) with length 1.\n\n        But wait, the initial state for '0' is value[0]=0, exp_len[0]=1.\n\n        Then, the string \"000\" becomes:\n\n            Start: 0\n            First '0': 0 * (10^1) + 0 = 0\n            Second '0': 0 * (10^1) + 0 = 0\n            Third '0': 0\n\n        So we get 0.\n\n        But if we have a query: \"0->0\", then the transformation for '0' is still \"0\", so the same.\n\n        However, if we have a query: \"0->00\", then the transformation for '0' becomes \"00\", so value[0] = (0 * (10^1) + 0) = 0, exp_len[0]=2.\n\n        Then, the string \"0\" becomes:\n\n            Start: 0\n            Then: 0 * (10^2) + 0 = 0.\n\n        But the representation is \"00\", which is 0.\n\n        The problem says: ignore leading zeros, but if the entire string is zeros then the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing each occurrence of a specific digit with another string of digits. The goal is to compute the resulting number after all transformations and find its remainder when divided by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). The challenge lies in efficiently handling the transformations, especially since repeated replacements can lead to exponentially long strings, which would be computationally infeasible to process directly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple queries that modify a string by replacing digits with other strings. Each query must be applied in sequence, and subsequent queries might reference digits introduced by previous replacements. Directly applying each query step-by-step would be too slow for large inputs due to potential exponential growth in string length.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of processing each query in the given order, we reverse the order of processing. For each digit, we maintain two pieces of information:\n   - **Value**: The numeric value of the transformed string representing the digit, modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length**: The number of digits in the transformed string, modulo 1000000006 (using Euler's theorem for modular exponentiation).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: By processing queries in reverse order, we ensure that each digit's transformation accounts for all subsequent transformations. For each query, we compute the new value and length by combining the transformations of each character in the replacement string. This approach leverages dynamic programming to efficiently update the transformations without explicitly constructing the entire string.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each query once, and for each query, it processes each character in the replacement string. Given that the total length of all replacement strings is up to 10^5, the overall complexity is O(N + M), where N is the length of the initial string and M is the total length of all replacement strings. This is efficient and feasible for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\nPHI_MOD = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n = int(data[1])\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_char = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((d_char, t_str))\n    \n    value = [i for i in range(10)]\n    exp_len = [1] * 10\n    \n    if queries:\n        for i in range(len(queries) - 1, -1, -1):\n            d_char, t_str = queries[i]\n            d_digit = int(d_char)\n            new_value = 0\n            new_exp = 0\n            \n            for char in t_str:\n                c_digit = int(char)\n                current_val = value[c_digit]\n                current_len = exp_len[c_digit]\n                \n                new_value = (new_value * pow(10, current_len, MOD) + current_val) % MOD\n                new_exp = (new_exp + current_len) % PHI_MOD\n            \n            value[d_digit] = new_value\n            exp_len[d_digit] = new_exp\n    \n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d_digit = int(char)\n        result = (result * pow(10, exp_len[d_digit], MOD) + value[d_digit]) % MOD\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the initial string and the number of queries. Each query specifies a digit to replace and the replacement string.\n2. **Reverse Processing**: Queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the digit's transformation is updated by combining the transformations of each character in the replacement string. The value is computed modulo 1000000007, and the length is computed modulo 1000000006 to handle large exponents efficiently.\n3. **Result Calculation**: After processing all queries, the initial string is transformed by applying the final transformations of each digit. The result is computed by iteratively building the number from left to right, using modular arithmetic to keep intermediate values manageable.\n4. **Output**: The final result, which is the number modulo 1000000007, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformations by leveraging modular arithmetic and dynamic updates, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
