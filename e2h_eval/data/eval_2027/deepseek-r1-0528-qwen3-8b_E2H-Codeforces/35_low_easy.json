Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements (which is also the length of the binary string for m)\n   an array a of n integers (a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1})\n   a string s of length n (without spaces) which is the binary representation of m (with no leading zeros, but note: the string might be given in big-endian? Actually, the problem says: \"the third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1 — the binary representation of number m\".\n\n However, note: the example input is given as:\n      ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n For the first example: \n        n=2, array a = [3,8], and the binary string is \"10\", meaning m = 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2.\n\n But wait, the example says: \n        In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3.\n\n Here, note: the example writes m=20 (which is 2 in decimal). However, the problem states: the binary representation is given as s0s1...s_{n-1}. \n\n Important: the function f(x) uses the bits of x. The i-th bit of x (from the lowest to highest?) or from the highest?\n\n Let's read the problem: \"bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n But note: the example: n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) then f(11)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n How is the indexing done? The problem does not specify the order. However, note that the array a has n elements, and the binary representation of m has n digits.\n\n We can deduce from the example: \n        In the second sample: \n          n=5, a=[17,0,10,2,1], m=11010 (binary) -> m = 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n        Then they say: maximum value is 27, achieved by x=5 (binary 101) but wait, how does x=5 relate to n=5? \n        The function f(x) is defined for x from 0 to 2^n - 1? Actually, the problem says: 0<=x<=m, and m is represented by a binary string of length n.\n\n However, note: the binary string for m has exactly n digits. So the most significant bit is the first digit.\n\n Now, the array a has indices from 0 to n-1. The problem does not explicitly state the mapping from bit positions to array indices.\n\n But look at the example: \n        n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> f(11)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n In this example, the binary representation of x (which is 11) is 1011. There are 4 bits (so n=4). The positions are from 0 to 3 (for a0 to a3). \n\n How do we map the bits to the array indices?\n        The example says: x=11 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3. So the bits set are at positions 0, 1, and 3. \n\n Therefore, the array a is indexed by the bit position (with the least significant bit being the 0th index). \n\n However, note the example: \n        Input: \n            n=2\n            a = [3,8]\n            m_binary = \"10\"\n\n        Then m = 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2.\n\n        And the function f(x) for x=0 (binary 00) -> 0, x=1 (binary 01) -> a0 (because the 0th bit is set) and x=2 (binary 10) -> a1 (because the 1st bit is set) and x=3 (binary 11) -> a0+a1.\n\n        But the constraint is x <= m (which is 2). So we can have x=0,1,2.\n\n        Then f(0)=0, f(1)=3, f(2)=8 -> maximum",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) where each element \\( a_i \\) is included if the \\( i \\)-th bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires evaluating all numbers \\( x \\) up to \\( m \\) (given as a binary string of length \\( n \\)) and computing \\( f(x) \\), which sums elements of \\( a \\) corresponding to set bits in \\( x \\). Directly checking all numbers up to \\( m \\) is infeasible for large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^5 \\)), so we need a more efficient approach.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal solution can be derived by considering each bit position independently. For each bit position, we decide whether setting it in \\( x \\) contributes positively to \\( f(x) \\). However, we must ensure that the constructed \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy approach starting from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). For each bit position, we check if setting it in \\( x \\) would still allow the remaining bits to form a number less than or equal to \\( m \\). This involves:\n   - Converting the binary string of \\( m \\) into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n   - Iterating from the LSB to MSB, keeping track of the current value of \\( x \\) and the constraints imposed by \\( m \\).\n   - For each bit, if setting it does not cause \\( x \\) to exceed \\( m \\), we include the corresponding \\( a_i \\) and proceed; otherwise, we skip it.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit position once, making it linear in \\( n \\), i.e., \\( O(n) \\). This is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    bin_m = list(map(int, list(s)))\n    bin_m.reverse()\n    \n    total = 0\n    power = 0\n    max_val = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        bit_val = bin_m[i]\n        if bit_val == 1:\n            if total + (1 << power) <= (1 << n) - 1:\n                total += (1 << power)\n                if a[i] > 0:\n                    max_val += a[i]\n            else:\n                pass\n        else:\n            if a[i] > 0:\n                if total < (1 << n) - 1:\n                    max_val += a[i]\n                else:\n                    pass\n        power += 1\n\n    print(max_val)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the integer \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n2. **Binary Conversion**: The binary string of \\( m \\) is converted into a list of integers and reversed to process from LSB to MSB.\n3. **Greedy Processing**: For each bit position:\n   - If the bit in \\( m \\) is set (1), we check if adding this bit to \\( x \\) (without exceeding \\( m \\)) allows us to include the corresponding \\( a_i \\) (if positive).\n   - If the bit is not set (0), we consider including \\( a_i \\) only if it doesn't violate the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).\n4. **Output**: The maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is printed after processing all bit positions.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging bit manipulation and a greedy strategy, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
