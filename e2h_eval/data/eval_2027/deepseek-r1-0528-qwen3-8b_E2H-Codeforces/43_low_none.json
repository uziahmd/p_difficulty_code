He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string only contains 'a', 'b', 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends 'c' so there might be none initially? \n    But note: the process is: A gives a string of some 'a's, then B appends some 'b's, then C appends some 'c's (equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' OR both).\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"aabc\" -> YES.\n\n Steps:\n\n Observation:\n - The string must have all the 'a's at the beginning (because A gives a string of 'a's and then B appends 'b's and then C appends 'c's). \n   But wait: what if there are 'a's after a 'b'? Then it would break the condition. Similarly, we cannot have 'b' after a 'c' or 'a' after a 'b' or 'c'.\n\n Actually, the problem states:\n   A has a string of only 'a'. \n   B appends some 'b' to the end.\n   C appends some 'c' to the end.\n\n Therefore, the string should be in non-decreasing order of characters? Actually, the letters are 'a', then 'b', then 'c'. So the string must be divided into three segments: \n   [one or more 'a'] then [one or more 'b'] then [one or more 'c']? \n\n However, note: the problem says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b'\" exist, but what about 'c'? \n   Since C appends some 'c's, and the condition says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'\", \n   but note: the entire string after appending by C includes the original 'a's and 'b's. So the total count of 'a' is fixed (from A), the total count of 'b' is the ones from B (which is appended) plus any that might have been in the original? \n\n Let me re-read: \n   A gives a string of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's. Then C appends some 'c's (equal to the total number of 'a' OR the total number of 'b' in the entire string at the time of C's appending).\n\n But note: the entire string at the time of C's appending is the string from A and B. So the counts for 'a' and 'b' are fixed (the original ones). \n\n However, the problem does not specify that the string from A and B must have all the 'a's and then 'b's. It just says the process. But the example outputs:\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"aaabccc\" -> YES (here, number of 'c' (3) equals the number of 'a' (3))\n\n   But wait, the string \"aaabccc\": \n        a: 3, b: 1, c: 3 -> condition holds because 3 == 3 (number of 'a').\n\n   However, the string is built as: \n        A: \"aaa\", then B appends one 'b', then C appends three 'c's (which is equal to the number of 'a').\n\n   But note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string (which is the string before appending 'c'). The string before appending 'c' is \"aaab\", which has 3 'a' and 1 'b'. So 3 or 1.\n\n   However, the example \"bbacc\": \n        This is \"bbacc\": \n            a: 1, b: 2, c: 2 -> condition: number of 'c' (which is 2) is equal to either the number of 'a' (1) or the number of 'b' (2). \n            But note: the entire string must be built as: \n                Start with A: which must be a string of 'a's. Then B appends 'b's. Then C appends 'c's.\n\n            In \"bbacc\", we see two 'b's first, then an 'a' and then two 'c's. This breaks the order: because after the 'b's we cannot have an 'a'. \n\n   So the order matters: the string must be such that:\n        All the 'a's come first, then the 'b's, then the 'c's.\n\n   Therefore, we can check the string for having non-decreasing order of characters? Actually, the characters are in increasing order: '",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by following a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The key insight is that the string must adhere to a strict order where all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's appended by C must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before appending the 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Character Order**: The string must be divided into three contiguous segments: one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and then one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like having 'a's after 'b's or 'b's after 'c's) makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Once the order is verified, count the occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', 'c').\n3. **Validate 'c' Count**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If both conditions are satisfied, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    # Check if the string is empty\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check the order of characters: all 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's\n    has_b = False\n    has_c = False\n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if has_b or has_c:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        elif char == 'b':\n            has_b = True\n            if has_c:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        elif char == 'c':\n            has_c = True\n            \n    # Count the number of each character\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Since the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # The condition for 'c': must be equal to count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Order Check**: The loop iterates through each character in the string. It ensures that once a 'b' is encountered, no more 'a's should follow. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, no more 'b's or 'a's should follow. If this order is violated, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Character Count Validation**: After confirming the correct order, the code counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The solution checks if there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' as required.\n3. **'c' Count Condition**: The number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the string's structure and character counts to determine if it adheres to the specified construction rules.",
