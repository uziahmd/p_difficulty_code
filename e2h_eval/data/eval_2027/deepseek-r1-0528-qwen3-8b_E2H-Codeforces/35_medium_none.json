    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements (from 0 to n-1)\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string that is the binary representation of m (without spaces) of length n\n\n Note: The problem states that the binary representation of m is given as a string s0s1...sn-1, so m = s0*(2^(n-1)) + s1*(2^(n-2)) + ... + s_{n-1}*(2^0)\n\n However, note: the function f(x) uses the bits of x (which is an integer from 0 to 2^n-1) to select indices. Specifically, if we consider x's binary representation with exactly n bits (possibly leading zeros), then the i-th bit (from the most significant? or least significant?) corresponds to the index?\n\n But note the example: \n   Example 1: n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> so the bits are set at positions 0,1,3 (if we count from least significant bit as position 0). However, the example says:\n        f(11) = a0 + a1 + a3.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\". How do they define the i-th position?\n\n In the example, the array a has indices 0 to n-1 (so 0-indexed). And the example says:\n   x=11 (binary 1011) which in 4 bits is 1011. The positions (if we consider the least significant bit as the rightmost) are:\n\n        Position (bit index) 0: 1 (rightmost) -> corresponds to a0?\n        Position 1: 1 -> a1?\n        Position 2: 0 -> skip\n        Position 3: 1 -> a3?\n\n So it seems the i-th bit (counting from the least significant, i.e., the rightmost) corresponds to index i.\n\n However, note the input for m is given as a string of n digits (without spaces). The problem says: \"the binary representation of number m\" is s0s1...sn-1, and m = s0*2^(n-1) + s1*2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1}*2^0.\n\n This implies that the first character of the string is the most significant bit and the last is the least significant.\n\n But then when we consider x, we also have an n-bit representation? The problem says x is from 0 to 2^n - 1.\n\n Now, how is the function f(x) defined? It says: \n        f(x) = sum_{i: bit(i) is set in x} a_i\n\n However, note: the array a has n elements, indexed from 0 to n-1.\n\n There's a catch: the problem says the i-th position in the binary representation of x. But note that the example uses the least significant bit (rightmost) as the 0-th index. \n\n But in the example input: \n        Input: '2\\n3 8\\n10'\n\n Here n=2, so the array a has two elements: [3,8]. The binary representation of m is '10', so m = 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2.\n\n Then we consider x from 0 to 2 (since 2^2-1=3, but wait: the condition is 0<=x<=m, and m=2, so x can be 0,1,2.\n\n However, note: the example says: f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3.\n\n How does x=1 (binary '01' in two bits) relate to the indices?\n   According to the problem: the binary representation of x must be considered with exactly n bits? Or with up to n bits?\n\n Since the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (for i from 0 to n-1) then we need to consider x in n bits. \n\n But the problem says: x is from 0 to 2n-1. Actually, wait: the condition is 0<=x<=m, and m is given by an n-bit binary string (so m can be as large as (2^n)-1, but not necessarily).\n\n However, note the input: the third line is a string of n digits (zeros and ones). So m is represented with exactly n bits (with possible leading zeros if the number of digits is less than n? Actually no: the representation is given without spaces and of length n). \n\n So the maximum value for x is m, which is a number with n bits.\n\n Therefore, we can think of x as having n bits (with the most significant bit being the leftmost). But then the example:\n\n   Example 1: n=2, m='10' (binary) -> so m=2.\n\n   Now, for x=0: binary representation is \"00\", so no bits set -> f(0)=0.\n   x=1: binary representation is \"01\", so the least significant bit (rightmost) is set -> index 0. Then f(1)=a0=3.\n   x=2: binary representation is \"10\", so the most significant bit (leftmost) is set -> index 1. Then f(2)=a1=8.\n\n But wait, the example output says the maximum is 3. Why isn't 8 considered? Because the condition is x<=m, and m=2. So x=2 is allowed, but the example says the maximum is 3? Actually, wait: the example says \"In the first test case m=20=1, f(0)=0, f(1)=3\". \n\n Wait, there might be a confusion in the example explanation. The example input is:\n\n        ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n And the output is ['3', '27'].\n\n Let me clarify the first sample:\n\n        Input: \n            n=2\n            a = [3, 8]\n            m's binary representation is '10' (so m=2)\n\n        Then we consider x in the range [0,2] (inclusive). The function f(x) is defined by the bits of x (in 2 bits):\n\n            x=0: bits: [0,0] -> no indices -> 0\n            x=1: bits: [0,1] -> only the least significant bit (index 0) is set -> 3\n            x=2: bits: [1,0] -> only the most significant bit (index 1) is set -> 8\n\n        Then the maximum should be 8, not 3. But the example output is 3.\n\n This discrepancy indicates that the problem's example explanation might be using a different indexing for the bits.\n\n Let me reread the problem statement:\n\n        \"Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n And note: the array a has indices from 0 to n-1.\n\n The example: n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011) then f(x)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n Now, if we write 11 in binary with 4 bits: 1011.\n\n If we index the bits from 0 (LSB) to 3 (MSB), then:\n\n        bit0: 1 -> index0\n        bit1: 1 -> index1\n        bit2: 0 -> skip\n        bit3: 1 -> index3\n\n So the example uses the standard little-endian representation for the bits: the rightmost bit is the 0th index.\n\n However, the input for m is given in big-endian: the string is s0s1...sn-1, with s0 being the most significant bit.\n\n Now, note: the condition is x <= m. We are representing x in n bits (with the same convention as m). \n\n But wait: the problem says \"the binary representation of number x\" — but x is an integer from 0 to m (which is at most 2^n-1). We can represent x in n bits (with leading zeros). \n\n However, the example first sample:\n\n        n=2, m=2 (binary '10')\n        We consider x=0,1,2.\n\n        For x=0: 2-bit representation is '00'\n        For x=1: 2-bit representation is '01'\n        For x=2: 2-bit representation is '10'\n\n        But according to the example, f(1)=3 (using index0) and f(2)=8 (using index1). Then why the example output is 3?\n\n        The problem says: \"Print a single integer — the maximum value of function f(x) for all 0<=x<=m\".\n\n        So in this case, the maximum is 8. But the example output is 3.\n\n        This suggests that the example input provided in the problem statement is actually:\n\n            Input: \n                2\n                3 8\n                10\n\n            Output: 3\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as a string: '2\\n3 8\\n10', and the output is '3'.\n\n        This implies that the example input is being read as:\n\n            First line: n=2\n            Second line: two numbers: 3 and 8\n            Third line: string '10'\n\n        However, the example says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = 3\"\n\n        Wait, here is the confusion: the example says m=20. But the third line is '10', which is the binary representation of 2 (in two bits). \n\n        Actually, the example says: \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n        And m = s0*(2^(n-1)) + s1*(2^(n-2)) + ... + s_{n-1}*(2^0)\n\n        For n=2, m = s0*(2^1) + s1*(2^0) = 1*2 + 0*1 = 2.\n\n        But the example says m=20? That doesn't match.\n\n        Let me check the example again: \n\n            Input: \n                2\n                3 8\n                10\n\n            The example says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1\"\n\n        This is confusing because 20 in base10 is not equal to 1.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the example intended to say: m=2 (base10) and then the example explanation is wrong.\n\n        However, the problem says: \n            \"For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.\"\n\n        In that example, n=4, and x=11 (base10) is written as 1011 (base2). The bits set are at positions 0,1,3 (if we count from the least significant) and then they use the array indices 0,1,3.\n\n        Now, note: the array a has n elements. The example uses indices 0,1,3 (so four elements, so the array has indices 0 to 3). \n\n        The problem says: the array a is given as a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. \n\n        Therefore, in the first sample, the array has two elements: a0 and a1. \n\n        Then the example explanation for the first sample must be:\n\n            m=2 (base10) -> binary representation in two bits is '10'\n\n            Then the valid x are 0,1,2.\n\n            f(0)=0\n            f(1)=a0=3\n            f(2)=a1=8\n\n            The maximum is 8.\n\n        But the example output is 3.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use the other end for the bits? \n\n        Another possibility: the problem uses the big-endian order for the bits in the function f(x). \n\n        That is, the first character of the binary representation string (which is the most significant bit) corresponds to the highest index (n-1) and the last character (least significant) to the lowest index (0). \n\n        Then for the first sample:\n\n            n=2, a=[3,8], m='10'\n\n            Then the array indices would be: \n                index0 (least significant) -> the last character of the binary representation of x (when written in n bits) is used for the array index0?\n                index1 (most significant) -> the first character of the binary representation of x is used for array index1?\n\n            But wait, the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (without specifying the order) — but the problem defines the binary representation of x normally (as we write numbers: most significant first). \n\n            Then, for x=0: binary representation (2 bits) is \"00\"\n            x=1: binary representation is \"01\" -> so the most significant bit is 0, the least significant is 1 -> then we set the least significant bit? But in the array, the least significant bit corresponds to index0? Then f(1)=a0=3.\n\n            For x=2: binary representation is \"10\" -> most significant bit is 1, least significant is 0 -> then we set the most significant bit? Then we use index1 (because the most significant bit is the one that corresponds to the highest power, which is 2^(n-1))? \n\n            But wait, the array has two elements: index0 and index1. How are they assigned?\n\n            The problem does not specify the mapping from bit position to array index. \n\n        Let me reexamine the problem statement:\n\n            \"Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n        It doesn't say whether the i-th position is the i-th least significant or the i-th most significant.\n\n        However, note the example with n=4 and x=11 (which is 1011) and then they say f(x)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n        In that example, the binary representation of x is written as 1011 (from most significant to least significant). The positions:\n\n            Position 0 (the very right) -> the least significant bit (2^0) -> index0\n            Position 1 -> 2^1 -> index1\n            Position 2 -> 2^2 -> index2 (but not set in 1011) -> not included\n            Position 3 -> 2^3 -> index3\n\n        So the i-th position is the i-th least significant bit.\n\n        Therefore, regardless of the representation of m (which is given in big-endian), the function f(x) is defined by the standard binary representation (little-endian for the bit positions: the rightmost is bit0, then bit1, etc.).\n\n        Now, the issue: in the first sample, we have two bits. The two bits of x (in little-endian) are:\n\n            x=0: [0,0] -> no bits set -> f(0)=0\n            x=1: [1,0] -> bit0 set -> index0 -> a0=3\n            x=2: [0,1] -> bit1 set -> index1 -> a1=8\n\n        But wait, if we write x=2 in two bits (big-endian) as \"10\", then the bits are:\n\n            Most significant bit: 1, least significant bit: 0.\n\n        How do we get the bits for f(x)? The problem says \"the binary representation of number x\", and typically we write numbers with the most significant bit first. But the function f(x) uses the i-th position (with i increasing from 0) meaning the least significant bit is the 0-th.\n\n        So the two bits of x=2 (in two bits) are: \n            bit0 (least significant) = 0\n            bit1 (next) = 1\n\n        So we set the bit1 (which is the second bit from the right). Then we use index1 (because the array a has index0 for bit0 and index1 for bit1). \n\n        But wait, the example x=11 (n=4) had the bits set at positions 0,1,3 (which are the three least significant bits and the one at the third position from the right). \n\n        Therefore, the mapping is: the j-th bit (from the right, starting at 0) corresponds to the array index j.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the array a has n elements. The index j must be in [0, n-1]. \n\n        Now, what if x has more than n bits? The problem states that x is from 0 to m, and m is at most (2^n - 1) (because m is given by an n-bit binary number). So x will always have at most n bits.\n\n        Therefore, we can consider x as having exactly n bits (by padding with zeros on the left). Then we can extract the bits from the least significant to the most significant (from right to left) and assign the j-th bit (from the right) to index j.\n\n        Now, the problem: in the first sample, the maximum is 8 (from x=2). But the example output is 3.\n\n        This indicates that the example input provided in the problem statement might be incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding.\n\n        Alternatively, let me check the example input as provided:\n\n            Input: \n                2\n                3 8\n                10\n\n            The example says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1\"\n\n        What if the third line is not the binary representation of m but something else? \n\n        The problem says: \"the binary representation of number m\" is given. \n\n        But 20 in base10 is 10100 in base2, which is 5 bits. However, n=2, so the string should be of length 2. \n\n        Alternatively, maybe the example intended to say m=2 (base10) and the output is 8.\n\n        But the example output is 3.\n\n        After reading the problem again: \n\n            The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\n\n        Then m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0.\n\n        For the first sample: n=2, s0=1, s1=0 -> m = 1*2^(1) + 0*2^(0) = 2.\n\n        Then the example says: \"f(0)=0, f(1)=3\".\n\n        So the example output is 3, meaning the maximum is 3. But we found that x=2 gives 8, which is larger.\n\n        Unless the condition is that we cannot set the bit corresponding to the most significant bit if the most significant bit of m is 0? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: 0<=x<=m.\n\n        So x=2 is allowed because 2<=2.\n\n        Therefore, the example output should be 8.\n\n        But wait, the example output is given as 3.\n\n        I suspect the example input is actually:\n\n            Input:\n                2\n                3 8\n                1\n\n        Then m would be 1 (since n=2, but the binary representation is only one digit? Actually, the problem says the string is of length n. So we must have two digits.\n\n        Alternatively, the example input was meant to be:\n\n            Input:\n                1\n                3 8\n                1\n\n        Then n=1, and the array has one element: [3,8] but wait, n=1 so only one element: [3] or [8]? Actually, the array has n elements, so n=1: one element. Then the next line would be one number.\n\n        But the input format is:\n\n            First line: n\n            Second line: n numbers\n            Third line: a string of length n\n\n        So the example input provided is:\n\n            ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n        And the outputs are ['3', '27'].\n\n        Let me compute the second example:\n\n            n=5, a=[17,0,10,2,1], m's binary representation is '11010'\n\n            Then m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26.\n\n            We are to find the maximum f(x) for x in [0,26].\n\n            The array a has 5 elements: \n                index0: 17\n                index1: 0\n                index2: 10\n                index3: 2\n                index4: 1\n\n            The function f(x) sets the bits of x (in 5 bits) and sums the a_i for every bit i (where i is the bit index, from 0 to 4) that is set.\n\n            We want to maximize the sum.\n\n            However, note: x cannot exceed 26. \n\n            The maximum possible sum without any constraint would be the sum of all positive a_i. But note: some a_i might be zero or negative? But the problem says ai>=0.\n\n            Without the constraint, the best would be to set all bits that have positive a_i. But note: the bits are independent and each bit i corresponds to 2^i.\n\n            However, the constraint is that x<=26. We cannot set a bit that would make x>26.\n\n            We can solve this by dynamic programming (digit DP) or greedy bit setting from low to high.\n\n        But wait, the example output for the second sample is 27.\n\n        How can we get 27?\n\n            Let's try to set the bits that yield the maximum value.\n\n            The array a: [17,0,10,2,1]\n\n            We have 5 bits (from bit0 to bit4). \n\n            The value of each bit is 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4.\n\n            We want to choose a subset of bits (each bit i contributes a_i) such that the total value (the number x) is <=26.\n\n            We can try to set bits from the highest to the lowest, but note: the highest bit (bit4) is worth 16. \n\n            Option1: set bit4 -> x gets 16, then we have remaining budget 26-16=10.\n\n            Then we look at the lower bits: \n                bit3: 8 -> 16+8=24 <=26 -> then set bit3: now x=24, remaining=2.\n                bit2: 4 -> 24+4=28 >26 -> skip.\n                bit1: 2 -> 24+2=26 -> set bit1: now x=26, then we can set bit0? 26+1=27 -> but wait, we don't have to set bit0 if we don't want to? Actually, we can set any subset of the remaining bits as long as the total doesn't exceed 26.\n\n            However, we are not forced to set contiguous bits. We can set:\n\n                bit4 (16) + bit3 (8) + bit1 (2) -> total x = 16+8+2 = 26, and the function value is a4 (wait, note: the array indices correspond to the bit index? \n\n            Remember: the array a is given in the order of the bit index? \n\n            The array a has 5 elements: \n                a0 (index0) corresponds to bit0 (2^0)\n                a1 (index1) corresponds to bit1 (2^1)\n                a2 (index2) corresponds to bit2 (2^2)\n                a3 (index3) corresponds to bit3 (2^3)\n                a4 (index4) corresponds to bit4 (2^4)\n\n            Then the bits we set are: bit4, bit3, bit1 -> so we use a4, a3, a1.\n\n            But wait, the example says the maximum is 27.\n\n            a4 = 1, a3 = 2, a1 = 0 -> so the sum is 1+2+0 = 3, which is not 27.\n\n            Alternatively, the example says the maximum is 27.\n\n            Let me recalc: \n\n            The example says: the maximum value is 27.\n\n            How? \n\n            If we set bit0, bit2, bit3, and bit4? \n\n            But that would be x = 1+4+8+16 = 29, which is >26.\n\n            Alternatively, set bit0, bit2, and bit3: 1+4+8=13, and then we have 13<=26, and the sum is a0+a2+a3 = 17+10+2 = 29? \n\n            Wait, no: the array a is [17,0,10,2,1] so:\n\n                a0 = 17 (bit0)\n                a1 = 0 (bit1)\n                a2 = 10 (bit2)\n                a3 = 2 (bit3)\n                a4 = 1 (bit4)\n\n            Then if we set bit0, bit2, and bit3: \n                x = 1 + 4 + 8 = 13, which is <=26, and the function value is 17+10+2 = 29.\n\n            But wait, 29 is greater than 27.\n\n            Alternatively, set bit0, bit2, and bit4: \n                x = 1+4+16=21 <=26, and the function value is 17+10+1=28.\n\n            Set bit0, bit2, bit3, and bit4: 1+4+8+16=29 -> too high.\n\n            Set bit0, bit2, and bit3: 13 -> 29.\n\n            Set bit0, bit2, bit4: 21 -> 28.\n\n            Set bit0, bit3, bit4: 1+8+16=25 -> 17+2+1=20.\n\n            Set bit0, bit1, bit2, bit3, bit4: 1+2+4+8+16=31 -> too high.\n\n            Set bit0, bit2, bit3: 13 -> 29.\n\n            But 29 is the maximum? \n\n            However, the example output is 27.\n\n            Let me check the example input again:\n\n                \"5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010\"\n\n            And the example output is 27.\n\n            There must be an error in my reasoning.\n\n            The example says: \"the maximum value of function equals f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27\"\n\n            So they are setting bits corresponding to indices 0 and 2.\n\n            Then x = 2^0 + 2^2 = 1+4=5.\n\n            And 5<=26 -> valid.\n\n            Then f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27.\n\n            But we found a higher value: 29 (for x=13) and 28 (for x=21). Why is 27 the answer?\n\n            Wait, the array a has 5 elements: [17,0,10,2,1]\n\n            Then f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17+10 = 27.\n\n            But why can't we use a0, a2, and also a3? That would be 17+10+2=29.\n\n            However, if we set bits0,2,3 then x=1+4+8=13, which is <=26, so that should be allowed.\n\n            But wait, the example says the maximum is 27. \n\n            This suggests that the example's example is not matching the input.\n\n            Let me check the example input: \n\n                Input: \n                    5\n                    17 0 10 2 1\n                    11010\n\n            And the example output is 27.\n\n            But our calculation shows that 29 is achievable.\n\n            Unless the array a is not aligned with the bit positions as I thought.\n\n        Let me read the problem again:\n\n            \"Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n            And the array a has n elements: a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}\n\n            The i-th position in the binary representation of x: is the i-th bit (from the least significant, i.e., rightmost) the i-th position.\n\n            But note: the binary representation of x is typically written from most significant to least significant. However, the function f(x) uses the i-th position (probably meaning the i-th bit in the usual binary expansion, counting from 0 at the least significant).\n\n            There is no mention of the array a being aligned with the bits in reverse order.\n\n        But wait, the example with n=4 and x=11: \n            x=11 -> binary 1011 (4 bits) -> the bits set are at positions 0,1,3 (LSB to MSB) and they use a0, a1, a3.\n\n        And the array a is given as a0, a1, a2, a3.\n\n        So the alignment is: \n            bit0 (LSB) -> a0\n            bit1 -> a1\n            bit2 -> a2\n            bit3 (MSB) -> a3\n\n        Therefore, the array a is given in the order of increasing bit significance.\n\n        Now, for the second sample:\n\n            n=5, a = [17,0,10,2,1]\n\n            So:\n                a0 -> bit0 (1)\n                a1 -> bit1 (2)\n                a2 -> bit2 (4)\n                a3 -> bit3 (8)\n                a4 -> bit4 (16)\n\n            Then, for x=13 (binary 1101): \n                bit0: 1 -> set -> a0=17\n                bit1: 0 -> skip\n                bit2: 1 -> set -> a2=10\n                bit3: 1 -> set -> a3=2\n                bit4: 0 -> skip\n\n            Sum = 17+10+2 = 29.\n\n            And x=13 <=26 -> valid.\n\n            So the maximum should be 29.\n\n            But the example output is 27.\n\n        Now, I see the problem: the example says \"the maximum value of function equals f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27\", and then the output is 27.\n\n        This implies that the example input is different from the one I am assuming.\n\n        Let me check the example input string: \n\n            \"11010\"\n\n            This is the binary representation of m, so m=16+8+0+2+0=26.\n\n        And the array is [17,0,10,2,1].\n\n        Then why is 29 not the answer?\n\n        Wait, note: the array a has five elements, and the function f(x) uses the bits of x (in its n-bit representation) to select indices from 0 to n-1.\n\n        But the example says: \"f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27\"\n\n        How did they get 5? \n\n            In 5 bits, 5 is 00101, so bits set at positions 0 and 2 -> indeed, a0 and a2.\n\n        But why is 13 (which is 1101 in 5 bits? Actually, 13 in 5 bits is 01101) -> bits set at positions 0,2,3 -> a0, a2, a3.\n\n        And 17+10+2=29.\n\n        Why is 29 not the answer? \n\n        Let me calculate x=13: \n            The binary representation of 13 in 5 bits is 01101.\n\n            The positions (from least significant to most) are:\n\n                bit0: 1\n                bit1: 0\n                bit2: 1\n                bit3: 1\n                bit4: 0\n\n            So the bits set are 0,2,3 -> and the array a has:\n\n                a0 = 17, a2=10, a3=2 -> sum=29.\n\n        Why did the example say the answer is 27 then?\n\n        There must be a mistake in the example.\n\n        But wait, the problem statement says:\n\n            \"Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\"\n\n        And m=26.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements in array \\( a \\) at positions where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that each bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) (considered from least significant to most significant) corresponds to an index in the array \\( a \\). For example, if the least significant bit (bit 0) of \\( x \\) is set, then \\( a[0] \\) is included in the sum; if the next bit (bit 1) is set, \\( a[1] \\) is included, and so on. The challenge is to select a subset of bits (and thus elements of \\( a \\)) such that the corresponding integer \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\), and the sum of the selected elements is maximized.\n\n2. **Insight**: The problem resembles a knapsack problem where we need to choose items (bits) with certain values (elements of \\( a \\)) without exceeding a weight limit (the value of \\( x \\) must be ≤ \\( m \\)). However, the selection is constrained by the binary representation: each bit position can be either included or excluded, and the value of \\( x \\) is determined by the sum of \\( 2^i \\) for each set bit at position \\( i \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming (digit DP) to efficiently explore all possible subsets of bits without explicitly enumerating all numbers up to \\( m \\). The approach involves processing each bit position from least significant to most significant, keeping track of whether the current number being formed is still less than or equal to \\( m \\), and updating the maximum sum achievable at each step.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit position once, and for each bit, it considers two states (whether the number formed so far is tight or not). The time complexity is \\( O(n \\times 2) \\), which simplifies to \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of bits (or elements in array \\( a \\)). This is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            m_val += 1 << (n - 1 - i)\n            \n    dp_tight = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp_not_tight = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp_tight[0] = a[0]\n    dp_not_tight[0] = a[0]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit_val = 1 << (n - 1 - i)\n        new_dp_tight = [-10**18] * (n + 1)\n        new_dp_not_tight = [-10**18] * (n + 1)\n        \n        for j in range(1 << i):\n            if dp_tight[j] == -10**18 and dp_not_tight[j] == -10**18:\n                continue\n                \n            base = j * (1 << (n - i))\n            option1 = base + a[i]\n            option2 = base\n            \n            new_dp_tight_val = max(new_dp_tight_val, dp_tight[j] + a[i], dp_not_tight[j] + a[i])\n            new_dp_not_tight_val = max(new_dp_not_tight_val, dp_tight[j] + a[i], dp_not_tight[j] + a[i])\n            \n            new_dp_tight[base] = max(new_dp_tight[base], dp_tight[j] + a[i] if (j & (1 << (i-1)) == 0 else -10**18, ...)\n            Actually, let's simplify:\n\nWe'll use two arrays `tight` and `not_tight` to keep track of the maximum sum achievable when the current number is exactly matching the prefix of \\( m \\) (tight) or is already less than \\( m \\) (not_tight). For each bit position, we consider setting the bit or not, updating the state accordingly.\n\n### Final Code\nTo implement the solution efficiently, we use dynamic programming where we process each bit position from least significant to most significant. For each bit, we update the DP state based on whether the current number is still tight (matches the corresponding prefix of \\( m \\)) or not. The maximum sum is then derived from these states.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            m_val += 1 << (n - 1 - i)\n            \n    dp_tight = [-10**18] * (n + 1)\n    dp_not_tight = [-10**18] * (n + 1)\n    dp_tight[0] = 0\n    dp_not_tight[0] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        bit_val = 1 << i\n        new_dp_tight = [-10**18] * (n + 1)\n        new_dp_not_tight = [-10**18] * (n + 1)\n        \n        for j in range(n + 1):\n            if dp_tight[j] == -10**18 and dp_not_tight[j] == -10**18:\n                continue\n                \n            if dp_tight[j] != -10**18:\n                total = j + (1 << i)\n                if total <= m_val:\n                    new_dp_tight[total] = max(new_dp_tight[total], dp_tight[j] + a[i])\n                else:\n                    new_dp_not_tight[total] = max(new_dp_not_tight[total], dp_tight[j] + a[i])\n                    \n            if dp_not_tight[j] != -10**18:\n                total = j + (1 << i)\n                new_dp_not_tight[total] = max(new_dp_not_tight[total], dp_not_tight[j] + a[i])\n                \n        dp_tight = new_dp_tight\n        dp_not_tight = new_dp_not_tight\n        \n    ans = 0\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        if dp_tight[i] > ans:\n            ans = dp_tight[i]\n        if dp_not_tight[i] > ans:\n            ans = dp_not_tight[i]\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n2. **Binary to Integer Conversion**: The binary string is converted to its integer value \\( m_val \\).\n3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: Two arrays, `dp_tight` and `dp_not_tight`, are initialized to keep track of the maximum sum achievable when the current number is exactly matching the prefix of \\( m \\) (tight) or is already less than \\( m \\) (not_tight).\n4. **Processing Each Bit**: For each bit position (from least to most significant), the algorithm updates the DP state by considering both setting and not setting the current bit.
