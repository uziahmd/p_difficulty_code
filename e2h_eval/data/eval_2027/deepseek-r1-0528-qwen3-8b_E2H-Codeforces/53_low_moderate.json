    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a simpler approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to check for each possible substring length (from the maximum possible down) whether there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. If the string length is n, then the maximum possible duplicate substring length is floor(n/2) but actually we can have duplicates even when overlapping, so we consider from n-1 down to 1 (but note: if we find one duplicate at length L, then we can output L and stop? Actually, we want the longest, so we start from the largest possible and go downwards until we find one that has at least two occurrences.)\n\n However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and occurrences can overlap.\n\n But note: the entire string might be the same character, then the longest substring that appears twice could be the whole string if it appears twice? Actually, no: in \"zzz\", the substring \"zz\" appears twice (at positions 0 and 1). So the answer for \"zzz\" is 2.\n\n Alternate approach: \n   We can iterate over all substring lengths from the maximum (n) down to 1, and for each length, check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: if we have a string of length 5, then the maximum length of a substring that can appear twice is 4? Actually, no: consider \"aaaaa\": \n   The substring \"aaaa\" (length 4) appears at index0 and index1, so that's two times. But wait, the entire string \"aaaaa\" (length 5) cannot appear twice because the string is only one occurrence. So the maximum length we can get is 4.\n\n However, we can also have: \n   \"ababa\": \n      substring \"aba\" appears at index0 and index2 -> so length 3.\n\n How to check for a given length L?\n   We can generate all contiguous substrings of length L and store them in a set or dictionary to see if any repeats.\n\n But note: the problem doesn't require the substring to be contiguous? Actually, the problem says substring, which by standard definition is contiguous.\n\n However, the sample: \n   Input: 'abcd' -> Output: '0'\n   Input: 'ababa' -> Output: '3'\n   Input: 'zzz' -> Output: '2'\n\n Steps for the algorithm:\n\n Let s be the input string, n = len(s)\n\n We'll iterate L from min(n-1, n//2 * 2 + something?) Actually, we don't need to restrict by n//2 because even if the substring is long, we just need two non-overlapping or overlapping? The problem says they can overlap.\n\n But note: the entire string cannot be used as a duplicate because it only appears once, so the maximum length we can have is n-1? Actually, no: \n   Example: \"abcabc\" -> the substring \"abc\" (length 3) appears twice, and the entire string is 6, but we can have a substring of length 3. But what about a longer one? \n   In \"abcabc\", the substring \"abcabc\" (length 6) only appears once. However, the substring \"abc\" (which is the first three) and \"abc\" (the next three) are two occurrences. \n\n However, consider \"aaa\": \n   The substring \"aa\" (length 2) appears twice (at index0 and index1). The substring \"aaa\" (length 3) appears only once. \n\n So we can iterate L from the maximum possible (which is n-1) down to 1, and check for each L if there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: if we have two occurrences, they must be non-overlapping? The problem says they can overlap. So for example, in \"aaa\", we have two overlapping occurrences of \"aa\": \n   [0:2] and [1:3] both are \"aa\".\n\n However, the problem does not require the two occurrences to be non-overlapping. Therefore, we can have two occurrences that share some characters.\n\n So the plan is:\n\n   For L from n down to 1? Actually, we want the longest, so we should start from the maximum possible L (which is n-1) because if we have a substring of length n, then we can only have one occurrence. So the maximum duplicate substring must be of length at most n-1. But wait, what if the string is \"aaaa\"? \n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution must efficiently handle all edge cases, including strings with all identical characters or no repeated substrings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous substring that occurs at least twice in the input string. The key observation here is that the longest such substring cannot be longer than half the length of the string (rounded down), but due to overlapping occurrences, it might be slightly less. However, since the string length is guaranteed to be up to 100, a brute-force approach is feasible.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings of decreasing lengths, starting from the largest possible (which is `n-1` for a string of length `n`) down to 1. For each length, we generate all unique substrings and check if any substring appears more than once. The first length where a duplicate is found is our answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a sliding window approach to generate all substrings of a given length. For each length, we store substrings in a set to detect duplicates. If a duplicate is found during the generation of substrings for a particular length, we immediately return that length as the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each possible substring length from `n-1` down to 1. For each length, it processes `O(n)` substrings. Given that `n` is at most 100, the total operations are manageable (around 5050 in the worst case), making the solution efficient for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        found = False\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                found = True\n                break\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = True\n        if found:\n            print(L)\n            return\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string is empty, the output is immediately 0.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: The loop starts from the maximum possible substring length (`n-1`) down to 1. This ensures we find the longest valid substring early.\n4. **Sliding Window Check**: For each length `L`, the code checks every possible substring of that length using a sliding window. A dictionary keeps track of seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, the loop breaks, and the current length `L` is printed.\n5. **Output Result**: If no duplicates are found for all lengths, the output is 0, indicating no repeating substrings.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging the problem's constraints and a straightforward sliding window technique, ensuring optimal performance for the given input size.",
