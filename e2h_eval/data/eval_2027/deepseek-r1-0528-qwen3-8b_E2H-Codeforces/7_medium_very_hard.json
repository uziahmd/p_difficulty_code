The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given a mathematical model for a snowflake graph. The construction is as follows:\n   - Start with 1 vertex (step 0).\n   - Then, at least one step: the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Now we have 1 + k vertices.\n   - Then, each vertex that has degree 1 (i.e., connected to only one other) must be connected to k more new vertices (at least one such expansion).\n\n However, note that the process must be done at least once (the first step). But then the description says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" \n\n Actually, reading the problem again: the first step is fixed (the initial vertex connected to k new vertices). Then, the rule is applied repeatedly: whenever a vertex has degree 1, it gets k new neighbors? But wait, the example for k=4 is the smallest possible snowflake. Let's draw:\n\n Step 0: 1 vertex.\n Step 1: 1 + k = 5 for k=4? Actually, the example says the smallest for k=4 is shown. But the example input/output includes n=6 and n=13, etc.\n\n Let's try to model the growth:\n\n Step 0: 1 node.\n\n Step 1: add k nodes -> total nodes = 1 + k.\n\n Step 2: Now, in the graph after step 1, there are k leaves (each of the k nodes added at step 1 is connected only to the center). Then, according to the rule, each leaf must be expanded (so we do the step at least once, meaning we must do step 1 at least, and then step 2 is mandatory for all leaves? Actually, the problem says: \"This step should be done at least once\" meaning the entire expansion process must be done at least once (so at least step 1). Then, the next step (step 2) is also required for every leaf? Or is it that we can choose to stop after step 1?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n So the first step is the initial one (center to k nodes). Then, the condition says that we must do the expansion for every vertex with degree 1 at least once. But note: after step 1, we have k leaves. Then, if we do step 2, we replace each leaf with a star of k new nodes? Actually, no: when we expand a leaf, we connect that leaf to k new nodes. But then the leaf becomes an internal node (with degree k+1) and the new nodes become leaves. Then we have to do the same for the new leaves? \n\n However, the problem does not specify that the process must be repeated until no more leaves? It just says that we must do the expansion for every vertex with degree 1 at least once. But note: the expansion is defined as: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" and this step should be done at least once.\n\n But wait: the first expansion (step 1) is already done. Then, after step 1, we have k leaves. Then, the rule says that we must do the expansion for these leaves (because they are connected to only one other vertex). So we must do step 2. Then, after step 2, we have:\n\n   Step 0: 1 node.\n   Step 1: 1 + k nodes.\n   Step 2: 1 + k + k*k nodes? Because each of the k leaves gets k new nodes.\n\n But wait, in step 2, we are expanding each leaf (which was just connected to the center) by adding k new nodes. So each leaf becomes connected to k new ones, so now the leaf has degree k+1 (and the new nodes are leaves). Then, we must do step 3 for all the new leaves (if we are to do the step at least once)? Actually, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the entire process (from the beginning) must be done at least once. But then, after step 1, we have leaves, and we must expand them (step 2). Then after step 2, we have more leaves, and then we must expand them too? Or can we stop after step 2?\n\n The problem does not specify the number of steps, but the condition is: we start with one vertex, then we do the initial expansion (step 1) and then we must do the expansion (step 2) for every leaf at least once. But note: the expansion is defined for every vertex with degree 1. After step 1, we have k leaves. Then we do step 2: we expand each leaf, so now we have k*k leaves (because each leaf from step 1 is replaced by k-1 leaves? Actually, no: when we expand a leaf, we connect it to k new nodes. Then the leaf is no longer a leaf (its degree becomes 1 + k = k+1) and the new nodes are leaves. So from one leaf we get k new leaves. Then, we must expand those new leaves again? \n\n The problem says: \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the entire process (the expansion of all leaves) must be done at least once. But note: the initial expansion (step 1) is the first time we do the expansion (so that counts as the first time). Then, the next expansion (step 2) is the second time we do the expansion. And the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we must do it at least once? Actually, the problem says two things:\n\n   Rule 1: The initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (this is the first expansion).\n   Rule 2: Each vertex with degree 1 is connected to k new vertices (this expansion step) and this step must be done at least once.\n\n But note: the first expansion (Rule 1) is the first time we do the expansion step (Rule 2) for the center? Actually, the center initially has degree 0, then we connect it to k, so the center now has degree k (which is >=2) and the k nodes are leaves. Then the condition for Rule 2 applies to the k leaves. Then we do Rule 2 for the k leaves, which adds k*k nodes. Then, after that, the leaves from step 2 are the new nodes, and they have degree 1 (they are connected only to their parent) so we must do Rule 2 again? \n\n But wait, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\". Does that mean that the entire process (including the first expansion and then at least one more expansion for every leaf) must be done? Or does it mean that the expansion step (Rule 2) must be performed at least once (meaning at least one expansion beyond the initial one)?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n   \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n This is ambiguous. However, note that the smallest snowflake for k=4 is shown. What does the smallest look like? The smallest must be the one that has been expanded the minimum number of times. Since the condition requires the expansion step (Rule 2) to be done at least once, then we must have at least two expansions: the initial expansion (Rule 1) and then one expansion (Rule 2) for the leaves.\n\n Therefore, the minimal snowflake has two layers: the center (1 node) and the first ring (k nodes) and the second ring (k*k nodes). So total nodes = 1 + k + k*k.\n\n However, wait: what if we do only the initial expansion (Rule 1) and then stop? Then we have 1+k nodes. But the problem says the expansion step (Rule 2) must be done at least once. That expansion step (Rule 2) is the one that expands the leaves. So we cannot stop at 1+k.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the entire process (Rule 1 and then Rule 2 at least once) is mandatory. But note: the problem says \"This step\" (meaning Rule 2) should be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake must have at least two expansions: the center expansion (Rule 1) and then one expansion of the leaves (Rule 2). Then the minimal snowflake has 1 + k + k^2 nodes.\n\n However, let's check the example test cases:\n\n Input: \n   9\n   1\n   2\n   3\n   6\n   13\n   15\n   255\n   10101\n   1000000000000000000\n\n Output:\n   NO\n   NO\n   NO\n   NO\n   YES\n   YES\n   YES\n   YES\n   NO\n\n Let's see:\n\n   n=1: NO -> because k>1, and we need at least two expansions (so at least 1+k+k^2, which is at least 1+2+4=7) but wait, maybe we can have multiple layers? Actually, the problem doesn't fix the number of layers, but the minimal snowflake is 1+k+k^2.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require that we do the expansion step (Rule 2) only once. It says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we can do it more than once. However, the minimal snowflake is the one with two layers (initial and then one expansion). So the total number of vertices for a snowflake with two layers is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n   However, we might have more layers. For example, three layers: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of vertices for a snowflake with m layers (m>=2) is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1)\n\n   This is a geometric series. We can write:\n\n        n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   But note: the first layer (center) is the 0-th power (k^0) and then we have m layers (from exponent 0 to m-1). So the formula is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the initial expansion (Rule 1) is the first expansion. Then, the expansion step (Rule 2) is done at least once (so at least one more expansion). So the minimal number of layers is 2 (so m=2: center and one ring). Then the minimal n is (k^2 - 1)/(k-1) = k+1 + 1? Actually, (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1. Wait, that doesn't match our previous count of 1+k+k^2.\n\n   Let me clarify: the layers are:\n\n     Layer0: 1 node (the center) -> k^0 = 1.\n     Layer1: k nodes -> k^1 = k.\n     Layer2: k^2 nodes -> k^2.\n\n   Then the total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n   The geometric series sum from i=0 to i=m-1 is (k^m - 1)/(k-1). For m=3: (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the initial expansion (Rule 1) is the first expansion. Then we have:\n\n        Layer0: 1 node (already there)\n        After Rule1: we add k nodes (layer1). Then we do Rule2 at least once: which is the expansion of the leaves (the k nodes in layer1) and that adds k^2 nodes (layer2). Then the total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n   So the formula for m layers (where the center is layer0 and the outermost is layer (m-1)) is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1) = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   However, note that the problem does not fix m (the number of layers). We can have any m>=2.\n\n   So the problem reduces to: for a given n (>=1), does there exist integers k>1 and integer m>=2 such that:\n\n        n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   But note: k is an integer greater than 1, and m is an integer at least 2.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: for a fixed k, we can compute the total number of nodes for different m (starting from m=2) until the value exceeds n.\n\n   However, n can be up to 10^18. We cannot iterate over k from 2 to infinity and then for each k iterate m from 2 until the sum exceeds n (because k can be very large and m even 2 gives k^2 which might be huge, but note: k must be at least 2, and for k=2, m=60 gives 2^60 which is about 1e18, so m won't be too big).\n\n   But note: t can be up to 10000. So we cannot iterate for each test case over k and m.\n\n   Alternative approach:\n\n   Notice that the equation is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1)\n\n   This is the same as:\n\n        n * (k-1) = k^m - 1\n\n   So we have:\n\n        k^m = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   Now, we can fix m (the number of layers) and try to find k. But note: m>=2 and k>1.\n\n   However, note that the minimal n for a fixed k and m=2 is (k^2+k+1) ??? Wait, no: for m=2, n = (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1. But wait, let me recalc:\n\n        For m=2: \n            n = (k^2 - 1) / (k-1) = (k-1)*(k+1)/(k-1) = k+1.\n\n        For m=3: \n            n = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k^2 + k + 1.\n\n        For m=4: \n            n = (k^4-1)/(k-1) = k^3 + k^2 + k + 1.\n\n   So the formula for m layers is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1) = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   Then, for a fixed m, we have:\n\n        k^m = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   But note: we can also consider that the same n can be represented in multiple ways (different k and m). However, we don't care about the representation, we just need to know if there exists any k>1 and m>=2 such that the equation holds.\n\n   How to solve for k and m?\n\n   Observation: since m>=2, the smallest m is 2. Then n must be at least k+1 (for m=2). But k>1, so n>=3 (k=2: n=3; k=3: n=4, etc). However, wait: for k=2 and m=2, n= (2^2-1)/(2-1)=3. So n=3 is represented.\n\n   But note: the example input says n=1,2,3 -> output \"NO\" for n=1,2,3? Actually, the example output for n=3 is \"NO\". \n\n   Why? Let me check the example: \n        Input: \n            9\n            1\n            2\n            3\n            6\n            13\n            15\n            255\n            10101\n            1000000000000000000\n\n        Output: \n            NO\n            NO\n            NO\n            NO\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            NO\n\n   So n=3 is \"NO\", but according to our formula for m=2 and k=2: n= (2^2-1)/(2-1)=3 -> so that would be \"YES\", but the example output says \"NO\".\n\n   There is a contradiction. \n\n   Let's reexamine the problem statement: \n\n        \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n\n        \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n   The key point: the expansion step (Rule 2) must be done at least once. The initial expansion (Rule 1) is the first expansion (for the center). Then, the expansion step (Rule 2) must be done at least once (so at least one more expansion). \n\n   In the case of k=2 and m=2: \n        Layer0: 1 node (center).\n        Layer1: 2 nodes (from Rule1).\n        Then, we must do Rule2: expand the two leaves (each leaf gets 2 new nodes). Then we have two new nodes per leaf -> 4 nodes. Then the total nodes would be 1 (center) + 2 (first ring) + 4 (second ring) = 7.\n\n   But wait, the formula for m=2 was giving n=3, but now we have 7.\n\n   What went wrong?\n\n   Let me break down the process for k=2 and two expansions (so two layers):\n\n        Step0: 1 node (center).\n        Step1: add 2 nodes (children of center) -> total 3 nodes.\n        Step2: Now, the two leaves (each has degree 1) must be expanded. Each leaf is connected to 2 new nodes. So we add 2*2=4 nodes -> total 3+4=7.\n\n   So the total number of nodes for k=2 and two layers is 7.\n\n   Then the formula should be:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2   (for two expansions: the center, the first ring, and the second ring)\n\n   But wait, the expansion step (Rule2) is done once, so we have two rings: the first ring (from Rule1) and the second ring (from Rule2). Then the total is 1 (center) + k (first ring) + k^2 (second ring) = 1+k+k^2.\n\n   So for k=2, n=1+2+4=7.\n\n   Then why did we get 3 for m=2? \n\n   Let me define m as the number of expansions (including the initial expansion). Then:\n\n        Expansion 0 (initial): we have the center -> 1 node.\n        Expansion 1: add k nodes -> total 1+k.\n        Expansion 2: add k^2 nodes -> total 1+k+k^2.\n\n   Then the number of layers is the number of expansions (so m=2 means two expansions: the initial and one expansion). But note: the problem says the expansion step (Rule2) must be done at least once. The initial expansion (Rule1) is the first expansion, and then we do Rule2 at least once (so at least one more expansion). Therefore, the minimal number of expansions is 2 (so m=2) and the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n   Then the equation is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(t-1)\n\n   where t (the number of expansions) is at least 2.\n\n   Then the total is (k^t - 1)/(k-1) for t>=2.\n\n   Now, for k=2 and t=2: n = (2^2 - 1)/(2-1) = 3/1 = 3 -> but we just computed 7.\n\n   Wait, the formula (k^t - 1)/(k-1) is the sum from exponent 0 to t-1. For t=2: exponents 0 and 1: 1 + k. That is 1+2=3.\n\n   But our process for two expansions (t=2) gave 1+k+k^2 = 7.\n\n   There's a discrepancy: the formula (k^t-1)/(k-1) for t=2 is 3, but we have 7.\n\n   Why? Because the process does not use the same exponentiation base as the geometric series we are thinking? \n\n   Let me recount:\n\n        t=0: 1 node (k^0)\n        t=1: add k nodes (k^1)\n        t=2: add k^2 nodes (k^2)\n\n   Then the total is k^0 + k^1 + k^2.\n\n   The geometric series for exponents 0 to 2 (three terms) is (k^3-1)/(k-1). \n\n   So if we let t be the number of expansions (so including the initial expansion as the first expansion) then we have:\n\n        Number of expansions: t (>=1, but the problem says the expansion step (Rule2) must be done at least once, so total expansions t>=2)\n\n        Total nodes = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)   [but wait, with exponents from 0 to t-1: that's t terms]\n\n   Actually, the process:\n\n        Start with 1 node (expansion count 0? or expansion count 1?).\n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let r be the number of expansion rounds (Rule2 is done r times, and Rule1 is done once). Then the total expansions (steps) is r+1 (initial expansion plus r Rule2 expansions).\n\n        Then the total nodes = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r.\n\n        This is a geometric series with r+1 terms (from exponent 0 to exponent r).\n\n        Then: n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   And the problem requires at least one Rule2 expansion (r>=1), so the minimal expansion rounds is 1, then the minimal total expansions is 2 (initial expansion and one Rule2) and then n_min = (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1.\n\n   But wait, for k=2 and one Rule2 expansion (r=1): n = (2^2-1)/(2-1)=3. But we thought the process for k=2 and one Rule2 expansion gives 1 (initial) + 2 (Rule1) + 4 (Rule2) = 7.\n\n   Now I see the confusion: the formula (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) is for the entire snowflake including all layers. But note: the initial expansion (Rule1) is the first expansion, and then Rule2 is done once (so two expansions: the first expansion and the second expansion). Then the layers are:\n\n        Layer0 (exponent0): 1\n        Layer1 (exponent1): k\n        Layer2 (exponent2): k^2\n\n   So the total expansions (rounds) is 2 (initial expansion and one Rule2 expansion) and the number of layers is 3 (0-indexed up to layer2). Then the formula should be:\n\n        n = (k^3 - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   But wait, we have three layers: 1 + k + k^2, which is (k^3-1)/(k-1) only if we consider the series from exponent0 to exponent2 (which is three terms) and that is indeed (k^3-1)/(k-1). \n\n   So the issue: we defined r as the number of Rule2 expansions, then the total expansions (including Rule1) is r+1, and the number of layers is (r+1)+1? \n\n   Actually, let me define:\n\n        Let m = total expansions (including the initial expansion and the Rule2 expansions). Then the total layers (including the center) is m (because we start with 1 and then add m layers?).\n\n   Alternatively, let m be the total number of expansions (each expansion adds a layer). Then the center is the 0-th expansion? No, the center is the base. Then:\n\n        After 0 expansions: 1 node.\n        After 1 expansion (Rule1): 1 + k\n        After 2 expansions (Rule1 and one Rule2): 1 + k + k^2\n\n   So the number of expansions (steps) is the number of layers minus one.\n\n   Then the total nodes = (k^(number_of_expansions+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   But wait, for 0 expansions: (k^1-1)/(k-1) = 1 -> correct.\n           1 expansion: (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1 -> correct (1+k).\n           2 expansions: (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1+k+k^2 -> correct.\n\n   Then the problem states that the expansion step (Rule2) must be done at least once. The initial expansion (Rule1) is one expansion. Then we must have at least one Rule2 expansion (so total expansions >= 2). Then:\n\n        n = (k^(m) - 1) / (k-1)   for m>=2.\n\n   So for m=2: n = (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1.\n        Example: k=2 -> n=3; k=3 -> n=4; k=4 -> n=5; etc.\n\n   Now, check the example outputs:\n\n        n=1 -> NO (correct, because minimal n for k>=2 and m>=2 is 3)\n        n=2 -> NO (correct)\n        n=3 -> YES (by k=2, m=2) but the example output is \"NO\" for n=3.\n\n   This is still a contradiction.\n\n   Let me read the problem statement again carefully:\n\n        \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n\n        \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n   The key is: the initial expansion is part of the process, and then the expansion step (Rule2) must be done at least once. \n\n   In the minimal case (only one Rule2 expansion) we have:\n\n        Step0: center node (1 node).\n        Step1: add k nodes (now 1+k nodes). Then we have k leaves.\n        Step2: for each leaf, add k new nodes (now 1+k+k*k nodes).\n\n   So the minimal snowflake must have 1+k+k*k nodes.\n\n   Then the formula is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2   (for one Rule2 expansion, i.e., two expansions total: the initial and one Rule2)\n\n   But wait, the problem says the expansion step (Rule2) must be done at least once. The initial expansion (Rule1) is not Rule2. So Rule2 is done at least once. Therefore, the minimal expansion is:\n\n        Start: 1 node.\n        Rule1: add k nodes (now 1+k nodes). Then we have leaves (k leaves).\n        Rule2: expand each leaf by adding k new nodes (now 1+k+k^2 nodes).\n\n   So the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n   Then the equation is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2   (for one Rule2 expansion)\n\n        or\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m   for m>=2 (here m is the number of Rule2 expansions, so the total expansions is m+1, and the total layers is m+2)\n\n   But note: the problem does not fix the number of Rule2 expansions, so we can have any m>=1 (Rule2 expansions) and then the total nodes is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m+1)   [because the initial expansion is the first expansion (k^1) and then m Rule2 expansions (k^2, k^3, ...)]\n\n   Alternatively, let m be the total number of expansions (including the initial Rule1). Then the total nodes is:\n\n        n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)   for m>=2.\n\n   But wait, if m=2: then n = (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1.\n\n   And if m=3: then n = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1+k+k^2.\n\n   So we have two representations:\n\n        If we let the total expansions (including Rule1) be m, then the minimal m is 2 (Rule1 and one Rule2) and then n_min = k+1 for m=2, but that is not matching the actual minimal snowflake (which requires at least 1+k+k^2).\n\n   What's the confusion? \n\n   Let me define the number of layers:\n\n        Layer0: center (1 node) -> expansion count 0.\n        Layer1: k nodes (from Rule1) -> expansion count 1.\n        Layer2: k^2 nodes (from Rule2) -> expansion count 2.\n\n   Then the total nodes is the sum of layers from 0 to L (inclusive). The number of expansions (steps) is L (because we did L expansions). \n\n   The problem says: the expansion step (Rule2) must be done at least once. The first expansion (Rule1) is the first step. Then Rule2 is done at least once (so at least one more step). Therefore, the minimal number of expansions (steps) is 2 (so two layers: layer0 and layer1 from Rule1, and then layer2 from Rule2). Then the total nodes is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n   But note: the formula (k^m-1)/(k-1) for m=3 (three layers) is 1+k+k^2.\n\n   Alternatively, if we let m be the number of layers (from 0 to m-1), then the total nodes is (k^m - 1)/(k-1). Then the minimal m is 3 (layers0,1,2) -> m>=3.\n\n   Then the minimal n is for m=3: (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1+k+k^2.\n\n   Then the equation is: n = (k^m-1)/(k-1) for some integer k>1 and integer m>=3.\n\n   Now, check the examples:\n\n        Example: n=13 -> YES.\n\n        Let's try: \n            k=2: \n                m=3: (2^3-1)/1 = 7\n                m=4: (2^4-1)/1 = 15 -> too big.\n            k=3:\n                m=3: (3^3-1)/2 = (27-1)/2 = 13 -> matches.\n\n        So n=13 is YES.\n\n        Example: n=15 -> YES.\n            k=2: m=4: (16-1)/1=15 -> YES.\n\n        Example: n=255 -> YES.\n            k=2: m=8: (2^8-1)=255, then (255)/(2-1)=255 -> so k=2, m=8.\n\n        Example: n=10101 -> YES.\n\n        Example: n=1000000000000000000 -> NO.\n\n   Now, what about n=3? \n        We need to find k>1 and m>=3 such that (k^m-1)/(k-1) = 3.\n\n        For m=3: (k^3-1)/(k-1)=k^2+k+1=3 -> then k^2+k-2=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(1+8))/2 -> k=(-1+3)/2=1 (not >1) or k=(-1-3)/2=-2 (invalid).\n\n        For m=4: (k^4-1)/(k-1)=k^3+k^2+k+1=3 -> k^3+k^2+k-2=0. For k=1: 1+1+1-2=1 (not zero) and k=2: 8+4+2-2=12 (too big). No solution.\n\n        So n=3 is NO.\n\n   Similarly, n=1 and n=2 are obviously NO.\n\n   Also, n=6: \n        We need (k^m-1)/(k-1)=6, with m>=3 and k>1.\n\n        Try m=3: k^2+k+1=6 -> k^2+k-5=0 -> k=(-1±sqrt(21))/2 -> not integer.\n        m=4: k^3+k^2+k+1=6 -> k^3+k^2+k-5=0. k=1: 1+1+1-5=-2. k=2: 8+4+2-5=9 -> too big. No solution.\n\n        So n=6 is NO.\n\n   Now, we have:\n\n        n=13: k=3, m=3 -> YES.\n        n=15: k=2, m=4 -> YES.\n        n=255: k=2, m=8 -> YES.\n        n=10101: we need to check.\n\n   How to check n=10101?\n\n        We need to find k>1 and m>=3 such that (k^m-1)/(k-1)=10101.\n\n        We can try small m (starting from m=3) and then solve for k.\n\n        For fixed m, we have:\n\n            k^m = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        But note: (k^m - 1) = (k-1)*10101.\n\n        We can also iterate m from 3 to floor(log2(10101)) (which is about log2(10000) ~ 14) and then solve for k.\n\n        Alternatively, for a fixed m, we can try to find an integer k>1 such that:\n\n            k^m = 10101*(k-1)+1\n\n        Rearranged: k^m - 10101*k + 10100 = 0.\n\n        But note: k^m = n*(k-1)+1 = 10101*(k-1)+1.\n\n        We can try k from 2 upward until k^m <= 10101*(k-1)+1, but m can be up to about 50 (since 2^50 is around 1e15, which is bigger than 10101). But note: n=10101 is fixed, and k must be at least 2.\n\n        Alternatively, note that k^m is approximately 10101*(k-1)+1, so k is roughly around the root of 10101*(k-1)+1.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n            For m from 3 to 50 (or until k^m > 10101*(k-1)+1 for k=2, then break early for larger m?).\n\n        But t can be up to 10000, and we cannot iterate m from 3 to 50 for each test case (that would be 48 * 10000 = 480000 iterations, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be cautious). However, note that n can be up to 10^18, so m can be up to about 60 (because 2^60 is around 1e18). But we cannot iterate m from 3 to 60 for each test case (60 * 10000 = 600000, which is acceptable in Python if done carefully).\n\n        However, there is a better way: for a given n, we can consider that the number of layers m (>=3) and base k must satisfy:\n\n            k^m = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        We can iterate on m (the exponent) from 3 to floor(log2(n))+1 (because k>=2,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a single vertex (the center). Each subsequent layer is formed by connecting each vertex in the previous layer to \\( k \\) new vertices, where \\( k > 1 \\). The expansion step must be performed at least once after the initial expansion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the total number of vertices in a snowflake graph with \\( m \\) layers (including the center) is given by the geometric series sum \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^{m-1} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{k^m - 1}{k-1} \\). Here, \\( k \\) must be an integer greater than 1, and \\( m \\) (the number of layers) must be at least 3 (since the initial expansion is one layer, and at least one more expansion is required).\n\n2. **Insight**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists integers \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 3 \\) such that \\( \\frac{k^m - 1}{k-1} = n \\). This can be rewritten as \\( k^m = n(k-1) + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18} \\) and \\( t \\leq 10^4 \\), we need an efficient way to check for each test case. The approach involves:\n   - Iterating over possible values of \\( m \\) (number of layers) starting from 3 up to a maximum where \\( k^m \\) could potentially equal \\( n(k-1) + 1 \\).\n   - For each \\( m \\), solve for \\( k \\) by checking if \\( n(k-1) + 1 \\) is a perfect \\( m \\)-th power. If \\( k \\) is an integer greater than 1, then \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph.\n\n4. **Optimization**: To handle large \\( n \\) efficiently, we limit the range of \\( m \\) by noting that \\( k \\) must be at least 2, so \\( m \\) can be at most \\( \\log_2(n) \\). This ensures the solution is feasible even for very large \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_power(x, m):\n    lower = 2\n    upper = x\n    while lower <= upper:\n        mid = (lower + upper) // 2\n        power = mid ** m\n        if power == x:\n            return True\n        elif power < x:\n            lower = mid + 1\n        else:\n            upper = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        \n        if n <= 2:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        max_m = 0\n        if n >= 2:\n            max_m = math.floor(math.log(n, 2)) + 2\n        else:\n            max_m = 3\n            \n        for m in range(3, max_m + 1):\n            target = n * (m - 1) + 1\n            root = round(target ** (1/m))\n            if root < 2:\n                break\n                \n            if is_perfect_power(target, m):\n                found = True\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **is_perfect_power Function**: This helper function checks if a number \\( x \\) is a perfect \\( m \\)-th power by performing binary search between 2 and \\( x \\) to find an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( k^m = x \\).\n\n2. **Main Function**: \n   - **Reading Input**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n   - **Handling Small \\( n \\)**: If \\( n \\) is 1 or 2, it immediately outputs \"NO\" since no valid snowflake graph can be formed.\n   - **Iterating Over Possible Layers**: For each test case, the code checks all possible numbers of layers \\( m \\) from 3 up to a calculated maximum based on logarithmic bounds.\n   - **Checking Valid \\( k \\)**: For each \\( m \\), it checks if \\( n(k-1) + 1 \\) is a perfect \\( m \\)-th power.
