He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (Roman numeral system) or both integers.\n The next line is a string representing the number c in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the given base a number to an integer (in base 10), then convert that integer to a Roman numeral string.\n    However, note the input says: the next line is a non-negative integer c in base a (which may contain leading zeros, but length <= 1000). \n    And if Roman numerals are included, the number (in base 10) would be <= 300010 and not 0.\n\n 2. If b is an integer, then we have to convert from base a to base b. But note: the input number c is given in base a as a string (with possible leading zeros) and the base a and b are between 2 and 25 (inclusive). Also, if b is an integer, then we must output the number in base b (without leading zeros).\n\n 3. There's a catch: if the base a is greater than 10, then the digits in the input string can be letters (from '0' to ...). But note the example: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base12 digit 'A' is 10.\n\n Important: The input number c is given in base a and may contain digits beyond '9'. For bases above 10, we use letters as digits. However, the problem states that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\n\n How to handle:\n\n Case 1: b is an integer (so we have two integers a and b)\n   Step 1: Convert the string (base a representation) to an integer in base 10.\n        We can do: \n          num = 0\n          for each char in the string:\n            d = int(char) if char is digit and the value is less than a? But wait, the string might have letters for bases >10.\n\n        Actually, the string can have digits and letters. We can map each character to a value:\n          If the character is between '0' and '9', then value = int(char)\n          Else, value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        But note: the base a might be as low as 2 and as high as 25. So if we see a letter, then its value must be at least 10 and less than a (because base a is at most 25, so maximum digit is 24). Also, the input is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n        Then, we can convert the base a string to a base 10 integer.\n\n   Step 2: Now convert the base10 integer to base b (if b is an integer). But note: the base b can be from 2 to 25 (or if b was replaced by R then it's Roman, but here b is integer). We must output without leading zeros.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the input number is non-negative and may be 0. But if the input is 0, then we output \"0\" (unless the base is R, but then we wouldn't have 0 because the guarantee says if Roman then the number is not 0). \n\n        Steps for converting base10 to base b (integer):\n          If the number is 0, then output \"0\".\n          Otherwise, repeatedly divide the number by b and record the remainders.\n\n        But note: the base b might be greater than 10, then we use letters.\n\n Case 2: b is 'R'\n   Step 1: Convert the base a string to base10 integer (same as above).\n   Step 2: Convert that base10 integer to a Roman numeral string.\n\n Implementation details for Roman numerations (from 1 to 300010, which is up to 300010, but note the problem says the number is <= 300010 and not 0).\n\n   We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n   Standard Roman numerals: \n     M: 1000, CM: 900, D: 500, CD: 400, C: 100, XC: 90, L: 50, XL: 40, X: 10, IX: 9, V: 5, IV: 4, I: 1.\n\n   We can use a list of tuples: [ (1000, \"M\"), (900,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of converting to the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main cases: converting between two integer bases or converting from an integer base to the Roman numeral system.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input String to Base 10 Integer**:\n   - The input number is given as a string in base `a`. Each character in the string is converted to its corresponding numerical value. For digits '0'-'9', the value is the integer value of the character. For letters 'A'-'Z', the value is `ord(char) - ord('A') + 10`.\n   - The string is processed from left to right, accumulating the total value by multiplying the current total by the base `a` and adding the current digit's value.\n\n2. **Convert Base 10 Integer to Target Base**:\n   - If the target base `b` is an integer (not 'R'), repeatedly divide the base 10 number by `b`, recording the remainders. These remainders are converted back to their respective characters (digits or letters) and concatenated in reverse order to form the result string.\n   - Special handling is done for the case when the input number is zero, which directly outputs \"0\".\n\n3. **Convert Base 10 Integer to Roman Numerals**:\n   - If the target base `b` is 'R', the base 10 number is converted to a Roman numeral using predefined rules for thousands, hundreds, tens, and units. The conversion involves mapping the number to the largest possible Roman numeral symbols and appending the remaining value until the entire number is represented.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n    \n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except ValueError:\n        a = None\n        \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        b = 'R'\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(b_str)\n        except ValueError:\n            b = None\n            \n    def convert_base_a_to_int(s, base):\n        total = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                d = int(char)\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            if d >= base:\n                return None\n            total = total * base + d\n        return total\n\n    num_base10 = convert_base_a_to_int(num_str, a)\n    if num_base10 is None:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        if num_base10 == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, \"M\"),\n            (900, \"CM\"),\n            (500, \"D\"),\n            (400, \"CD\"),\n            (100, \"C\"),\n            (90, \"XC\"),\n            (50, \"L\"),\n            (40, \"XL\"),\n            (10, \"X\"),\n            (9, \"IX\"),\n            (5, \"V\"),\n            (4, \"IV\"),\n            (1, \"I\")\n        ]\n        res = []\n        for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n            while num_base10 >= value:\n                res.append(symbol)\n                num_base10 -= value\n        roman_str = ''.join(res)\n        print(roman_str)\n    else:\n        if num_base10 == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        digits = []\n        n = num_base10\n        base_val = b\n        \n        while n:\n            remainder = n % base_val\n            digits.append(remainder)\n            n //= base_val\n            \n        if not digits:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        res = []\n        for digit in digits[::-1]:\n            if digit < 10:\n                res.append(str(digit))\n            else:\n                res.append(chr(ord('A') + digit - 10))\n                \n        print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line specifies the source base `a` and the target base `b` (which can be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line is the number in base `a` as a string.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input string is converted to a base 10 integer. Each character is processed to determine its numerical value, considering both digits and letters (for bases greater than 10).\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**:\n   - **Integer Base**: The base 10 number is divided by the target base repeatedly, with remainders converted to their respective characters (digits or letters). The remainders are collected in reverse order to form the result string.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: The base 10 number is decomposed into the largest possible Roman numeral components (like M for 1000, CM for 900, etc.), appending each component to the result string until the entire number is represented.\n4. **Edge Handling**: Special cases include handling leading zeros (output omitted) and the number zero (outputs \"0\" unless converting to Roman numerals, which excludes zero per problem constraints).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all specified cases, ensuring correct conversions between bases and from base 10 to Roman numerals.",
