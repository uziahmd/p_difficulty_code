His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two numbers n and x in the first line.\n Then two lists: one for the first tour (list a) and one for the second tour (list b).\n\n We know that Vasya's total points (from both tours) is at least x. However, we don't know which participant is Vasya, but we know that there are two integers i, j such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n The problem: we have to find the best and worst place Vasya could have got.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are going to consider all participants. Each participant has two scores: one from the first tour and one from the second tour. But note: the input gives two separate lists of n integers each.\n\n 2. We can form an array `c` of the total for each participant if we assume that the pairing is arbitrary? Actually, we are told that the results have only points and no names. So we have two sets of scores, and we can assign any a_i with any b_j? However, note: the problem states that \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", meaning that the same participant appears in both lists? Actually, no: the problem says \"the results have only points, no names\". So we have two lists: one for the first tour and one for the second tour, and each list has n integers. There are n participants, and each participant has one score from the first tour and one from the second tour, but we don't know which one is which. Therefore, we can form a multiset of pairs (a_i, b_j) for i,j in [0, n-1] but wait, actually the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad\", meaning that the pairing is fixed? Or is it that we are allowed to assign arbitrarily?\n\n Let me clarify: the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour (two lists of n integers). But the problem is, the results have only points, no names. So we don't know which participant's first tour score corresponds to which second tour score. Therefore, we can reassign arbitrarily the second tour scores to the first tour scores? Actually, no: the problem does not specify that the same participant must appear in both lists. However, the note says: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such that ai + bj ≥ x\". This means that we are allowed to consider any pairing? Actually, the problem says: \"Vasya was present\" so we know that there exists at least one way to assign the second tour scores to the participants (including Vasya) such that Vasya's total is at least x.\n\n But note: the entire table is built from the two lists. We are allowed to assign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the first tour participants? Actually, no: because the problem says \"the results have only points, no names\", meaning that the two lists are given independently. And the condition for the Olympiad is that each participant has one score from the first tour and one from the second tour. So we have two lists: first tour and second tour, and we need to form n pairs (one for each participant). However, the problem does not require that the same participant's two scores must come from the same index? \n\n But note: the example input: \n   \"5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1\"\n Here, every participant gets 1 in the first tour and 1 in the second tour, so regardless of assignment, everyone has 2.\n\n However, the second example:\n   \"6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4\"\n\n In the best case, Vasya gets 4 from the first tour and 8 from the second, so total 12. In the worst case, he gets 4 from the first and 3 from the second, total 7.\n\n How do we solve?\n\n Observation: We have two lists, say A (first tour) and B (second tour). We can assign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the first tour participants. So we are allowed to form a list of pairs (a, b) by matching the two arrays arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the assignment is a bijection? Actually, since there are exactly n participants and two lists of n integers, we must assign each element of A to one element of B (and vice versa). So we are forming a permutation of B to assign to A.\n\n Now, the goal is to find the best and worst place Vasya could get.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are allowed to choose which two numbers (one from A and one from B) belong to Vasya, as long as their sum is at least x. But note: the entire assignment must be a bijection. However, when considering the best and worst place for Vasya, we can consider the entire set of participants.\n\n But note: we are not forced to use the same assignment for all participants. We are allowed to consider any assignment (bijection) and then see what Vasya's total is and then his rank.\n\n However, the problem asks: \"find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won\".\n\n Approach:\n\n We can consider two scenarios:\n\n Best place: We want to minimize Vasya's rank. To do that, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he is as high as possible) and also arrange the other participants to be as low as possible.\n\n But note: the assignment is fixed for the entire set. Actually, we are allowed to choose the assignment arbitrarily (bijection) and then we can compute Vasya's total (if we assign the best possible to him) and then the rest of the participants' totals (which we can arrange arbitrarily as well, but note: we cannot change the multiset of A and B). \n\n However, the catch: the assignment must be a bijection. So we are going to assign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the first tour scores.\n\n Steps for best place:\n\n - We can choose a pair (a, b) for Vasya such that a+b>=x and then assign the remaining a's and b's arbitrarily to the other participants.\n\n - But note: the entire table is built from the n pairs. The ranking is by the sum of the two tours.\n\n How to compute the best place?\n\n Idea:\n\n We can try to assign the largest remaining b's to the smallest a's (to minimize the competition) to push Vasya to the top. Alternatively, to get the best place for Vasya, we want to make his total as high as possible and then minimize the number of participants with a total strictly greater than Vasya's.\n\n However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So:\n\n Step 1: Consider that we assign to Vasya the maximum total we can? Actually, no: sometimes we might want to give Vasya a slightly lower total if it helps him beat more people? Actually, no: we want to maximize his rank, so we want his total to be as high as possible.\n\n But note: we are constrained by the available numbers. We can choose one a for Vasya and one b for Vasya, and then the rest must be assigned without repetition.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n 1. Form a list of all participants: we have n participants, but initially we don't know their two scores. We have two multisets: A and B.\n\n 2. We are going to assign the two multisets arbitrarily. The condition for Vasya is that there must be at least one pair (a, b) such that a+b>=x.\n\n 3. For the best place: we want to maximize the number of participants that have a total less than or equal to Vasya's total, but we can assign the scores arbitrarily.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n  - Sort the first list A and the second list B.\n\n  - We can try to assign the highest available scores to Vasya and then assign the remaining scores optimally to minimize the number of participants above Vasya.\n\n However, let's break down:\n\n We can fix Vasya's total to be T (at least x). Then, we want to minimize the number of participants with total > T.\n\n How many participants can have total > T? We can use the remaining numbers (A without the chosen a and B without the chosen b) to form n-1 pairs.\n\n But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can form the n-1 pairs arbitrarily from the remaining numbers.\n\n To minimize the number of participants above Vasya (with total > T), we would try to assign the remaining numbers in a way that minimizes the number of pairs with sum > T.\n\n Similarly, for the worst place, we want to maximize the number of participants with total > Vasya's total (but Vasya's total is at least x, and we are allowed to choose the minimal total that is >= x).\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following known approach (from similar problems):\n\n 1. Sort both arrays A and B.\n\n 2. Precompute the total sum array for all pairs? That would be O(n^2) which is too slow (n up to 10^5).\n\n Instead, we can use the following:\n\n For the best place:\n\n  - We want to maximize Vasya's total. Then, we want to minimize the number of participants that have a total greater than Vasya's.\n\n  - How to maximize Vasya's total? Take the maximum from A and the maximum from B? But wait: maybe the maximum from A and maximum from B is the best, but we are constrained by the fact that we cannot use the same element twice.\n\n  - However, we are allowed to choose any two numbers from A and B (as long as they are distinct). So the maximum total is max_A + max_B.\n\n  - But note: we are allowed to choose any pair. Then, we remove these two numbers and then we have to assign the rest. Then, the number of participants with total greater than (max_A+max_B) is zero? Actually, no: because the maximum total we can form is max_A+max_B, so no one can exceed that. Then, how many participants can have the same total? \n\n  However, wait: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So if we assign the best two to Vasya, then the rest of the participants will have pairs from the remaining numbers.\n\n  But note: the problem says the total results' table sorts by sum. If two participants have the same sum, the jury can assign arbitrarily. So for best place, we can hope that Vasya is the first even if there are others with the same total? Actually, the problem says: \"the best and the worst place\". The best place is 1, even if there are others with the same total? Actually, no: the best place is the highest rank (lowest place number). In case of ties, the jury can assign the places arbitrarily, so Vasya might be pushed down arbitrarily.\n\n  But wait, the problem says: \"the best and the worst place\" meaning the minimal and maximal rank (place number) that Vasya can achieve.\n\n  How to compute the best place?\n\n  We can consider:\n\n  Let T = (a_i + b_j) for Vasya, and we choose T to be as large as possible (to minimize competition). Then, we want to minimize the number of participants with total > T. Since T is the maximum, no one has total > T. Then, we can arrange the others arbitrarily. However, there might be others with total equal to T. Then, the jury can decide the ordering. The best scenario is that Vasya is placed first, even if there are others with the same total. Because the problem says: \"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice.\" So the jury can put Vasya first.\n\n  Therefore, the best place is always 1? Not necessarily: because maybe Vasya's total is not the maximum? Actually, we are allowed to choose the assignment arbitrarily, so we can choose the assignment that maximizes Vasya's total. Then, we can arrange the rest arbitrarily.\n\n  However, what if there are multiple ways to assign and Vasya's total is fixed? Actually, we are allowed to choose the assignment for the entire set arbitrarily (bijection). So we can choose:\n\n    - Assign the highest available score in A and the highest available score in B to Vasya (if we wish to maximize his total). Then, the rest of the participants are assigned arbitrarily.\n\n  Then, the best place is 1, because we can set Vasya's total to be the maximum and then the jury can assign him first.\n\n  But wait: what if there are two participants with the same maximum total? Then the jury can assign arbitrarily, so Vasya can still be first.\n\n  However, let's read the problem statement: the total results' table sorts by the sum. The first place is the highest. If two have the same, then the jury decides. So if Vasya is one of the ones with the maximum total, then we can assign him first.\n\n  Therefore, the best place is always 1.\n\n  But wait, consider the example: \n      Input: \"5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1\"\n      Output: \"1 5\"\n\n  So the best place is 1 and the worst is 5.\n\n  However, the above reasoning would say best place is 1, but worst place is n (5). \n\n  But wait, the example output is \"1 5\", so our reasoning for the best place holds.\n\n  However, let me check the second example:\n\n      Input: \"6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4\"\n      Output: \"1 5\"\n\n  So the best place is 1.\n\n  But wait, what if we cannot assign the maximum two numbers to Vasya? Actually, we are guaranteed that Vasya is present, so there is at least one pair (a,b) such that a+b>=x. But we are allowed to choose any assignment. So we can assign the maximum two to Vasya if that maximum two sum is at least x? Or wait, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose the assignment that gives Vasya the maximum total (if we want) and then assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n  However, note: the problem does not specify that we must use the same assignment for all participants. Actually, the assignment is a bijection. So we are allowed to assign the two largest numbers to Vasya only if we don't use them for other participants? Actually, yes: we are allowed to choose which two numbers (one from A and one from B) go to Vasya, and then the rest are assigned arbitrarily.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\", meaning two lists of n integers. Then, the entire set of participants is defined by the two lists. And Vasya is one of the participants, so we know that there is a participant that has one score from the first list and one from the second. However, we don't know which. But we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can assign the two largest numbers (from the two lists) to Vasya, provided that the two largest numbers are from two different participants? Actually, no: the two largest numbers might be in the same list.\n\n  Actually, we have two lists. The total set of scores is the multiset A ∪ B. But the assignment is: we match each element of A with an element of B. Then, the total for a participant is the sum of one element from A and one element from B.\n\n  So to maximize Vasya's total, we should take the maximum value from A and the maximum value from B? But note: the same element might appear multiple times, but we cannot use the same element twice.\n\n  Example: \n      A = [10, 20, 30], B = [1, 2, 30]\n      Then the maximum total is 30+30=60? But wait, if we assign 30 from A and 30 from B, that's allowed. However, note: the two lists are independent. But the problem says: each participant has one score from the first tour and one from the second. So the same score (value) might appear in both lists, and that's okay.\n\n  Therefore, we can take the maximum of A and the maximum of B, and that gives the maximum total.\n\n  However, what if the maximum of A and the maximum of B are from the same participant? Actually, no: because the participant is defined by the two lists. The assignment is: we assign each a_i to a distinct b_j. So we can assign the maximum a and the maximum b to the same participant (if they are distinct) or if the same participant has two maximums? Actually, no: because the participant's two scores are one from A and one from B, and the assignment is a bijection.\n\n  Therefore, we can assign the maximum a and the maximum b to Vasya, and then we have n-1 participants left.\n\n  Then, the best place is 1.\n\n  But wait, what if there are multiple participants that can get the maximum total? Then we can still assign Vasya first.\n\n  Now, the worst place:\n\n  We want to maximize the rank of Vasya (i.e., the worst place). To do that, we want to minimize Vasya's total (but still at least x) and then maximize the number of participants with total greater than Vasya's total.\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to choose the assignment arbitrarily. So we can choose an assignment that gives Vasya the minimum total that is >= x, and then assign the rest of the scores to maximize the number of participants with total greater than Vasya's.\n\n  Steps for worst place:\n\n  1. We need to choose a pair (a, b) for Vasya such that a+b>=x, and among these, we choose the one that minimizes the total (so that his total is as low as possible, making him vulnerable to being beaten by many).\n\n  2. Then, we want to assign the remaining scores to the other participants in such a way that as many as possible have a total greater than Vasya's chosen total.\n\n  However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose the worst total for Vasya (minimal T0 >= x) and then assign the rest to maximize the count of participants with total > T0.\n\n  How to do step 2?\n\n  We have two multisets A' = A without a, and B' = B without b. Then, we can form n-1 pairs from A' and B'. We want to count the maximum number of pairs that have sum > T0.\n\n  Alternatively, we can think: we want to maximize the number of participants with total > T0, so we would assign the highest remaining scores to the other participants to get as many high totals as possible.\n\n  But note: we are constrained by the multiset of remaining numbers.\n\n  Algorithm for worst place:\n\n  Step 1: Find the minimal total T0 >= x that Vasya can have. However, note: we are allowed to choose any assignment, so we can choose any pair (a, b) such that a+b>=x. We want to minimize T0 (to make it as low as possible) so that we can have more participants above him.\n\n  But wait: is minimizing T0 always the best for the worst place? Yes, because a lower total makes it easier for others to have a higher total.\n\n  However, there might be multiple pairs (a, b) that sum to the same minimal T0, and we can choose the one that leaves the best multiset for the other participants (i.e., the one that minimizes the damage to Vasya? Actually, no: we want to maximize the number of participants above him, so we want to leave the largest numbers for the others.\n\n  Actually, the minimal T0 might not be unique. But we are free to choose the pair that minimizes T0, and then we can choose the assignment for the rest arbitrarily.\n\n  However, we must consider: the minimal T0 might be achieved by several pairs, and we want to choose the one that leaves the remaining set with the maximum potential for having many participants with total > T0.\n\n  But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily the rest. So the maximum number of participants with total > T0 is fixed by the remaining multiset and T0.\n\n  So we can:\n\n  - Let T_min = minimal T0 (>=x) that can be achieved by any pair (a, b) from A and B.\n\n  But wait: we don't necessarily have to use the minimal T0. We can use any T0>=x. However, using a higher T0 might result in fewer participants above him? Actually, no: we want the worst place, so we want to be beaten by as many as possible. Therefore, we choose the minimal T0 (so that we are as low as possible) and then we maximize the number of participants above us.\n\n  However, there's a catch: what if we cannot achieve the minimal T0 by leaving enough high numbers for the rest? Actually, no: the minimal T0 is just the minimum value of a+b that is >=x. Then, we can choose any pair (a, b) that gives that minimal T0. Then, we remove a and b and then we want to compute the maximum number of pairs (from the remaining) that have sum > T_min.\n\n  But note: we are not forced to use the minimal T0. We could use a higher T0, but then we might be able to have more participants above us? Actually, no: because if we use a higher T0, then the bar for being above us is higher, so we might get fewer participants above us.\n\n  Therefore, to maximize the number of participants above us, we must minimize our own total (to the minimal T_min) and then use the remaining numbers to form as many pairs as possible that are above T_min.\n\n  However, there's another consideration: the minimal T0 might not be achievable by all pairs? Actually, we are allowed to choose any bijection. But note: we are not forced to use the minimal T0 for Vasya. We are forced to have at least one pair for Vasya that is >=x, but we can choose any. However, to get the worst place, we want to minimize our own total and then maximize the number of participants above us.\n\n  Steps for worst place:\n\n  1. Find the minimal T_min (>=x) that can be formed by any pair (a, b) from A and B.\n\n  2. Then, from the entire set, remove one occurrence of a and one occurrence of b such that a+b=T_min (or at least >=x, but we choose the minimal one). But note: there might be multiple pairs (a, b) that yield T_min. We want to remove a and b that leave the rest of the multiset as strong as possible (so that we can form as many pairs above T_min as possible). Actually, we want to remove the pair that minimizes the potential for the rest to form high totals? Or maximizes? \n\n  Actually, to maximize the number of participants above Vasya, we want to leave the highest numbers for the other participants. Therefore, we should remove the smallest numbers that can form T_min (so that the remaining set has the highest numbers). Why? Because if we remove a high number, then the rest might not be able to form as many high totals.\n\n  Example: \n      Suppose we have A = [1, 2] and B = [3, 4] and x=5.\n      The minimal T_min is 5 (from 1+4 or 2+3). \n      If we remove 1 and 4, then the remaining is [2,3] -> total 5, so no one above 5? \n      If we remove 2 and 3, then the remaining is [1,4] -> total 5, same.\n\n      But wait, the minimal T_min is 5, and we are removing a pair that sums to 5. Then, the rest form a pair that also sums to 5. Then, the number of participants above Vasya is 0. But note: the problem requires that Vasya's total is at least x, and we are using the minimal one. \n\n      However, the problem does not require that the entire assignment must have distinct totals. We can have multiple participants with the same total.\n\n      But note: we are counting the number of participants with total > T_min (not >=). So in this case, no one is above.\n\n      However, what if we have more participants? Let n=3: A = [1,2,3], B=[4,5,6], x=5.\n\n      Minimal T_min: 5 (from 1+4, 2+3, etc.)\n\n      We want to remove a pair (a,b) such that a+b>=5, and we choose the minimal one (5). Then, we want to leave the remaining numbers to form as many pairs as possible with sum>5.\n\n      We have two choices for pairs that sum to 5: (1,4), (2,3)\n\n      Option1: Remove (1,4): then remaining A'=[2,3] and B'=[5,6]. We can form two pairs: (2,5)=7, (3,6)=9 -> both above 5. Then, there are 2 participants above Vasya.\n\n      Option2: Remove (2,3): then remaining A'=[1,3] and B'=[4,6]. We can form two pairs: (1,4)=5, (3,6)=9 -> one above and one equal.\n\n      But wait, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily the rest. In option1, we have two above. In option2, we have one above.\n\n      Therefore, to maximize the number of participants above Vasya, we should remove the pair that uses the smallest numbers (so that the remaining numbers are as large as possible).\n\n      So the algorithm for the worst place:\n\n        Step 1: Compute T_min, the minimal total that Vasya can have (>=x). But note: we are allowed to choose any pair (a, b) such that a+b>=x, and we choose the minimal one. However, we must also consider that we cannot use the same element twice.\n\n        Step 2: We want to remove a pair (a, b) such that a+b = T_min (or the minimal value above x) and then we want to compute the maximum number of pairs (from the remaining) that have sum > T_min.\n\n        Step 3: The worst place for Vasya is (number of participants with total > T_min) + 1. Because if there are k participants with total > T_min, then Vasya is at least k+1. But note: there might be participants with total equal to T_min. The problem: the jury can assign arbitrarily the same totals. However, the problem says: the table is sorted by total, and then the jury assigns the places arbitrarily. So if we have k participants above (with total > T_min) and m participants with total = T_min (including Vasya), then the worst place for Vasya is k + (the position among the m participants with total T_min). But wait, we can arrange the same total arbitrarily, so the worst place is k + m (because the jury could put all the above first, then Vasya last among the same).\n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify that the same total participants must be assigned consecutive places. But typically, the ranking is: \n          1st: all with the highest total (then the jury assigns arbitrarily, so we can be last in the block of same totals). Then, the next block, etc.\n\n        Therefore, the worst place is: (number of participants with total > T_min) + (number of participants with total == T_min) [including Vasya].\n\n        But wait, we have fixed that Vasya's total is T_min. Then, the number of participants with total == T_min is: \n            count = (number of pairs (a_i, b_j) in the entire set that sum to T_min) minus (the one we removed for Vasya) plus 1 (Vasya himself)? \n\n        Actually, no: we removed one occurrence of T_min. But note: there might be multiple pairs (a, b) that sum to T_min. However, we are forming a bijection. The entire set of pairs is fixed: we are going to assign the entire set. But we are allowed to choose which pair goes to Vasya.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think:\n\n          Let M = T_min (the minimal total for Vasya).\n\n          Then, the entire set of n pairs (including Vasya) must be assigned. We are free to choose which pair is assigned to Vasya (as long as it is >=x, and we choose the minimal one to minimize his total). Then, the rest are assigned arbitrarily.\n\n          But note: the same total M might appear multiple times in the entire set (without Vasya). Actually, we removed one occurrence of M (the pair we assigned to Vasya). Then, the total number of pairs (in the entire set) that have total >= M is fixed? \n\n        Actually, we can compute:\n\n          Let F(t) = the maximum number of pairs (from the entire set) that have sum >= t.\n\n        But wait, we are trying to compute the worst place.\n\n        Alternative approach for worst place:\n\n          We want to compute the maximum number of participants that can have a total strictly greater than Vasya's total (which is at least x). Then, the worst place is (that maximum number) + 1 (because Vasya is after them). But note: we can choose Vasya's total arbitrarily (as long as it is at least x) and we choose the minimal one. Then, we can assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n          However, we cannot arbitrarily assign the rest: we have fixed multiset of A and B. We remove the pair (a, b) that forms Vasya's total (minimal one). Then, from the remaining, we can form n-1 pairs arbitrarily. We want to maximize the number of pairs (from the remaining) that have total > T_min.\n\n          Then, the worst place is (max_count) + 1, where max_count is the maximum number of pairs (from the remaining) that have total > T_min.\n\n          But note: the entire set of pairs (including Vasya) is fixed by the two multisets. However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose the assignment that maximizes the number of pairs above T_min (by giving the highest remaining scores to the other participants).\n\n          How to compute max_count?\n\n          We have two multisets A' and B' (the original A and B without the chosen a and b). Then, we want to form n-1 pairs from A' and B' such that the number of pairs with sum > T_min is maximized.\n\n          This is equivalent to: we want to assign the remaining numbers to form as many pairs as possible with sum > T_min.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Sort A' and B' in descending order.\n\n            Then, use two pointers to count the maximum number of pairs with sum > T_min.\n\n          However, note: we are free to assign arbitrarily, so we can use a greedy matching.\n\n          Steps for counting the maximum number of pairs above T_min from A' and B':\n\n            We want to maximize the number of pairs (a, b) such that a+b > T_min.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              Sort A' in descending order.\n              Sort B' in descending order.\n\n            Then, traverse A' and for each a, we try to find the smallest b in B' such that a+b > T_min. But to maximize the count, we should use the smallest b that is just above T_min - a, so that the larger b's are left for the bigger a's.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use two pointers from the end of B' and traverse A' from the beginning (largest a) and try to match with the smallest b that makes the sum > T_min.\n\n          Actually, we can use a greedy matching from the largest to the smallest:\n\n            Sort A' in descending order.\n            Sort B' in descending order.\n\n            Then, we want to match the largest a with the smallest b that is > T_min - a. But to maximize the count, we should use the minimal b that satisfies a+b > T_min, so that we save the larger b's for the smaller a's.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            Count = 0\n            j = 0   # pointer for B'\n            for i in range(len(A')):\n                # We want the smallest b in B' such that b > T_min - a, but we are traversing from largest a to smallest.\n\n          Another method: \n\n            We can use two pointers from the end of A' and B' (both descending) and try to match the largest a with the largest b that is still needed? \n\n          Actually, to maximize the number of pairs above T_min, we should assign the smallest b that is sufficient for a. Then, we can do:\n\n            Sort A' in descending order, and B' in ascending order? \n\n          Standard method for two-sum counting: \n\n            We want to know: how many pairs (a, b) in A' x B' satisfy a+b > T_min.\n\n          But note: we are forming a bijection. We are not counting independent pairs, but matching. We want the maximum matching (which is n-1) that satisfies as many conditions as possible.\n\n          However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose which pairs to form. The maximum number of pairs above T_min is the maximum matching of size k (for k from 0 to n-1) such that k pairs are above T_min.\n\n          This is a classic problem: given two arrays, how to form the maximum number of pairs (a, b) such that a+b > T_min.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Sort A' in ascending order.\n            Sort B' in ascending order.\n\n            Then, we can use two pointers from the end of both arrays.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a greedy matching:\n\n              We want to match the largest elements with the smallest elements that can form a pair above T_min.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n              Sort A' in ascending order.\n              Sort B' in ascending order.\n\n              Then, we can use two pointers starting from the end of B' and traverse A' from the end to the beginning.\n\n            But note: we want to maximize the count, so we want to use the smallest b that can form a pair above T_min for a large a.\n\n          Algorithm for maximum matching above T_min:\n\n            Let A_sorted = sorted(A')   # ascending\n            Let B_sorted = sorted(B')   # ascending\n\n            Then, we can do:\n\n              i = 0\n              j = len(B_sorted)-1\n              count = 0\n              # But we want to match the largest a with the smallest b that satisfies a+b > T_min.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n              We want to match the largest a with the smallest b that is > T_min - a.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              Sort A' in descending order, and B' in ascending order.\n\n              Then, for each a in A' (from largest to smallest):\n                  We need the smallest b in B' (starting from the beginning) that is > T_min - a. But wait, we want to use the smallest b that is sufficient so that we don't waste large b's.\n\n            Actually, we can use two pointers from the end of A' and the end of B'? \n\n          Let me use:\n\n            Sort A' in descending order.\n            Sort B' in descending order.\n\n            Then, we want to count the maximum pairs (a, b) such that a+b > T_min.\n\n            We can use two pointers:\n\n              i = 0   # for A'\n              j = 0   # for B'\n\n            But a standard way for two-sum count (for the condition a+b > T) is:\n\n              Sort A' and B' (both ascending).\n              Then, for the largest a, we need a large b. So we can use:\n\n                i = 0, j = n-1 for the entire set? \n\n          Actually, we can use a two-pointer method from the end:\n\n            Sort A' in ascending order.\n            Sort B' in ascending order.\n\n            Then, set two pointers at the end of both arrays.\n\n            count = 0\n            i = n-1\n            j = n-1\n            while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\n                if A'[i] + B'[j] > T_min:\n                    count += 1\n                    i -= 1\n                    j -= 1\n                else:\n                    j -= 1\n\n          But wait, that is for independent pairs, and we are allowed to use each element once. This method is for independent pairs (like in two-sum count). However, we are forming a matching (each element used once). The above method is for counting the maximum number of pairs (without regard to which a is matched with which b) that satisfy a+b > T_min. But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can form any matching.\n\n          However, the above method does not guarantee that we are not overcounting or undercounting. Actually, we can use:\n\n            We want to know: what is the maximum number of pairs (from A' and B') we can form such that the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours and the given results of all participants. The solution involves analyzing the participants' scores to find the minimal and maximal ranks Vasya can get while ensuring his total points meet or exceed the given threshold.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Input**: Two lists of integers representing scores from the first and second tours, and a minimum total points `x` that Vasya must achieve.\n   - **Output**: Two integers representing the best (lowest) and worst (highest) possible ranks Vasya can get.\n   - **Key Insight**: The best rank is always 1 because Vasya can be assigned the highest possible scores from both tours, making his total the highest, thus placing him first regardless of others.\n   - **Worst Rank Calculation**: To find the worst rank, we need to minimize Vasya's total points (to the maximum extent possible without dropping below `x`) and then count how many other participants can have higher totals. This involves:\n     - **Finding Minimal Total (`T_min`)**: The smallest sum of any pair (one score from each tour) that is at least `x`.\n     - **Counting Participants with Higher Totals**: After removing the scores used for Vasya's minimal total, count how many pairs from the remaining scores can form sums greater than `T_min`.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing and counting.\n   - **Two-Pointer Technique**: Used to count the maximum number of pairs that can exceed `T_min` from the remaining scores after Vasya's scores are removed.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: Sorting the two lists takes O(n log n) time. The two-pointer traversal is O(n), making the overall complexity O(n log n).\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the sorted lists, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Best place is always 1\n    best_place = 1\n    \n    # Find the minimal total T_min >= x\n    T_min = float('inf')\n    i, j = 0, n-1\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        s = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j]\n        if s >= x:\n            T_min = min(T_min, s)\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n            \n    if T_min == float('inf'):\n        T_min = x\n        \n    # Prepare the remaining arrays by removing one occurrence of a and one of b that sum to T_min\n    # We'll remove the smallest elements that can form T_min to leave larger elements for others\n    a_remaining = a_sorted.copy()\n    b_remaining = b_sorted.copy()\n    \n    # If we found T_min, remove one occurrence of a and one of b that sum to T_min\n    # Since we want to maximize the number of participants above T_min, remove the smallest possible a and b that still sum to T_min\n    i_ptr, j_ptr = 0, n-1\n    found = False\n    while i_ptr < n and j_ptr >= 0:\n        s = a_remaining[i_ptr] + b_remaining[j_ptr]\n        if s == T_min:\n            a_remaining.pop(i_ptr)\n            b_remaining.pop(j_ptr)\n            found = True\n            break\n        elif s > T_min:\n            j_ptr -= 1\n        else:\n            i_ptr += 1\n            \n    if not found:\n        # We didn't find T_min exactly, so use the minimal total that is >= x (which might be higher than T_min we initially thought, but actually T_min was set to x if no pair found)\n        pass\n\n    # Count the maximum number of pairs in a_remaining and b_remaining that have sum > T_min\n    a_remaining.sort(reverse=True)\n    b_remaining.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    count_above = 0\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(len(a_remaining)):\n        while j < len(b_remaining) and a_remaining[i] + b_remaining[j] <= T_min:\n            j += 1\n        if j < len(b_remaining):\n            count_above += 1\n            j += 1\n\n    worst_place = count_above + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum total points `x`, and the two lists of scores from the first and second tours.\n2. **Finding Best Place**: The best place is always 1 because Vasya can be assigned the highest possible scores from both tours, ensuring his total is the highest.\n3. **Finding Minimal Total (`T_min`)**: Using a two-pointer approach on sorted lists, we find the smallest sum of any pair (from the two tours) that is at least `x`.\n4. **Adjusting for Worst Place**: After removing the scores used for `T_min`, we again use a two-pointer technique to count how many remaining pairs can form sums greater than `T_min`.
