    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the entire string might be considered, but if no duplicate substring of positive length exists, we output 0.\n 2. Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to check for each length from the maximum down to 1.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate over substring lengths from n//2 down to 1 (but actually, we can go from the maximum substring length which is len(s) down to 1) and check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and occurrences can overlap.\n\n Example: \n   Input: 'abcd' -> no substring appears twice, so output 0.\n   Input: 'ababa' -> substring 'aba' appears twice (at index 0 and index 2). Also, 'a' appears multiple times, but we want the longest -> so 3.\n   Input: 'zzz' -> substring 'z' appears three times, but also substring 'zz' appears twice? Actually, in 'zzz': \n        'zz' appears as starting at index0 and index1. So the answer is 2.\n\n But wait: the example output for ['zzz'] is 2.\n\n However, let me clarify with the example 'zzz':\n   Substrings of length 3: \"zzz\" -> only one occurrence.\n   Substrings of length 2: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> two occurrences (overlapping allowed). So length 2 is valid.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can do:\n   Let n = len(s)\n   For length L from n//2 down to 1 (or from n down to 1, but we want the longest so we can break when we find one for a given L) we can check all contiguous substrings of length L and record their frequency.\n\n However, we can also think: the maximum possible duplicate substring must have length at most floor(n/2) ? Not exactly: consider \"aaa\", then the substring \"a\" has length 1, and \"aa\" (length 2) appears twice (at index0 and index1). But note: the entire string is of length 3, so the maximum length for a duplicate substring cannot exceed floor((n+1)/2) ??? Actually, we can have two overlapping occurrences of a substring of length L, so the condition is that the two starting indices must be at most L apart? Actually, the two occurrences can start at i and j such that j-i >= L (if non-overlapping) but the problem allows overlapping. However, the substring itself is defined by consecutive characters. \n\n But note: the substring of length L must appear at least twice. The two occurrences can start at different indices. The minimal requirement is that the two occurrences don't necessarily need to be non-overlapping.\n\n However, we are looking for the longest. So we can start from the maximum possible L (which is n) and go down until we find one? But the maximum duplicate substring can be at most n-1? Actually, the entire string can only appear once, unless the string is duplicated? But the problem says the string is given and we are to find a substring (which is contiguous) that appears at least twice. The entire string is one occurrence, so we require two. Therefore, the entire string cannot be a duplicate. So the maximum L we need to consider is less than n.\n\n Actually, we can have two occurrences of a substring of length L, so we must have at least two starting positions i and j (with i < j) such that the substring starting at i of length L equals the substring starting at j of length L. The condition for overlapping is that j - i < L? Actually, the substring at i covers [i, i+L-1] and at j covers [j, j+L-1]. For them to not overlap, we need j >= i+L. But the problem allows overlapping, so we only require j >= i (and j < i+L is allowed). However, even if they overlap, they must be the same substring.\n\n Example: \"ababa\": \n   Consider L=3: \n     substring starting at 0: \"aba\"\n     substring starting at 1: \"bab\"\n     substring starting at 2: \"aba\" -> so we found two at indices0 and 2.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   Let n = len(s)\n   We'll iterate L from min(n, some_max) down to 1? Actually, we know the maximum L for which a duplicate substring can exist is n-1 (if n>=2) because if we take a substring of length n, it appears only once. But wait: if we take a substring of length n-1, then we have two starting positions: 0 and 1. So for L = n-1, we have two substrings: s[0:n-1] and s[1:n]. These two are adjacent and overlapping.\n\n   However, the problem says the substring must appear at least twice. So we can have two occurrences of a substring of length L, and the two occurrences must be in the string (so we need at least two starting indices i and j, with i < j, such that j-i < n and j-i >= 0, and the substring of length L starting at i equals the substring starting at j).\n\n   We can iterate L from n down to 1 (but we want the longest, so we start from n and go down until we find one) but note: the entire string (L=n) cannot appear twice because the entire string is unique. So we start from n-1 and go down to 1.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"aaaa\"? Then the entire string (L=4) is \"aaaa\", and we can have a substring of length 3: \"aaa\" appears at index0 and index1 (and index2) so multiple times. But we are looking for the longest. The entire string is length4, but it appears only once. The next is length3: \"aaa\" appears three times. Then length2: \"aa\" appears three times. Then length1: \"a\" appears four times. So the longest is 3.\n\n   However, we can also consider: the maximum L for which a duplicate exists is floor(n/1) but we require two distinct starting indices. The condition for having two distinct starting indices for a substring of length L is that we need at least two starting indices i and j (with i<j) such that j < n - L + 1. And we require the two substrings to be equal.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   For L in range(min(n, max_possible), 0, -1): \n        We look at all contiguous substrings of length L and store the substring and the starting index (or just count the frequency of the substring).\n\n        If we find at least one substring (of length L) that occurs at least twice, then we output L and break.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require the substring to appear consecutively, just at least twice.\n\n   However, we must consider: the entire string is of length n, so the maximum L we can consider is n-1 (because if L = n, then there's only one substring). But wait: what if the string is periodic? Actually, no: the entire string is one contiguous block. So we are safe to set the maximum L as n-1.\n\n   But consider: if we have two identical halves? For example, \"abcabc\". The entire string is length6. We can have a substring of length3: \"abc\" appears at index0 and index3. Then the answer would be 3. But note: we can also have a substring of length4: \"abca\" and \"bcab\" and \"cabc\" are the ones of length4. None of these repeat? Actually, the substring \"abca\" appears only once, \"bcab\" once, \"cabc\" once. Then we go to length3: \"abc\" appears twice, so we output 3.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n   n = len(s)\n   # We'll consider L from n-1 down to 1 (we skip L = n because then we only have one substring)\n   # But wait: what if the string is \"aaa\", n=3. Then we consider L from 2 down to 1.\n        L=2: substrings: \"aa\" (from index0) and \"aa\" (from index1) -> so we found two. Then output 2.\n\n   However, the example input includes 'zzz', which is similar.\n\n   But wait, what about the example \"abcd\"? n=4, then we check L=3: \n        substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=2: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicate. Then output 0.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to worry about empty string.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n   We can use a dictionary to count the frequency of each substring of a fixed length L.\n\n   Steps:\n     Let n = len(s)\n     For L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                seen[substr] += 1\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n\n        # Now, check if any substring has count >= 2?\n        found = False\n        for count in seen.values():\n            if count >= 2:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)   # or break and then we know we found the answer.\n\n     If we didn't find any, then output 0.\n\n   But wait: is this efficient? The string length is at most 100, and the maximum L is 99 (for n=100) and then we have about 100 - L + 1 substrings for each L. The total number of substrings considered is sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n - L + 1) = O(n^2). Since n<=100, the total operations is about (100*101/2) * (max substring length) but wait: we are doing for each L separately, and the inner loop runs (n-L+1) times, and each time we create a substring of length L. The worst-case total operations is about the number of contiguous substrings, which is n*(n+1)/2, which is 5050 for n=100. That is acceptable.\n\n   However, we are iterating from the largest L (n-1) down to 1, and we break as soon as we find a duplicate for a given L. So we don't have to check all L if we find one.\n\n   But note: we are going from the largest L to smallest, so we will find the longest substring first.\n\n   However, we must consider: the substring of length L might not be the entire set of contiguous substrings? Actually, we are checking every contiguous substring of length L.\n\n   Let me test with \"ababa\":\n        n=5, so we check L from 4 down to 1.\n        L=4: \n            substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3:\n            substrings: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> we see \"aba\" twice. So we output 3.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if there are two different substrings of the same length that both appear twice? We are breaking at the first L (from high to low) that has at least one substring appearing twice. Since we are going from high to low, we return the highest L for which there's a duplicate. And that is what we want.\n\n   However, note: we are not storing all substrings, we are storing for each L independently. So we are checking for each L separately.\n\n   One more example: \"abcabc\"\n        n=6, check L=5: substrings: \"abcab\", \"bcabc\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=4: \"abca\", \"bcab\", \"cabc\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3: \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", \"abc\" -> wait, \"abc\" appears at index0 and index3 -> so we output 3.\n\n   But wait, in \"abcabc\", the substring \"abc\" appears at index0 and index3, so yes.\n\n   However, note: the substring \"abc\" of length3 is the same as the substring from index0 to index2 and from index3 to index5.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a string like \"aabaac\"?\n        Let's break it down: \n          s = \"aabaac\"\n        We are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n        Check L=5: \n            substrings: \"aabaa\", \"abaac\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=4:\n            \"aaba\", \"abaa\", \"baac\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3:\n            \"aab\", \"aba\", \"baa\", \"aac\" -> no duplicate? \n            But wait: \"aab\" at index0 and then \"aab\" doesn't appear again. \n            \"aba\": at index1 and then at index3? \n                index1: \"aba\" -> s[1:4] = \"aba\"\n                index3: s[3:6] = \"aac\" -> not \"aba\"\n            \"baa\": at index2: \"baa\", and then no other \"baa\".\n            \"aac\": at index4: \"aac\", and then no other.\n\n        L=2:\n            \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ac\"\n            \"aa\" appears at index0 and index3 -> so output 2.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n   But wait, is there a longer substring? What about L=3: did I miss something?\n        Let me list all substrings of length3 for \"aabaac\":\n            index0: \"aab\"\n            index1: \"aba\"\n            index2: \"baa\"\n            index3: \"aac\"\n\n        No duplicates.\n\n   So the code above would output 2.\n\n   However, note: the substring \"aa\" (L=2) appears twice, so that's correct.\n\n   But wait, is there a substring of length 3 that appears twice? Actually, no.\n\n   However, note: the substring \"aa\" appears at index0 (substring s[0:2]) and at index3 (substring s[3:5]). So that's two non-overlapping occurrences.\n\n   Another example: \"aaa\"\n        n=3, check L=2: \n            substrings: s[0:2]=\"aa\", s[1:3]=\"aa\" -> duplicate, so output 2.\n\n   It works.\n\n   But note: we are using a dictionary for each L. We could optimize by breaking early in the inner loop if we find a duplicate for the current L, but the problem size is small.\n\n   However, we can also break early in the inner loop if we already found a duplicate for the current L? Actually, we are building the dictionary and then checking. We can break early if we find a substring that we've seen before and its count becomes 2.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                # We found at least two occurrences of this substring\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)   # But wait, we are in the middle of the loop for a fixed L. We break the inner loop and then we break the outer loop.\n\n        But note: we are iterating from the largest L to the smallest, and we want the largest L. So if we find a duplicate for a given L, we output that L and exit.\n\n   However, the above approach doesn't check all substrings for the current L? We break as soon as we find one duplicate. But that's okay because we only need one substring (any substring) of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n   But wait: what if the first substring we check is not the duplicate one? We break too early.\n\n   Actually, we cannot break the inner loop until we are sure that we have found at least one duplicate for the current L. But note: we are counting the frequency. If we see a substring that we've seen before, then we have at least two. But we cannot break immediately because we are still counting the rest. However, we don't need to count the rest: we can break the inner loop and then break the outer loop.\n\n   However, we can break the inner loop as soon as we see a substring that has been seen before (and then we break the outer loop). But note: we are storing the frequency. We can break as soon as we see a duplicate because we know that there is at least one substring (the current one) that is a duplicate.\n\n   But wait: what if the current substring is the second occurrence of some substring, then we can break. However, we are storing the frequency, and we are checking for duplicates. So we can do:\n\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                # This means we have seen this substring before, so we have at least two occurrences.\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n\n   But wait: what if we have three occurrences? Then we are breaking on the second occurrence, which is correct.\n\n   However, what if we have two occurrences of two different substrings? Actually, we are iterating and we break at the first duplicate we encounter. But that's okay because we only need one substring (any) that is duplicated.\n\n   But note: we are storing the frequency in the dictionary. However, if we break as soon as we see a duplicate, then we don't record the frequency for the rest of the substrings. But we don't care because we only need to know if there's at least one substring that is duplicated.\n\n   However, we must record the frequency for the entire set for the current L? Actually, no: because we are breaking at the first duplicate we meet, and then we break the entire program. But what if we don't meet a duplicate until later? Then we must continue.\n\n   Actually, the above early break is incorrect because we might not have encountered the duplicate substring until we see the second occurrence. But we are storing the frequency. The correct way is to not break the inner loop until we have processed all substrings for the current L? Or we can break as soon as we see a duplicate because we know that we have found at least one substring (the current one) that is duplicated.\n\n   However, we must ensure that the duplicate we found is indeed present. But we are storing the frequency, and when we see the same substring again, we break.\n\n   But wait: we are storing the frequency in the dictionary. In the above code, if we break as soon as we see a duplicate, then we don't record the frequency for the rest. But we don't need to: we only need to know that there is at least one duplicate.\n\n   However, the above code does:\n\n        seen = {}\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                # We found a duplicate, so we break and output L.\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n\n   This is correct because we are checking each substring. When we see a substring that is already in seen, that means we have seen it before, so we have at least two occurrences.\n\n   But note: we are not storing the frequency, we are just checking existence. However, if we see the same substring multiple times, we break at the second occurrence. But what if we have more than two? We break at the second, which is sufficient.\n\n   However, we are not storing the frequency beyond the first two? Actually, we don't need to. We only care about whether we have seen it at least once.\n\n   But wait: what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the second occurrence, and that's okay.\n\n   But note: the above method does not work if we have two different substrings that are duplicates? Actually, we break at the first duplicate we encounter. But we are iterating over all starting indices. So we will break at the second occurrence of the first duplicate substring we meet.\n\n   However, we want the longest L, so if we find a duplicate at L=5, we break and output 5, even if there is a duplicate at L=6 (which is the entire string)? But wait, we are iterating from high to low. We start at L=5 and then break. But we never checked L=6? Actually, we start from L = n-1 (which is 5) and then we break. We don't check L=6 because we started from n-1 (which is 5) and we break.\n\n   But wait: our initial L range was from n-1 down to 1. For n=6, we start at 5. Then we break at 5 if we find a duplicate. But the entire string (L=6) is not checked because we set the range to (n-1) down to 1.\n\n   However, the entire string (L=6) cannot be duplicated (only one occurrence). So we are safe.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"abcabc\" and we consider L=6? Then we have one substring: \"abcabc\", so no duplicate. Then we check L=5: \"abcab\", \"bcabc\" -> no duplicate. Then L=4: ... until L=3.\n\n   So we are not missing the entire string because we skip L=n.\n\n   However, what if the string is \"aaaa\" (n=4)? Then we check L=3: \n        substrings: \"aaa\", \"aaa\" -> duplicate, so output 3.\n\n   But wait: the entire string is \"aaaa\", which is of length4. But we don't check L=4. But that's okay because we require two occurrences, and the entire string of length4 appears only once.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string is empty, but the problem says non-empty, so we ignore.\n\n        # We consider L from n-1 down to 1\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            found_duplicate = False\n            for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[start:start+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    # We found a duplicate for this substring of length L.\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = 1\n\n        # If we finish all L without finding any duplicate, output 0.\n        print(0)\n\n   However, wait: the above code does not consider the possibility that the same substring might appear more than twice, but that's okay.\n\n   But wait: what if the same substring appears twice, but we break at the second occurrence. That's correct.\n\n   Let me test with \"aaa\" (n=3):\n        L from 2 to 1:\n        L=2:\n            start=0: substr=\"aa\", not in seen -> seen={\"aa\":1}\n            start=1: substr=\"aa\", in seen -> print(2) and exit.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"abab\" (n=4):\n        We check L=3:\n            start0: \"aba\" -> not seen -> seen={\"aba\":1}\n            start1: \"bab\" -> not seen -> seen={\"aba\":1, \"bab\":1}\n            start2: \"aba\" -> seen! -> print(3) and exit.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"aba\" appears at index0 and index2, so that's correct.\n\n   However, note: the substring \"aba\" is of length3, and the string is \"abab\", so the two occurrences are at index0 and index2 (which are separated by 2 indices, so they overlap? Actually, the first occurrence is from index0 to 2, the second from index2 to 4? But wait, the string is \"abab\", so the substring starting at index2 is \"ab\" (if we take length3, then we go from index2 to index4, which is out of bounds? Actually, the substring of length3 at index2 would be \"aba\"[2:5] -> but the string is \"abab\", so index2: s[2:5] is \"ab\" (since the string has length4, index2 to 5 is two characters: s[2] and s[3] -> \"ab\"). \n\n   Wait, let me write the string: \"abab\" -> indexes: 0:a,1:b,2:a,3:b.\n\n   For L=3, the substrings are:\n        start0: s[0:3] -> \"aba\"\n        start1: s[1:4] -> \"bab\"\n        start2: s[2:5] -> but 5 is beyond the string, so in Python, slicing beyond the end is handled by truncation? Actually, no: the substring from start2 to start2+L-1 is from index2 to index4, but the string only has indices 0 to 3. So s[2:5] is \"ab\" (because the third character is at index3, and then index4 is beyond). But wait, the substring of length3 from index2 would require three characters: s[2], s[3], and s[4] -> but s[4] doesn't exist. So the substring of length3 starting at index2 is not valid? \n\n   Actually, the inner loop goes from 0 to n-L (inclusive). For n=4 and L=3, the last start index is 4-3 = 1. So we only have starts 0 and 1.\n\n   Correction: the inner loop should run for start in range(0, n - L + 1). Because the substring starting at start has length L, and the last index is start+L-1, which must be < n. So the condition is start <= n-L.\n\n   In the example \"abab\", n=4, L=3: then n-L+1 = 4-3+1 = 2, so start in [0, 1]. So we don't consider start=2.\n\n   Then for \"abab\", L=3: \n        start0: \"aba\"\n        start1: \"bab\"\n\n   Then no duplicate. Then we go to L=2:\n        start0: \"ab\"\n        start1: \"ba\"\n        start2: \"ab\"\n\n        At start2: we see \"ab\", which is in seen (from start0) -> so we break and output 2.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"ab\" appears at index0 and index2, so that's correct.\n\n   However, the example \"abab\" has the substring \"aba\" (length3) only once, and \"ab\" (length2) twice.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   But wait, the above code for the inner loop: \n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let me fix the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the example \"ababa\" (n=5) for L=3: \n        starts: 0,1,2 -> three substrings: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> so at start2, we see \"aba\" which is in seen (from start0) -> so we break and output 3.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, in the example \"abab\", we break at L=2. But the substring \"ab\" is of length2, and we found two occurrences.\n\n   However, what if we have a string where a longer substring is duplicated but we break at the next lower one? Actually, we are iterating from high to low, so we check the highest L first. \n\n   Example: \"abcdeabc\" (n=8). \n        Check L=7: \n            substrings: \n                start0: \"abcdeabc\" -> too long? Actually, we are only taking 7: \"abcdeab\"\n                start1: \"bcdeabc\" -> no duplicate.\n            Then L=6: \n                \"abcdeab\", \"bcdeabc\" -> no duplicate.\n            Then L=5: \n                \"abcde\", \"bcdea\", \"cdeab\", \"deabc\", \"eabca\", \"abc\" -> wait, no duplicate?\n            Then L=4: \n                \"abcd\", \"bcde\", \"cdea\", \"deab\", \"eabc\", \"abca\" -> no duplicate?\n            Then L=3: \n                \"abc\", \"bcd\", \"cde\", \"dea\", \"eab\", \"abc\", \"bc\" -> wait, \"abc\" appears at start0 and start6 -> duplicate. So output 3.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"abc\" appears twice (at index0 and index6). However, there is a longer substring that appears twice? Actually, the entire string is \"abcdeabc\", so the substring \"abc\" is the first three and the last three. But is there a longer substring that repeats? \n\n        The substring \"deab\" (length4) does not repeat. \n        \"eabc\" (length4) does not repeat.\n\n   So 3 is the answer.\n\n   However, wait: the substring \"abc\" is of length3, and we found it. But is there a substring of length4 that repeats? Let me check:\n\n        The substrings of length4: \n            \"abcd\", \"bcde\", \"cdea\", \"deab\", \"eabc\", \"abc\" -> wait, no. Actually, the last substring of length4 would be from index4 to 7: \"eabc\".\n\n        Now, is there any duplicate? \n            \"abcd\" -> only once\n            \"bcde\" -> only once\n            \"cdea\" -> only once\n            \"deab\" -> only once\n            \"eabc\" -> only once\n\n        So no.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above code does not account for the fact that the same substring might appear in multiple ways, but we are checking by value.\n\n   One more edge: string with all same characters, say \"aaaaa\" (n=5). \n        Check L=4: \n            starts: 0: \"aaaa\", 1: \"aaaa\" -> duplicate, output 4.\n\n   But wait, the entire string is \"aaaaa\", so the substring of length4 appears twice (starting at0 and1). So that's correct.\n\n   However, the example input was \"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\", so we must output 0, 3, 2 respectively.\n\n   Let me run the code for these examples:\n\n   Example1: \"abcd\" (n=4)\n        L from 3 down to 1:\n            L=3: \n                start0: \"abc\" -> seen={}\n                    add \"abc\":1\n                start1: \"bcd\" -> add \"bcd\":1 -> no duplicate -> next L.\n            L=2:\n                start0: \"ab\" -> add \"ab\":1\n                start1: \"bc\" -> add \"bc\":1\n                start2: \"cd\" -> add \"cd\":1 -> no duplicate.\n            L=1:\n                start0: \"a\" -> add \"a\":1\n                start1: \"b\" -> add \"b\":1\n                start2: \"c\" -> add \"c\":1\n                start3: \"d\" -> add \"d\":1 -> no duplicate.\n            Then output 0.\n\n   Example2: \"ababa\" (n=5)\n        L=4: \n            start0: \"abab\", start1: \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3:\n            start0: \"aba\" -> add\n            start1: \"bab\" -> add\n            start2: \"aba\" -> duplicate -> output 3.\n\n   Example3: \"zzz\" (n=3)\n        L=2:\n            start0: \"zz\", start1: \"zz\" -> duplicate -> output 2.\n\n   All correct.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but the problem reads from stdin. We assume one string per input.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So we read one string.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   But wait: what if the input has spaces? The problem says the string consists of lower-case Latin letters and is non-empty.\n\n   We can use:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   But the problem says the string is given in the first input line. There might be no space, but to be safe.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" So we can simply:\n\n        s = input()\n\n   But if the input is coming from a file or pipe, and there might be trailing newline, then strip() is safe.\n\n   But the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to worry about empty string.\n\n   However, the example inputs are given without spaces.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters, and length <=100.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   However, if the input is provided with a newline, then strip() removes the newline. But the problem says the string is contained in the first line, so we don't want to remove internal spaces? But the problem says lower-case Latin letters, so no spaces.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   But note: the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", meaning the entire string is in the first line. So we can read the entire line and remove any extraneous whitespace (like newline) but the string itself shouldn't have spaces.\n\n   Let me assume that the string is given without spaces and we can read the whole line and remove any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   But wait: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we can rely on that.\n\n   However, if the string has spaces, then we are removing them. But the problem says it's lower-case Latin letters. So no.\n\n   We'll proceed.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string is empty, but the problem says non-empty, so we skip.\n        # We consider L from n-1 down to 1\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[start:start+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = 1\n        print(0)\n\n   However, note: the above code uses `exit(0)` which is from the system. We can also use `sys.exit(0)`, but the problem doesn't require external modules.\n\n   But `exit(0)` is a built-in function, so it's okay.\n\n   But wait: what if we don't find any duplicate? Then we print 0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, we can avoid using `exit(0)` by using a flag and breaking out of the loops.\n\n   Revised without exit:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[start:start+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = 1\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            print(0)\n\n   This is equivalent.\n\n   But the problem is small, and either way is acceptable.\n\n   Let me choose the version without `exit(0)`.\n\n   However, the problem says the string length is at most 100, so we can use either.\n\n   But note: the problem expects an output of one number.\n\n   I'll use the version with a flag.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[start:start+L]\n                seen[substr] = seen.get(substr, 0) + 1\n                if seen[substr] >= 2:\n                    print(L)\n                    return   # But we are not in a function.\n\n   We can put the code in a function, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\n   Since the problem is small, we can do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            # Use a set or dict to track seen substrings\n            seen = {}\n            for start in range(0, n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap. The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the string from the longest possible down to the shortest, and for each length, determine if any substring of that length appears at least twice.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous substring that occurs more than once in the input string. The key observation here is that longer substrings are checked first, and as soon as a duplicate is found for any length, that length is the answer since we are checking from the largest to the smallest.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating from the largest possible substring length (n-1, where n is the string length) down to 1, we can efficiently find the longest substring that repeats. For each length, we use a dictionary to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is seen more than once during the iteration, we immediately return the current length.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves nested loops: the outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from largest to smallest, and the inner loop checks all substrings of the current length for duplicates using a dictionary.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n^3) in the worst case, where n is the string length. This is because for each length L (from n-1 down to 1), we check up to n - L + 1 substrings, each of length L. However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfound = False\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = {}\n    for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[start:start+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            found = True\n            break\n        else:\n            seen[substr] = 1\n    if found:\n        break\nif not found:\n    print(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: The length of the string is stored in `n`, and a flag `found` is initialized to `False` to track if a duplicate substring is found.\n3. **Outer Loop**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `1`, representing the lengths of substrings to check.\n4. **Inner Loop**: For each substring length `L`, the code checks all possible starting positions in the string. Each substring of length `L` is added to a dictionary. If a substring is encountered more than once, its presence is detected, and the current length `L` is printed, then the program exits.\n5. **Result Handling**: If no duplicate substring is found after checking all lengths, the program prints `0`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination upon finding the longest valid substring, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
