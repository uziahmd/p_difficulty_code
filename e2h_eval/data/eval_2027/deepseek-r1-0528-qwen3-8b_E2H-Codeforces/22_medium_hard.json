After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: first line has n and m, then n lines with m characters (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and store as a list of strings (each string is a row of marks for one student).\n\n We need to determine for each subject, what is the highest mark (from 1 to 9). Then, for each subject, note which students have that highest mark.\n\n However, note: a student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., has the highest mark in that subject).\n\n But note: multiple students can be best in the same subject? Actually, if two or more students have the same highest mark in a subject, then they are all best in that subject.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" \n So if the highest mark is, say, '9', then every student who has a '9' in that subject is best.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n For each subject j (column), find the maximum mark (as a character, but we can convert to int or just compare by char since '1'<'2'...<'9').\n\n Then, for each student i, check for any subject j: \n   grade[i][j] == max_mark[j]   (then student i is best in subject j)\n\n But note: the input is given as a list of strings for the rows (students) and we have m columns.\n\n However, we have to consider that the input might have n and m up to 100, so we can do nested loops.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Step 1: Read n, m and the grid (list of n strings, each of length m)\n\n Step 2: For each column j (from 0 to m-1):\n   Let col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n   Let max_mark = max(col)   # This gives the highest mark in that subject\n\n Step 3: We will create a list (or set) of students who are best in at least one subject.\n\n But note: we don't need to know for each subject which students are best, but for each student if there is at least one subject where he is best.\n\n We can do:\n\n For each student i (row i), we can check for each subject j: if grid[i][j] == max_mark[j] then student i is successful.\n\n However, we must precompute the max_mark for each subject j.\n\n But wait: what if two different subjects have the same max_mark? That doesn't matter because we are checking per subject.\n\n Example from sample 1:\n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Columns:\n        Subject0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n        Subject1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n        Subject2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Now, for student0 (first row): \n        subject0: '2' == '2' -> successful (so we break or count one success)\n        subject1: '2' != '3' -> skip\n        subject2: '3' == '3' -> successful (but we only need one)\n\n   So student0 is successful.\n\n   Student1 (second row):\n        subject0: '2' == '2' -> successful.\n\n   Student2 (third row):\n        subject0: '1' != '2'\n        subject1: '1' != '3'\n        subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n   Therefore, output 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n 1. Parse input.\n 2. Create a list `max_marks` of length m (for each subject) such that max_marks[j] is the maximum character in column j.\n\n 3. For each student i (from 0 to n-1):\n        successful = False\n        for j from 0 to m-1:\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break   # no need to check other subjects for this student\n        if successful:\n            count++\n\n 4. Print count.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as a string in the example, but the actual input will be from stdin.\n\n Example input format:\n\n First line: \"3 3\"\n Next three lines: \"223\", \"232\", \"112\"\n\n We can read:\n\n import sys\n\n data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n Then first line = data[0].split()\n Then next n lines = data[1:1+n]\n\n But note: the example input is provided as a string in the example, but the problem says the first line contains two integers.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n n, m = map(int, input().split())\n grid = []\n for i in range(n):\n     grid.append(input().strip())\n\n But note: the example input is given as a string that includes the newline, so using input() is safe.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not separated by spaces.\"\n\n So let's code accordingly.\n\n But wait: what if there are extra spaces? The problem says the marks are not separated by spaces.\n\n Example: \n     Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n We can assume that each row is exactly m characters.\n\n However, we use input().strip() to remove any extraneous whitespace (like newline) but the problem says each line has m characters.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n Edge case: n=0 or m=0 -> but n,m>=1.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        n=3, m=3\n        grid = [\"223\", \"232\", \"112\"]\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \n        n=3, m=5\n        grid = [\"91728\", \"11828\", \"11111\"]\n\n   For subject0: max('9','1','1') -> '9'\n   For subject1: max('1','1','1') -> '1'\n   For subject2: max('7','8','1') -> '8'\n   For subject3: max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n   For subject4: max('8','8','1') -> '8'\n\n   Now check each student:\n\n   Student0: \"91728\"\n      subject0: '9' == '9' -> successful.\n\n   Student1: \"11828\"\n      subject0: '1' != '9'\n      subject1: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n\n   Student2: \"11111\"\n      subject0: '1' != '9'\n      subject1: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n\n   Therefore, all 3 are successful.\n\n   So output 3.\n\n Code:\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the example input is provided as a string in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n We'll assume standard input.\n\n Code:\n\n n, m = map(int, input().split())\n grid = []\n for i in range(n):\n     grid.append(input().strip())\n\n # If we read from a file or stdin, we have grid as list of strings.\n\n # Precompute max_marks for each subject (each column)\n max_marks = []\n for j in range(m):\n     col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n     max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n # Now, count successful students.\n count = 0\n for i in range(n):\n     successful = False\n     for j in range(m):\n         if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n             successful = True\n             break\n     if successful:\n         count += 1\n\n print(count)\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n     grid = [\"223\", \"232\", \"112\"]\n     max_marks for subject0: max(['2','2','1']) -> '2'\n     subject1: max(['2','3','1']) -> '3'\n     subject2: max(['3','2','2']) -> '3'\n\n     Student0: \n         j0: '2'=='2' -> True -> count becomes 1.\n     Student1:\n         j0: '2'=='2' -> True -> count becomes 2.\n     Student2:\n         j0: '1' != '2'; j1: '1' != '3'; j2: '2' != '3' -> False.\n\n     Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n Example 2: \n     grid = [\"91728\", \"11828\", \"11111\"]\n     max_marks: \n         j0: max('9','1','1') -> '9'\n         j1: max('1','1','1') -> '1'\n         j2: max('7','8','1') -> '8'\n         j3: max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n         j4: max('8','8','1') -> '8'\n\n     Student0: \"91728\": \n         j0: '9'=='9' -> True -> count=1.\n     Student1: \"11828\":\n         j0: '1' != '9'\n         j1: '1'=='1' -> True -> count=2.\n     Student2: \"11111\":\n         j0: '1' != '9'\n         j1: '1'=='1' -> True -> count=3.\n\n     Output: 3 -> correct.\n\n But wait: what about the second example input string? The example input was given as \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\", which matches.\n\n However, note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9. The example uses digits from '1' to '9'. Our comparison works because we are comparing characters and the natural order of digits is the same as their numeric value.\n\n But what if the input has a space? The problem says: \"Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9\", and \"the marks in a rows are not separated by spaces\", so we can safely assume that.\n\n Let's run the code.\n\n However, note: the example input is provided as a string in the example, but in the problem statement the input is from stdin.\n\n We can also handle the case when the input is provided via a file, but the code above reads from stdin.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Print the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\"\n\n We are printing the count.\n\n It should work.\n\n However, let me consider an alternative: what if two students tie for the highest mark in a subject? Then both are considered best. And that's okay because we only need one subject where the student is best.\n\n The above code correctly checks for equality to the max_mark.\n\n One more edge: if there is only one subject (m=1) then we check that one column.\n\n Example: n=2, m=1, grid = [\"1\", \"1\"]\n   max_marks[0] = '1'\n   Student0: '1'=='1' -> successful.\n   Student1: '1'=='1' -> successful.\n   Output: 2.\n\n Another example: n=2, m=1, grid = [\"1\", \"2\"]\n   max_marks[0] = '2'\n   Student0: '1' != '2' -> not successful.\n   Student1: '2'=='2' -> successful.\n   Output: 1.\n\n It works.\n\n I think we are good.\n\n But note: the problem says the input has n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Our solution is O(n*m) which is acceptable for n, m <= 100 (at most 100*100 = 10000 comparisons).\n\n Let me submit the code as requested.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of a student in all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves iterating through each column and keeping track of the maximum value.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful. The check is done by comparing each student's mark in every subject against the precomputed maximum marks for those subjects.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks.append(max(col))\n        \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into a list. The first line contains the dimensions n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code collects all marks from each student and determines the highest mark in that subject. This is stored in a list `max_marks`.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: For each student, the code checks if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, the student is marked as successful. The loop breaks early once a successful subject is found for efficiency.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects by leveraging precomputed maximum values, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
