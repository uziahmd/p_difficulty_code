Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of old candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour.\n   - When a candle burns out, it becomes a leftover. Also, when we use a new candle, we get a burned candle which is leftover.\n   - We can combine 'b' leftovers to make one new candle.\n\n How to think:\n   Let's denote:\n     hours = 0   (total hours so far)\n     current_candles = a   (the candles we have initially)\n     leftovers = 0        (burned candles that are not yet used to make new ones)\n\n But note: the process can be broken down as:\n\n   Step 1: Use all available candles (current_candles) for burning. This gives:\n        hours += current_candles\n        Then, we will have current_candles burned, so leftovers += current_candles\n        Then, we can convert some of these leftovers into new candles: \n            new_candles = leftovers // b\n        And then leftovers %= b   (remaining leftovers)\n\n        Then, we set current_candles = new_candles   (because we now have these new candles to burn)\n\n   However, note: after burning, the new candles become burned and added to leftovers, so we must account for that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate until we don't have any candles to burn.\n\n   But note: the problem says Vasily acts optimally. We start by burning the initial candles and then use the leftovers to make more.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   But wait, we don't start with any leftover. Then we burn 'a' candles, so we add 'a' hours, and then we have 'a' leftovers.\n   Then, we can form floor(a / b) new candles, and the leftover becomes a % b.\n\n   Then we burn these new candles, so we add floor(a / b) hours, and then we have a % b + floor(a / b) leftovers from the new burning.\n\n   Then we can form floor((a % b + floor(a / b)) / b) new candles, and so on.\n\n   However, note: the example: \"4 2\" -> 7 hours.\n\n   Steps for (4,2):\n     Start: current = 4, leftover = 0\n     Step 1: Burn 4 -> hours=4, leftover becomes 4.\n             Make new candles: 4 // 2 = 2, leftover = 4 % 2 = 0.\n             Now we have 2 new candles and 0 leftover.\n     Step 2: Burn 2 -> hours=6, leftover becomes 2.\n             Make new candles: 2 // 2 = 1, leftover = 0.\n     Step 3: Burn 1 -> hours=7, leftover becomes 1 -> which is less than b (which is 2), so we stop.\n\n   But wait, the example output is 7. So we stop at 7.\n\n   However, in step 3, we cannot form a new candle because 1 < 2.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n     total = 0\n     current = a\n     leftover = 0\n\n   But actually, we can use a loop:\n\n     total = 0\n     candles = a\n     while candles > 0:\n         total += candles\n         # These candles will burn and become leftovers, so we add them to the leftover count\n         leftover += candles\n         # Now, we can convert 'leftover' into new candles: every b leftovers make one\n         new_candles = leftover // b\n         leftover = leftover % b\n         candles = new_candles\n\n     Then print(total)\n\n   Let's test with (4,2):\n        Initial: candles = 4, leftover = 0, total=0\n        Iteration 1:\n            total = 4\n            leftover = 4\n            new_candles = 4//2 = 2, leftover = 0\n            candles = 2\n        Iteration 2:\n            total = 4+2 = 6\n            leftover = 2\n            new_candles = 2//2 = 1, leftover = 0\n            candles = 1\n        Iteration 3:\n            total = 6+1 = 7\n            leftover = 1\n            new_candles = 1//2 = 0, leftover = 1\n            candles = 0 -> break.\n\n        Output: 7 -> correct.\n\n   Another example: (6,3)\n        Input: 6 3 -> expected 8.\n\n        Iteration 1:\n            total = 6\n            leftover = 6\n            new_candles = 6//3 = 2, leftover = 0\n            candles = 2\n        Iteration 2:\n            total = 6+2 = 8\n            leftover = 2\n            new_candles = 2//3 = 0, leftover = 2\n            candles = 0 -> break.\n\n        Output: 8 -> correct.\n\n   However, note: what if we have a=1 and b=2? \n        Input: 1 2\n        Iteration 1:\n            total = 1\n            leftover = 1\n            new_candles = 1//2 = 0, leftover=1 -> break.\n        Output: 1 -> correct.\n\n   Edge: a=1, b=1000 -> same as above: 1.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a=0? The problem states a>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, let me check the constraints: a from 1 to 1000, b from 2 to 1000.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n   Read the input string, split into two integers.\n\n   Then apply the above loop.\n\n   But note: we must be cautious because the leftover might accumulate from multiple cycles.\n\n   This simulation seems to work.\n\n   However, we can also solve without a loop by using a formula, but the numbers are small (a<=1000, b<=1000) and the number of iterations is logarithmic (base roughly b) so the loop is efficient.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"4 2\"\n        Output: 7\n\n        Input: \"6 3\"\n        Output: 8\n\n   Code:\n\n   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n   total = 0\n   candles = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   while candles > 0:\n       total += candles\n       leftover += candles\n       candles = leftover // b\n       leftover = leftover % b\n\n   print(total)\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   But wait, in the first iteration, we add the initial 'a' candles. Then we update leftover and then recalculate candles.\n\n   This matches our reasoning.\n\n   However, note: in the example (4,2) we did three iterations. \n\n   But wait, in the second iteration we set candles to 2, then in the third we set to 1, then 0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   One more example: (10,3)\n\n   Expected: \n        First: burn 10 -> total=10, leftover=10 -> 10//3 = 3 new candles, leftover=1.\n        Then burn 3 -> total=13, leftover=1+3=4 -> 4//3 = 1 new candle, leftover=1.\n        Then burn 1 -> total=14, leftover=1+1=2 -> no new candle.\n\n        So 14 hours.\n\n   Let me run the code:\n\n        a=10, b=3\n        candles=10, leftover=0, total=0\n        Iteration1: total=10, leftover=10 -> candles=10//3=3, leftover=10%3=1\n        Iteration2: total=13, leftover=1+3=4 -> candles=4//3=1, leftover=4%3=1\n        Iteration3: total=14, leftover=1+1=2 -> candles=2//3=0, leftover=2 -> break.\n\n        Output: 14 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Note: The input is given in a single line.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and can be reused after collecting enough burned-out candles to form new ones. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of initial candles (`a`) and the number of burned-out candles needed to create a new one (`b`).\n2. **Simulate Burning Process**: For each iteration, burn all available candles, adding their count to the total hours. The burned candles become leftovers.\n3. **Recycle Leftovers**: Convert the collected leftovers into new candles. The number of new candles is the integer division of the leftovers by `b`, and the remaining leftovers are what couldn't form a full set.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are no more candles left to burn. The total hours accumulated during each burning phase is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning candles and recycling leftovers, ensuring optimal usage of available resources. The loop runs in logarithmic time relative to the initial number of candles, making it efficient even for the upper constraint limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    candles = a\n    leftover = 0\n    \n    while candles > 0:\n        total += candles\n        leftover += candles\n        candles = leftover // b\n        leftover = leftover % b\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned-out candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `total` (accumulated hours), `candles` (current candles to burn), and `leftover` (burned candles not yet recycled) are initialized.\n3. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are candles to burn. In each iteration:\n   - The current candles are burned, adding their count to `total`.\n   - These burned candles are added to `leftover`.\n   - New candles are formed by converting `leftover` into new ones (using integer division by `b`), and the remainder is left as unused leftovers.\n4. **Output**: Once no more candles are left, the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that Vasily uses his candles optimally, maximizing the illumination time by continuously recycling burned-out candles into new ones. The solution efficiently handles all edge cases within the given constraints.",
