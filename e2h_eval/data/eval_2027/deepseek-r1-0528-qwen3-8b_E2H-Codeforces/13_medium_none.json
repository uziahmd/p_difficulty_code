For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given a string with three space-separated notes.\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) for the 12 notes in order: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'] \n    Note: The problem says the notes are cyclic and the mapping is fixed.\n\n 2. Since the chord is unordered, we need to consider all permutations of the three notes.\n\n 3. For a given ordering [a, b, c] (each note represented as a number), we can compute the distances (in semitones) between consecutive notes (taking into account the circular nature). However, note that the distance from a higher note to a lower one is not directly the same as the forward direction.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". However, when we have a set of three notes, we can arrange them in increasing order (modulo 12) and then check the intervals.\n\n 4. However, the problem does not require the notes to be consecutive in the circle? Actually, we can arrange the three distinct notes in a circle and then consider the three possible orderings (starting from each note). But note: the chord definition requires an ordering such that the first interval is 4 and the second is 3 (for major) or 3 and then 4 (for minor). \n\n    Important: The entire set must form two intervals of 4 and 3 (with the third being 7, which is the sum). But note: the ordering might wrap around the circle.\n\n 5. Approach:\n\n    Let the notes be represented by numbers: n0, n1, n2.\n\n    We can consider all cyclic orders. But note: the problem says \"if we can order the notes\", meaning we can arrange the three in a sequence (without necessarily being adjacent in the 12-note circle, but the distances are measured along the musical scale, which is circular). However, the distances must be the shortest way? Actually, the problem states: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\".\n\n    But wait: the definition says the distance from the lowest to the highest. So when we order the three notes in ascending order (considering the circle, so we might break the circle at the smallest note and then go up), we get three consecutive notes in the circle? Not exactly: the chord is defined by the intervals between consecutive notes in the chosen ordering. However, the problem does not specify that the three notes must be consecutive in the circle. It just specifies the relative distances.\n\n    Example: \"C E G\": \n        C -> E: 4 semitones (because E is 4 steps from C: C, C#, D, D#, E)\n        E -> G: 3 semitones (E, F, F#, G)\n\n    But what if we have a chord that is not in the base octave? Actually, the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically, so we can map any note to a number mod 12.\n\n    However, the example also includes \"C# B F\": \n        They say: order as \"B C# F\"\n        B to C#: 1 semitone (since B->C is 1, but wait: the list is ... A, B, C, ... so B to C is 1? But wait, the list: \n        ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'] -> wait, there's a confusion: the problem says after H comes C, and the example has 'H'? Actually, the example input includes 'A B H' and the note list has 'H' as the last one. But wait, the list provided: \n        ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n        Let me map:\n        C:0, C#:1, D:2, D#:3, E:4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11.\n\n        Now, the example \"C# B F\": \n            C#:1, B:10, F:5.\n\n        How do we order them? The problem says: we can order the notes as \"B C# F\". Then:\n            B to C#: from 10 to 1: \n                If we go forward: from B(10) to C(0) is 2 semitones (since 10->11->0, but wait our mapping doesn't include 12? Actually, we are on a 12-note circle, so the distance from 10 to 1: \n                We can compute the distance in two ways: \n                    forward (without wrapping): (1 - 10) mod 12 = (1 - 10) = -9 -> but negative, so we take positive by doing (1 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 3? \n                However, the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. In the ordering \"B C# F\", we are going from B to C#. But in the circle, from B to C# we can go two ways: \n                    Going up: B->C->C#: that's 2 semitones (because B to C is 1, C to C# is 1 -> total 2).\n                    Going down: B to A to G# to ... that's 10 semitones? \n\n                The problem says: the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. So in this ordering, we are considering the notes as arranged from low to high? But wait, the example says \"between B and C#\" is 3 semitones. \n\n        Let me re-read: the example says: \"if we order the notes as 'B C# F', then between B and C# will be 3 semitones\". \n\n        This suggests that the ordering is done in the circular manner? But then the distance from B to C# going upward (without wrapping) is 2, but going downward is 10. \n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the ordering in the natural ascending order (without wrapping) but then the example \"C# B F\" is ordered as \"B C# F\", which is ascending? \n\n        Let's assign numbers: \n            B=10, C#=1, F=5.\n\n        We want to arrange them in ascending order (considering the circle, but the problem says \"from the lowest to the highest\"). \n\n        The natural ascending order (without wrapping) would be: B, C, C#, D, ... but wait, in our mapping, the numbers are 0 to 11. So the ascending order (lowest to highest) is by the numerical value, but if we break the circle, we can consider the notes modulo 12.\n\n        However, the example says: \"B C# F\" is the ordering. \n\n        Let's compute the distances:\n\n        Option 1: Using the circular arrangement, but the problem says \"distance from the lowest to the highest\" meaning we are to consider the entire circle? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n\n        So the distance from E to C is 8 because we go E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->C (which is 8 semitones). \n\n        Therefore, the distance function d(x, y) is defined as: \n            d(x, y) = (y - x) % 12   if we don't allow negative, but wait: \n            Actually, the problem says the distance from E to C is 8. \n            From E (4) to C (0): (0 - 4) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8 (if we define modulo so that negative becomes positive). \n\n        So the distance from note x to note y is (y - x) % 12, but if negative we add 12 until positive? Actually, we can define:\n            distance(x, y) = (y - x) % 12\n            but then (0-4)%12 = ( -4 %12) = 8 (since -4+12=8). \n\n        However, the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. So if we have three notes, we can arrange them in increasing order (by the circular measure) and then the distances are the differences.\n\n        But note: the chord definition requires consecutive intervals. \n\n        Steps for checking:\n\n        Let the three notes be a, b, c (as numbers).\n\n        We need to check if there exists a cyclic permutation [x, y, z] such that:\n            d(x, y) = 4 and d(y, z) = 3, OR \n            d(x, y) = 3 and d(y, z) = 4.\n\n        But note: the entire set must be three distinct notes.\n\n        However, the problem says: the chord is an unordered set. And the definition uses consecutive notes in the ordering. \n\n        But wait: the example \"C E G\": \n            Ordering: [C, E, G] -> \n                d(C, E) = (4 - 0) % 12 = 4 -> good for major first part.\n                d(E, G) = (7 - 4) % 12 = 3 -> good.\n\n        But what if we have a chord that wraps around? For example, consider the chord \"B D# F\" (which is a minor chord). \n\n        Let me map: \n            B -> 10, D# -> 3, F -> 5.\n\n        We need to arrange them in an order that gives the minor pattern (3,4). \n\n        What are the possible orderings? We can arrange the three notes in a circle and then choose a starting point.\n\n        One way is to break the circle at the lowest note (considering the circular order). But the problem doesn't specify the starting note.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider all 3! = 6 permutations and for each, check the two intervals (and then the third interval is the remaining one). But note: the definition requires consecutive intervals, and the entire chord is three notes. However, the definition does not require the three notes to be consecutive in the circle without gaps. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the chord is an unordered set of three notes. The condition is: there exists an ordering (x,y,z) such that the distance from x to y is 4 and y to z is 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\n        But note: the distances are defined as the distance from x to y (which is (y-x) mod 12) but then the distance from x to z would be (z-x) mod 12, and note that (z-x) mod 12 should be (y-x + z-y) mod 12 = (4+3)%12=7 for major, and (3+4)%12=7 for minor. So the entire span from x to z is 7 semitones.\n\n        However, the problem also allows the possibility that the three notes might not be consecutive in the circle, but the condition is only about the consecutive intervals in the chosen ordering.\n\n        But note: the example \"C# B F\" is minor: \n            Notes: C#=1, B=10, F=5.\n\n        They used ordering: B, C#, F.\n\n        Then: \n            d(B, C#) = (1 - 10) % 12 = (1-10) = -9 %12 = 3? Because -9 mod12 is 3 (since -9+12=3).\n            d(C#, F) = (5 - 1) %12 = 4.\n\n        So the condition holds.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the distance between two notes x and y as (y - x) % 12, but if negative we adjust by adding 12 until positive? Actually, we can use modulo arithmetic: (y - x) % 12, but note that in Python, negative modulo might give a negative result? \n\n        We can define a function to compute the distance from x to y as:\n            dist = (y - x) % 12\n            But wait: if (y-x) is negative, then (y-x) %12 in Python will return a value between 0 and 11, but it is computed as (y-x) %12 = (y-x + 12*k) such that the result is in [0,11]. However, the problem defines the distance from E to C as 8, which is (0-4)%12 = (-4)%12 = 8 in Python.\n\n        So we can use: \n            def distance(x, y):\n                return (y - x) % 12\n\n        However, note: the distance from a higher note to a lower note (without wrapping) would be negative modulo, but that's okay because the problem says the distance is always positive and the modulo operation gives the positive equivalent.\n\n        But wait: in the example, the ordering must be such that the distances are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). However, the problem says the chord is defined by an ordering that goes from the lowest to the highest? Actually, no: the example \"C# B F\" was ordered as \"B C# F\", which is ascending in the circle? \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones\" and then \"between Y and Z equals 3 semitones\". There's no requirement that the entire sequence is increasing. But observe:\n\n        In the major chord: C E G -> \n            From C to E: we go from 0 to 4 (so increasing by 4)\n            From E to G: from 4 to 7 (increasing by 3)\n\n        In the minor chord: B C# F -> \n            From B to C#: from 10 to 1 (which is increasing by 1, but modulo 12 we got 3? That doesn't seem increasing in the usual sense. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. So in the ordering, the notes must be arranged from the lowest to the highest? \n\n        Let me check: in the minor example, the ordering is \"B C# F\". Are these arranged from low to high? \n            In the circle, the note numbers: B=10, C#=1, F=5. \n            But 10 is greater than 5 and 1? \n\n        The problem says: \"the distance between X and Y\" is defined as from X to Y. But then the example says the distance from B to C# is 3. \n\n        How do they define the ordering? The problem does not explicitly say that the ordering must be ascending. However, note the example: \"C E G\" is major and the ordering is C, E, G. \n\n        But in the minor example, the ordering is given as \"B C# F\", and then they say the distance from B to C# is 3. \n\n        The key is: the definition does not require the notes to be in the base octave. The distance is computed by the circular shift. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"if we can order the notes\". So we are allowed to choose any cyclic order (any starting point) and then the distances are computed by the circular distance (forward in the circle).\n\n        But note: the example ordering for the minor chord is \"B C# F\", which is not the usual ascending order (because B is 10, then C# is 1, which is less than 10). \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require the ordering to be strictly increasing in the linear sense, but the distance is defined by the circle. \n\n        Therefore, we can consider the three notes and check all 6 permutations (orderings) to see if there exists an ordering (x,y,z) such that:\n            (distance(x,y) == 4 and distance(y,z) == 3) OR (distance(x,y)==3 and distance(y,z)==4)\n\n        However, note: the entire set must form a cycle. But we are only considering three consecutive notes. \n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Map the input notes to numbers (0-11) using the list: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'].\n\n        2. Extract the three numbers.\n\n        3. Generate all 6 permutations of these three numbers.\n\n        4. For each permutation (a,b,c):\n            Let d1 = distance(a, b) = (b - a) % 12\n            Let d2 = distance(b, c) = (c - b) % 12\n\n            Then, the entire span from a to c should be (c - a) % 12, but note: the two intervals are consecutive. However, the definition does not require the entire span from a to c to be the sum of the two intervals? Actually, in the circle, the distance from a to c might be d1+d2 (if we go from a->b->c) but if the chord wraps around, then the direct distance from a to c might be different. However, the condition only requires the consecutive intervals.\n\n        5. Conditions for major: d1==4 and d2==3.\n           Conditions for minor: d1==3 and d2==4.\n\n        6. If we find at least one permutation that satisfies major, then output \"major\". Similarly for minor.\n\n        7. If none, then \"strange\".\n\n        But wait: what if a permutation satisfies both? The problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous.\" So no chord is both.\n\n        However, let's test: is there a chord that can be interpreted as both?\n            Condition for major: (4,3) and for minor: (3,4). \n            In a circle, if we have an ordering (a,b,c) with (b-a)%12=4 and (c-b)%12=3, then the entire chord spans 7 semitones. Similarly for minor: (3,4) also spans 7 semitones. But note: the set of notes is the same, but the ordering is different.\n\n            Example: Consider the chord \"C E G\" (major) and also consider the same set in a different ordering: \n                Ordering [E, G, C]: \n                    d(E,G)= (7-4)%12=3, d(G,C)= (0-7)%12= (0-7+12)=5 -> not 4 or 3.\n                Ordering [G, C, E]:\n                    d(G,C)=5, d(C,E)= (4-7)%12= (4-7+12)=9 -> not 4 or 3.\n\n            So only the ordering [C, E, G] works for major.\n\n            Now, what about the same chord in a different representation? \n\n            Example: Consider the chord \"D F# A\" (which is a major chord). \n                D=2, F#=6, A=9.\n                Ordering [D, F#, A]: \n                    d(D,F#)= (6-2)%12=4, d(F#,A)= (9-6)%12=3 -> major.\n\n            Now, is there a minor chord that can be interpreted as major? \n\n            Example: Consider the chord \"C D# G\" (which is actually a diminished chord? Or maybe not). Let's check:\n                Notes: C=0, D#=3, G=7.\n                Permutations:\n                    [0,3,7]: d1=(3-0)=3, d2=(7-3)=4 -> minor.\n                    [0,7,3]: d1=(7-0)=7, d2=(3-7)= (3-7+12)=8 -> no.\n                    [3,0,7]: d1=(0-3)= (0-3+12)=9, d2=(7-0)=7 -> no.\n                    [3,7,0]: d1=(7-3)=4, d2=(0-7)=5 -> no.\n                    [7,0,3]: d1=(0-7)=5, d2=(3-0)=3 -> no.\n                    [7,3,0]: d1=(3-7)= (3-7+12)=8, d2=(0-3)=9 -> no.\n\n            So this chord is minor.\n\n            Another example: Consider the chord \"C E G\" again, but also try to interpret it as minor: \n                We need an ordering (x,y,z) such that d(x,y)=3 and d(y,z)=4, and the entire set {0,4,7}.\n                Check:\n                    [0,4,7]: (4-0)=4 -> not 3, so skip.\n                    [0,7,4]: (7-0)=7, (4-7)=9 -> no.\n                    [4,0,7]: (0-4)=8, (7-0)=7 -> no.\n                    [4,7,0]: (7-4)=3, (0-7)=5 -> no.\n                    [7,0,4]: (0-7)=5, (4-0)=4 -> no.\n                    [7,4,0]: (4-7)=9, (0-4)=8 -> no.\n\n            So indeed, the chord is either major or minor or neither, but not both.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n        We'll create a mapping dictionary for the 12 notes.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        mapping = {\n            'C': 0,\n            'C#': 1,\n            'D': 2,\n            'D#': 3,\n            'E': 4,\n            'F': 5,\n            'F#': 6,\n            'G': 7,\n            'G#': 8,\n            'A': 9,\n            'B': 10,\n            'H': 11\n        }\n\n        Then read the input string, split it, and split each note (but note: the input is three space separated notes, and each note is one token. However, there are two-character notes: 'C#', 'D#', etc. But the input format: \"C E G\", \"C# B F\", so each note is separated by space. The two-character ones are given as two characters.\n\n        We can split the input and then for each token, check if the first character is one of the keys and the rest is empty or the second character is '#'? Actually, the problem says the notes are from the given list. So we have:\n\n        Example tokens: \"C\", \"E\", \"G\", \"C#\", \"B\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\", \"H\"\n\n        We can map by having a dictionary that maps the string representation to the number.\n\n        However, note: the example input includes \"A B H\", so we have 'H' as a note.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        tokens = input().split()\n        Then, for each token, check: if the token is in the mapping dictionary? But wait, our mapping dictionary has single-character and two-character strings. So we can do:\n\n        But note: the two-character note is 'C#', and the single-character are the others. However, we have 'B' and 'H' as single-character. \n\n        Since the problem states the 12 notes, we can create the dictionary with all the strings.\n\n        However, the input may have spaces and the tokens are separated by space. Each token is one of the 12 note names.\n\n        Let me build the dictionary:\n\n        note_to_int = {\n            'C': 0,\n            'C#': 1,\n            'D': 2,\n            'D#': 3,\n            'E': 4,\n            'F': 5,\n            'F#': 6,\n            'G': 7,\n            'G#': 8,\n            'A': 9,\n            'B': 10,\n            'H': 11\n        }\n\n        Then, convert the three tokens to their integer representations.\n\n        Then, generate all permutations of the three integers.\n\n        Then, for each permutation (a, b, c):\n\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n\n            # But note: the definition requires the entire set to be three distinct notes. We assume the input has distinct notes? The problem doesn't say, but typically chords have distinct notes.\n\n            Then, if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                print(\"major\")\n                exit or break\n\n            elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                print(\"minor\")\n                exit or break\n\n        If we didn't find any, then print \"strange\"\n\n        However, note: the problem says the chord is exactly three notes, and we are given three. We assume distinct.\n\n        But wait: what if the three notes are not distinct? The problem says \"set\", so we assume distinct. But the problem says \"unordered set\", so duplicates are not allowed.\n\n        So we assume distinct.\n\n        However, let's test with the example inputs:\n\n        Example 1: Input \"C E G\"\n            tokens: ['C','E','G'] -> [0,4,7]\n            permutations: \n                (0,4,7): d1= (4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major -> output \"major\"\n\n        Example 2: Input \"C# B F\"\n            tokens: ['C#','B','F'] -> [1,10,5]\n            permutations: \n                (1,10,5): d1=(10-1)%12=9, d2=(5-10)%12=(-5)%12=7 -> no.\n                (1,5,10): d1=(5-1)%12=4, d2=(10-5)%12=5 -> no.\n                (10,1,5): d1=(1-10)%12=(-9)%12=3, d2=(5-1)%12=4 -> minor -> output \"minor\"\n\n        Example 3: Input \"A B H\"\n            tokens: ['A','B','H'] -> [9,10,11]\n            permutations:\n                (9,10,11): d1=1, d2=1 -> no.\n                (9,11,10): d1=2, d2=(10-11)=11 -> no.\n                (10,9,11): d1=(9-10)=11, d2=2 -> no.\n                (10,11,9): d1=1, d2=(9-11)=10 -> no.\n                (11,9,10): d1=(9-11)=10, d2=1 -> no.\n                (11,10,9): d1=(10-11)=11, d2=(9-10)=11 -> no.\n\n            -> \"strange\"\n\n        This matches the example.\n\n        However, wait: the example input is given as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] and outputs ['major', 'minor', 'strange'].\n\n        But note: the example input \"C# B F\" is provided as a string. We must split and then map.\n\n        Code:\n\n        We'll read the input, split, and then map each token to an integer.\n\n        However, what if the input has a note that is not in the dictionary? The problem states the input will be from the 12 notes.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        One more example: the minor chord example from the problem: \"C# B F\"\n\n        But wait, the example input is \"C# B F\", and we mapped:\n            C# -> 1, B -> 10, F ->5.\n\n        Then the permutation (10,1,5) gave d1=3 and d2=4 -> minor.\n\n        But note: the example says the ordering is \"B C# F\", which is (10,1,5). \n\n        However, the definition does not require the entire set to be in increasing order (linear) but the ordering we are checking is arbitrary (we are checking all permutations). \n\n        This method should work.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Note: We must import itertools for permutations.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        import itertools\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if len(data) != 3:\n            # but the problem says three, so we assume three\n            # but let's be safe and use three\n            pass\n\n        notes = [note_to_int[token] for token in data]\n\n        for perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n            a, b, c = perm\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n            # We don't care about the third interval (from a to c) because the definition only requires the two consecutive intervals.\n\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                print(\"major\")\n                exit(0)   # or break and then after the loop print strange, but we can break early.\n\n            if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                print(\"minor\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        print(\"strange\")\n\n        But wait: what if a chord can be major in one ordering and minor in another? The problem says it's unambiguous, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, let's test with a known chord that is both? Actually, we saw above that the same set cannot be both. So we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n        But note: the problem says the chord is exactly three notes, and we are checking all permutations. We are breaking at the first occurrence of either major or minor.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note: the definition of the distance: (y-x) % 12. But if we have a negative, the modulo operation in Python handles it correctly.\n\n        Example: (10-1) %12 = 9, (1-10)%12 = (1-10) = -9 %12 = 3 (because -9 + 12 = 3).\n\n        So the function is correct.\n\n        Let's run the example \"C E G\" and \"C# B F\" and \"A B H\".\n\n        But wait: the example \"C# B F\" was found with the permutation (10,1,5). \n\n        However, note: the problem does not require the ordering to be the one that starts with the lowest note. We are checking all orderings.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the chord is given in a different representation? For example, the chord \"C E G\" might be given as \"E G C\"? \n\n        Example: Input \"E G C\"\n            tokens: ['E','G','C'] -> [4,7,0]\n            permutations:\n                (4,7,0): d1=(7-4)=3, d2=(0-7)=5 -> no.\n                (4,0,7): d1=(0-4)=8, d2= (7-0)=7 -> no.\n                (7,4,0): d1=(4-7)=9, d2=(0-4)=8 -> no.\n                (7,0,4): d1=(0-7)=5, d2= (4-0)=4 -> no.\n                (0,4,7): d1=4, d2=3 -> major -> found.\n\n        So even if we give the notes in any order, we'll find the major ordering.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n        Code:\n\n        import itertools\n\n        # Build the mapping dictionary\n        note_to_int = {\n            'C': 0,\n            'C#': 1,\n            'D': 2,\n            'D#': 3,\n            'E': 4,\n            'F': 5,\n            'F#': 6,\n            'G': 7,\n            'G#': 8,\n            'A': 9,\n            'B': 10,\n            'H': 11\n        }\n\n        data = input().split()\n        notes = [note_to_int[token] for token in data]\n\n        # Generate all permutations\n        for perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n            a, b, c = perm\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                print(\"major\")\n                exit(0)\n            if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                print(\"minor\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        print(\"strange\")\n\n        However, wait: the example input \"C# B F\" is given as ['C#','B','F'] and we map to [1,10,5]. Then the permutation (10,1,5) is generated. Then d1 = (1-10)%12 = -9%12=3, d2=(5-1)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n        But note: the problem says the ordering for minor is \"B C# F\", which is (B, C#, F) -> (10,1,5). \n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, there is a potential issue: the distance from a to b is defined as (b - a) %12. But in the circle, the distance from a to b is the smallest nonnegative residue. But the problem says the distance from E to C is 8. Our method gives (0-4)%12=8, which is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. In the ordering (10,1,5): \n            The three notes are 10,1,5. In the circle, we break the circle arbitrarily. The definition does not require the ordering to be increasing in the linear sense, but the distance is computed by the circular shift. \n\n        This is consistent.\n\n        Let me test with a chord that wraps multiple times? Actually, the modulo operation takes care of that.\n\n        One more example: a major chord that wraps around: \n            Consider the chord \"G# C E\" (which is a major chord). \n            G#=8, C=0, E=4.\n            We need to find an ordering: \n                One ordering: [C, E, G#] -> (0,4,8): d1=4, d2= (8-4)=4 -> not 3.\n                [C, G#, E]: (0,8,4): d1=8, d2=(4-8)= (4-8+12)=8 -> no.\n                [E, C, G#]: (4,0,8): d1=(0-4)=8, d2=(8-0)=8 -> no.\n                [E, G#, C]: (4,8,0): d1=4, d2=(0-8)= (0-8+12)=4 -> no.\n                [G#, C, E]: (8,0,4): d1=(0-8)=4, d2=(4-0)=4 -> no.\n                [G#, E, C]: (8,4,0): d1=(4-8)=8, d2=(0-4)=8 -> no.\n\n            Hmm, that doesn't find it. \n\n            But wait, the chord \"G# C E\" is the same as \"C E G#\", so it should be major. \n\n            The ordering [C, E, G#] is (0,4,8): \n                d1= (4-0)=4, d2=(8-4)=4 -> fails because we need 3.\n\n            Why? The chord \"C E G#\" is a major chord? Let's check the intervals:\n\n            From C to E: 4 semitones (C->C#->D->D#->E: 4 semitones)\n            From E to G#: 3 semitones? \n                E->F->F#->G->G#: that's 4 semitones (from E to G is 3, then G to G# is one more, so 4). \n\n            Actually, G# is the same as Ab, and the major chord is root, major third (4 semitones), and perfect fifth (7 semitones). \n\n            The perfect fifth from C is G (which is 7 semitones). But G# is 8 semitones from C. \n\n            So \"C E G#\" is not a major chord. \n\n            Correction: \n                Major chord: root, major third (4 sem",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval requirements for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique integer (0 to 11) based on its position in the sequence of 12 musical notes (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H). This mapping simplifies distance calculations.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations to consider every possible ordering of the notes.\n3. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation, compute the intervals between consecutive notes. A major chord requires the first interval to be 4 semitones and the second to be 3 semitones. A minor chord requires the first interval to be 3 semitones and the second to be 4 semitones.\n4. **Output Result**: If any permutation matches the major or minor chord criteria, output the corresponding result. If no permutation matches, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_int = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    notes = [note_to_int[token] for token in data]\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n            \n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The dictionary `note_to_int` maps each note to its corresponding integer value (e.g., 'C' maps to 0, 'C#' to 1, etc.).\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is split into individual note tokens, which are then converted to their integer representations using the dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the circular nature of musical notes.\n4. **Interval Validation**: The intervals are checked against the criteria for major (4 and 3 semitones) and minor (3 and 4 semitones) chords. If a match is found, the corresponding result is printed immediately.\n5. **Final Output**: If no valid ordering is found after checking all permutations, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic for accurate interval calculations and permutations to explore all orderings.",
