Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all the letters must be the same (the same letter for the entire diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, and that letter is different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the example input has:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output 'NO'\n\n   Why? Because the center of the last row (third row) is 's' but the diagonal requires 'x'. Actually, let's check:\n\n   The main diagonal: \n        [0][0] = 'x', [1][1]='o', [2][2]='s', [3][3]='o', [4][4]='x'\n   But wait, condition 1 says both diagonals must have the same letter. So the main diagonal must be all same and the anti-diagonal must be all same.\n\n   In the example, the main diagonal has two different letters: 'x' and then 'o' and then 's'. So it fails.\n\n   Let me re-read the example: \n        Input: ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox'] -> Output 'NO'\n\n   Actually, the main diagonal is not all same. So we can break down:\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n, then n lines.\n 2. Check the two diagonals:\n    - Main diagonal: (i, i) for i in range(n)\n    - Anti-diagonal: (i, n-1-i) for i in range(n)\n\n 3. For the diagonals to form an X, the entire main diagonal must be the same letter, say A, and the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter, say B.\n    But note: the problem does not require that A and B are the same? Actually, looking at the example: \n        Example 2: \n            3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n        This is a YES. In this case, the main diagonal is ['w','s','w'] -> wait, that's not the same! \n        Actually, let's check the example 2 carefully:\n\n        The grid:\n            row0: 'w','s','w'\n            row1: 's','w','s'\n            row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w' -> all 'w'\n        Anti-diagonal:\n            (0,2)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,0)='w' -> all 'w'\n\n        So actually, the center cell (1,1) is common to both diagonals. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter? \n\n        But wait, condition says: on both diagonals the letters are the same. It doesn't say they must be the same as each other. However, the center is shared so they are the same by default. But what if the two diagonals have different letters? \n\n        Example: \n            Let the main diagonal be 'a' and anti-diagonal be 'b'. Then the center cell must be both 'a' and 'b'. So if they are different, then the center cell is the only one that is forced to be both. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter because the center cell is part of both.\n\n        So we can deduce that the entire main diagonal must be one letter, and the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter, and since the center is common, the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n        Therefore, we can check:\n            Let diag_letter = the letter at the center (which is also the common letter for both diagonals) and check that every element on the main diagonal is diag_letter and every element on the anti-diagonal is diag_letter.\n\n 4. Then, for the rest of the cells (non-diagonal), they must all be the same letter, say C, and C != diag_letter.\n\n However, note: the example input 2 is:\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n    The center is 'w'. The main diagonal is all 'w', the anti-diagonal is all 'w'. Now, the non-diagonal cells: \n        (0,1): 's'\n        (1,0): 's'\n        (1,2): 's'\n        (2,1): 's'\n\n    So all non-diagonal are 's', which is different from 'w'. So it's YES.\n\n 5. But wait, in the example 1, the main diagonal is not all same. So we first check the diagonals.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Step 1: Read n and the grid.\n\n    Step 2: Check the two diagonals and the center cell.\n\n        Let center = grid[n//2][n//2]\n\n        For main diagonal:\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][i] != center:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit or break.\n\n        For anti-diagonal:\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][n-1-i] != center:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break.\n\n        If either fails, output \"NO\".\n\n    Step 3: Check the non-diagonal cells.\n\n        We need to traverse every cell that is not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check: for every cell (i, j) that is not on the main diagonal (i != j) and not on the anti-diagonal (i+j != n-1), we must have the same letter, say C, and that letter must be different from center.\n\n        But note: there might be a case where the non-diagonal cells are not all the same, or they are the same but same as center? Condition says: all other squares (not on diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n        So:\n\n            Let non_diag_letter = None\n\n            For i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    else:\n                        if non_diag_letter is None:\n                            non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                        else:\n                            if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                                print(\"NO\")\n                                return\n\n            And then check that non_diag_letter exists (meaning there is at least one non-diagonal cell) and non_diag_letter != center.\n\n        However, what if n=1? But n>=3.\n\n    Step 4: Print \"YES\" if both conditions hold.\n\n But wait: what if the two diagonals are the same letter, but the non-diagonals are not all the same? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n However, consider: what if the non-diagonals are the same but equal to the diagonal letter? Then we should output \"NO\", because the condition requires the non-diagonals to be different.\n\n So we can do:\n\n    Read n and grid.\n\n    center = grid[n//2][n//2]\n\n    # Check main diagonal\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != center:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != center:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n    # Now, set the non-diagonal letter to the first non-diagonal cell we find, and then check the rest.\n    non_diag_letter = None\n    valid_non_diag = True\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                    valid_non_diag = False\n                    break\n        if not valid_non_diag:\n            break\n\n    # Also, if there are no non-diagonal cells? But n>=3, so there are non-diagonal cells (at least 4 cells in a 3x3, and more in larger).\n    if non_diag_letter is None:\n        # This would mean n=1, but n>=3 so skip.\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if non_diag_letter != center and valid_non_diag:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n However, note: the above code breaks the inner loop and then the outer loop. But we can also use a flag.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n    non_diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n    # Now, if we found at least one non-diagonal cell, then check its letter is different from center.\n    if non_diag_letter == center:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n But wait: what if there are multiple non-diagonal cells, but they are all the same and different from center? Then we pass.\n\n However, there's a catch: what if the grid is 3x3 and the non-diagonal cells are not the same? Then we break early and print \"NO\".\n\n But wait: we are breaking the inner loop and then the outer loop? Actually, we break the inner loop but then the outer loop continues? Actually, we break the inner loop and then break the outer loop by using a flag or by returning. But in the above code, we break the inner loop and then break the outer loop by having a condition to break out of the outer loop? Actually, the above code does not break the outer loop. We break the inner loop (with the 'break') and then the outer loop will continue with the next i? But we don't want to do that.\n\n Let me fix the non-diagonal checking:\n\n    We can do:\n\n        non_diag_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_letter is None:\n                    non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return   # or break and then outside we know to print NO.\n\n        Then after the loops, check that non_diag_letter != center.\n\n    But wait, what if the grid is 3x3 and the non-diagonal cells are not uniform? Then we break in the middle and return \"NO\".\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        non_diag_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_letter is None:\n                    non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return\n\n        # If we haven't returned, then all non-diagonal cells are the same.\n        if non_diag_letter == center:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n However, what if the grid has no non-diagonal cells? But n>=3, so the grid has at least 9 cells, and the diagonals have 3 cells (for n=3) so 6 non-diagonal cells. So we are safe.\n\n But wait, what if the grid is 3x3 and the non-diagonal cells are all the same but also the center is that same letter? Then we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n However, what if the grid has two different non-diagonal letters? Then we break and output \"NO\".\n\n But note: the condition requires that all non-diagonal cells are the same letter. So if we find two different ones, we break.\n\n However, the above code breaks on the first inconsistency. That's acceptable.\n\n But wait, what if we don't find any non-diagonal cell? Then non_diag_letter remains None, and then we would check:\n\n        if non_diag_letter == center: \n            -> None == center? Then we output \"NO\"\n\n But that's okay because if there are no non-diagonal cells, then the condition fails (because the non-diagonal part must be present and same). Actually, for n>=3, the grid has non-diagonal cells. For n=3: total cells 9, diagonals 3 (but the center is shared, so 2 distinct diagonals? Actually, the two diagonals together have 5 cells: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) -> so 5 distinct cells. Then non-diagonal: 9-5 = 4. So always non-diagonal cells exist for n>=3.\n\n However, let's test with n=3: 9-5=4, so yes.\n\n But wait: the two diagonals: \n        Main: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)\n        Anti: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\n        So the set of diagonal indices: {(0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (0,2), (2,0)} -> 5 indices.\n\n So the above code should work.\n\n But wait, the example 1:\n\n        n=5, grid:\n            xooox\n            oxoxo\n            soxoo\n            oxoxo\n            xooox\n\n        Step 2: \n            Center is grid[2][2] = 's'\n\n            Check main diagonal: \n                [0][0] = 'x' -> not 's' -> so we output \"NO\" and break.\n\n        So we never get to the non-diagonal part.\n\n Example 2:\n\n        n=3, grid:\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n        Step 2: \n            center = grid[1][1] = 'w'\n\n            Check main diagonal: \n                [0][0] = 'w' -> ok\n                [1][1] = 'w' -> ok\n                [2][2] = 'w' -> ok\n\n            Check anti-diagonal:\n                [0][2] = 'w' -> ok\n                [1][1] = 'w' -> ok\n                [2][0] = 'w' -> ok\n\n            Then non-diagonal: \n                First non-diagonal cell: (0,1): 's'\n                Then (1,0): 's'\n                Then (1,2): 's'\n                Then (2,1): 's'\n\n            So non_diag_letter becomes 's'. Then we check: non_diag_letter != center -> 's' != 'w' -> True, so output \"YES\".\n\n Example 3:\n\n        Input: 3\n                xpx\n                pxp\n                xpe\n\n        Step 2: center is grid[1][1] = 'x'\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            [0][0] = 'x' -> ok\n            [1][1] = 'x' -> ok\n            [2][2] = 'e' -> not 'x' -> so output \"NO\"\n\n        However, the example output is \"NO\", which matches.\n\n But wait, the example input was given as:\n\n        ['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n        The expected output is \"NO\", so our code outputs \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n However, note: the example input 3 is provided as a string in the example, but the example output is 'NO'.\n\n But wait, the example input 3 is actually:\n\n        Input: \n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n        Our code: \n            n=3\n            grid = \n                ['xpx', 'pxp', 'xpe']\n\n            Center: grid[1][1] = 'x'\n\n            Main diagonal: \n                (0,0) -> 'x' -> ok\n                (1,1) -> 'x' -> ok\n                (2,2) -> 'e' -> not 'x' -> so we output \"NO\".\n\n        Correct.\n\n Another example: \n\n        Input: \n            3\n            aaa\n            aab\n            aaa\n\n        Main diagonal: 'a','a','a' -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: (0,2)='a', (1,1)='a', (2,0)='a' -> ok.\n        Then non-diagonal: \n            (0,1): 'a' -> but wait, the non-diagonal letter must be different from the diagonal letter (which is 'a'). Here, non_diag_letter is 'a' (from (0,1)) and then (1,0)='a', (1,2)='b' -> wait, (1,2) is on the anti-diagonal? Actually, (1,2) is not on the main diagonal (1!=2) and not on the anti-diagonal (1+2=3, which is not 2 (n-1=2 for n=3) -> wait, n=3, so n-1=2, and 1+2=3 !=2 -> so (1,2) is non-diagonal.\n\n        But (1,2) is 'b'. So when we set non_diag_letter to the first non-diagonal cell (0,1) as 'a', then at (1,2) we have 'b' which is different from 'a'. So we break and output \"NO\".\n\n        This is correct because the non-diagonal cells are not all the same.\n\n However, what if the non-diagonal cells are all the same but that same letter is the same as the diagonal? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n Example:\n\n        Input:\n            3\n            aaa\n            aab\n            aaa\n\n        Actually, wait: the non-diagonal cells are:\n            (0,1): 'a' -> same as diagonal -> then (1,0): 'a', (1,2): 'b' -> so already fails.\n\n        Another example:\n\n            Input:\n                3\n                bbb\n                bcb\n                bbb\n\n            Main diagonal: (0,0)='b', (1,1)='c', (2,2)='b' -> fails because not all same (unless center is 'b', but (1,1) is 'c').\n\n        So the code:\n\n            Read n=3, grid = ['bbb','bcb','bbb']\n\n            Center = grid[1][1] = 'c'\n\n            Check main diagonal:\n                (0,0): 'b' != 'c' -> output \"NO\"\n\n        Now, if we have:\n\n            Input:\n                3\n                xxx\n                xyy\n                xxx\n\n            Main diagonal: (0,0)='x', (1,1)='y', (2,2)='x' -> fails.\n\n        Another:\n\n            Input:\n                3\n                xxx\n                xxy\n                xxx\n\n            Main diagonal: (0,0)='x', (1,1)='x', (2,2)='x' -> ok.\n            Anti-diagonal: (0,2)='x', (1,1)='x', (2,0)='x' -> ok.\n            Then non-diagonal: (0,1)='x' -> but wait, the non-diagonal cells: \n                (0,1): 'x' -> same as center 'x' -> then we check: non_diag_letter is 'x', then (1,0)='x', (1,2)='y' -> here (1,2) is not on the main diagonal (1!=2) and not on the anti-diagonal (1+2=3 !=2) -> so non-diagonal. Then we see 'y' which is different from 'x'. So we break and output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, the non-diagonal cells are not all the same: (0,1) is 'x', (1,0) is 'x', (1,2) is 'y'. So they are not the same.\n\n        However, what if:\n\n            Input:\n                3\n                xxx\n                xyy\n                xxx\n\n            Then main diagonal: (0,0)='x', (1,1)='y', (2,2)='x' -> fails.\n\n        How about:\n\n            Input:\n                5\n                xxxxx\n                xxaxy\n                xaxax\n                xxaxy\n                xxxxx\n\n            This is an X pattern. \n            Main diagonal: \n                (0,0)='x', (1,1)='a', (2,2)='x', (3,3)='a', (4,4)='x' -> fails because not all same.\n\n        So the main diagonal must be entirely the same letter.\n\n        The example of an X pattern in the problem's example was:\n\n            Input 2: \n                3\n                wsw\n                sws\n                wsw\n\n            This is an X.\n\n        How is that stored? \n            The center is 'w'. The diagonals are all 'w'. The non-diagonals are 's'. \n\n        So the code works.\n\n However, note: the example input 1 was:\n\n            ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n        Our code correctly outputs \"NO\" because the main diagonal has an 's' at the center, but the center was set to 's' and then we check the main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x' -> matches 's'? No, so we break and output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, the example input 1 is provided as:\n\n            Input: ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n        The center is the third row (index 2) and third column (index 2): \n            row2: 'soxoo' -> the third character (index2) is 'x' (if we count: s o x -> index0: 's', index1:'o', index2:'x')? \n\n        Let me write the grid:\n\n            row0: 'xooox'\n            row1: 'oxoxo'\n            row2: 'soxoo'\n            row3: 'oxoxo'\n            row4: 'xooox'\n\n        The center is at (2,2): row2 is 'soxoo', so the third character is at index2: 'x'\n\n        Then main diagonal: \n            (0,0): 'x' -> ok\n            (1,1): 'o' -> not 'x' -> fails.\n\n        But wait, the example input 1 is provided as a string in the example, but the example output is \"NO\". Our code outputs \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input 1 description: \n            ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n        But wait, the center of the last row (row4) is 'x', and the center of the third row (row2) is 'x'. But the second row (row1) is 'oxoxo', so (1,1) is 'x'? Actually:\n\n            row0: index0: 'x', index1: 'o', index2: 'o', index3: 'o', index4: 'x'\n            row1: index0: 'o', index1: 'x', index2: 'o', index3: 'x', index4: 'o'\n            row2: index0: 's', index1: 'o', index2: 'x', index3: 'o', index4: 'o'\n\n        So the main diagonal: \n            (0,0)='x'\n            (1,1)='x'\n            (2,2)='x'\n            (3,3)='x'\n            (4,4)='x'\n\n        Then why did I think it was 'o'? \n\n        Let me double-check: \n            row0: 'xooox' -> (0,0) is first char: 'x'\n            row1: 'oxoxo' -> (1,1) is the second character (0-indexed: index1) -> 'x'\n            row2: 'soxoo' -> (2,2) is index2: 'x'\n            row3: 'oxoxo' -> (3,3) is index3: 'x'\n            row4: 'xooox' -> (4,4) is index4: 'x'\n\n        So the main diagonal is all 'x'. \n\n        Then why the example output is \"NO\"? \n\n        Then the anti-diagonal: \n            (0,4)='x'\n            (1,3)='x'\n            (2,2)='x'\n            (3,1)='x'\n            (4,0)='x'\n\n        So anti-diagonal is all 'x'. \n\n        Then we move to non-diagonal: \n            We look for the first non-diagonal cell. For example, (0,1): 'o'\n            Then we set non_diag_letter = 'o'\n\n            Then we check all other non-diagonal cells: they must be 'o' and not 'x'.\n\n            Now, check some non-diagonal cells:\n\n            row0: \n                (0,1): 'o' -> ok\n                (0,2): 'o' -> ok\n                (0,3): 'o' -> ok\n\n            row1:\n                (1,0): 'o' -> ok\n                (1,2): 'o' -> ok\n                (1,4): 'o' -> ok\n\n            row2:\n                (2,0): 's' -> not 'o' -> fails.\n\n        So the cell (2,0) is 's', which is not 'o'. Therefore, we output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, the example input 1 is described as:\n\n            Input: ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n        And the example output is \"NO\". So our code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input 1 was provided as:\n\n            ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n        But wait, the third row is 'soxoo'. The first character is 's'. So (2,0) is 's'. \n\n        Therefore, the non-diagonal letter must be the same for every non-diagonal cell, but we have two different letters: 'o' and 's'. \n\n        So the condition fails.\n\n        Thus, the code is:\n\n        Steps:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            grid = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                line = input().strip()\n                grid.append(line)\n\n            mid = n//2\n            center_char = grid[mid][mid]\n\n            # Check main diagonal\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][i] != center_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            # Check anti-diagonal\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][n-1-i] != center_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            # Check non-diagonal cells\n            # We'll traverse all cells and skip the diagonals.\n            non_diag_char = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    if non_diag_char is None:\n                        non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            exit(0)\n\n            # Now, if we have non_diag_char and it is not equal to center_char, then YES, else NO.\n            if non_diag_char != center_char:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait, what if the non_diag_char is None? Then we didn't find any non-diagonal cell. But for n>=3, there are non-diagonal cells. However, if n==1, then we don't have non-diagonal cells, but n>=3. So we can assume non_diag_char is not None.\n\n However, let's make sure: for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 9-5=4, so we will set non_diag_char. \n\n But what if the grid is 1x1? Then n=1, but our n>=3, so we don't worry.\n\n However, the problem states: n is odd and 3<=n<300.\n\n So we can run without fear.\n\n But wait: what if the grid is 3x3 and all cells are the same? \n\n        Example: \n            aaa\n            aaa\n            aaa\n\n        Then the main diagonal: all 'a', anti-diagonal: all 'a', then non-diagonal: all 'a'. Then non_diag_char is 'a', which equals center_char 'a'. Then we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n One more example:\n\n        Input:\n            3\n            aba\n            bbb\n            aba\n\n        Main diagonal: 'a','b','a' -> not all same -> output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, the center is 'b'.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The first line contains an odd integer `n`, which is the size of the grid. The next `n` lines contain the grid itself, each being a string of `n` characters.\n2. **Check Diagonals:** \n   - **Main Diagonal:** Verify that all characters from the top-left to the bottom-right are the same.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal:** Verify that all characters from the top-right to the bottom-left are the same.\n   - The center character of the grid must be the same for both diagonals since it is part of both.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells:** All cells not on either diagonal must be the same character and different from the diagonal character.\n4. **Output Result:** If all conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    mid = n // 2\n    center_char = grid[mid][mid]\n    \n    # Check main diagonal: from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != center_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    # Check anti-diagonal: from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != center_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    non_diag_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_char is None:\n                non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if non_diag_char == center_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code starts by reading the integer `n` and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Center Character:** The center character of the grid is identified, which must be the same for both diagonals.\n3. **Diagonal Checks:** The code checks each cell along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). If any cell in these diagonals does not match the center character, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n4. **Non-Diagonal Check:** The code then checks all cells not on the diagonals. The first non-diagonal cell sets the expected character, and all subsequent non-diagonal cells must match this character. If any cell differs, the answer is \"NO\". Additionally, the non-diagonal character must differ from the center character.\n5. **Result Output:** If all checks pass, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all conditions required to determine if the grid forms an \"X\" by leveraging simple loops and conditional checks. The solution handles edge cases and ensures correctness through systematic validation of each condition.",
