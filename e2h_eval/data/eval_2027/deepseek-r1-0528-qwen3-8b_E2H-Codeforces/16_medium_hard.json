Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two points: home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) that define the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads divide the plane into regions (blocks). The movement is allowed only across entire road segments (nonzero common border). Importantly, two adjacent blocks (sharing a segment of a road) can be crossed in one step. However, if two blocks only meet at an intersection (a point) then they are not considered adjacent for a step.\n\n But note: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". So we are essentially crossing a full road segment.\n\n However, note that the entire plane is divided by n lines. We can think of each road as a line that separates two half-planes. The home and university are in some blocks.\n\n The important thing is: how many steps are required? Each step crosses one road (because when you cross a road, you move from one block to an adjacent one, and the adjacency is defined by a segment of a road). But note: you might cross multiple roads, but the problem asks for the minimum number of steps.\n\n However, observe: the problem does not require us to actually traverse the graph of regions (which would be too complex for n up to 300). Instead, note that:\n\n In fact, the answer is the number of roads that separate the home and the university, but with a catch: sometimes we cannot cross one road without having to cross others? Actually, wait.\n\n Let's consider: the roads are linear and they are infinite. The minimal path from home to university must cross a road whenever the home and university lie on opposite sides of that road.\n\n But note: the problem does not require crossing roads in a straight line. However, the following holds:\n\n - Each road is a straight line. The entire plane is divided by the roads. The regions are convex polygons (possibly unbounded) and the arrangement is such that two regions are adjacent if they share a segment of a road.\n\n - The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads we must cross. However, we are allowed to cross one road at a time, and each crossing changes the block. But note: the movement is defined by crossing entire road segments (so we can cross any part of the road, but we are constrained by the fact that the roads are fixed).\n\n Now, note: the problem does not require to cross the roads in a particular order, but the minimal steps is the minimal number of crossings. However, we cannot avoid crossing a road if the home and university are separated by that road.\n\n Therefore, we can think: the answer is the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\n How do we check if a road (line) separates the home and the university?\n\n For a given road: a*x + b*y + c = 0.\n Define a function f(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c.\n\n Then, the side of the line for a point (x,y) is determined by the sign of f(x,y).\n\n Home is at (x1,y1): s1 = sign(f(x1,y1))\n University is at (x2,y2): s2 = sign(f(x2,y2))\n\n If s1 != s2, then the road separates them.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the roads divide the plane. So if the home and university are on the same side of a road, then that road does not separate them.\n\n But wait: what if two roads are parallel? Then the separation is independent. However, the minimal path must cross every road that separates them.\n\n However, there is a catch: sometimes you can cross multiple roads at the same time if they all pass through the same point? But note the movement rule: you can only cross one road at a time (i.e., one step moves you from one block to an adjacent one which shares a segment of a road). So even if two roads intersect, you still have to cross them separately.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home from the university.\n\n But wait: is that always true?\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0']\n   This means: home (1,1), university (-1,-1), 2 roads: \n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0 (the x-axis)\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0 (the y-axis)\n\n   Let's check the sides for home (1,1) and university (-1,-1):\n\n   For Road1 (y=0):\n        home: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        university: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> separated.\n\n   For Road2 (x=0):\n        home: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        university: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> separated.\n\n   So both roads separate them. Then the answer would be 2.\n\n   Example output: 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   Home (1,1), university (-1,-1), 3 roads:\n        Road1: x=0 (same as above)\n        Road2: y=0 (same as above)\n        Road3: x+y-3=0\n\n   Check Road1: same as above -> separates.\n   Check Road2: same as above -> separates.\n   Check Road3: \n        f(1,1) = 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n        f(-1,-1) = -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> not separated.\n\n   So only 2 roads separate. Output 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is simply to count the number of roads for which the home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n However, wait: what if the roads are not axis-aligned? The same logic applies because the sign of the linear equation determines the side.\n\n But note: the definition of the line equation: aix + biy + ci = 0.\n\n We can compute for each road:\n     s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n     s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n And then check if s1 * s2 < 0 (if they have opposite signs).\n\n However, caution: if the line passes exactly between the two points (but our input guarantees that neither home nor university is on the road) so we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n But note: due to floating point precision? The numbers are integers, and the inputs are integers, so we can use integer arithmetic.\n\n However, there is a caveat: the line equation might have large coefficients and the product s1*s2 might be very large, but that's okay.\n\n But also note: we are using multiplication and the signs. We can use:\n\n     if (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0) or (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0):\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n     if s1 * s2 < 0:\n\n However, if the numbers are very large, then the product might be too big? But note: the absolute values are up to 10^6, so the maximum |s1| could be 10^6 * (10^6) + ...? Actually, the expression is a*x+b*y+c, and a, b, c are in [-10^6, 10^6], and x,y are in [-10^6,10^6]. So:\n\n     |a*x| <= 10^12, similarly for b*y and c. So the absolute value of s1 and s2 can be up to around 3e12, and their product up to 9e24, which is beyond the range of Python integers? Actually, no, because Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but we are only doing comparisons. However, we are only checking the sign, so we don't need the exact value of the product if we can avoid overflow. But wait, the product might be too slow? \n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the product by:\n\n     if (s1 < 0 and s2 >= 0) or (s1 >= 0 and s2 < 0):\n\n But note: the guarantee that the points are not on the road, so s1 and s2 are nonzero. So we can safely use:\n\n     if s1 * s2 < 0:\n\n However, let's consider: if the product is negative, then one is positive and the other negative.\n\n But there is another issue: what if the line equation is defined with a negative leading coefficient? The sign is arbitrary. However, the condition is based on opposite signs.\n\n However, note: the line equation can be multiplied by a negative constant and the sign flips. But we are consistent: we use the same equation for both points.\n\n Example: if we have a line defined by a*x+b*y+c=0, then the same line can be written as (-a)*x + (-b)*y + (-c)=0. The side of a point (x,y) would flip. However, the condition (s1*s2<0) is invariant under flipping the entire equation (because if we multiply by -1, then both s1 and s2 become negative of the original, so the product becomes the same).\n\n So the condition is robust.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read home (x1, y1)\n 2. Read university (x2, y2)\n 3. Read n\n 4. For each of the n roads (each with a, b, c):\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0, then this road separates home and university.\n\n 5. Count the number of such roads.\n\n However, wait: is it really that simple?\n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Road1: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> line y=0.\n        Home: (1,1) -> 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive.\n        University: (-1,-1) -> 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative.\n        Product: 1 * (-1) = -1 -> negative -> count.\n\n        Road2: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> line x=0.\n        Home: 1*1+0*1+0=1 -> positive.\n        University: 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1 -> negative.\n        Product: 1*(-1)=-1 -> negative -> count.\n\n        Total count=2.\n\n Example 2:\n        Road3: a=1, b=1, c=-3 -> line x+y-3=0.\n        Home: (1,1) -> 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative.\n        University: (-1,-1) -> -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative.\n        Product: (-1)*(-5)=5 -> positive -> not counted.\n\n        So total count=2.\n\n But wait: what if the line equation is not normalized? Consider a line defined by 2x+3y+4=0. Then for two points, we check the product. It's the same.\n\n However, note: there is a possibility that the line equation is defined with a different representation. But the problem states: \"each road is defined by aix+biy+ci=0\", and we are just using the given coefficients.\n\n One more edge: what if two roads are coincident? The problem says: \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.\" So no.\n\n But wait, what if the roads are parallel but distinct? Then they are two separate lines and the separation conditions are independent.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads that have opposite signs for the two points.\n\n However, wait: is it possible that crossing one road might change the side for subsequent roads? No, because the minimal path must cross a road if and only if the two points are separated by that road. And the roads are fixed.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the actual path, but the minimal number of steps. Since each step crosses one road (and you can plan the path arbitrarily, avoiding unnecessary crossings) then the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, consider: what if two roads are not independent? Actually, the arrangement of lines is such that the minimal path is just the number of separating lines. Why?\n\n Because each separating line must be crossed at least once, and we can cross them one by one (and each crossing is one step). Moreover, we can always arrange the path to cross the lines in any order (as long as we cross each separating line once) and we don't need to cross non-separating lines because we can go around them.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n But wait: there is a known example in computational geometry: the dual graph of an arrangement of lines is not necessarily just the number of separating lines? Actually, the regions are defined by the arrangement, and the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of lines to cross. This is analogous to the problem of connecting two regions in an arrangement of lines, and the minimal number of lines to cross is the number of lines that separate the two regions.\n\n However, note: the problem states that we are moving from one block to another by crossing a road (a segment of a road). And the roads are the lines. The blocks are the connected components of the complement of the union of the lines.\n\n The minimal number of roads to cross is indeed the number of lines that strictly separate the two points.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n    count = 0\n    for each road (a, b, c):\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n    print(count)\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says that the movement is defined by having a nonzero common border. But note: if two blocks are separated by a road, then they are adjacent via that road. And to go from one block to the other, we must cross that road. And since we can cross one road per step, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads to cross.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to cross roads in sequence arbitrarily. However, the separating lines condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\n However, consider: what if the home and university are separated by two roads, but there is a way to cross both roads at the same time (at an intersection)? Then we would cross two roads in one step? \n\n But the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". The common border is the road segment. If two blocks share a road segment, then you can cross that segment (one road) in one step.\n\n However, if two blocks are separated by two roads, then they do not share a common border (unless the two roads meet at a point and form a T-junction, but then the two blocks would be separated by two different road segments). Actually, two blocks that are separated by two roads do not share a common border. They are separated by two borders. So you have to cross two steps.\n\n Therefore, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that must be crossed, which is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n Thus, the code is as above.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are already in the same block? Then we don't need to cross any road. However, if they are in the same block, then no road separates them. So the count would be 0. That is correct.\n\n However, consider: what if the two points are separated by a road, but the road is not passed in the input? Then we don't count it, and the answer is 0, but that's wrong because they are separated by that road. But wait: the input gives all the roads. So we are counting the separating roads from the given set.\n\n Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n But wait: the example input format has two examples. The first example:\n\n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   Output: 2\n\n   Second example:\n\n        Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   Output: 2\n\n However, note: the second example has 3 roads, but only two separate the points.\n\n But wait: is there a case where two roads are the same? The problem states: \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.\"\n\n So we are safe.\n\n However, wait: there is an alternative interpretation. What if the problem intended to consider the arrangement of lines and the fact that crossing one road might make the home and university appear on the same side of the next road? Actually, no. The separation by a road is independent of other roads. The condition for a road is solely based on the two points and that road.\n\n But note: the arrangement of lines divides the plane into regions. Two points are in the same region if and only if they are on the same side of every road. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, there is a classic problem: \"How many lines must be crossed to go from one region to another?\" and the answer is the number of lines separating the two regions.\n\n Therefore, we output the count.\n\n Let me test with a simple example: one road.\n\n   Input: \n        0 0\n        1 0\n        1\n        0 1 0   [this is the line y=0]\n\n   Home (0,0) is on the road? No, but wait: the problem says \"neither your home nor the university lie on the road\". So we cannot have a point on the road. Let me adjust:\n\n        Home: (0,1) and University: (0,-1), and one road: 0*x+1*y+0=0 (y=0)\n\n        Then:\n            Home: 0*0+1*1+0 = 1 -> positive\n            University: 0*0+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative\n            Product = -1 -> negative -> count=1.\n\n        Steps: 1.\n\n        But wait, the two points are separated by the road. So we must cross one road. Correct.\n\n Another test: two roads that are the same? Not allowed.\n\n But wait: what if two roads are the same? The problem says no, so we don't have to handle.\n\n However, note: the input says \"each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero\" and \"no two roads are the same\".\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read x1, y1\n   Read x2, y2\n   Read n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: the product might be very large, but that's okay because we are only comparing sign. However, we can also do:\n\n        if (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0) or (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0):\n\n   This avoids the large product (though the product of two 30-bit integers might be 60 bits, which is acceptable in Python, but for clarity we can use the direct comparison).\n\n However, note: the signs: we must be cautious for zeros. But the problem states that the points are not on the road, so s1 and s2 are nonzero. So either positive or negative.\n\n But wait: what if the line equation is defined with a negative leading term? The condition (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0) is the same as (s1 * s2 < 0) because if both are negative then product positive, if both positive then product positive, and if one positive and one negative then product negative.\n\n Therefore, we can use the product or the two conditions.\n\n However, the product might be slower for very large numbers (but the numbers are integers and the product is of two numbers that are each up to 3e12 in absolute value, so the product is 9e24, which is a 80-bit number, which is acceptable in Python but might be a bit slow for 300 iterations? But 300 is small.)\n\n But let's stick to the product for simplicity.\n\n However, let me consider: if the product is negative, then we count. But if the product is positive, then we don't.\n\n But wait: what if one of the expressions is zero? The problem says the points are not on the road, so s1 and s2 are nonzero.\n\n Therefore, we can write:\n\n        if (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) * (a*x2 + b*y2 + c) < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n But wait: there is a potential overflow? The numbers are integers and the product might be huge, but Python handles big integers. However, the problem constraints are such that the absolute value of the product is (|a*x1+b*y1+c|) * (|a*x2+b*y2+c|) which is at most (|a|*|x1|+|b|*|y1|+|c|)*(|a|*|x2|+|b|*|y2|+|c|) and the worst-case values are 10^6 for coefficients and 10^6 for coordinates, so the maximum absolute value of each expression is 10^6*(10^6) + 10^6*(10^6) + 10^6 = 2e12 + 10^6 ~ 2e12, then the product is about 4e24, which is a 79-bit number. Python can handle that, but it might be slower than the condition without multiplication.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) and (a*x2 + b*y2 + c) and (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) * (a*x2 + b*y2 + c) < 0:\n\n But we know they are nonzero, so the 'and' is redundant.\n\n However, let me check: the problem says the points are not on the road, so we don't need to check for zero.\n\n But wait: what if the expression is zero due to integer overflow? Actually, we are using integers and the inputs are integers, so the expressions are integers. And the problem says the points are not on the road, so they are nonzero.\n\n Therefore, we can use the product.\n\n However, there is a better way: we can compare the signs without multiplying the large numbers. But the numbers are integers and the product is acceptable.\n\n But let me run with the product.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            continue\n        a, b, c = map(int, data)\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n However, wait: the example input format was given as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n But note: the problem reads from standard input. We are reading from stdin.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as two separate strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        The first line contains two integers: home\n        The second line contains two integers: university\n        The third line contains an integer n\n        Then n lines, each with three integers.\n\n So we read:\n\n        Line1: \"1 1\"\n        Line2: \"-1 -1\"\n        Line3: \"2\"\n        Then two lines: \"0 1 0\" and \"1 0 0\"\n\n But note: the second example:\n\n        Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n          1 1 -3\n\n So we have to read from stdin.\n\n However, the provided example input is given as a list of strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n        Input\n        The first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.\n\n        ...\n\n        Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\n So we assume the input comes from stdin.\n\n But note: the example input is given as a list of strings? Actually, the example input is shown as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n But that is just the example. In the actual input, the input is provided via standard input, so we read line by line.\n\n However, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives two examples. But the code should read from stdin.\n\n Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n\n        Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          2\n          0 1 0\n          1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n\n        Input:\n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n          1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: I just realized: the product might be negative even if the signs are the same? No, wait: if both are positive then product positive; both negative then product positive; one positive and one negative then product negative.\n\n But note: the product being negative is the condition for opposite signs.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, wait: there is an alternative representation of the line. The line equation is defined up to a scalar multiple. But the condition (s1 * s2 < 0) is independent of the scalar factor. Because if we multiply the entire equation by k (positive or negative), then:\n\n        Original: a*x+b*y+c = 0\n        New: k*a*x + k*b*y + k*c = 0\n\n        Then s1_original * s2_original < 0  <=> (k*s1_original) * (k*s2_original) < 0 ?\n\n        Let k be positive: then (k*s1_original) * (k*s2_original) = k^2 * s1_original * s2_original, and k^2 is positive, so the sign is the same.\n\n        Let k be negative: then (k*s1_original) * (k*s2_original) = k^2 * s1_original * s2_original, and k^2 is positive (since squared), so again the sign is the same.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is invariant.\n\n Therefore, we are safe.\n\n Final code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = input().split()\n        a, b, c = map(int, data)\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n However, wait: the problem says the roads are given in the next n lines. The above code reads the next n lines.\n\n But note: the input might have extra spaces? We use split() so that's okay.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"3 space-separated integers\", so we can rely on split().\n\n But let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n\n        Input: \n           1 1\n           -1 -1\n           2\n           0 1 0\n           1 0 0\n\n        After reading the first two lines, we read n=2, then two lines.\n\n Example 2:\n\n        Input:\n           1 1\n           -1 -1\n           3\n           1 0 0\n           0 1 0\n           1 1 -3\n\n        We read three lines.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, wait: what if the input has leading/trailing spaces? The split() method removes them.\n\n But the problem says: \"space-separated\", so we assume the integers are separated by one or more spaces. Using split() is safe.\n\n Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        x1=1, y1=1, x2=-1, y2=-1, n=2\n        Road1: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> s1 = 0*1+1*1+0=1, s2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=1.\n        Road2: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> s1=1*1+0*1+0=1, s2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=2.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n Example 2:\n        n=3\n        Road1: a=1,b=0,c=0 -> s1=1*1+0*1+0=1, s2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=1.\n        Road2: a=0,b=1,c=0 -> s1=0*1+1*1+0=1, s2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=2.\n        Road3: a=1,b=1,c=-3 -> s1=1*1+1*1-3=-1, s2=1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3=-5 -> product=5 -> not negative.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: I just thought of a different scenario. What if the two points are separated by a road, but the road is defined with a negative coefficient? \n\n Example: same as above but Road1 is given as: 0 -1 0 (which is the same line y=0, but multiplied by -1). \n\n        Then for Road1: a=0, b=-1, c=0.\n        s1 = 0*1 + (-1)*1 + 0 = -1\n        s2 = 0*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + 0 = 1\n        product = -1 * 1 = -1 -> negative, so counted.\n\n So it works.\n\n Therefore, we submit the code.\n\n However, note: the problem says the roads are defined with ai and bi not both zero, and the input guarantees that.\n\n We are done.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says \"Let's call each such region a block.\" and \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". Our reasoning is that the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n However, is that always the minimal steps? Consider: the arrangement of lines might allow a shorter path if we cross multiple roads at an intersection? But note: each step only crosses one road. Even if two roads meet at a point, you still have to cross each road separately. You cannot cross two roads in one step because the common border between two blocks is only one road. \n\n Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n We output the code.\n\n But wait: the problem statement example input is given as a string, but in the competition environment, the input is from stdin.\n\n We assume the input is provided as described.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road (a line segment) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation here is that each road that separates the home and university blocks must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal number of steps is simply the count of such separating roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many lines (roads) separate two given points (home and university) in a plane. Each line divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university are located in different regions (blocks) if they lie on opposite sides of any line. The minimal steps required to move from one block to another is the number of such separating lines, as each step crosses one road.\n2. **Insight**: For each line, we can check if the home and university lie on opposite sides by evaluating the sign of the line equation at both points. If the signs differ, the line separates them.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road (line), compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, the points lie on opposite sides of the line, indicating that this line must be crossed.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the `n` roads exactly once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 300`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads, `n`.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` of the line equation `ax + by + c = 0` are read.\n3. **Checking Separation**: The value of the line equation is computed for both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, the points lie on opposite sides of the line, and the road is counted as a separator.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such separating roads is printed, which represents the minimal number of steps needed to reach the university from home.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic to determine separation, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
