The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given a number of test cases. For each test case, an integer `n` (from 1 to 10^18) is provided.\n\n We need to determine if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that a snowflake graph with `n` vertices can be constructed.\n\n The snowflake construction:\n\n   Step 0: Start with 1 vertex.\n\n   Then, we perform a series of steps. In each step (at least once), every leaf (vertex connected to only one other vertex) gets connected to `k` new vertices.\n\n How does the graph grow?\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let `r` be the number of expansion steps (at least 1).\n\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n\n   After the first expansion (step 1): \n        We start with 1 vertex (the center). Then we add `k` edges from the center, so we add `k` new vertices.\n        Total vertices = 1 + k.\n\n   Step 2: Now, the graph has `k` leaves (each of the `k` new vertices has degree 1, except the center which now has degree `k`).\n        We then expand each of these `k` leaves by adding `k` new vertices for each. However, note: when we expand a leaf, we connect it to `k` new vertices. But note that the leaf was already present and we are adding `k` more. So for each leaf we add `k` vertices.\n\n        But wait, after the first expansion we have `k` leaves. Then in the second expansion we add `k * k` vertices? And the leaves then become the new ones from the second expansion.\n\n   However, note the rule: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (leaf) is connected to `k` new vertices. This step is done at least once.\n\n   But note: after the first expansion, the center is no longer a leaf (it has degree `k`). The leaves are the `k` new ones.\n\n   Then, in the second expansion, we do the same: we take each leaf (each of the `k` from the first expansion) and connect each to `k` new vertices. However, after connecting, the old leaves become non-leaves (they now have degree `k+1`?) but the new ones are leaves.\n\n   Actually, the rule says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices.\" (first step)\n\n   Then: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n   So the process:\n\n   Step 0: 1 vertex (degree 0? or wait, initially the graph has one vertex. Then we do the first expansion: the initial vertex is connected to k new ones. Then we do at least one more expansion (so step 1: the first expansion, and then step 2: the second expansion, etc.)\n\n   But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion from leaves must occur at least once. However, the very first expansion (from the center) is also specified.\n\n   Actually, the problem defines two distinct expansions:\n\n   - The initial expansion: from the center (which is the only vertex) we add k new vertices.\n\n   - Then, the next expansion (and possibly more) is from the leaves.\n\n   So the total number of expansion steps (including the initial one) is at least 1 (the initial expansion) and then at least one more (the condition)? Wait, no: the condition says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion from leaves must be done at least once. But the initial expansion is separate.\n\n   Let me re-read:\n\n   \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices.\" -> This is the first step.\n\n   Then: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" -> This is the second step and must be done at least once.\n\n   So the entire process has at least two steps? Actually, no: the initial expansion is the first step, and then the second step (expanding leaves) is the second expansion. But note: the initial expansion creates leaves (the k new ones) and then we must do at least one expansion from leaves.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal snowflake (for k=4) has:\n\n      Step0: 1\n      Step1: 1 + 4 = 5\n      Step2: 5 + 4*4 = 5 + 16 = 21? \n\n   But wait, the example says the smallest for k=4 is shown. Actually, the example output says:\n\n        Input: 6, 13, 15, 255, 10101, 1000000000000000000 are \"YES\"\n\n   Let's check n=6:\n\n        If we do two expansions (initial and then one from leaves):\n\n          Step0: 1\n          Step1: 1 + k = 1 + k\n          Step2: 1 + k + k*k\n\n        So for n=6: 1 + k + k*k = 6 -> k^2 + k + 1 = 6 -> k^2+k-5=0. Solving: k = (-1±sqrt(21))/2 -> not integer.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the initial expansion is considered as the first expansion and then the condition requires at least one more? Then the total steps must be at least 2.\n\n        But what if we consider:\n\n          Step0: 1\n          Step1: 1 + k\n          Step2: 1 + k + k*k\n          Step3: 1 + k + k*k + k*k^2? \n\n        Wait, no: in step2, we expanded each leaf (which are k in number) by k, so we add k*k. Then in step3, we would have to expand each leaf from step2. How many leaves are there in step2? In step2, the leaves are the k*k new vertices (since they were just added and have degree 1). Then we add k*(number of leaves in step2) = k*(k*k) = k^3.\n\n        So the general formula for r expansion steps (with r>=1, and note the condition requires at least one expansion from leaves, so r>=2) is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(r-1)   [but wait, the initial expansion is step1?]\n\n        Actually, let's index:\n\n          Step0: n0 = 1\n          Step1: n1 = 1 + k\n          Step2: n2 = 1 + k + k^2\n          Step3: n3 = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3\n\n        So the total number of vertices after r steps (where r>=1) is:\n\n          n = 1 + k * (k^0 + k^1 + ... + k^(r-1)) ? \n\n        Actually, no: the initial expansion (step1) adds k, then step2 adds k^2, then step3 adds k^3, etc.\n\n        So n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n\n        But note: the condition says we must do the expansion from leaves at least once. That means we must have at least two steps (so r>=2). However, note that the initial expansion is the first step and the expansion from leaves is the second step. So r must be at least 2.\n\n        But wait, the problem says:\n\n          \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices.\" (this is the first expansion)\n\n          \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" (this is the second expansion)\n\n        So the minimal snowflake has two expansions (steps). Then the total vertices would be:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2   (if we stop after the second expansion)\n\n        However, the problem does not say we stop after the second expansion. It says \"at least once\" for the second expansion, but we can do more. So the total number of vertices is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r   for some r >= 2? \n\n        Actually, note the condition: the second expansion (done at least once) is part of the process. But the first expansion is mandatory. Then the entire process must have at least two expansions.\n\n        But wait, the problem does not specify the number of expansions beyond the minimal. So we can have any number of expansions as long as at least one expansion from leaves is performed. So r (the exponent) must be at least 2 (meaning we have two expansions: the first and then at least one more).\n\n        However, note: the initial expansion is step 1 (r=1) and then we require at least one more (so r>=2). But wait, the example input 6 is \"NO\", but 13 is \"YES\". \n\n        Let's see:\n\n          n=13: 1 + k + k^2 = 13 -> k^2+k+1=13 -> k^2+k-12=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(49) )/2 = ( -1±7 )/2 -> k=3 or k=-4 -> k=3 is valid.\n\n          Then n=1+3+9=13 -> YES.\n\n        Now, what about n=6? We saw that with two steps we get 1+k+k^2=6 -> no integer solution. What if we use three steps? Then:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 = 6.\n\n          k^3 + k^2 + k + 1 = 6.\n\n          k=1: 1+1+1+1=4 -> too small.\n          k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 -> too big.\n\n          No solution.\n\n        Another possibility: perhaps the expansion steps are defined differently? Or maybe the first expansion is step0? \n\n        Let me think again:\n\n          Step0: 1 vertex.\n          Then we do the first expansion (which is the initial expansion): add k vertices. Now we have 1+k.\n\n          Then we do the second expansion: from the k leaves, each gets k new ones. Then we have 1+k+k*k.\n\n          Then we can do a third expansion: from the k*k leaves (each of the k*k new ones) we add k new ones per leaf, so we add k^3. Then total: 1+k+k^2+k^3.\n\n        So the formula for r expansions (starting from 0 being the initial state, then expansion step 1,2,...,r) is:\n\n          n = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(r-1))\n\n        Actually, wait: the first expansion (step1) adds k, the second (step2) adds k^2, the third (step3) adds k^3, etc. So:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r   (if we count the initial state as having 1, then after r expansions we have terms from k^0 to k^r? Actually, no: the initial state is 1 (which is k^0). Then the first expansion adds k (so k^1), the second adds k^2, and so on until k^r.\n\n        So the total number of vertices is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r   for some r>=1 (because we must do the initial expansion, and then at least one expansion from leaves, so actually the minimal is two terms: 1+k+k^2, but wait: the condition requires at least one expansion from leaves, so we must have at least two expansions? Actually, the condition says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion from leaves must be done at least once. The initial expansion is mandatory and then the expansion from leaves is the next step.\n\n        However, note: the initial expansion does not necessarily create leaves? Actually, the initial expansion creates k leaves. Then the condition requires that we do the expansion from leaves at least once.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of expansions is two: the initial expansion and then one expansion from leaves. So the minimal representation is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2\n\n        But wait, what if we do only the initial expansion? Then we have n = 1+k. However, the condition says the expansion from leaves must be done at least once. So the initial expansion alone is not enough. We must have at least two expansions (so two layers beyond the center). \n\n        However, note: the problem statement says:\n\n          \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices.\" (first expansion)\n\n          \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" (second expansion)\n\n        So the entire construction requires at least two expansions: the first expansion (from the center) and the second expansion (from the leaves). \n\n        Therefore, the minimal n is 1 + k + k^2, and k>1.\n\n        But wait, what about the possibility of having more than two expansions? Then n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r for some r>=2.\n\n        So the problem reduces to: does there exist an integer k>1 and an integer r>=2 such that:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n\n        However, note that the above geometric series formula:\n\n          n = (k^(r+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        But wait, the series is from k^0 to k^r, so:\n\n          n = (k^(r+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        However, note: our expansion steps:\n\n          Step0: 1 = (k^1 - 1)/(k-1) ? -> (k-1)/(k-1)=1, so yes.\n\n          Step1: 1+k = (k^2-1)/(k-1) -> (k^2-1)/(k-1)=k+1, correct.\n\n          Step2: 1+k+k^2 = (k^3-1)/(k-1) -> (k^3-1)/(k-1)=k^2+k+1, correct.\n\n        So indeed, n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) for some integer k>1 and integer r>=2 (since we need at least two expansions, so r+1>=3, i.e., exponents go up to r+1, and we require at least two expansions meaning the series goes up to k^2 at minimum).\n\n        However, note: the condition requires at least one expansion from leaves, which is the second expansion. The second expansion uses the leaves from the first expansion. So the minimal representation is two expansions (r=2, because the series then has terms from k^0 to k^2, and the exponent in the numerator is k^3). So:\n\n          n = (k^3 - 1) / (k-1) = k^2 + k + 1.\n\n        But wait, the problem does not specify the number of expansions. We can have more than two. So we are looking for:\n\n          n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)   for some integer k>1 and integer m>=3 (since m = r+1, and r>=2 so m>=3).\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the expansion steps are r (with r>=2), then the exponent is r+1? Actually, no: the series goes from 0 to r (inclusive), so the exponent in the numerator is k^(r+1). And r>=2, so exponent>=3.\n\n        However, note: the initial expansion is step1 (which gives m=2: because then n = (k^2-1)/(k-1)), but wait the condition requires at least one expansion from leaves, so we cannot stop at step1 (which is m=2). We must have m>=3.\n\n        Therefore, the problem is: given n (which can be as large as 10^18), is there an integer k>1 and an integer m>=3 such that:\n\n          n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        But note: k can be any integer greater than 1, and m can be any integer from 3 upwards.\n\n        However, note that m (the exponent) must be at least 3. Also, note that k must be an integer and k>1.\n\n        Example:\n\n          n=13: 13 = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k^2+k+1 -> k=3: 3^2+3+1=13 -> works.\n\n          n=15: 15 = (k^3-1)/(k-1) -> k^2+k+1=15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> k=(-1±sqrt(57))/2 -> not integer. But wait, maybe m=4?\n\n          For m=4: n = (k^4-1)/(k-1) = k^3+k^2+k+1 = 15.\n\n          k=2: 8+4+2+1=15 -> works.\n\n          So 15 is represented by k=2 and m=4.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"a snowflake with n vertices can exist\" if there exists ANY k>1 and ANY expansion steps (at least two expansions, i.e., m>=3) such that n = (k^m-1)/(k-1).\n\n        However, note: the expansion steps must be at least two, so m>=3. But we are allowing any m>=3.\n\n        So we have to check for a fixed n (up to 10^18) if there exists an integer k>1 and an integer m>=3 such that:\n\n          n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        How to solve this?\n\n        Note: the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n          n*(k-1) = k^m - 1\n\n        We are to find integers k>=2 and m>=3.\n\n        Since n can be as large as 10^18, we cannot iterate over all possible k and m.\n\n        Let's try to fix m (the exponent) and then solve for k.\n\n        But note: m is the exponent in the numerator (k^m). The minimal m is 3, and the maximum m?\n\n          For k>=2, k^m grows very fast. So m won't be very large.\n\n          For example, for k=2, 2^m: \n            m=3: 8, then n=(8-1)/(2-1)=7\n            m=4: 15\n            m=5: 31\n            m=6: 63\n            ...\n            until 2^m is about 10^18: m is about log2(10^18) ~ 60.\n\n        Similarly, for k=3, m=3: 27, then (27-1)/2=13; m=4: (81-1)/2=40, etc.\n\n        So m is at most around 60 (if k=2) and even less for larger k.\n\n        Therefore, we can iterate over m from 3 to about 60 (or until k^m exceeds n*(k-1)+1, but we don't know k). Alternatively, we can fix m and then solve for k.\n\n        However, note: the equation is:\n\n          n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        This is a polynomial in k of degree m-1. We can use binary search for k for a fixed m? But note: k must be an integer.\n\n        Alternatively, we can rearrange:\n\n          k^m = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n        We are looking for an integer k>=2.\n\n        How to find k for a fixed m?\n\n        We can note that k is roughly the m-th root of (n*(k-1)+1). But since k is at least 2, we can set a lower bound and an upper bound.\n\n        However, note that n can be as large as 10^18, and m is at most 60, so we can iterate over m from 3 to about 60, and for each m, we can solve for k.\n\n        But solving for k in:\n\n          k^m = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n        is not trivial. However, note that k must be an integer. We can use binary search for k for each fixed m, but the range of k might be very large.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider that for a fixed m, the function f(k) = (k^m - 1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>=2. So for a given m, we can try to find an integer k such that f(k)=n.\n\n        We can also note that k must be at least 2 and at most around n (if m=3, then k^3 = n*(k-1)+1, so k^3 is about n*k, so k^2 is about n, so k is about sqrt(n) for m=3, which is 10^9, too big to iterate).\n\n        We need a better way.\n\n        Observation: for fixed m, the equation is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1)\n\n        We can use the fact that k^m <= n*(k-1)+1 < n*k (since k>=2, then k-1 < k, so n*(k-1)+1 < n*k). Therefore, k^m < n*k, so k^(m-1) < n.\n\n        So for a fixed m, k must be less than the (m-1)-th root of n, but note: we have k^m <= n*k, so k^(m-1) <= n.\n\n        So k <= n^(1/(m-1))? Actually, from k^m <= n*k, then k^(m-1) <= n.\n\n        Therefore, k <= floor(n^(1/(m-1))). But note, n can be 10^18, and m>=3, so m-1>=2, and then k is at most around 10^9 (if m-1=2, then k<=sqrt(n)=10^9). But we cannot iterate k from 2 to 10^9 for each test case (we have up to 10^4 test cases) and for each m from 3 to 60. \n\n        Alternatively, we can for each test case and for each m from 3 to 60, try to find k by solving:\n\n          k^m = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        But note: the left side is k^m and the right side is n*k - n + 1. We can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] (but n is 10^18, so that is too big). However, we know k^(m-1) <= n, so k <= n**(1/(m-1)). For m=3, that's about 10^9, which is too many to iterate.\n\n        We need a smarter way.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        We are iterating over m from 3 to 60 (at most 58 values per test case). For each m, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, n**(1/(m-1))] (which for m=3 is [2, 10^9], which is too many to do a binary search for each m and for each test case? Because 10^9 is the upper bound for m=3, and we do 58 binary searches per test case, each taking about O(log(10^9)) which is about 30 steps. Then for each test case, we do 58*30 ~ 1740 steps, and we have up to 10^4 test cases -> 1740*10000 = 17.4e6, which is acceptable in Python? But wait, the upper bound for k is n**(1/(m-1)) and n can be up to 10^18. \n\n        However, note: for m=3, the upper bound is about 10^9, and we do a binary search from 2 to 10^9 (about 30 iterations). Then for m=4, the upper bound is n**(1/3) which is (10^18)^(1/3)=10^6, so 20 iterations. Then m=5: 10^18^(1/4)=10^4.5, so about 10^4.5, which is 31622, so about 15 iterations. \n\n        But note: the equation is not linear, and we are doing a binary search for k. The condition for a candidate k is:\n\n          (k^m - 1) // (k-1) == n\n\n        However, k^m might be very big (for m=60 and k=2, that's 2^60 which is about 1e18, which is the limit of n, so we have to compute k^m. But k is at most n**(1/(m-1)) and m>=3, so for m=3, k is up to 10^9, and then k^3 is 10^27 which is too big for standard integers? Actually, 10^27 is within the range of Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the exponentiation might be slow and the numbers very big). However, note that n is up to 10^18, so when m=3, k^3 = n*(k-1)+1. But k is about 10^9, then k^3 is 10^27, which is way bigger than n=10^18. \n\n        So we must avoid computing k^m when k is too big. \n\n        Alternatively, we can break the binary search when k^m becomes too big (greater than n*(k-1)+1) but we don't know k in advance.\n\n        We can use:\n\n          Condition: k^m <= n*(k-1)+1   (approximately, because we have equality)\n\n        But note: we are checking for exact equality.\n\n        However, we can use the fact that k is bounded by n**(1/(m-1)) (from k^(m-1) <= n). Then we can iterate over k from 2 to int(round(n**(1/(m-1)))) + 1? But that is too many.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use binary search for k for fixed m:\n\n          low = 2\n          high = 10**18  # but wait, we know k^(m-1) <= n, so we can set high = min(10**18, n**(1/(m-1))+1)\n\n        But we cannot compute n**(1/(m-1)) for n=10^18 and m=3 because that is 10^9, which is acceptable, but then for m=4: 10^6, etc.\n\n        Steps for fixed m:\n\n          Let low = 2, high = min(10**18, int(round(n**(1/(m-1)))) + 100)   [but wait, we cannot compute n**(1/(m-1)) for n=10^18 and m=3 by floating point because 10^18 is a big float and might lose precision?]\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          high = pow(n, 1/(m-1)) + 1   but using floating point may be imprecise for n=10^18 and m=3.\n\n        We can set:\n\n          high = 2\n          while (pow(high, m-1)) <= n:\n              high *= 2\n\n          Then we have an interval [2, high] and do binary search.\n\n        But note: the condition is k^(m-1) <= n, so k <= n**(1/(m-1)). We can set high to the smallest power of 2 that satisfies 2^(m-1) > n? Actually, we want an upper bound for k: k <= floor(n**(1/(m-1))). We can use:\n\n          high = 10**18   # worst-case, but we know k^(m-1) <= n, and n<=10^18, so k <= 10^18, but that is too high for binary search (log2(10^18) is about 60, which is acceptable for m=3, but for m=3, the actual k is about 10^9, so we can set:\n\n          low = 2\n          high = 10**9  # for m=3, but wait, we don't know m. Actually, for each m, we set a different high.\n\n        But note: for m=3, k is about the cube root of n? Actually, from the equation:\n\n          n = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k^2+k+1.\n\n          Then k^2 < n < k^3? Actually, k^2+k+1 is about k^2 for large k, so k is about sqrt(n). But wait, from k^2+k+1 = n, then k is about sqrt(n). \n\n        Actually, for m=3: n = k^2+k+1, so k^2 <= n < (k+1)^2? Not exactly, because (k+1)^2 = k^2+2k+1, and n = k^2+k+1, so n is between k^2 and (k+1)^2.\n\n        So for m=3, k is about sqrt(n). For n=10^18, k is about 10^9. Then we cannot iterate from 2 to 10^9.\n\n        We must use binary search for k for each fixed m.\n\n        Steps for fixed m (from 3 to 60) and for a given n:\n\n          Step 1: Determine an upper bound for k: since k^(m-1) <= n, then k <= n**(1/(m-1)). We can set:\n\n            low_k = 2\n            high_k = 10**18  # but we know k^(m-1) <= n, so we can set high_k = min(10**18, int(n**(1/(m-1))) + 100)   # but n**(1/(m-1)) might be fractional.\n\n          However, we can use:\n\n            high_k = 2\n            while (high_k ** (m-1)) <= n:\n                high_k *= 2\n\n          Then we have an interval [low_k, high_k] for k.\n\n          Then we do binary search in [low_k, high_k] for k such that:\n\n            (k**m - 1) // (k-1) == n\n\n          But note: k**m might be too big to compute exactly (for k=10^9 and m=3, we get 10^27, which is a big number but Python can handle). However, we are only doing about 58 * (log2(high_k)) evaluations per test case. The worst-case for m=3: high_k is about 2^ceil(log2(10^9)) which is about 2^30 (about 1e9) so we do about 30 iterations for m=3. For m=4, we double until (high_k^3) <= n, and n=10^18, so high_k starts at 2, then 4,8,..., until 8 (8^3=512<=1e18, then 16, 32, ... until 1e6 (because (1e6)^3=1e18, so we double until high_k is about 2^20 which is 1e6, so about 20 steps). \n\n          Then for each candidate k, we compute:\n\n            term = (k**m - 1) // (k-1)\n\n          But wait, k**m might be very big (like for m=60, k=2, then 2**60 is about 1e18, which is acceptable, but if k is 10^6 and m=60, that number is astronomical). \n\n        We must avoid computing k**m for very large k and m.\n\n        Alternative approach: we are trying to check if there exists k and m such that n = (k^m-1)/(k-1). \n\n        There is another representation: \n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1)\n\n        We can use a loop for the powers, but m is the exponent, so we are iterating over m from 3 to 60, and for each m, we can use a loop to compute the sum of the geometric series without using exponentiation (by repeated multiplication) but then we are still iterating over k? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that the geometric series can be computed by:\n\n          s = 1\n          term = 1\n          for i in range(1, m):\n              term *= k\n              s += term\n\n        But then we are still iterating over k (which is the variable we are searching for) and we don't know k.\n\n        We can use the binary search for k and then for each candidate k, compute the geometric series by repeated multiplication (without using exponentiation, which might be faster and avoids huge numbers? Actually, for m=60, we do 60 multiplications, which is acceptable).\n\n        But note: we are doing binary search for k (about 30-20 steps per m) and for each candidate k we do m-1 multiplications. Then for each test case and each m (58 values) we do about (number of binary search steps) * m. The worst-case m is 60, and the binary search steps is about 60 (if m=3, we do about 30 steps, each step does 2 multiplications (for m=3: two terms) so 30*2=60 operations). Then for m=4, about 20 steps, each step does 3 multiplications -> 60. Then for m=60, we do about log2(upper_bound) steps (which is about 60 for m=3, but for m=60 the upper_bound is very small because k^59 <= n, so k is very small). \n\n        But wait, for m=60, k is at most n**(1/59). For n=10^18, 10^18^(1/59) is about 10^(18/59) ~ 10^0.305, so k is about 2 (because 2^59 is about 5e17, and 3^59 is way too big). So for m=60, we only need to check k=2.\n\n        Therefore, the overall complexity is acceptable.\n\n        Steps for one test case:\n\n          t = number of test cases (given)\n\n          For each test case with n:\n\n            if n==1: \n                # Then we require at least two expansions? Actually, the minimal expansion is two, so n=1 is the initial state (one vertex) but we haven't done the initial expansion. The initial expansion requires k>1 and then we must do at least one expansion from leaves. So n=1 is not allowed? \n                # According to the problem: the initial expansion is mandatory and then the expansion from leaves is mandatory. So we must have at least two expansions? Then n>=1+k+k^2 (with k>=2) -> minimum n=1+2+4=7. \n                # However, wait: the problem says the initial expansion is the first step (adding k new vertices) and then the expansion from leaves (at least once). So the minimal n is 1+k+k^2, which for k=2 is 7. \n                # But the example input includes 1,2,3,6,13,15,255,10101,1000000000000000000.\n\n                # The example output: \n                #   1 -> \"NO\"\n                #   2 -> \"NO\"\n                #  ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single vertex (the center). Each subsequent layer adds \\( k \\) new vertices to each vertex in the previous layer that has only one connection (a leaf). The construction must include at least two expansion steps: the initial expansion from the center and at least one expansion from leaves.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the total number of vertices \\( n \\) in the snowflake graph must satisfy the equation \\( n = \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\) and integer \\( m \\geq 3 \\). This equation represents a geometric series where each term corresponds to the vertices added in each expansion step.\n2. **Insight**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists any \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 3 \\) such that the above equation holds. Given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we can limit our search for \\( m \\) to values up to 60 because \\( 2^{60} \\) exceeds \\( 10^{18} \\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case, iterate over possible values of \\( m \\) (from 3 to 60). For each \\( m \\), perform a binary search to find an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} \\). The binary search bounds are determined by the constraint \\( k^{m-1} \\leq n \\).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks each test case by leveraging binary search for each \\( m \\). The number of operations per test case is manageable due to the logarithmic nature of binary search and the limited range of \\( m \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n_val = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        \n        if n_val == 1:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        if n_val >= 7:\n            for m in range(3, 61):\n                low_k = 2\n                high_k = 2\n                while (high_k ** (m-1)) <= n_val:\n                    high_k *= 2\n                    \n                while low_k <= high_k:\n                    mid_k = (low_k + high_k) // 2\n                    try:\n                        s = 1\n                        term = 1\n                        for i in range(1, m):\n                            term *= mid_k\n                            s += term\n                    except OverflowError:\n                        s = None\n                        break\n                    \n                    if s == n_val:\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                    elif s < n_val:\n                        low_k = mid_k + 1\n                    else:\n                        high_k = mid_k - 1\n                        \n                if found:\n                    break\n                    \n        else:\n            found = False\n            \n        if found:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Handling Small \\( n \\)**: If \\( n \\) is 1 or less than 7, it's impossible to form a valid snowflake graph (since the minimal graph requires at least 7 vertices for \\( k=2 \\)).\n3. **Binary Search for Valid \\( k \\)**: For each possible exponent \\( m \\) (from 3 to 60), the algorithm performs a binary search to find an integer \\( k \\) such that the sum of the geometric series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^{m-1} \\) equals \\( n \\).
