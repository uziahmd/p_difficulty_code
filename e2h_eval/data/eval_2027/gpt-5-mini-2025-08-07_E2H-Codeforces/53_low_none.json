Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Analyzing input structure**\n\nIt looks like I need to handle multiple lines of input, which might indicate multiple test cases. The problem is likely from CSES titled \"Longest Repeated Substring,\" but the examples suggest that there are three inputs resulting in three outputs.\n\nThe first line contains the string, and I assume I should read until EOF. For each non-empty line, I need to compute the longest substring that appears at least twice, including overlapping ones. For strings up to length 100, I can try a brute-force method with sets or dictionaries to check for duplicates efficiently, considering the time complexity.",
