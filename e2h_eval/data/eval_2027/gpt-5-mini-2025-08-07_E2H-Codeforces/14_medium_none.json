He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Implementing zero function logic**\n\nI’m working on the function `zeros(n)` that sums the floor division by 5 repeatedly. For the upper bound, I’ll use `5 * (m + 1)`, ensuring to cover all cases efficiently. I need to determine minimal `n` such that `zeros(n) >= m`. Using binary search, I’ll adjust the `low` and `high` until I find this value. I have to be careful about edge cases, especially since the requirements say `m >= 1`, though I can handle `m = 0` in the code. I'll ensure the output format is precise too!",
