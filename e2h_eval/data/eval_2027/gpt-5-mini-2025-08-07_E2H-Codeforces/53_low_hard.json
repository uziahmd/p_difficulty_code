Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing substring problem**\n\nI’m thinking about whether we need to handle multiple test cases, as the sample suggests a list of inputs and outputs while the original problem seems to focus on a single string. It seems we should compute the longest duplicated substring length for each line of input. To do this, I might consider a brute force approach to check all possible substrings, but I’ll need to handle overlapping counts carefully. It looks like a worst-case complexity of O(n^3) could be acceptable for n up to 100.",
