Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Planning Python Script**\n\nI need to write a Python script that reads input from stdin, which could involve multiple test cases. The example given shows input like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and outputs such as ['0','3','2']. It seems I’ll need to handle each line separately and calculate the length of the longest substring appearing at least twice, even with overlaps. With a maximum length of 100, a naive O(n^3) approach should work; I'll use sets to track substrings efficiently during iteration.",
