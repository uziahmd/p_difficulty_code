They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

But brute divisors may be many.\n    # Better: For each connected component, choose a node and try candidate values derived from its incident edges: for edge (u,v,g,l), a_u must divide g*l and be multiple of g. So candidates are divisors of g*l that are multiples of g and <=1e6. Intersection across edges too complex; but degree small average.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)\n    vis = [False]*n\n    res = [0]*n\n    from math import gcd\n    def get_divisors_of_gl(g,l):\n        prod = g*l\n        # get divisors of prod that are multiples of g and <=1e6\n        divs = [1]\n        tmp = prod\n        pf = {}\n        while tmp>1:\n            p = spf[tmp]\n            cnt=0\n            while tmp%p==0:\n                tmp//=p; cnt+=1\n            pf[p]=cnt\n        for p,c in pf.items():\n            cur=[]\n            powp=1\n            for e in range(c+1):\n                for d in divs:\n                    cur.append(d*powp)\n                powp*=p\n            divs = cur\n        out = []\n        for d in divs:\n            if d%g==0 and d<=MAXA:\n                out.append(d)\n        return out\n    for i in range(n):\n        if vis[i]: continue\n        # build component nodes\n        comp=[]\n        dq=deque([i]); vis[i]=True\n        while dq:\n            u=dq.popleft(); comp.append(u)\n            for v,_ in adj_e[u]:\n                if not vis[v]:\n                    vis[v]=True; dq.append(v)\n        # collect candidate seeds for node comp[0]\n        root = comp[0]\n        # collect constraints edges incident to root\n        cand_set = None\n        for v,idx in adj_e[root]:\n            u,vv,g,l = edges[idx]\n            dlist = get_divisors_of_gl(g,l)\n            # for each divisor d that's <=1e6 and is value for root\n            # but need to know which side root corresponds in edge: if root==u then a_root must be divisor as above, else same\n            s = set(dlist)\n            if cand_set is None:\n                cand_set = s\n            else:\n                cand_set &= s\n            if not cand_set:\n                break\n        if cand_set is None:\n            # isolated node no edges: can assign 1\n            res[root]=1\n            for u in comp:\n                res[u]=1\n            continue\n        if not cand_set:\n            print(\"NO\"); return\n        tried = False\n        for seed in sorted(cand_set):\n            # BFS assign\n            ok_comp = True\n            assigned_local = {}\n            q = deque([root])\n            assigned_local[root]=seed\n            while q and ok_comp:\n                u = q.popleft()\n                au = assigned_local[u]\n                for v,idx in adj_e[u]:\n                    uu,vv,g,l = edges[idx]\n                    other = v\n                    # compute av\n                    prod = g*l\n                    if prod % au != 0:\n                        ok_comp=False; break\n                    av = prod//au\n                    if av>MAXA or av<1:\n                        ok_comp=False; break\n                    if au % g != 0 or av % g != 0:\n                        ok_comp=False; break\n                    if (au*av)!=prod:\n                        ok_comp=False; break\n                    if gcd(au,av)!=g:\n                        ok_comp=False; break\n                    if (au*av)//g != l:\n                        pass\n                    if other in assigned_local:\n                        if assigned_local[other]!=av:\n                            ok_comp=False; break\n                    else:\n                        assigned_local[other]=av\n                        q.append(other)\n            if ok_comp:\n                for u,val in assigned_local.items():\n                    res[u]=val\n                # for any nodes in comp not assigned (isolated in component?), set 1\n                for u in comp:\n                    if res[u]==0:\n                        res[u]=1\n                tried = True\n                break\n        if not tried:\n            print(\"NO\"); return\n    # final verify all edges\n    for u,v,g,l in edges:\n        au=res[u]; av=res[v]\n        from math import gcd\n        if gcd(au,av)!=g or (au*av)!=(g*l):\n            print(\"NO\"); return\n        if au<1 or au>MAXA or av<1 or av>MAXA:\n            print(\"NO\"); return\n    print(\"YES\")\n    print(\" \".join(str(x if x!=0 else 1) for x in res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
