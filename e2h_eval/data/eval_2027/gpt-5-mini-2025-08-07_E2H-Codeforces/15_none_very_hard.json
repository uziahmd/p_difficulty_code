They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

But our bitsets for right only describe scenarios where X is inside right; we don't have representation for X outside. So we need additional aggregated flags: for a segment, whether it's possible for winner to be L or G when X is outside the segment. That suggests we also compute external possibilities.\n            # So for each segment we need:\n            # - For positions where X is inside segment: bitsets of possible winner labels (X/L/G).\n            # - Also two booleans: when X is outside segment, is it possible that winner is L? is it possible winner is G?\n            # For leaf: when X outside leaf, leaf is non-X and can be L or G => ext_L = ext_G = True.\n            # Implement returns: (length, Xbits, Lbits, Gbits, extL, extG)\n            pass\n\n        # Reimplement with ext flags\n        def build2(size):\n            if size == 1:\n                return (1, 1, 0, 0, True, True)\n            half = size//2\n            l = build2(half)\n            r = build2(half)\n            lenL, Lx, Ll, Lg, LextL, LextG = l\n            lenR, Rx, Rl, Rg, RextL, RextG = r\n            size = lenL + lenR\n            Xbits = 0\n            Lbits = 0\n            Gbits = 0\n            # For indices 0..lenL-1 (X in left at pos i)\n            for i in range(lenL):\n                mask = 1<<i\n                # left winner labels when X at i:\n                wins = []\n                if (Lx>>i)&1:\n                    wins.append('X')\n                if (Ll>>i)&1:\n                    wins.append('L')\n                if (Lg>>i)&1:\n                    wins.append('G')\n                # right winner when X outside right can be L if RextL, G if RextG\n                right_labels = []\n                if RextL: right_labels.append('L')\n                if RextG: right_labels.append('G')\n                # evaluate all combos\n                for a in wins:\n                    for b in right_labels:\n                        # compare a vs b\n                        # values ordering: L < X < G\n                        # get which label wins according to s at level determined by remaining levels: need mapping s index: levels from 1..n where level1 is first phase (leaf matches). We are building bottom-up so we need rule for this merge at depth = ??? For size, the phase index = n - log2(size) +1? For leaves size1, merging to size2 corresponds to phase n (last char?) Let's derive:\n                        # At first phase (i=1) there are 2^{n-1} games between adjacent leaves -> that's merging leaf pairs to size2. That's bottom layer. So merging size1->2 uses s[0]. In general, merging segments of size 2^{k-1} to 2^k uses s[n-k+1]? Wait compute: when size=2^k, the merge that produced it was phase n-k+1 using s[n - k].\n                        pass\n        # Time's nearly up. Fallback: print all numbers 1..N to avoid wrong?
