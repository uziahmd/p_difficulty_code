Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me think about the properties of regular polygons. In a regular n-gon, each interior angle is (n-2)*180/(n) degrees. Wait, but that's for the internal angles of the polygon itself. However, here we're talking about angles formed by selecting three vertices. So maybe I need to find the measure of the angle formed when choosing three points.\n\nLet me recall that in a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. But when you pick three points, the angle at the middle point depends on how many steps apart the other points are.\n\nFor example, in a regular polygon, if we have three vertices v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the vertex of the angle. Suppose there are k steps between v1 and v2, and m steps between v3 and v2. Wait, no. Actually, since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 depends on how many edges are skipped between v1 and v2 and between v3 and v2. Wait, perhaps the key is to find the number of sides between v1 and v2 along the perimeter, and similarly between v3 and v2.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v2 and between v3 and v2. Let me think: for example, in a regular pentagon (5 sides), if I pick three consecutive vertices, say 1,2,3. The angle at 2 would be the internal angle of the pentagon, which is (5-2)*180/5 = 108 degrees. But if I pick vertices 1,2,4, then the angle at 2 would be different.\n\nWait, maybe there's a formula here. Let's consider that for a regular n-gon, the angle formed at vertex v2 by two other vertices v1 and v3 depends on the number of sides between them. Let me think of the polygon as being inscribed in a circle. Then, the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle. Wait, but the angle formed by three points on a circle. For example, if the arc between v1 and v3 (passing through the opposite side of the circle from v2) is some number of steps, then the angle at v2 would be half of that arc's measure.\n\nWait, here's a thought: in a regular polygon, each vertex lies on a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 2π/n radians, or 360/n degrees. Now, if I have three points v1, v2, v3 arranged such that v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the angle. Then, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Because the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle subtended by that arc.\n\nSo, suppose there are k steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2. Then, the central angle for that arc would be k*(360/n) degrees. The inscribed angle would be half that, so (k * 180)/n degrees. However, since the polygon is convex, the arc that doesn't contain v2 must be less than 180 degrees. Wait, no. Wait, in a regular polygon, the arc between two vertices can be measured in two directions. The angle at v2 is determined by the arc that is opposite to the angle. For example, if you have three points on a circle, the angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. So, for that arc to be valid, the arc must be less than 180 degrees? No, because if it's more than 180 degrees, then the inscribed angle would be more than 90 degrees. Wait, but in a regular polygon, the angle formed by three vertices can vary depending on how far apart they are.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem, the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the number of vertices between v1 and v3. Let me think again. Let's say that between v1 and v3, there are m steps when moving clockwise around the polygon. But since the polygon is regular, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not pass through v2 would determine the angle.\n\nAlternatively, for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 can be determined by the number of edges between v1 and v2 and between v3 and v2. Let me think of the following: suppose that between v1 and v2, there are k edges in one direction, and between v3 and v2, there are l edges in the other direction. But since the polygon is regular, the angle depends on how many steps are between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. Let me look up the formula for the angle formed by three vertices of a regular polygon. \n\nAfter some research, I recall that for a regular polygon with n sides, the measure of the angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 (with v2 as the vertex) can be calculated as follows: \n\nThe angle is equal to ((n - 2k) * 180) / (2n) degrees, where k is the number of sides between v1 and v3 when moving along the perimeter. Or perhaps another formula.\n\nAlternatively, think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a unit circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is θ = 2π/n radians. Suppose we have three points A, B, C on the circle. The angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. So, the measure of angle ABC is (arc AC) / 2. \n\nSo, for example, in a regular polygon, if the arc AC (not containing B) spans m steps (each step is θ), then the arc length is m * θ. The angle ABC is (m * θ) / 2. \n\nSince θ is 2π/n radians, then the angle is m * π / n radians. Converting that to degrees, it's m * 180 / n degrees. \n\nBut wait, what is m here? For example, in a regular pentagon (n=5), if we take three consecutive vertices A, B, C. Then, the arc AC that doesn't contain B is 2 steps (since between A and C, there are two edges). So m=2. Then the angle ABC would be (2 * 180)/5 = 72 degrees. But wait, the internal angle of the pentagon is 108 degrees. So this seems conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, no. Because when you take three consecutive vertices, the angle at B is the internal angle of the polygon. But according to the formula above, if the arc AC (not containing B) is 2 steps, which is 2 * 360/5 = 144 degrees. Then the angle ABC is half of that, 72 degrees. But that contradicts with the known internal angle of 108 degrees. So clearly, my understanding is wrong here. Where's the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the arcs. Let me think again. The angle ABC is an inscribed angle. The arc that it subtends is the arc AC that does NOT contain B. But in the case of three consecutive vertices A, B, C, the arc AC that does not contain B would be the arc that goes the other way around the circle. For example, in a pentagon, the arc AC that does not contain B would be three steps (since the total number of steps between A and C is two steps in one direction, and three steps in the other). So m is 3 steps. Then, the arc length is 3 * 360/5 = 216 degrees. The angle ABC would be half that, 108 degrees, which matches the internal angle. So that makes sense.\n\nAh! So the key is that m is the number of steps between A and C in the arc that does not contain B. Therefore, for the three consecutive points A, B, C, the arc AC not containing B is three steps (since the polygon has five vertices). So m = n - (steps between A and C in the other direction). So how do we compute m?\n\nIn general, given three points A, B, C, with B being the vertex of the angle, the number of steps between A and C along the arc that does not contain B is equal to (n - k), where k is the number of steps between A and C along the arc that contains B. But how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, for any three distinct vertices, the angle at B is determined by the number of vertices between A and C when moving around the polygon in the direction that does not pass through B. \n\nBut perhaps there's a formula for this. Let me think again. The angle at B is equal to ( (number of steps between A and C along the arc that does not contain B) * 180 ) / n degrees. Because the arc length is that number of steps multiplied by 360/n degrees, and the angle is half of that. \n\nSo, for example, in the pentagon case, when A, B, C are consecutive, the arc AC not containing B is three steps. Then the angle is (3 * 180)/5 = 108 degrees, which matches.\n\nAnother example: square (n=4). If we take A, B, D, then the arc AD not containing B is two steps (since the square has four vertices. Between A and D, if you go the other way around the square, passing through C, that's two steps. The angle at B would be (2*180)/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct, as the angle between adjacent vertices is 90 degrees. Wait, but if you have A, B, D in a square, then the angle at B is between BA and BD. Let me imagine a square with vertices labeled 1,2,3,4 clockwise. If A is 1, B is 2, D is 4. Then BA is from 2 to 1, BD is from 2 to 4. The angle between BA and BD is 90 degrees. Which matches the formula.\n\nAnother example: in a square, if we take vertices 1,2,3. Then the arc between 1 and 3 not containing 2 is two steps (the arc from 1 to 3 via 4). So the angle at 2 is (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct, since the internal angle is 90 degrees. But if we take vertices 1, 2, 4, then the arc between 1 and 4 not containing 2 is 2 steps (from 1 to 4 via 3?), no. Wait, in square, vertices are 1,2,3,4. Between 1 and 4, the arc that doesn't contain 2 is the one that goes through 3, which is one step (from 1 to 4 directly? No. Wait, the steps between 1 and 4 in the square: moving clockwise, it's three steps (1→2→3→4). But moving counter-clockwise, it's one step (1→4). So the arc that doesn't contain 2 would be the shorter arc. Wait, but in this case, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is the one that is one step long. So the number of steps is 1. Then the angle at B (which is 2) would be (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. Which matches the example in the problem statement where a square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles.\n\nSo yes, this formula seems correct. The angle at vertex B is (m * 180)/n degrees, where m is the number of steps between A and C along the arc that does not contain B. And m can be calculated as (number of steps between A and C along the arc that doesn't contain B). \n\nNow, the question is, given n and a, how to find three vertices such that this angle is as close as possible to a. Also, note that m must be at least 1 and at most n-2. Because if m is 1, then the arc between A and C is one step, meaning A and C are adjacent. If m is n-2, then the arc is n-2 steps, which would be the same as one step in the other direction (since the total steps around the polygon is n steps). Wait, for example, n=5, m can be up to 5-2=3 steps. Which is the maximum possible for the arc that doesn't contain B. Because if m was 4 steps, then that arc would contain B. So the possible values of m are from 1 to n-2. \n\nBut for a given m, the angle is (m * 180)/n. So the problem reduces to finding an m such that this value is as close as possible to a. Then, once we find the optimal m, we can choose three vertices accordingly.\n\nSo, first step: find the m that minimizes |(m * 180 / n) - a|. Once we have that m, we can select any three vertices that form such an angle.\n\nBut how to find m?\n\nLet me think. The possible values of m are integers between 1 and n-2. For each m, the angle is (m * 180)/n. We need to find the m that makes this angle closest to a.\n\nBut since a can be up to 180, and for m up to n-2, the maximum angle would be ((n-2)*180)/n. For example, when n=3, the maximum is (1 * 180)/3 = 60 degrees. Which is correct for a triangle. For n=4, ((4-2)*180)/4 = 90 degrees. For n=5, (3 * 180)/5 = 108 degrees. So for larger n, the maximum angle increases. For example, when n approaches infinity, the maximum angle approaches 180 degrees. So for any given a, there's an optimal m.\n\nBut how to find the best m?\n\nLet me consider that for each m, the angle is (m * 180)/n. Let's denote this as angle(m) = (m * 180)/n. We need to find m in [1, n-2] such that |angle(m) - a| is minimized.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Compute for all possible m in 1..n-2, the value of angle(m), and find the m that gives the minimal difference to a.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e5, iterating through all possible m is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e5. But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think.\n\nWe can compute the ideal m that would make angle(m) exactly equal to a. Solving for m:\n\nm = (a * n) / 180\n\nBut m has to be an integer between 1 and n-2. So we can compute the real value of m, then check the floor and ceiling of that value, and see which gives the closest angle.\n\nSo for example, let's compute m_candidate = (a * n) / 180. Then check m_floor = floor(m_candidate), m_ceil = ceil(m_candidate), and possibly m_floor-1 and m_floor+1 if they are within the valid range. Then among these candidates, find the one that gives the minimal difference.\n\nBut since m must be between 1 and n-2, we need to clamp the candidate m values to this range.\n\nThis approach would be O(1) time, which is better than O(n).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute m_candidate = (a * n) / 180. Then check m_floor and m_ceil (and possibly nearby values) to find the best m.\n\nOnce we find the best m, then we can construct the three vertices.\n\nNow, the next step is to find three vertices that form this angle. How?\n\nOnce m is determined, the arc between A and C (not containing B) has m steps. So, for example, if we fix B as vertex 1, then A and C can be placed m steps apart. But how to arrange this?\n\nLet me think. Let's pick B as vertex 2. Then, A and C should be placed such that the arc between them (not containing B) is m steps. How to find their positions?\n\nAlternatively, for any B, we can choose A and C such that there are exactly m steps between them along the arc that does not contain B. For example, if B is vertex 2, then A could be vertex 1, and C could be vertex (1 + m + 1) mod n? Not sure. Maybe it's easier to pick B as vertex 1, then A as vertex 2, and C as vertex (2 + m) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to pick B as vertex 1. Then, A can be vertex 2, and C can be vertex (m + 2). But wait, the arc between A and C that doesn't contain B must be m steps. So if B is vertex 1, and A is vertex 2, then C should be vertex (2 + m) steps away from A in the direction that does not include B. Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in order to have an arc of m steps between A and C not containing B, we can arrange the three points such that B is between A and C when moving around the polygon in the other direction. For example, if we have B as a vertex, then A is k steps clockwise from B, and C is k steps counter-clockwise from B. Then, the arc between A and C that does not contain B would be m steps, where m = (n - 2k) steps. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the number of steps between A and C along the arc not containing B is m. So, the arc between A and C that does not contain B is m steps. Then, the arc that contains B is (n - m) steps. Since the total number of steps between A and C along the entire circle is n steps (since it's a polygon). But the arc between A and C can be split into two parts: one that contains B and one that does not. The sum of their lengths is n steps. So, the arc that does not contain B is m steps, and the one that contains B is (n - m) steps.\n\nSo, for example, if we want to have B between A and C along the arc that contains B (so that the arc not containing B is m steps), then the positions of A and C can be placed such that between them, along the arc that contains B, there are (n - m) steps. Which would mean that between A and C, there are (n - m) steps passing through B.\n\nBut how to arrange this? Let me think of a simple example. Let's say n=5, m=2. Then, the arc between A and C not containing B is 2 steps. The arc containing B is 5-2=3 steps. So, for example, if B is vertex 1, then A and C can be placed such that moving from A to C through B takes 3 steps. Let's pick A as vertex 2. Then, moving clockwise from A (vertex 2) through B (vertex 1) to C would take 3 steps. Wait, vertex 2 to 1 is one step, then 1 to 5 is another, then 5 to 4 is third. So C would be vertex 4. Then, the arc from A (2) to C (4) that contains B (1) is 3 steps. The arc that does not contain B is from 2 to 4 via 3, which is 2 steps. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for this example, the three vertices are 2, 1, 4. The angle at B (vertex 1) is 2*180/5 = 72 degrees.\n\nSo, the way to construct such a triplet is: choose B as any vertex. Then, choose A as B's next vertex (clockwise), and C as A's (m)th vertex in the clockwise direction. Or perhaps another way.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can choose B as vertex 1, A as vertex 2, and C as vertex (2 + m). But wait, in the example where n=5, m=2, then C would be 2 + 2 = 4. Which matches the example. So that seems to work.\n\nWait, but in that case, the arc between A (2) and C (4) that does not contain B (1) is 2 steps (2→3→4). Which is correct. So yes, that seems to be a valid approach.\n\nBut what if m is larger than n-2? Well, since m is chosen between 1 and n-2, that's not possible.\n\nSo, the general approach is: once m is determined, then for any B, we can set A as B's next vertex (say, B is vertex x, then A is x+1), and C is A + m steps. But since the polygon is cyclic, we need to handle the indices modulo n.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's choose B as vertex 1. Then, A is vertex 2. Then, C is vertex 2 + m. But wait, 2 + m may be larger than n. So, for example, if n=5, m=3, then C is 2+3=5. Which is correct. The arc between A (2) and C (5) that does not contain B (1) would be 3 steps (2→3→4→5). Which gives angle 3*180/5 = 108 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the triplet would be A=2, B=1, C=5. But wait, the angle is at B, which is 1. The angle is formed by A (2), B (1), C (5). So the output would be 2 1 5. But according to the problem statement, the output requires three distinct vertices, which they are.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, for example, when n=4 and a=67, the output is 2 1 3. Let's check what m that corresponds to. For n=4, the angle is (m*180)/4. The sample says that for a=67, the closest is 45 degrees (m=1). So m=1. So the triplet would be A=2, B=1, C=2+1=3. Which gives 2 1 3. Which matches the sample output. So yes, this approach works.\n\nAnother example from the sample input: when n=4 and a=68, the optimal is m=2 (since 2*180/4=90 degrees, which is closer to 68 than 45). Then, the triplet would be A=2, B=1, C=2+2=4. So the triplet is 2 1 4. Which is one of the possible outputs listed in the note.\n\nSo, this approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute m_candidate = (a * n) / 180. Since m must be integer, check m_floor and m_ceil, etc.\n\nBut wait, since the angle is (m * 180)/n, and a is given, the equation is:\n\nFind m such that (m * 180)/n is as close as possible to a.\n\nSo solving for m: m = (a * n) / 180.\n\nBut since m must be integer between 1 and n-2, we need to find the integer m closest to this value.\n\nBut since m can be fractional, we can compute the candidate m's around that value.\n\nSo, the algorithm for finding m is:\n\nCompute m_real = (a * n) / 180.\n\nThen, the possible m's are floor(m_real), ceil(m_real), and maybe floor(m_real)-1, etc., but clamped to the valid range [1, n-2].\n\nOnce we find the best m, then we can generate the triplet as follows:\n\nChoose B as vertex 1. Then, A is vertex 2. C is vertex (2 + m). However, since the polygon is cyclic, if 2 + m exceeds n, then it wraps around. Wait, but since m is at most n-2, 2 + m can be up to 2 + (n-2) = n. So, for example, if m is n-2, then 2 + m = n. Which is valid.\n\nSo, the triplet would be (A, B, C) = (2, 1, 2 + m). But since the problem allows any triplet that satisfies the condition, this is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the first sample input, n=3, a=15. Then m_real = (15 * 3)/180 = 0.25. So the possible m's are 0 (invalid) and 1. Since m must be >=1, the only option is m=1. Then the triplet is 2, 1, 2 + 1 = 3. So the triplet is 2 1 3. But the sample output is 1 2 3. Which is also acceptable. Because the problem allows any triplet, and the angle is the same.\n\nSo, in this case, the code could generate 2 1 3, which is a valid answer. However, the sample output is 1 2 3. But that's also valid. How?\n\nBecause the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex. For the triplet 1 2 3, the angle is at vertex 2. Let's compute m for this case. For n=3, the arc between 1 and 3 not containing 2 is 1 step (since the polygon is a triangle). So m=1. So the angle is (1*180)/3 = 60 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code's approach of choosing B as 1, and A as 2, and C as 2 + m gives a valid triplet. But the sample uses a different triplet. However, the problem allows any valid triplet, so the code's approach is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed with generating triplets as (2, 1, 2 + m), but perhaps there are other ways. However, the code needs to output three distinct vertices. So the code can generate that triplet, and that should be acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the best m, then generate the triplet.\n\nBut there's a catch. For example, when the optimal m is not unique. For instance, if two different m's give the same minimal difference. How to choose between them? According to the problem statement, any of them is acceptable.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute the possible m's that minimize the difference between (m * 180)/n and a.\n\nOnce m is determined, generate the triplet (2, 1, 2 + m). However, when 2 + m exceeds n, it's okay as long as it's modulo n? No, because for example, if n=5 and m=3, then 2 + 3 = 5, which is valid. But if m=4, then 2 + 4 = 6, but n=5, so 6 mod 5 is 1. However, m can't be 4 in this case because for n=5, m can be up to 5-2=3. So the code ensures m is between 1 and n-2, so 2 + m will be at most 2 + (n-2) = n, which is valid.\n\nSo the triplet is (2, 1, 2 + m). But the problem allows any triplet. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut what if the code chooses m=0? Well, since m ranges from 1 to n-2, the code ensures that m is in that range.\n\nNow, the code needs to find the best m. Let's think about the code steps.\n\nFirst, compute m_real = (a * n) / 180.0. Then, possible candidates are floor(m_real), ceil(m_real). Also, check if m_real is exactly integer, then that's the candidate. Also, need to check if m_real is outside the valid range, so clamp to 1 or n-2.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nFor example, if m_real is less than 1, then the best m is 1. If m_real is larger than n-2, then the best m is n-2.\n\nOnce we have the candidate m's, we need to check all possible m's around m_real and find the one that gives the minimal difference.\n\nBut perhaps the code can generate a few candidates (like m_floor, m_ceil, m_floor-1, m_ceil+1) and select the best among them.\n\nAlternatively, generate all possible candidates in the vicinity of m_real, and select the best.\n\nSo here's the code logic for finding m:\n\nCompute m_real = a * n / 180.0\n\ncandidates = set()\n\ncandidates.add(math.floor(m_real))\n\ncandidates.add(math.ceil(m_real))\n\ncandidates.add(math.floor(m_real) - 1)\n\ncandidates.add(math.ceil(m_real) + 1)\n\nThen, for each candidate, check if it's in [1, n-2]. Then, compute for each candidate m in this set, the absolute difference between (m * 180)/n and a. Choose the m with the minimal difference. If there's a tie, choose any.\n\nOnce m is found, generate the triplet.\n\nBut perhaps even better, generate all possible m's in the range [max(1, floor(m_real) - 1), min(n-2, ceil(m_real) + 1)] and check them all. Since this is a small range, it's manageable.\n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps the following steps:\n\nCompute m_candidate = round(a * n / 180). Then check m_candidate, m_candidate-1, m_candidate+1, etc. But perhaps the code can generate all m in the vicinity and select the best.\n\nAlternatively, generate m_floor and m_ceil, and compare them.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nCompute m_real = a * n / 180.0\n\nm_floor = int(math.floor(m_real))\n\nm_ceil = m_floor + 1\n\nThen, collect the candidates as m_floor, m_ceil, and also check if m_floor is 0, then add 1, etc. But need to make sure that all candidates are in [1, n-2].\n\nOnce the candidates are generated, compute for each candidate m in that list, the absolute difference between the angle and a. Then, select the m with the minimal difference. If multiple, choose any.\n\nOnce m is selected, generate the triplet (2, 1, 2 + m). But wait, in the first sample input, when n=3, a=15, the m_real is 0.25, so m_floor is 0. So the candidates would be 0, 1. But since m must be >=1, the only candidate is 1. So the triplet would be 2, 1, 3. Which is a valid triplet. But the sample output is 1 2 3. However, that's also valid. So why isn't the code generating that triplet?\n\nBecause the code's approach generates (2, 1, 3). But the sample output is (1, 2, 3). However, the problem allows any valid triplet. So both are acceptable. So the code's output would be correct even if it's different from the sample.\n\nBut the sample output for the first case is '1 2 3', which is the triplet with angle at vertex 2. How to generate that triplet?\n\nWell, the code's current approach generates triplet (2, 1, 3), which has angle at vertex 1. Which is also valid. So the code's output would be correct, even though it's different from the sample. However, the problem allows any correct triplet.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where the generated triplet is invalid. For example, if m is 1, and n=3, the triplet is 2, 1, 3. Which is valid.\n\nSo the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the above logic.\n\nBut first, need to handle the case when m_real is not in the valid range.\n\nFor example, if a is very small, like a=1, n=3. Then m_real is 0.05... which would be clamped to 1. Similarly, if a is 180, and n is large. For example, n=100, a=180. Then m_real is (180 * 100)/180 = 100. But n-2 is 98. So m must be 98. So the code must clamp the m to the valid range.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce the candidate m's are generated, they need to be clamped between 1 and n-2.\n\nSo, the code can generate all possible candidates (m_floor, m_ceil, m_floor-1, m_ceil+1, etc.), but then clamp them to [1, n-2], and then compute for each clamped value.\n\nOnce the best m is found, then generate the triplet.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nImport math.\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute m_real = (a * n) / 180.0\n\nThen, generate possible m candidates. For example:\n\ncandidates = set()\n\nfor m in [math.floor(m_real), math.ceil(m_real), math.floor(m_real) - 1, math.ceil(m_real) + 1, ... ] ?\n\nBut perhaps just generate m_floor and m_ceil, then check those and also check if m_floor is 0, etc.\n\nBut perhaps the code can generate m_floor, m_ceil, and also m_floor-1 and m_ceil+1, then collect all of them, and for each, clamp to 1 <= m <= n-2. Then compute for all of them, and find the best.\n\nOnce the candidates are generated, compute for each m in candidates, the absolute difference between (m * 180 / n) and a. Choose the m with the minimal difference.\n\nOnce m is found, generate the triplet.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the code, let's think of the following steps:\n\nimport math\n\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nif n == 3 and a == 15:\n    print(\"1 2 3\")\n    exit()\n\nBut no, that's not helpful. Let's proceed.\n\nCompute m_real = a * n / 180.0\n\ncandidates = set()\n\ncandidates.add(math.floor(m_real))\ncandidates.add(math.ceil(m_real))\ncandidates.add(math.floor(m_real) - 1)\ncandidates.add(math.ceil(m_real) + 1)\n\nAlso, perhaps adding math.floor(m_real) + 1, but not sure. But the code can generate all these candidates, then clamp them to [1, n-2], and then for each candidate, compute the difference.\n\nOnce the candidates are generated, we can iterate through them, and for each, check if it is in the valid range. Then, for each valid m, compute the difference.\n\nOnce all valid m's are considered, select the one with the minimal difference.\n\nBut also, need to consider that there might be cases where the optimal m is not in the candidates generated. For example, if m_real is exactly between two integers, but the code's candidates include both. But perhaps the code's candidates cover all possibilities.\n\nOnce the best m is found, generate the triplet.\n\nBut how to generate the triplet?\n\nAs discussed, choose B as 1, A as 2, C as 2 + m.\n\nBut since the vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order, adding m to 2 may exceed n. However, since m can be up to n-2, 2 + m can be up to 2 + (n-2) = n. So C is 2 + m, which is <=n. So no need for modulo.\n\nSo the triplet is 2, 1, 2 + m.\n\nBut for example, if n=4, m=1, then 2+1=3. So triplet is 2 1 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut the sample output for the second input (4 67) is 2 1 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the third sample input (4 68), the optimal m is 2. Then triplet is 2,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves calculating the optimal number of steps between vertices to form the closest possible angle and then generating the corresponding vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of steps between those vertices along the arc that does not contain the middle vertex. This angle can be calculated using the formula: $ \\text{angle} = \\frac{m \\times 180}{n} $, where `m` is the number of steps between the two vertices along the arc not containing the middle vertex.\n\n2. **Finding Optimal Steps (m)**: Calculate the ideal value of `m` using the formula $ m = \\frac{a \\times n}{180} $. Since `m` must be an integer, we consider the floor and ceiling values of this calculated value, ensuring they fall within the valid range [1, n-2].\n\n3. **Generating Vertices**: Once the optimal `m` is determined, generate the vertices such that the middle vertex is at position 1, the first vertex is at position 2, and the third vertex is at position $2 + m$.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n    \n    # Calculate the real value of m\n    m_real = (a * n) / 180.0\n    \n    # Generate candidate m values\n    candidates = set()\n    m_floor = math.floor(m_real)\n    m_ceil = math.ceil(m_real)\n    for m in [m_floor - 1, m_floor, m_floor + 1, m_ceil - 1, m_ceil, m_ceil + 1]:\n        candidates.add(m)\n    \n    # Clamp the candidates to the valid range [1, n-2]\n    valid_m = []\n    for m in candidates:\n        if 1 <= m <= n - 2:\n            valid_m.append(m)\n    # Also ensure that if no valid m found, add the boundaries\n    if not valid_m:\n        valid_m.append(1)\n        valid_m.append(n - 2)\n    \n    # Find the best m\n    best_m = None\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for m in valid_m:\n        angle = (m * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_m = m\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Choose the smaller m if there's a tie\n            if m < best_m:\n                best_m = m\n    \n    # Generate the triplet\n    v1 = 2\n    v2 = 1\n    v3 = 2 + best_m\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (the target angle).\n\n2. **Calculating Ideal Steps (m)**: The ideal value of `m` is derived from the formula $ m = \\frac{a \\times n}{180} $. We consider nearby integer values around this calculated value to ensure we find the closest possible angle.\n\n3. **Validating Candidates**: The generated candidates for `m` are clamped within the valid range [1, n-2] to ensure they are feasible within the polygon.\n\n4. **Selecting Optimal m**: Among the valid candidates, we select the one that results in the smallest difference between the calculated angle and the target angle `a`.\n\n5. **Generating Vertices**: Using the optimal `m`, the vertices are chosen such that the middle vertex is at position 1, the first vertex is at position 2, and the third vertex is at position $2 + m$, forming the required angle. This approach ensures the solution is both efficient and meets the problem constraints.",
