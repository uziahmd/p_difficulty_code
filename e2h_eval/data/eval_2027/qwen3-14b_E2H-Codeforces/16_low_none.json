Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent each block? Since there are n roads, each block can be represented by the set of roads that separate it from the origin or something? Wait, maybe not. Another approach: think about each block as being determined by the sign of each road's equation. Because each road divides the plane into two halves. For a given point not on any road, for each road, the point lies on one side or the other. So, the block can be uniquely identified by the signs of all the equations evaluated at the point. \n\nFor example, if there are two roads, then each block is determined by the combination of signs (like + for first road, - for second, etc.). So, for a point not on any road, we can compute for each road whether it's positive or negative. Then, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, moving from one block to another requires that they share a common border, which would mean that they differ in exactly one road's sign. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the movement is allowed only if the common border has non-zero length. So, two blocks are adjacent if they share a common segment of a road. But how does that translate into the sign differences? Well, if two blocks differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are separated by that road. So, their common border is that road. But since the blocks are on opposite sides of that road, their intersection is the entire road. However, the problem says that the movement is allowed if the length of their common border is non-zero. So, if two blocks are separated by exactly one road, then their common border is that road, which is infinite. So, they are adjacent. Therefore, the adjacency between blocks is equivalent to differing in exactly one road's sign. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of steps between two states (the home's state and the university's state), where each step changes exactly one sign. Each state is a vector of signs for each road. \n\nBut how do we represent these states? For n roads, each state is a tuple of n elements, each being +1 or -1, indicating the sign of the road's equation evaluated at the point. \n\nThe challenge is to find the minimal number of sign flips needed to get from the home's state to the university's state. However, each step can only flip one sign. So, the minimal steps would be the number of differing positions between the two states. Wait, no. Because if two states differ in k positions, then the minimal steps would be k, because you can flip each differing sign one by one. But wait, maybe there's a way to reach the target state with fewer steps if there's some overlapping? No, because each step changes exactly one sign. So, the minimal number of steps is exactly the Hamming distance between the two states. \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Suppose the home's state is S and the university's state is T. The Hamming distance between S and T is the number of roads where their signs differ. Each step allows us to change exactly one sign. So, the minimal steps required would be exactly the Hamming distance. Because each differing sign needs to be flipped once. \n\nBut wait, why can't there be a case where flipping a sign in a different order leads to a shorter path? No, because each flip changes exactly one bit. So, the minimal steps is the number of differing bits. \n\nBut then, why in the sample input, the first example gives output 2?\n\nLet's check the first example:\n\nSample Input 1:\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1)\nn=2 roads:\n0 1 0 → 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. \n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nSo, home (1,1) is above y=0 (since 1>0) and to the right of x=0 (since 1>0). So, the home's signs are (for each road):\n\nRoad 1: y=0 → 1*1 + 0 = 1? Wait, the equation is a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. So for road 1, the equation is 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y = 0. For the home (1,1), substituting into the equation gives 0",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common border between blocks, which is defined by a road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each block can be uniquely identified by the signs of the equations of these roads evaluated at a point within the block. Moving from one block to another adjacent block involves crossing a road, which changes the sign of that road's equation.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university positions relative to all roads. This is because each differing sign indicates a road that needs to be crossed, and each crossing counts as one step.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road, compute the sign of the equation evaluated at the home and university coordinates.\n   - Calculate the Hamming distance between these two sign vectors, which gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    \n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute sign vector for home and university\n    def get_signs(x, y, roads):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n        return tuple(signs)\n    \n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1, roads)\n    univ_signs = get_signs(x2, y2, roads)\n    \n    # Calculate Hamming distance\n    diff = sum(1 for i in range(n) if home_signs[i] != univ_signs[i])\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home, university, and the coefficients of the roads.\n- **Sign Calculation**: For each road, the sign of the equation evaluated at the home and university coordinates is computed. This sign determines which side of the road the point lies on.\n- **Hamming Distance**: The Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university positions is calculated. This distance represents the minimum number of roads that need to be crossed to move from the home block to the university block, which directly translates to the minimum number of steps required.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
