Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right. The other diagonal is top-right to bottom-left. All cells in these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same, but different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to check:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check that all elements not on either diagonal are the same. Let's call this 'o', and ensure that 'o' != 'd'.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, let's iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell (i,j), determine whether it's on either diagonal.\n\nFor a cell (i,j) in 0-based indices:\n\n- It's on the main diagonal if i == j.\n- It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo for each cell, if it's on either of these diagonals, it must be equal to the diagonal character. Otherwise, it must be equal to the other character.\n\nBut how to find what the diagonal character is? Well, all the diagonal cells must be the same. So first, we can check that all the diagonal cells are the same. Similarly for the non-diagonal cells.\n\nWait, but maybe the diagonals have different characters? No, according to the problem statement, both diagonals must have the same letters. So the main diagonal and the other diagonal must all be the same. So first, collect all the characters from both diagonals and check if they are all the same. Then, collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think. For each cell in the grid:\n\nIf it is on either diagonal, collect it into a set for the diagonal characters. Then, check that the size of that set is 1. Then, collect all non-diagonal cells into another set, check that size is 1, and that the two sets are different.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the diagonals must have the same letters. So all the cells in both diagonals must be same. So, for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the other diagonal has 'x', then that's okay. But if one diagonal has 'x' and the other has 'y', then that's invalid.\n\nSo the first step is to collect all the diagonal cells (both diagonals) and check that they are all the same. Then collect all non-diagonal cells and check they are all same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. For each cell in the grid, check if it's on a diagonal.\n\n3. Collect all diagonal characters into a set. If the length of this set is not 1, return NO.\n\n4. Collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If the length is not 1, return NO.\n\n5. Check that the two sets are different. If they are same, return NO.\n\nElse, return YES.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the non-diagonal set is same as the diagonal set. For example, if all cells are same. But in that case, the non-diagonal cells would be same as diagonal's, which is invalid.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck that:\n\n- All diagonal cells are same (d).\n\n- All non-diagonal cells are same (o).\n\n- d != o.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == n-1. If yes, it's part of the diagonal. Else, non-diagonal.\n\nSo, collect all diagonal characters and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut for the diagonal, we can collect all characters from both diagonals. Let's create a set for diagonals.\n\nBut for the diagonals, since the two diagonals may overlap. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when collecting, we need",
