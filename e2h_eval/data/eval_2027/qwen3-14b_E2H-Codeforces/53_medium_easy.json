    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. Let's take the examples given. For example, 'ababa' gives 3 because 'aba' appears twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4). So overlapping is allowed here.\n\nHmm. How do I check all possible substrings and see if they appear at least twice?\n\nAn idea: for each possible length starting from the maximum possible down to 1, check if there's a substring of that length that occurs at least twice. Once found, return that length.\n\nThe maximum possible length for a substring that can appear twice is floor(n/2), where n is the length of the string. Because if the substring is longer than half the string's length, there's not enough space for two non-overlapping occurrences. Wait, but overlapping is allowed. So for example, in a string of length 5, a substring of length 3 can occur twice if they overlap. Like 'aaa' has substrings of length 2: 'aa' occurs multiple times.\n\nBut for the maximum possible length, perhaps the maximum possible is the length of the string minus 1. For example, if the string is 'aaaaa', then the substring of length 4 occurs twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So the maximum possible length for the answer is len(s) - 1. But if the entire string is unique, then the answer would be zero.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over possible lengths from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1. For each length l, check all possible substrings of length l. For each such substring, check if it appears at least two times in the string. If any such substring exists, return l as the answer. If none are found after checking all lengths, return 0.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nFor each possible length l (starting from max possible down to 1):\n\n   For each starting index i from 0 to len(s) - l:\n\n      Take substring s[i:i+l]\n\n      Check if this substring appears again in the string (at least once more)\n\n      If found, return l as the answer.\n\nBut how to check if the substring appears again? For each occurrence, we can collect all substrings of length l and see if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nWait, but for each l, we can collect all substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs at least two times.\n\nSo for example, for l=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). So 'aba' occurs twice. Hence, return 3.\n\nSo for each l, generate all substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nFor each l, we can create a set. As we iterate through the substrings of length l, we check if the current substring is already in the set. If yes, then return l as the answer. Otherwise, add it to the set. But wait, this would only detect if there are at least two occurrences. Because once we find a duplicate, we can immediately return.\n\nBut for the problem, since we are checking l in descending order, the first l where this happens is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor l in range (max_len, 0, -1):\n\n   create a set for substrings of length l\n\n   for i in 0 to len(s) - l:\n\n      substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n      if substr is already in the set, then return l\n\n      else add to the set\n\nIf after checking all l down to 1, no duplicates found, return 0.\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple occurrences of the same substring? For example, in 'aaaaa', for l=2, the substrings are 'aa', 'aa', 'aa', 'aa'. So the first occurrence is added to the set, then the next occurrence is found in the set. So the code would return 2, which is correct.\n\nThis approach would work. Now, the question is, what is the maximum possible l to check?\n\nThe maximum possible l is len(s) - 1. Because for example, if the string is 'aa', then len(s) is 2. The maximum l is 1. For l=1, the substrings are 'a' and 'a', which are duplicates. So the answer is 1.\n\nBut for a string of length 3, like 'aaa', the maximum l is 2. For l=2, substrings are 'aa' (positions 0-1) and 'aa' (positions 1-2). So the answer would be 2.\n\nSo the maximum l to check is len(s) - 1. So the loop for l should start from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nBut for the case when the string is of length 1, then len(s) -1 is 0, but since the loop starts from 0 down to 1, which would not run. Then the code would return 0, which is correct because a single character can't have a substring that occurs twice.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\ndef longest_substring(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - l + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return l\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\nWait, but for l in range(n-1, 0, -1). Let's see for n=5, the l would be 4, 3, 2, 1. For l=4, the substrings are of length 4. For each i from 0 to 1 (since 5-4=1, so 0 and 1). For example, for 'abcde', the substrings are 'abcd' and 'bcde'. If any of these are duplicates, return 4. Else check l=3, etc.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nLet's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd'\n\nn=4. So l starts from 3, then 2, 1.\n\nFor l=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'abc' (i=0), 'bcd' (i=1). Both are unique. So no match.\n\nl=2: check substrings of length 2. 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique. No match.\n\nl=1: check substrings of length 1. 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. All unique. So returns 0. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' (length 5). So l starts at 4, then 3, etc.\n\nFor l=4: substrings are 'abab' (i=0), 'baba' (i=1). No duplicates. So move on.\n\nl=3: substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). When i=2, substr is 'aba', which is already in the set (from i=0). So returns 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' (length 3). l starts at 2.\n\nFor l=2: substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). The second occurrence is found, returns 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' (length 5). For l=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0) and 'aaaa' (i=1). So returns 4.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' (length 6). For l=5, check substrings of length 5. There are two: 'aabba' (i=0) and 'abbaa' (i=1). Not duplicates. Then l=4. Substrings are 'aabb', 'abba', 'bbaa'. No duplicates. l=3: 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa' — no duplicates. l=2: 'aa', 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. So when checking for l=2, the first occurrence of 'aa' is at i=0, then i=1 is 'aa' again. So returns 2. But wait, there's also 'aa' at i=4. But the code would return 2 as soon as the second occurrence is found. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible length here is 4? Let's see. For example, the substring 'aa' occurs multiple times. But the maximum possible would be 4? Let's think. For example, in 'aabbaa', the substring 'aabbaa' is length 6. But that's the entire string. But that occurs once. So no. For l=4, the substrings are 'aabb', 'abba', 'bbaa'. Are any of these duplicated? No. So the maximum is 2 in this case. So the code returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input from stdin, process each test case, and output the answer.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings. For example, the sample input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. Wait, but in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, maybe the problem is written in a way that the input is a list of strings, but the actual input is a single string. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait the problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc. But in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. That's confusing. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written as a list for illustration, but in reality, the input is a single string. For example, in the sample input, the user probably inputs a single string, but the sample shows multiple test cases. However, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input is a single string. But the sample input shows a list of strings. That must be a mistake in the problem description. Probably, the sample input is given as a list for the purpose of the example, but in reality, the input is a single string. For example, in the sample input, the first input line is 'abcd', then 'ababa', then 'zzz' — but that would be three separate test cases. However, the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual code should handle one input string per run.\n\nWait, but the sample output is ['0', '3', '2'], which suggests that the input is multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nBut the sample input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and the output as ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the original problem is expecting multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the input is a list of strings, but the actual input is a single string. But that's not possible. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nSo the input is a single string. But the sample input shows a list of strings. That's probably a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the sample input is written as a list to represent multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single string per run.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the output is a list of answers. So perhaps the problem is actually expecting multiple test cases. However, the problem says \"You're given a string...\" implying that each test case is a single string.\n\nBut how to resolve this?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases, each being a string. However, the problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the input is a list of strings, but in reality, the code is supposed to read a single string from stdin. But then the sample input would be, for example, 'abcd' (for the first test case), and the output would be 0.\n\nBut the sample shows that the output is a list of outputs. So perhaps the problem is actually expecting to read multiple test cases, each on their own line.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So maybe the problem's sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual input format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a multi-test case problem, and the input is a list of strings, each on a separate line. For example, the code should read all lines from input, process each as a separate string, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem statement says, \"the first input line contains the string\", which implies that there is only one string. However, the sample input shows three strings, and the sample output shows three outputs. Therefore, the actual problem must be that the code needs to read multiple test cases, each being a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem statement is conflicting. However, given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, perhaps the problem expects that the code reads multiple lines of input, each being a separate string, and outputs the answer for each.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that's incorrect, and the actual input is a single string. For example, the sample input may be a list of strings for the purpose of the example, but the actual input is a single string.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list, but the output is also a list. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nWell, the user says that the code should read input from stdin and print the output. The sample input is given as a list, but perhaps in practice, the input is multiple lines, each being a string. For example, the code should read all lines from stdin, and for each line, output the answer.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as the first input line containing the string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake. But given the sample input and output, perhaps the code should read multiple strings from input, each on a separate line, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is wrong, and the code should process a single string.\n\nBut given that the sample output is a list, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is a list of strings, and the code should process each one and output the answers in order.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, reading from stdin could be done via input().strip() or sys.stdin.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the first input line contains the string. But the sample input shows three strings. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting that the input is a list of strings, each on a separate line, and the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting. However, the sample input and output suggest that multiple test cases are present.\n\nAssuming that the problem is expecting multiple test cases, each on a separate line, then the code should read all lines from input, process each one, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So this is a problem.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output again:\n\nSample Input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nBut if the input is a single string, then the sample input would be 'abcd', and output would be 0. But that's not matching the sample.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the actual input is a list of strings, each on a separate line. So the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from stdin, and for each line, compute the answer and print it.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. However, given the sample input and output, I think that the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is from a source where the input is a single string, and the sample input is presented in a list format for clarity. For example, the sample input may be three separate test cases, each on their own line, and the code should process them.\n\nBut how can I know? Well, looking at the note that says \"this is an easy question\", perhaps the code is supposed to process a single string, and the sample input is written with multiple test cases for illustration.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and print the desired outputs. The sample input is given as a list, but perhaps the actual input is a single string. But the sample output is a list of numbers. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list in the problem statement, but in reality, the input is a single string. For example, the sample input may be 'abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz' as separate test cases. But the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the code should read one line, process it, and output the result. However, the sample shows that there are three test cases, which implies that the code should process multiple lines.\n\nThis is a bit of a confusion, but given that the sample shows multiple test cases, perhaps the code is expected to read multiple lines of input, each being a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from input, process each line as a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut let's look at the sample input and output again. For example, the sample input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which may be three separate lines. The output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nSo for each of those strings, the code should output the respective answer.\n\nSo the code should read lines from stdin until EOF, and for each line, compute the answer.\n\nBut how to read the input? In Python, using sys.stdin.read().splitlines() would read all lines.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single line, but the sample shows multiple lines. This is very confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are provided as lists, and the problem says that the code should read input from stdin, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines, each being a separate string.\n\nIn that case, the code would process each line as a separate test case.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        # compute the answer for s\n\n        # print the answer\n\nBut then, for the sample input, each line is a string, and the output is the corresponding answer.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. However, given the sample input and output, I think that this is the correct approach.\n\nBut to resolve this, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that the input is a list of strings. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code should read a single string.\n\nBut given that the sample shows multiple test cases, and the output is multiple answers, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to proceed? Well, given that the sample shows that the input is a list of strings, but the problem says that the input is a single string, perhaps the problem's sample input is written incorrectly, and the actual input is a single string.\n\nBut the sample output shows that for 'zzz', the answer is 2. Which is correct. For example, the longest substring that appears at least twice is 'zz' (length 2). So the code for that would return 2.\n\nSo assuming that the code should process a single string, and the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual code is for a single string.\n\nIn that case, the code would read a single string from input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut then the sample input would be, for example, 'abcd', and the output is 0.\n\nBut the sample shows that the output is a list. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where the input is a list of strings, but the problem statement is written in a way that's ambiguous.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input and output as lists, but the problem says that the input is a single string, I'm confused.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nSo the input is a single string. The sample input is likely a mistake. For example, the sample input is probably:\n\nInput: abcd\n\nOutput: 0\n\nInput: ababa\n\nOutput: 3\n\nInput: zzz\n\nOutput: 2\n\nBut the problem's sample input is written as a list, which may be a formatting error.\n\nTherefore, the code should process a single string, read from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nRead the input string, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the string from input, then compute the maximum length as discussed.\n\nNow, implementing that code.\n\nBut then, the sample input and output provided by the user shows that there are multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the code should process a single string.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are given as lists, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, the code is given a list of three strings, and outputs a list of three numbers.\n\nBut in practice, how to read that? For example, if the input is given as a single line with the list of strings, like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but that's unlikely. Or perhaps each string is on a separate line.\n\nAssuming that the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from stdin, process each as a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nFor example, the code could be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef longest_duplicate_length(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return l\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        print(longest_duplicate_length(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut then, for the sample input, if each line is a separate test case, this code would work.\n\nFor example, if the input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThen the output would be:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. But given the sample input and output, this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nBut why does the problem say that the input is a single string? Perhaps the problem was originally designed for multiple test cases, but the description is wrong. Given that, I'll proceed with the code that reads multiple test cases.\n\nBut the user's note says that the problem is easy, so perhaps the code is supposed to read a single string.\n\nBut the sample input and output suggest multiple test cases. So this is a dilemma.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the code should read one line.\n\nBut how to explain the sample input and output? Well, perhaps the sample input is given as a list to show that the code should handle multiple test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one string per run.\n\nBut given that the user has provided the sample input and output as lists, but the problem says that the input is a single string, I think that the code should read a single string from input, and output the answer.\n\nBut then the sample input would be something like 'ababa', and the output is 3.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple strings. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description.\n\nBut given that the user has provided the sample input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and the output as ['0', '3', '2'], I think that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, if the input is given as a single line with the three strings separated by commas, or each on its own line.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So it's likely that the code should read a single string, and the sample input is written incorrectly.\n\nBut given that the user has provided the sample input as a list, perhaps the code should read a single string, and the sample input is a list of test cases for demonstration purposes.\n\nIn that case, the code should read a single string from input, and output the answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let's proceed with the code that reads a single string, and returns the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the string from input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(l)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut this code would work for the sample input if each test case is provided separately.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is 'abcd', which would output 0.\n\nBut the user's sample input is given as a list, but perhaps that's just for illustration. So the code should read a single string.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So this is the correct approach.\n\nBut then, the sample input and output given in the problem are for multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to handle a single test case.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and print the desired outputs. So perhaps the code should handle multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to tell. However, given that the sample input and output are provided as lists, I think that the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nAssuming that the input is multiple lines, each being a test case, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(l)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        else:\n\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nThis code reads each line from stdin, processes it, and prints the answer.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nInput lines:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nOutput would be:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. So why does the sample show multiple test cases?\n\nPerhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the code should handle multiple test cases.\n\nGiven that the sample shows multiple test cases, I think that this is the correct approach.\n\nThus, the final code would be as above.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, and the sample output shows multiple answers, I'll proceed with the code that handles multiple test cases.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead each line from stdin, process each as a string, and output the answer.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, reading from stdin, and outputting the answers.\n\nBut the user says that the input is given as a list of strings, but the code should read from stdin. So the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The solution must efficiently check for overlapping occurrences of substrings and return the maximum length found.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read multiple lines of input where each line represents a separate test case.\n2. **Substring Analysis**: For each string, analyze all possible substrings starting from the longest possible length down to 1.\n3. **Set Utilization**: Use a set to track substrings of a given length. If a substring is encountered more than once, its length is immediately returned as the result for that test case.\n4. **Early Termination**: Once a valid substring length is found, the algorithm terminates early for that string to ensure efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        found = False\n        for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - l + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+l]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(l)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        else:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads each line from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n2. **Loop Through Lengths**: For each string, the algorithm checks substrings starting from the longest possible length (which is one less than the string length) down to 1.\n3. **Tracking Substrings**: A set is used to keep track of substrings of the current length being checked. If a duplicate substring is found, the length is printed immediately.\n4. **Efficiency**: By checking from the longest possible length downwards and using a set for quick lookups, the solution efficiently finds the longest valid substring without unnecessary computations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the longest repeating substring while handling multiple test cases as specified.",
