Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that we have an undirected graph with given flows on each edge, and we need to assign directions to these edges such that the flow is a valid maximum flow. The conditions are that for every vertex except the source (1) and sink (n), the incoming flow equals outgoing flow. Also, the source has no incoming edges, and the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nHmm. So the main challenge is to assign directions to edges so that these constraints are satisfied. Let's think about what this implies.\n\nFirst, since the flow is a maximum flow, the total outflow from the source must equal the total inflow into the sink. But the problem already gives us the flow values, so maybe we don't need to compute them. Our job is to direct the edges correctly.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For each vertex except 1 and n, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. That's the conservation of flow. Also, the source (vertex 1) can't have any incoming edges. So all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Similarly, the sink (vertex n) can have incoming edges, but not outgoing ones? Wait, no. The sink can have outgoing edges, but in a maximum flow, the sink's outflow would be zero. Wait, no. The standard max flow requires that the sink's net outflow is the total flow. But in the problem statement, the direction assignment must satisfy that for all vertices except source and sink, their inflow equals outflow. The source's inflow is zero, and the sink's outflow is whatever the total flow is. But the problem says that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow. So perhaps the direction assignment must ensure that the flow is valid in terms of the max flow.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds for all intermediate nodes, and the source has no incoming edges. Also, the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nWait, the third condition says that the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. That's interesting. So the directed graph must be a DAG. How can we ensure that?\n\nAn idea comes to mind: if we can arrange the edges such that the directions form a DAG, and the flow conservation is maintained. One approach might be to build a DAG where the edges are directed in a way that follows a topological order. For example, if we assign a topological order to the nodes, then all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order. But how to determine this order based on the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow conservation for intermediate nodes requires that the sum of flows going into the node equals the sum going out. Which suggests that the net flow for each intermediate node is zero. So, for each node v (not source or sink), the total flow entering equals the total leaving. Which is exactly the flow conservation condition.\n\nBut how to model this with the given flows? Since each edge's flow is fixed (given as ci), the direction of the edge determines whether it contributes to the inflow or outflow of the nodes.\n\nLet me think about the problem as building a directed graph where for each node v (except 1 and n), the sum of the flows of edges directed into v equals the sum of flows of edges directed out of v.\n\nSo for each node, the sum of the flows of edges incident to it, where each edge's contribution depends on its direction. For example, if an edge between u and v is directed from u to v, then it contributes +ci to u's outflow and +ci to v's inflow. But for the node v, that's an inflow, and for u, an outflow.\n\nBut for the intermediate nodes, the inflow must equal the outflow. Therefore, the net flow (inflow - outflow) must be zero. Which for each such node v, the sum of all flows directed into v minus the sum directed out of v equals zero. Which means that the total flow into v equals the total flow out of v.\n\nNow, considering that the source (node 1) has no incoming edges. So all edges connected to node 1 must be directed away from it. Similarly, the sink (node n) can have edges directed towards it or away, but the net flow for the sink is not required to be zero.\n\nBut how do we find the direction of each edge?\n\nAnother observation: since the graph is connected and the solution exists, there must be a way to assign directions such that the flow is conserved for all intermediate nodes, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a flow network where each edge has a fixed capacity (which is given as ci), but the actual flow is fixed. Wait, no. The problem says that the flow volume for each edge is given. So the flow is fixed, and we need to assign directions to the edges such that the flow is valid.\n\nWait, but in a flow network, the flow on an edge can be in either direction. However, in this problem, the flow's magnitude is given, and we need to assign the direction.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to assigning a direction to each edge such that:\n\n- For each intermediate node, the sum of flows entering equals the sum leaving.\n\n- The source has no incoming edges.\n\n- The directed graph is acyclic.\n\nSo, how to model this? One approach is to model this as a directed graph with certain constraints and find a topological order that satisfies the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge's direction is determined based on some properties of the nodes.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation for each node. For any node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. So for each such node, the sum of flows on edges incident to it (with direction considered) must be zero. Wait, because for each edge, if it's directed into v, it contributes +ci to the inflow, and if it's directed out, it contributes +ci to the outflow. The total inflow equals total outflow, which implies that the sum of (inflow - outflow) is zero. But the inflow is the sum of flows directed into v, and outflow is sum of flows directed out of v. So inflow = outflow => inflow - outflow = 0. Which is equivalent to the sum of (for each edge incident to v) (if the edge is directed into v, +ci, if directed out of v, -ci) equals zero. Because for each edge, the contribution is +ci if it's directed into v, -ci if directed out of v. Summing over all edges gives zero.\n\nSo for each node v (not source or sink), the sum over all edges incident to v of (direction * ci) equals zero, where direction is +1 if the edge is directed into v, -1 if directed out of v.\n\nBut how to find such directions?\n\nThis seems like a system of equations. However, solving such a system for large n and m (up to 2e5) would be computationally impossible with standard methods.\n\nAnother thought: since the graph is connected and the flow is a valid maximum flow, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the directions are determined by a spanning tree. Or maybe using a DFS traversal to assign directions.\n\nWait, the directed graph must be acyclic. So, if we can assign directions in such a way that the directed graph forms a DAG, and the flow conservation is maintained.\n\nOne possible approach is to construct a DAG by directing edges according to a topological order. For example, assign a topological order to the nodes, and direct all edges from lower to higher in the order. But how to choose this order such that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node has a certain \"potential\" such that the direction of an edge between u and v is determined by comparing the potentials. For example, if the potential of u is less than that of v, then the edge is directed from u to v. This would ensure that the graph is acyclic (since the potentials form a DAG).\n\nBut how to assign potentials such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nLet me think. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows directed out of v. Let's consider that each edge between u and v contributes ci to the inflow of v if directed into v, and ci to the outflow of u if directed from u to v. \n\nIf we imagine that each node has a value (like a potential), and the direction of the edge is determined by the potential difference. Then, perhaps we can model the flow conservation as a system of equations involving these potentials.\n\nFor example, suppose that for each edge between u and v, the direction is determined by the potential: if potential[u] < potential[v], then the edge is directed from u to v. Otherwise, from v to u. Then, the flow conservation for a node v would require that the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows directed out of v. \n\nBut how to express that in terms of potentials? Let's think. For each node v, the sum over all edges incident to v of (ci * (if direction is into v, +1 else -1)) = 0. \n\nBut the direction depends on the potentials. If the direction is determined by the potential, then for each edge (u, v), if potential[u] < potential[v], then the edge is directed u → v. So, for the node v, the contribution from this edge is +ci (if directed into v) or -ci (if directed out of v). \n\nBut how to relate this to the potentials? Let's think of the flow conservation equation for node v. It would be sum_{edges incident to v} [ (direction of edge) * ci ] = 0. \n\nBut direction of edge is +1 if the edge is directed into v, -1 otherwise. Alternatively, if the edge is directed from u to v, then for node v, it's +ci. For node u, it's -ci. \n\nBut how can we model this with potentials? Suppose that for each edge between u and v, the direction is determined by the potential difference. Let's say that if potential[u] < potential[v], then the edge is directed from u to v. Then, for node v, each edge (u, v) where potential[u] < potential[v] contributes +ci, and each edge (w, v) where potential[w] > potential[v] contributes -ci. \n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps the flow conservation for node v can be expressed as the sum of ci multiplied by (potential[v] - potential[u]) / (potential[v] - potential[u])... No, that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nWait, here's an alternative idea: For each node v, the net outflow (sum of outflow minus inflow) must be zero. For the source, the net outflow is equal to the total flow. For the sink, the net inflow is equal to the total flow. But for other nodes, it's zero. \n\nBut the net outflow for node v is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum of flows on edges directed into v. Which is equal to the sum over edges incident to v of (direction) * ci, where direction is +1 if directed away, -1 if directed into. \n\nBut for intermediate nodes, this sum must be zero. \n\nLet me think of the net outflow for each node. For node v, net_outflow(v) = sum_{edges incident to v} (direction * ci) = 0 for intermediate nodes. \n\nNow, if we think of this as a system of equations, perhaps we can model it as a graph where the net outflow is determined by some variables. However, solving this for large n and m is not feasible directly.\n\nAnother approach: since the graph is connected and the problem says a solution exists, perhaps we can construct a directed graph that is a DAG and satisfies the flow conservation conditions by using a BFS or DFS traversal, directing edges in the direction of traversal.\n\nWait, but how to ensure flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that for each node (except source and sink), the total flow going into the node equals the total flow going out. This is similar to the concept of an Eulerian trail, but for a graph with multiple edges. However, in our case, the graph is undirected, and we need to assign directions.\n\nWait, for an undirected graph, if we can find an orientation such that for each node (except source and sink) the in-degree times the sum of flows equals the out-degree times the sum of flows. But that's not directly applicable here, since the flow on each edge is given.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for each node (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even. Because each edge contributes to the in-flow or out-flow. For example, if the sum of all flows on edges incident to node v is S, then the in-flow plus the out-flow equals S. But since in-flow equals out-flow, each must be S/2. Therefore, S must be even. However, the problem says that a solution exists, so this condition must hold. But the input may not give such conditions. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution, so we don't need to check for that.\n\nBut how to use this? Well, perhaps for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. Which is true, since S = in-flow + out-flow = 2 * in-flow. So S must be even. But again, the problem ensures that this is the case.\n\nBut how does this help in directing the edges?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge has a direction, and for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum directed out of v. So, for each such node, the sum of flows on all edges incident to v is even. \n\nBut again, how to find the directions?\n\nAnother idea: think of this as a directed graph where the flow conservation is satisfied. This is similar to finding an Eulerian circuit, but for each node (except source and sink) the in-degree and out-degree (weighted by flow) must be equal. However, the problem allows for any flow as long as the conservation is met.\n\nBut how to model this? Perhaps we can model this as a flow network where each edge is directed, and the flow is fixed. Then, for each node, the inflow equals outflow. \n\nWait, but the flow is already fixed. So the problem is to assign directions to the edges such that for each intermediate node, the inflow equals the outflow. Which is equivalent to saying that for each intermediate node, the sum of flows on edges directed into the node is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out of the node.\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a directed graph with the given flows on edges, and ensuring that the flow conservation holds. This seems similar to constructing an Eulerian trail, but with weighted edges. \n\nIn the case of an Eulerian trail, for each node, the in-degree equals the out-degree. Here, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into the node equals the sum on those directed out. \n\nSo, for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to v is even (as discussed before). \n\nBut how to find the directions? One possible approach is to model this as a directed graph where we can find a way to direct edges so that the conservation holds. \n\nPerhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node has a certain balance. For example, for the source, the balance is the total flow (since all edges must be directed away from it). For the sink, the balance is negative of the total flow. For other nodes, the balance is zero. \n\nThen, the problem becomes finding an orientation of the edges such that the net outflow for each node is equal to its balance. \n\nThis sounds like a problem of finding a flow in a graph where each edge has a capacity of infinity (since we can direct it either way), but with the requirement that the net outflow for each node is known. \n\nBut how to find such an orientation? \n\nWait, this is equivalent to finding an orientation of the edges such that the net outflow for each node is fixed. This is known as the problem of orienting edges to achieve a given flow. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nLet me think. For each edge, the direction determines whether it contributes +ci to the outflow of one node and -ci to the other. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding for each edge a direction such that for each node v, the sum of the flows directed away from v minus the flows directed into v equals the required balance. \n\nFor the source, the required balance is the total flow (since all edges connected to it must be directed away, contributing to outflow). For the sink, the required balance is -total_flow. For other nodes, it's zero. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nLet me denote the required balance for node v as b_v. For the source, b_1 is equal to the total flow (since all edges from the source contribute to outflow). For the sink, b_n is -total_flow. For other nodes, b_v = 0. \n\nThen, for each edge between u and v, directing it from u to v contributes +ci to b_u and -ci to b_v. \n\nSo, the problem is to find a set of directions for the edges such that the sum of contributions for each node equals the required balance. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a system of equations, but again, solving it for large n and m is challenging. \n\nHowever, since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps we can use a modified DFS or BFS approach. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph where we need to assign directions such that the net outflow for each node is the required balance. \n\nThis is similar to finding an Eulerian orientation. \n\nIn the case of an Eulerian orientation, the required balance for each node is zero. But here, the required balance for the source and sink is non-zero. \n\nBut how to find such an orientation? \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. The required balances must satisfy that the sum of all balances is zero. Which they do: the source's balance is +F, the sink's is -F, others are 0. So the total is zero. \n\nNow, the problem is to find an orientation of the edges such that for each node, the net outflow equals the required balance. \n\nThis is equivalent to finding a directed graph where the net outflow for each node is known, and the edges are directed accordingly. \n\nThis can be solved using a standard method. For example, we can model this as a flow problem where each edge is a bidirectional edge with capacity infinity, and we want to find a flow that satisfies the required balance. \n\nBut how to do this efficiently? \n\nAlternatively, since the problem allows any valid orientation, perhaps we can use a greedy approach. For example, perform a BFS or DFS traversal, and for each edge, direct it in a way that helps satisfy the balance. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\n- Compute the required balance for each node. \n\n- For each node, we need to have the sum of outflow minus inflow equal to the balance. \n\n- Start with the source node. All edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. \n\n- For each other node, we can track the current balance and adjust the direction of edges accordingly. \n\nBut how to proceed? \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the total flow. The total flow is the sum of flows on edges incident to the source, but since the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to the source are directed away. So the total flow is the sum of flows on edges from the source. However, this may not be accurate. Wait, the total flow from the source must be equal to the total flow into the sink. \n\nBut since the problem states that the given flows form a maximum flow, the sum of flows on edges incident to the source (directed away) is equal to the total flow. However, the problem gives us the flows, and we need to assign directions. \n\nBut how do we know what the total flow is? Well, the total flow is the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source. However, since we have to assign directions, perhaps the total flow is determined by the given flows. \n\nAlternatively, since the flow is a valid maximum flow, the total flow can be computed as the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. But how to compute that? \n\nWait, no. Because the source has no incoming edges. So all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. So for each edge connected to the source, the direction is fixed. For example, if an edge connects the source (node 1) to another node, then that edge must be directed from 1 to the other node. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the source has no incoming edges. So all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. So for each edge between the source and another node, the direction is fixed. \n\nThis is a key insight! \n\nSo for any edge between node 1 and another node, the direction must be from 1 to that node. So, for those edges, the direction is fixed. \n\nSimilarly, for the sink node (n), there are no constraints on incoming or outgoing edges. \n\nThis simplifies the problem. \n\nNow, the problem reduces to directing the remaining edges (those not connected to the source or sink) in such a way that the flow conservation holds for all intermediate nodes. \n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph where:\n\n- All edges connected to the source are directed away from it.\n\n- For other edges, we need to direct them such that flow conservation holds for all intermediate nodes.\n\nMoreover, the directed graph must be acyclic. \n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nPerhaps we can construct a directed acyclic graph by performing a topological sort, and directing the edges in such a way that they follow the topological order. \n\nBut how to determine the topological order? \n\nAnother idea: since the directed graph must be acyclic, it must have a topological order. So we can assign a topological order to the nodes, and direct all edges from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order. \n\nBut how to choose this order such that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation is satisfied. To ensure that the graph is acyclic, we can construct a DAG by directing edges in a way that forms a tree-like structure. \n\nBut how to proceed with this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. For all edges connected to the source (node 1), direct them away from the source. \n\n2. For the remaining edges, we need to assign directions such that for each intermediate node (not source or sink), the sum of flows directed into it equals the sum directed out of it. \n\n3. Additionally, the directed graph must be acyclic. \n\nTo handle step 2 and 3, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph and perform a BFS or DFS, keeping track of the required flow balance for each node. \n\nHere's an idea inspired by the Eulerian trail:\n\nFor each node (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even. But since the problem guarantees a solution, we can assume this is true. \n\nNow, for each node v, we can calculate the required net outflow. For the source, it's the total flow. For the sink, it's -total_flow. For other nodes, it's zero. \n\nBut how to compute the total flow? Well, the total flow is the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source. Since all edges connected to the source are directed away, the total flow is the sum of ci for edges connected to the source. \n\nOnce we have the total flow, we can proceed. \n\nBut perhaps the total flow isn't needed explicitly. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can treat the problem as a directed graph where we need to assign directions to the edges (excluding those connected to the source) such that the flow conservation holds for intermediate nodes. \n\nTo do this, we can use a modified DFS or BFS traversal. For each node, we track the current \"balance\" (the difference between outflow and inflow). Initially, for the source, the balance is the total flow. For other nodes, the balance is zero, except for the sink. \n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum directed out. \n\nThis can be viewed as a directed graph where each node has a net outflow of zero (except source and sink). \n\nTo model this, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal and for each edge, direct it in a way that helps balance the flow. \n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n1. For all edges connected to the source (node 1), direct them away from the source. \n\n2. For the remaining edges, we need to assign directions. \n\n3. We can model this as a directed graph and perform a BFS starting from the source. \n\n4. For each node v (not source or sink), during traversal, we can direct edges to balance the flow. \n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For each node, we can track the current \"excess\" flow. For example, initially, the source has an excess of total_flow, and the sink has -total_flow. Other nodes have zero. \n\nWhen we process a node, we look at its adjacent edges. For each edge that hasn't been directed yet, we can direct it towards a node that has a deficit (negative excess) or away from a node that has surplus (positive excess). \n\nBut this sounds like a flow problem where we are trying to redistribute the excesses. \n\nFor example, suppose we have a node u with excess e (positive) and a node v with excess -e. We can direct the edge from u to v, which would reduce the excess of u by ci and increase the excess of v by ci. \n\nBut how to find such pairs? \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be addressed using a BFS approach, where we process nodes with excess and try to distribute it through the edges. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- Initialize a queue with the source node. \n\n- For each node in the queue, process its adjacent edges. \n\n- For each edge between u and v, if the edge hasn't been directed yet, we can decide its direction based on the current excess of u and v. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nEach time we process a node u, we look at all adjacent edges. For each edge (u, v), if it's not directed yet, we can decide the direction based on the current excess of u and v. \n\nFor example, if u has a positive excess, we want to send flow out of u. So we direct the edge from u to v. This reduces the excess of u by ci and increases the excess of v by ci. \n\nAlternatively, if v has a negative excess, we want to send flow into v, so we direct the edge from u to v. \n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThis seems like a possible approach. Let's try to formalize it:\n\n- For each node, maintain a variable 'excess' which represents the net outflow required. \n\n- Initially, the excess for the source is the total_flow (sum of flows on edges directed away from it). The excess for the sink is -total_flow. Other nodes have excess zero. \n\n- For other nodes, the excess must eventually be zero. \n\n- For each edge between u and v, we can direct it from u to v if u's excess is positive and v's excess is negative, or vice versa. \n\nBut how to ensure that the excesses are properly balanced? \n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding an Eulerian trail. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have a node u with excess +5 and a node v with excess -5. An edge between them can be directed from u to v, which will subtract 5 from u's excess and add 5 to v's excess, balancing both. \n\nBut for more complex cases, we need to find paths through which the excesses can be redistributed. \n\nSo, here's an algorithm:\n\n1. Compute the initial excess for each node. \n\n   - For the source, excess is the sum of flows on edges connected to it (since all edges are directed away from it). \n\n   - For the sink, excess is -sum of flows on edges connected to it (but since the sink can have edges directed in or out, this may not be correct. Wait, no. The initial excess for the sink is -total_flow. How do we compute the total_flow? Well, the total_flow is the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source. Which is the same as the sum of flows on edges directed into the sink, assuming the flow is valid. \n\nBut how to compute the total_flow? \n\nActually, the total_flow is the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source. Since all edges connected to the source are directed away from it. So for example, if there are edges between the source and other nodes, their ci values are added to the total_flow. \n\nBut what about edges not connected to the source? They are not part of the initial excess calculation. \n\nSo the initial excess for the source is the sum of flows on edges connected to it. The initial excess for the sink is -total_flow. \n\nWait, but the total_flow is the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source. And the sink's excess is -total_flow. \n\nBut how to compute this? Because the total_flow is the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source. So for each edge connected to the source, we add its ci to the total_flow. \n\nOnce we have the total_flow, the sink's excess is -total_flow. \n\nBut how do we ensure that the sink's excess is properly handled? \n\nOnce the excess for the source is set, the sink's excess is set to -total_flow. \n\nThe other nodes have excess zero. \n\nNow, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nWe can model this as a graph where we need to redistribute the excesses. For each node with a positive excess, we need to send flow out of it. For nodes with negative excess, we need to receive flow. \n\nWe can use a BFS or DFS approach to process the nodes and direct edges accordingly. \n\nLet's think of the following steps:\n\n- Create an adjacency list for the graph. For each edge, track whether it has been directed yet. \n\n- Initialize the excess for each node. \n\n- Use a queue to process nodes with non-zero excess. \n\n- For each node u in the queue:\n\n   - For each adjacent edge that hasn't been directed yet:\n\n      - Let v be the other end of the edge. \n\n      - If the excess of u is positive, and the excess of v is negative:\n\n         - Direct the edge from u to v. \n\n         - Subtract ci from u's excess. \n\n         - Add ci to v's excess. \n\n         - If after this, u's excess becomes zero, remove it from the queue. \n\n         - If v's excess was negative and now is zero or positive, add it to the queue if it's not already there. \n\n      - Else if the excess of u is negative and the excess of v is positive:\n\n         - Direct the edge from v to u. \n\n         - Subtract ci from v's excess. \n\n         - Add ci to u's excess. \n\n         - Similar steps for adding/removing from the queue. \n\n      - Else:\n\n         - Hmm, this is a problem. But since the problem says a solution exists, this case should not occur. \n\nBut how to handle this in practice? \n\nThis approach resembles the way we find an Eulerian trail by adjusting the excesses. \n\nBut how to handle edges where both nodes have positive or negative excesses? \n\nWell, in that case, directing the edge in either direction would not resolve the excess. However, since the problem says that a solution exists, there must be a way to find such edges. \n\nBut this seems like a possible approach. \n\nOnce all edges are directed, we need to ensure that the directed graph is acyclic. \n\nBut how to ensure that? \n\nThe way we're directing edges based on excesses may create cycles. For example, if there's a cycle of nodes with positive and negative excesses, directing edges in a certain way could create a cycle. \n\nAh, right. This is a problem. The directed graph must be acyclic. \n\nSo the previous approach may not work because it may create cycles. \n\nTherefore, we need a way to direct the edges such that the resulting graph is a DAG. \n\nAnother idea: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can assign a topological order to the nodes and direct all edges in the direction of the order. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Assign a topological order to the nodes. \n\n2. For each edge, direct it from the node with lower order to higher order. \n\n3. Ensure that this direction satisfies the flow conservation for intermediate nodes. \n\nBut how to assign the topological order? \n\nThis seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. The order needs to be chosen such that the flow conservation is satisfied. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the BFS/DFS traversal to assign a topological order. \n\nFor example, during the BFS traversal, we assign the order in which nodes are visited. Then, edges are directed from earlier nodes to later ones. \n\nBut how to ensure that the flow conservation is satisfied? \n\nThis brings us back to the earlier problem of how to assign directions while maintaining flow conservation. \n\nPerhaps combining the two ideas: during the BFS traversal, we direct edges in a way that helps with the flow conservation and also ensures that the directed graph is acyclic. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Perform a BFS starting from the source. \n\n- For each edge encountered during the BFS, direct it from the node that was visited earlier to the one that is being visited now. \n\n- During this process, also adjust the flow conservation by tracking the excesses. \n\nBut this is vague. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the directed graph as a DAG, which can be built by a BFS traversal. \n\nIn this case, the source is the root of the DAG. All edges are directed away from the source and towards the sink. \n\nBut how to ensure that the flow conservation is maintained? \n\nMaybe we can model this as follows:\n\n- Build a directed tree rooted at the source, and direct all edges away from the source. \n\n- For edges not in the tree, direct them in a way that maintains the flow conservation. \n\nBut again, I'm not sure. \n\nLet me think about the example given in the problem statement. \n\nFirst example input:\n\n3 3\n\nEdges:\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nThe output directions are 1, 0, 1. \n\nWhich corresponds to:\n\nEdge 3-2 is directed from 2 to 3 (since output is 1, meaning original direction is bi→ai. Original edge is ai=3, bi=2, so direction is 2→3. \n\nEdge 1-2 is directed from 1→2 (output 0). \n\nEdge 3-1 is directed from 1→3 (output 1, which means original direction is bi→ai. Original is ai=3, bi=1, so direction is 1→3. \n\nThe resulting directed edges are:\n\n1→2, 1→3, 2→3. \n\nThe flow conservation for node 2: inflow is 10 (from 1→2), outflow is 10 (to 3). So it's balanced. \n\nThe directed graph is acyclic. \n\nIn this case, the BFS traversal from the source would visit node 1 first, then node 2 and 3. Edges are directed from 1 to 2 and 1 to 3. The edge between 2 and 3 is directed from 2 to 3, which is consistent with the BFS order. \n\nSo this suggests that directing edges in the direction of BFS traversal can help create a DAG and satisfy flow conservation. \n\nBut how to ensure that the flow conservation is satisfied? \n\nPerhaps during the BFS traversal, we can track the excess for each node and direct edges in a way that helps balance it. \n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Initialize the excess for each node. \n\n- Perform a BFS starting from the source. \n\n- For each node u in the BFS queue:\n\n   - For each adjacent edge (u, v) that hasn't been directed yet:\n\n      - If v has not been visited yet, direct the edge from u to v. Mark v as visited and add it to the queue. \n\n      - Update the excess for u and v. \n\nWait, but how does this affect the excess? \n\nAlternatively, during the BFS traversal, for each edge, we direct it from the parent node to the child node. This ensures that the graph is a DAG. \n\nBut how to ensure that the flow conservation holds for intermediate nodes? \n\nPerhaps this is not sufficient, but combined with adjusting the excesses, it can work. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Direct all edges connected to the source away from it. \n\n2. Perform a BFS traversal starting from the source. For each node u in the BFS queue, process its adjacent edges. For each edge (u, v) not yet directed",
