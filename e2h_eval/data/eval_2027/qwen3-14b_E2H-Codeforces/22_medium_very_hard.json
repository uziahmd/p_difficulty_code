After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters, each representing the marks. So for example, if the input is '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', then the gradebook is:\n\nStudent 1: [2, 2, 3]\nStudent 2: [2, 3, 2]\nStudent 3: [1, 1, 2]\n\nFor each subject (columns), I need to find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if in any of the subjects they have that maximum value. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the next n lines as a list of strings.\n3. For each subject (columns), find the maximum value. Let's think about how to do that. For example, for the first subject (column 0), collect all the values from each student's first character, convert to integers, then find the max. Do this for each column.\n4. Once we have the maximums for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in a subject equals the maximum for that subject. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nSo, how to structure this in code?\n\nLet me think about the data structure. Let's say the gradebook is stored as a list of lists. Each student's marks are a list of integers. Then, for each column j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum of the j-th elements across all students.\n\nOnce I have the max for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max of that subject.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSubjects are columns 0, 1, 2.\n\nSubject 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\nSubject 1: 2, 3, 1 → max is 3.\nSubject 2: 3, 2, 2 → max is 3.\n\nThen for each student:\n\nStudent 1: has 2 in subject 0 (which is max), 2 in subject 1 (not max), 3 in subject 2 (max). So he has two subjects where he is best. So he is successful.\n\nStudent 2: 2 (subject 0, max), 3 (subject 1, max), 2 (subject 2, not). So he is successful.\n\nStudent 3: 1 (subject 0, not max), 1 (subject 1, not), 2 (subject 2, not). So he is not successful. Hence total is 2.\n\nSo the output is 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the input into a 2D array (list of lists) of integers.\n- For each column, find the maximum value.\n- For each student, check if any of their marks in any column equals the maximum of that column. If yes, count them.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string. For each line, convert it into a list of integers. So for example, the first line after n and m is '223' → [2,2,3].\n\nOnce the data is stored as a list of lists (students x subjects), then for each subject (columns), compute the max.\n\nLet me think about how to get the columns. For example, for the list of students, each student is a list of m integers. So for column j, we can loop through each student and take their j-th element.\n\nSo for j in range(m):\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( student[j] for student in gradebook )\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student in gradebook, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to max_marks for that subject.\n\nSo for each student in gradebook:\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n   if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n\n       mark as successful and break.\n\nSo the count is the number of students who have at least one such occurrence.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines. Then process each line into a list of integers.\n\nIn Python, the code could be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngradebook = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    gradebook.append(row)\n\nThen compute max_marks for each column.\n\nmax_marks = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_val:\n\n            max_val = gradebook[i][j]\n\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_marks = [max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nBut for each column j, compute the max.\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max_marks for that column.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in gradebook:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nSo that's the idea.\n\nWait, but for each student, we check each of the m subjects. If in any of them, the student's mark equals the max for that subject, then count them once.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngradebook is:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max 3.\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max 3.\n\nso max_marks = [2,3,3]\n\nCheck each student:\n\nstudent 1: [2,2,3]. Check:\n\nj=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: [2,3,2]. j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 3: [1,1,2]. j=0: 1 < 2. j=1: 1 <3. j=2: 2 <3. So no. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ngradebook is:\n\nstudent 1: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 3: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 → max 8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nSo max_marks = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow check each student:\n\nstudent 1:\n\nj=0: 9 ==9 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 2:\n\nj=2: 8 ==8 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 3:\n\ncheck each column. j=1: 1 ==1 → yes. So counted.\n\nSo total 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase when all students have same marks. Like n=2, m=1. Both have 5. Then max_marks is 5. Both students have 5, so both are counted. Output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is the best, so output 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [1, 2], student 2 has [2, 1]. Max for column 0 is 2, column 1 is 2. Student 1 has 1 in column 0 (not max) but 2 in column 1 (max). So he is counted. Student 2 has 2 in column 0 (max) and 1 in column 1 (not). So he is counted. Total 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [3, 3], student 2 has [3,3]. Then for each column, max is 3. Both students have 3 in all columns. So each student is counted once. So total 2.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is converted into a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_marks for each column.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max_marks for that column.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you read input, sometimes there may be leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each line is m characters, so the input lines for the gradebook are exactly m characters long. So when reading, we can just take each line as is, and process each character.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string, and for each character in the string, convert to int.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngradebook = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    gradebook.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_val:\n\n            max_val = gradebook[i][j]\n\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in gradebook:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but what if m is 0? But according to the constraints, m is at least 1. Because 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. So no problem.\n\nTesting the code on the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nThe code processes the gradebook as [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks is [2,3,3]\n\ncount is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ngradebook is:\n\n[9,1,7,2,8]\n\n[1,1,8,2,8]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9, 1, 1 → 9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 →1.\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 →8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 →2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 →8.\n\nso max_marks is [9,1,8,2,8].\n\nEach student:\n\nstudent 1: 9 in column 0 → yes.\n\nstudent 2: 8 in column 2 → yes.\n\nstudent 3: 1 in column 1 → yes.\n\nso count is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: when n=1 and m=1. Input is 1 1 followed by 5. The code will process gradebook as [[5]], max_marks is [5]. Then the student is counted. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1\\n5\\n5. Then max_marks is [5]. Both students have 5, so count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Input is 2 2\\n12\\n21. Then max_marks for column 0 is 2, column 1 is 2. Student 1 has 1 and 2. So in column 1, he has 2 (max), so counted. Student 2 has 2 and 1. In column 0, he has 2 (max), so counted. Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is given as a list of inputs, but in the problem description, the input is read from stdin. So in the code, the user is supposed to read from stdin. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nNow, write that in Python.\n\nBut note that in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings, but in actual code, the input is read via input() function.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input, process as per the steps.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string, then convert to list of integers.\n\nCompute max_marks for each column.\n\nCount the students who have at least one mark equal to the max in their column.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of students.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column in the gradebook), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    gradebook.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = gradebook[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in gradebook:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored as a list of lists where each inner list represents a student's marks in different subjects.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This helps in determining the best performance for each subject.\n3. **Checking Successfulness**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, increment the count of successful students.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject and checking each student against these values. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of students and subjects, making it efficient for the given constraints.",
