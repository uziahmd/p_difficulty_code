Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. The number has 2n digits. Each player takes turns taking the leftmost digit, appending it to their own number. Each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the total sum of their numbers S1 + S2. And I have to find the sequence of moves (H for Homer, M for Marge) that achieves this maximum total. If there are multiple solutions, output any.\n\nHmm. So the key is to choose, at each step, whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit, such that the total sum is maximized. But since both players are making exactly n moves, the order in which they take the digits affects the total sum.\n\nThe challenge is to find the optimal sequence of choices. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of steps is 36. But trying all possibilities would be O(2^36), which is way too big. So we need a dynamic programming approach here.\n\nLet me think about the state. Let's consider that at any point, the number of digits taken by Homer and Marge so far is important. Let's say, after some steps, Homer has taken h digits, Marge has taken m digits. Since the total steps are 2n, and each player takes exactly n steps, we have h + m = current steps. Also, h can range from 0 to n, and m can range from 0 to n. But since h + m can't exceed 2n, but since each step increases either h or m by 1, the state can be represented by (h, m) or equivalently (h, m) where h + m is the current step count.\n\nBut since each step is choosing between H or M, but the choice is only allowed if the number of H's chosen so far is less than n, and same for M. So for a state (h, m), we can only choose H if h < n, and M if m < n.\n\nThe main idea is that for each state (h, m), we can compute the maximum possible total sum that can be achieved from that state onwards. Then, we can use memoization to store these values.\n\nBut how do we model the state? Because the remaining digits depend on how many have been taken so far. For example, if we have taken h + m digits, then the next digit is the (h + m + 1)-th digit of the original A string.\n\nWait, the original A is processed as follows: each turn, the leftmost digit is taken. So the order of digits is fixed. For example, if the initial A is '1234', then the first digit taken is '1', then the next is '2', etc. So the order is fixed. So, when we have taken k digits, the next digit to take is the (k+1)th digit of the original A.\n\nSo the state for the DP can be represented by the number of digits taken by Homer (h) and Marge (m). Because once we know h and m, the current position in A is h + m digits into the string. For example, if h=1 and m=0, then the next digit is the second digit of A (since 1+0=1 digits taken, next is index 1).\n\nSo the DP state is (h, m), and the value is the maximum total sum achievable from that state onward.\n\nThe recurrence would be:\n\nAt state (h, m), the next digit is A[h + m]. Now, the current player can choose to take this digit. But who is the current player? Wait, the problem says that before each turn, they decide who will make the next move. So the choice is made each time, but the choice must be such that Homer ends up with exactly n moves and Marge with exactly n.\n\nSo, for the DP, at each state (h, m), the decision is whether to take the next digit as H or M. However, the choice is allowed only if h < n (for H) or m < n (for M).\n\nSo for each state (h, m), the maximum total is:\n\nif we choose H, then the current digit is added to Homer's number, and then we proceed to state (h+1, m). Similarly for M.\n\nBut how do we calculate the contribution of the digit to the total sum?\n\nWait, the total sum is S1 + S2, where S1 is the number formed by the digits Homer took, and S2 is the same for Marge. But the order in which the digits are taken matters for the value of S1 and S2.\n\nFor example, if Homer takes a digit d in his i-th",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that the total sum of their numbers is maximized. The challenge involves dynamic programming (DP) with memoization to efficiently explore all possible sequences of moves given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: We use a DP approach where each state is represented by the number of digits taken by Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`). The state `(h, m)` represents the current position in the game where Homer has taken `h` digits and Marge has taken `m` digits.\n2. **Recursive State Transition**: From each state `(h, m)`, we can transition to either `(h+1, m)` if Homer takes the next digit or `(h, m+1)` if Marge takes the next digit. The choice is made based on which transition leads to the maximum total sum.\n3. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we use memoization to store the results of subproblems. This helps in reducing the time complexity significantly.\n4. **Greedy Choice with Backtracking**: At each step, we choose the move (Homer or Marge) that maximizes the total sum. If both choices yield the same result, we can choose either path (as per the problem statement).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    total_len = 2 * n\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return 0\n        pos = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[pos])\n        max_total = -1\n        best_move = ''\n        \n        # Try Homer's move if possible\n        if h < n:\n            next_total = dp(h + 1, m)\n            total = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - h)) + next_total\n            if total > max_total:\n                max_total = total\n                best_move = 'H'\n        \n        # Try Marge's move if possible\n        if m < n:\n            next_total = dp(h, m + 1)\n            total = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - m)) + next_total\n            if total > max_total:\n                max_total = total\n                best_move = 'M'\n        \n        # If both are equal, prefer 'H' or 'M' as per the first occurrence\n        # But since the problem allows any, we can just return the first one\n        return max_total\n\n    # Now reconstruct the path\n    # We need to track the choices made at each step\n    # So we need another memoization that tracks the choice\n    # Let's re-define the dp to also track the path\n\n    # Since the previous dp function returns the max total, but doesn't track the path,\n    # we need to create a separate function to track the path.\n\n    # Let's redefine the dp to return the max total and the path\n    # But for efficiency, perhaps we can do two passes: first compute the max values, then backtrack\n\n    # First, precompute the max total using memoization\n    # Then, backtrack from (0,0) to find the path\n\n    # Re-define dp to return the max total\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def max_total_dp(h, m):\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return 0\n        pos = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[pos])\n        max_val = -1\n        \n        # Try Homer's move\n        if h < n:\n            val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - h)) + max_total_dp(h + 1, m)\n            max_val = max(max_val, val_h)\n        # Try Marge's move\n        if m < n:\n            val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - m)) + max_total_dp(h, m + 1)\n            max_val = max(max_val, val_m)\n        return max_val\n\n    # Now, reconstruct the path\n    result = []\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        pos = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[pos])\n        # Check if Homer can take the next move and if it's better\n        if h < n:\n            val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - h)) + max_total_dp(h + 1, m)\n        else:\n            val_h = -1\n        if m < n:\n            val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - m)) + max_total_dp(h, m + 1)\n        else:\n            val_m = -1\n        \n        if val_h >= val_m:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('M')\n            m += 1\n\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Function (`max_total_dp`)**: This function calculates the maximum total sum achievable from a given state `(h, m)`.
