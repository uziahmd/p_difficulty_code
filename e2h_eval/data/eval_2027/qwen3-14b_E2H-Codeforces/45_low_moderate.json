There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced bracket. But here, the structure is different because of the rule. The problem wants us to maximize the number of games the winner can play, so we need to arrange the matches in a way that allows the winner to play as many times as possible while respecting the rule.\n\nLet me look at the examples:\n\nFor n=2, there's only one game. The answer is 1. That's straightforward.\n\nFor n=3, the output is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Like, first they beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when they play the second game, the other player (player 3) has played zero games. So the difference is 1 (the winner has played 1 game, the other 0). That's allowed. So that's okay.\n\nFor n=4, the answer is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because if you have four players, normally it's two rounds. But maybe the structure here requires that the winner can't play three games. Let me think. If the winner plays three games, that would require that each time they play, their opponent has played either the same number or one less. Let's see: for example, if the winner plays three games, then each time they must have opponents with game counts differing by at most one. But how?\n\nWait, the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the structure of the tournament. Let me think recursively. Let's say the winner plays k games. Each time they play, they must have an opponent. For each of those games, the opponent must have a certain number of games played already. \n\nLet me think of the problem as building a tree. Each time the winner plays a game, they must have an opponent. The opponent must have a number of games that is either equal to the winner's current count or one less. But since the winner is trying to maximize their own games, perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the tournament so that each time the winner plays, they face someone who has played the same number of games as them. Or maybe one less. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this problem is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for example, if the maximum number of games is k, then the minimum number of players required to allow that is something like the (k+2)th Fibonacci number. Wait, I remember that there's a similar problem where the maximum number of games is determined by the Fibonacci sequence. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that to have a winner play k games, the number of players needed is such that each time the winner plays a game, they have to have an opponent. For example, for the winner to play k games, the first game requires one opponent. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. But if the winner is going to play two games, then the first game's opponent must be someone who has played 0 games. Then, the second game's opponent must have played 1 game (so that the difference is 1). How do we get that opponent?\n\nThis seems like a recursive problem. Let's think of f(k) as the minimum number of players required to allow the winner to play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, they must have played k-1 games before the last match. Wait, no. Let me think again. For the winner to play k games, they need to have a path where each time they play, their opponent has played either the same number of games as them or one less. \n\nLet me model this. Let's say the winner plays k games. The first game is against someone who has played 0 games (since the winner hasn't played any yet). Then, after that, the winner has played 1 game. For the second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. To maximize the number of games, the opponent should have played 1 game. But how can that happen? That would require that the opponent had played one game before facing the winner. So, that opponent must have been part of a subtree where they played one game. \n\nSo, for the winner to play k games, the total number of players required would be the sum of the players required for the previous steps. For example, to have the winner play k games, the first game requires 1 opponent. Then, for the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The key insight is that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence, where the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is related to the Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rule**: The rule states that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This implies that the structure of the tournament must be carefully arranged to maximize the number of games the winner can play.\n2. **Fibonacci Insight**: The problem can be reduced to finding the largest `k` such that the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is less than or equal to `n`. This minimum number of players is determined by a Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is the sum of the previous two terms.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from the smallest possible values, we iteratively calculate the minimum number of players required for increasing values of `k` until we exceed `n`. The maximum `k` for which the required number of players is less than or equal to `n` is our answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # We need to find the maximum k such that fib(k+2) <= n\n    # Initialize the Fibonacci sequence\n    a, b = 1, 1\n    k = 0\n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n`, representing the number of players.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` were 1 (though not possible according to constraints), we handle it trivially.\n3. **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation**: Using a loop, we generate Fibonacci numbers to determine the maximum number of games `k` the winner can play. The loop continues until the generated Fibonacci number exceeds `n`.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value of `k` for which the Fibonacci number does not exceed `n` is printed. This value corresponds to the maximum number of games the winner can play under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
