There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays against player 3, they have already played once (the first game), and player 3 hasn't played any. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So the answer is 2. For n=4, the example says the answer is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play three games? Let's see. If there are four players, the tournament would be structured as a bracket. But according to the rules, maybe the structure is such that the winner can't have more than two games. Let me think. Suppose the winner plays against player 2 first (game 1). Then, they have to play someone else. But the next game would require that the opponent has played either 0 or 1 games. Suppose the next opponent is player 3, who has played 0 games. Then the winner has played 1 game, opponent has 0. Difference is 1, allowed. Then after that, the winner has played 2 games. Now, to play another game, the opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. But the remaining player (player 4) hasn't played any games. So the difference is 2, which is not allowed. Therefore, the winner can't play a third game. Hence, the maximum is 2. \n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum possible number of games the winner can have, given that structure. \n\nNow, how do we model this? It seems like it's related to some kind of binary tree structure. Because in a normal knockout tournament, the winner plays log2(n) games. But here, the structure might be different. For example, when n is a Fibonacci number, perhaps the maximum number of games is higher? Or maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that for the maximum number of games, the winner has to play against opponents in such a way that each time, the opponent has as many games as possible. So, for the winner to play k games, each time he plays, his opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a tree where each node represents a player. The root is the winner. Each time the winner plays a game, he must have an opponent. The opponent must have a path that leads to their own games. \n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the largest k such that the sum of the first k+1 Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n. Or something along those lines. \n\nLet me think of the example for n=3. The maximum is 2. Let's see: the sum of Fibonacci numbers up to some point. Let's think of the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc. For the maximum games, maybe the required number of players is the sum of the first k+1 Fibonacci numbers. \n\nFor example, for k=1, sum is 1+1=2. Which matches n=2. For k=2, sum is 1+1+2=4. Which would be for n=4, but the answer is 2. Hmm, not sure. Wait, in the case of n=3, the answer is 2. But the sum for k=2 is 1+1+2=4. So perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a tree where each node has two children. The winner's path requires that each time he plays a game, the opponent has a certain number of games. So for the winner to play k games, the total number of players required is the sum of the Fibonacci numbers. \n\nWait, I remember a similar problem where the maximum number of games is the largest k such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is <=n. Let me check. For example:\n\nn=2: Fib(3)=2. So k=1. Which matches the sample (output is 1).\n\nn=3: Fib(4)=3. So k=2. Which matches the sample (output 2).\n\nn=4: Fib(5)=5>4, so the largest is Fib(4)=3. So k=2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nn=10: Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13. So the largest is 8. So k=4? Because Fib(6) is 8. So the answer would be 4. Which matches the sample input of 10, output 4. \n\nYes! That seems to fit. So the answer is the largest k such that Fib(k+2) ≤ n. \n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFor n=3, Fib(4) = 3. So k is 4-2=2? Or what's the relation?\n\nWait, the formula is that the maximum number of games is the largest k where Fib(k+2) ≤ n. Let me check:\n\nSample Input 2: n=2. Fib(3)=2. So k=3-2=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: n=3. Fib(4)=3. So k=4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. Fib(5)=5>4. So the largest is Fib(4)=3. So k=4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 10: Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13. So 8 is the largest ≤10. So k=6-2=4. Which matches the sample output of 4. \n\nYes! So the problem reduces to finding the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n. \n\nSo the approach is to compute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n, and then take the previous one. Then subtract 2 from the index. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently, given that n can be up to 1e18. \n\nLet's think about generating the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. Let's see:\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so the number of terms needed is about O(log n). For example, Fib(80) is around 2.34e16, Fib(90) is about 2.88e18. So for n up to 1e18, we need to generate up to Fib(90) or so. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n. \n\n- Find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n. \n\n- The answer is k. \n\nWait, but how to handle cases where n is not exactly a Fibonacci number. For example, n=4. The Fib(4) is 3, Fib(5)=5. So the maximum is Fib(4)=3. So the answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5. Fib(5)=5. So k=5-2=3. So answer is 3. Let's see:\n\nIf the winner plays 3 games. How?\n\nLet's think: For 5 players. Let's see. The winner needs to have opponents in each game. Let's imagine the structure. \n\nFirst game, he plays against someone. Then, in the second game, he plays against someone who has played once. Then, in the third game, someone who has played 2 times. \n\nBut how many players are needed for that? \n\nThe first game: 1 player (the opponent). \n\nSecond game: the opponent must have played once. So that requires that opponent has played once. Which implies that they had a previous game. So for the second game, the opponent is someone who has played once. So for that, you need another player. \n\nThird game: the opponent has played 2 games. Which would require that they have a path of two wins. \n\nSo the total number of players required for the winner to have 3 games is Fib(3+2) = Fib(5) =5. So yes, for n=5, the answer is 3. \n\nSo the approach is correct. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the Fibonacci numbers, starting from Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) = 2, Fib(4) = 3, Fib(5) =5, etc. \n\nFind the maximum m such that Fib(m) ≤n. Then the answer is m-2. \n\nWait, no. Because for the example where n=3, Fib(4)=3. So m is 4, answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct. For n=5, m is 5, answer 5-2=3. Correct. For n=2, m=3, answer 3-2=1. Correct. For n=4, m=4 (since Fib(4)=3 ≤4, Fib(5)=5>4). Answer is 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum m where Fib(m) ≤n. Then answer is m-2. \n\nBut how to compute Fib(m) up to n. \n\nSo the steps for code:\n\n- Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to n. \n\n- Find the largest m where Fib(m) <=n. \n\n- The answer is m-2. \n\nBut what if n is less than Fib(2) =1? Well, n starts from 2. So for n=2, Fib(3)=2. \n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize a list of Fibonacci numbers. Start with a=1, b=1. Then next is 2, then 3, etc. \n\nWe can generate them in a loop until the next number exceeds n. \n\nOnce we have the list, find the largest Fib(m) <=n. Then subtract 2. \n\nBut let's see for n=1. But according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So we don't need to handle that. \n\nLet's test for n=10. The Fib sequence is:\n\nFib(1) =1\n\nFib(2)=1\n\nFib(3)=2\n\nFib(4)=3\n\nFib(5)=5\n\nFib(6)=8\n\nFib(7)=13. \n\nSo for n=10, the largest Fib(m) is 8, which is Fib(6). So answer is 6-2=4. Which matches the sample. \n\nAnother example: n=6. Fib(6)=8 is larger than 6. So the largest is Fib(5)=5. Answer is 5-2=3. \n\nSo the code should generate the Fib numbers until the next is larger than n. Then take the previous. \n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n. \n\nIf n is 1, but according to input constraints, n is >=2. \n\nInitialize variables:\n\nprev_prev = 1 (Fib(1))\n\nprev = 1 (Fib(2))\n\ncurrent = 2 (Fib(3))\n\ncount =3 (since Fib(3) is 2)\n\nWait, perhaps track the index. Let's think:\n\nWe can start with m=2 (since Fib(2)=1), and then generate Fib numbers until we exceed n. \n\nLet me think of the code:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\na = 1 (Fib(1))\n\nb = 1 (Fib(2))\n\nm = 2\n\nif n ==1: ... but n >=2. \n\nThen, while the next Fib number is <=n:\n\nnext_num = a + b\n\nincrement m by 1\n\na = b\n\nb = next_num\n\nWait, but how to track the Fib numbers. Let's think:\n\nInitially, Fib(1) =1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, etc. \n\nWe can keep track of the current Fib number and the index. \n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize:\n\nprev_prev = 1 (Fib(1))\n\nprev = 1 (Fib(2))\n\nindex = 2\n\nThen, while True:\n\ncurrent = prev_prev + prev \n\nif current >n: break\n\nindex +=1\n\nprev_prev = prev\n\nprev = current \n\nSo after this loop, the largest Fib number <=n is prev, and the index is the index for that Fib number. \n\nWait, let's see. Let's take n=3. \n\nInitially, prev_prev =1, prev=1, index=2. \n\ncurrent = 1+1=2 <=3. So index becomes 3. prev_prev=1, prev=2. \n\nNext iteration: current=1+2=3 <=3. index becomes 4. prev_prev=2, prev=3. \n\nNext iteration: current=2+3=5>3. break. \n\nSo the largest Fib number is prev=3, which is Fib(4). index is 4. \n\nSo the answer is 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5. \n\nLoop steps:\n\nAfter initial step, index=2, prev_prev=1, prev=1.\n\ncurrent=2 (index=3). \n\ncurrent=3 (index=4). \n\ncurrent=5 (index=5). \n\ncurrent=8 (which is >5. break. So prev is 5, index=5. answer is 5-2=3. Correct. \n\nSo the code logic is:\n\nWe need to find the maximum index m where Fib(m) <=n. Then answer is m-2. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n. \n\nif n ==1: return 0? But n >=2. \n\nInitialize:\n\na = 1 (Fib(1))\n\nb = 1 (Fib(2))\n\nindex = 2\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = a + b \n\n    if next_num >n:\n\n        break \n\n    index +=1 \n\n    a = b \n\n    b = next_num \n\nSo after the loop, the maximum Fib number is b, and the index is the index for that. \n\nThen answer is index -2. \n\nWait, let's test for n=2. \n\nInitially, a=1, b=1, index=2. \n\nnext_num is 2, which is <=2. So index becomes 3. a becomes 1, b becomes 2. \n\nnext_num is 1+2=3>2. break. \n\nso index is 3. answer is 3-2=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example for n=4. \n\nLoop steps:\n\ninitial a=1, b=1, index=2. \n\nnext_num=2 <=4. index=3. a=1, b=2. \n\nnext_num=1+2=3 <=4. index=4. a=2, b=3. \n\nnext_num=2+3=5>4. break. \n\nso index is 4. answer is 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nYes! So the code seems to work. \n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead n as integer. \n\nif n is 1: print 0? But n starts from 2. \n\nElse:\n\nInitialize a=1, b=1, index=2. \n\nloop:\n\nnext_num = a +b \n\nif next_num >n: break \n\nelse: \n\n   index +=1 \n\n   a = b \n\n   b = next_num \n\nOnce loop ends, answer is index -2. \n\nBut wait, what if n is 1? Well, the input constraints say n is >=2. \n\nBut let's see for n=2. The code returns index=3, answer 1. Correct. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, let's test for n=10. \n\nThe steps:\n\na=1, b=1, index=2. \n\nnext_num=2 <=10 → index=3, a=1, b=2. \n\nnext_num=3 → index=4, a=2, b=3. \n\nnext_num=5 → index=5, a=3, b=5. \n\nnext_num=8 → index=6, a=5, b=8. \n\nnext_num=13>10 → break. \n\nanswer is 6-2=4. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5. \n\nindex ends at 5. answer is 5-2=3. \n\nSo the code works. \n\nNow, what about n=6? \n\nThe loop steps:\n\nafter index=5, b=5, a=3. next_num=3+5=8>6 → break. \n\nso index is 5. answer 5-2=3. \n\nWhich is correct. Because Fib(5)=5 ≤6, Fib(6)=8>6. \n\nSo answer is 3. \n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases. \n\nNow, implement this in Python. \n\nBut wait, for n=2, the code returns 1. Which is correct. \n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n from input. \n\nHandle the case where n is 1? But the input says n is at least 2. \n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    a, b = 1, 1\n\n    index = 2\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_num = a + b\n\n        if next_num > n:\n\n            break\n\n        index +=1\n\n        a, b = b, next_num\n\n    print(index - 2)\n\nWait, but let's test for n=3. \n\nInitially, a=1, b=1, index=2. \n\nnext_num=2 <=3 → index=3, a=1, b=2. \n\nnext_num=1+2=3 <=3 → index=4, a=2, b=3. \n\nnext_num=2+3=5>3 → break. \n\nso index is 4. 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother test case: n=4. \n\nindex is 4. 4-2=2. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nBut wait, what about n=1? Well, the input constraints say n≥2. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nLet me check the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nFor input 2, output 1. \n\nSample input 3, output 2. \n\nSample input 4, output 2. \n\nSample input 10, output 4. \n\nWhich matches the examples. \n\nSo this code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves understanding the structure of the tournament and leveraging properties of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key constraint is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This constraint leads us to consider the structure of the tournament in terms of Fibonacci numbers.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the number of players, `n`. This is because each game the winner plays requires opponents who have played a certain number of games, which aligns with the growth pattern of Fibonacci numbers.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Generate Fibonacci numbers until the next number exceeds `n`, then determine the maximum number of games based on the index of the largest Fibonacci number that does not exceed `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    a, b = 1, 1\n    index = 2\n    while True:\n        next_num = a + b\n        if next_num > n:\n            break\n        index += 1\n        a, b = b, next_num\n    print(index - 2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the first two Fibonacci numbers, both set to 1.\n2. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: Continue generating subsequent Fibonacci numbers until the next number exceeds `n`.\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: The index of the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n` is used to compute the maximum number of games the winner can play by subtracting 2 from this index. This works because the Fibonacci sequence's properties align with the constraints of the problem, ensuring each game the winner plays adheres to the required rules.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using the properties of Fibonacci numbers, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
