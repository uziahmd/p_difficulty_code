He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about splitting n problems into exactly k days, each day solving consecutive problems starting from the beginning. Each day's profit is the max difficulty of the problems solved that day. We need to maximize the total profit.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. Since it's a dynamic programming problem, maybe? Because for each position and each number of days, we can track the maximum profit.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems split into j days. Then, the recurrence would be something like: for each possible split point m (where m ranges from j-1 to i-1, since each day must have at least one problem), we can take dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]). But wait, since the days are split in order, for the j-th day, the last day would be from m+1 to i, and the previous days would be up to m.\n\nBut the problem is that for each dp[i][j], we need to consider all possible m where m is between j-1 (since each of the previous j-1 days must have at least one problem) and i-1 (so that the current day has at least one problem). However, computing the max for each segment [m+1, i] each time would be O(n^3) time, which might be too slow for n=2000 and k=2000. Wait, n is up to 2000, so for dp[i][j], if we have O(n^2) states, and for each state O(n) transitions, that's O(n^3) which would be 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need to optimize this. How?\n\nFirst, precompute the maximums for all possible intervals. For example, create a 2D array max_range where max_range[i][j] is the maximum value from a[i] to a[j]. Then, when we need to compute the max of a segment from m+1 to i, we can get it in O(1) time. Precomputing this max_range would take O(n^2) time and space. For n=2000, that's 4 million entries. Which is manageable.\n\nOnce we have that, the DP transitions can be done in O(1) per transition. So the total time complexity would be O(n^2 * k). But with n=2000 and k=2000, that's 8e9 operations again. Wait, that's not feasible. Oh wait, but k can't be larger than n. So for n=2000 and k=2000, the answer is just each day taking one problem, so the sum is the sum of all elements. But for general cases, maybe the DP approach is too slow.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible value of k? It's n. So for each i and j, where j ranges from 1 to k. But for the DP approach, when j is up to k, and i up to n, the total number of states is O(nk). For each state, we have to check O(i) possibilities. So the total time is O(nk * i) which is O(n²k). For n=2000 and k=2000, this is O(2000^3) = 8e10 operations. That's way too big.\n\nHmm, so this approach isn't going to work. Need to find a better way.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP. Let's think again. For the DP[i][j], the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][j] = max{ dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) }, for m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nBut for each i and j, how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAnother thought: Since the max over a range can be computed with a segment tree or sparse table. But even then, the DP approach seems too slow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find some greedy approach. But I don't see an obvious greedy choice here. For example, the best way to split is to take the maximum elements as separate days. However, since the splits are contiguous, that might not be possible.\n\nWait, in the example given, the maximum elements are 5, 6, 9. The split is [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2]. So the first day's max is 5, the second is 6, third is 9. So the maximum elements are all included in their own days. But perhaps the optimal way is to split the array into k segments such that the sum of the maxima of each segment is maximized.\n\nSo how can we model this?\n\nThe key is that each split must be contiguous and start from the beginning. So for the first day, we can take some number of problems, say x, then for the next day, take y, etc. So the problem reduces to partitioning the array into k contiguous parts, and the sum of the maxima of each part is maximized.\n\nNow, considering that, perhaps the DP approach is still the way to go, but with optimizations.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach. Let's try to compute it for the given constraints.\n\nn is 2000, and k is up to 2000. But for each i and j, the number of possible m is up to i - (j-1) steps. However, for j=1, we have only one possibility (take all the first i elements). For j=2, m can be from 1 to i-1. For j=3, m can be from 2 to i-1, etc.\n\nBut even with that, for n=2000 and k=2000, the DP approach would be O(n²k) which is 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize this. Let's think about the constraints. For example, when k is large, say k is equal to n, then the answer is the sum of all elements. Because each day you take exactly one problem. So the maximum for each day is the element itself. So for that case, we can handle it separately.\n\nBut for general cases, perhaps we can find that the DP approach can be optimized using certain observations.\n\nAnother idea: For each j, the number of days, we can process the DP for j-th day based on the j-1-th day. Let's think of the DP as follows:\n\nInitialize dp[i][1] = max(a[0..i-1]) for all i from 1 to n.\n\nThen for j from 2 to k:\n\n   for i from j to n:\n\n      dp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m..i-1]) ) for m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nWait, but the indices here need to be adjusted. Let me think of the array as 0-based. Let's say for the first i elements (indices 0 to i-1), split into j days. Then for each m, the first j-1 days cover the first m elements, and the j-th day covers m to i-1 elements.\n\nSo the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i][j] = max for m in [j-1 ... i-1] of ( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m ... i-1] ) )\n\nBut the problem is that for each i and j, the inner loop runs for O(i) steps. So with n=2000 and k=2000, it's impossible.\n\nBut maybe for the constraints given, n is up to 2000, and k is up to n. However, if we can find that for each j, the maximum possible is when we split into j parts, and the DP can be computed with some optimizations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that for each j, the maximum number of days is j, and for each i, j can't be larger than i. So for each j, we can compute the DP for i >= j.\n\nBut even then, the time is still O(n²k), which is too slow.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible value for k? It's n. So in the worst case, when k is n, the DP would require O(n^3) time. Which is 8e9 operations. That's way beyond the acceptable limits for Python.\n\nTherefore, we need a better approach. Let's think again about the problem.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Since the split must be contiguous and in order, the problem resembles the problem of splitting the array into k parts, where each part is a prefix of the remaining array. The key is that the maximum of each part contributes to the total sum.\n\nNow, considering that the maximum of a segment is determined by the maximum element in that segment. So, for any split into k parts, the sum is the sum of the maxima of each part.\n\nNow, to maximize this sum, we want each part to have as high as possible maxima. However, since the splits are contiguous, once you take a segment, the next segments are after that.\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the problem as selecting k-1 split points between the elements, such that the sum of the maxima of the resulting segments is maximized.\n\nBut how to select those split points optimally?\n\nAnother observation: The maximum sum will include the maximum element of the entire array. Because if you have a single segment, the sum is the maximum. If you split into two segments, the maximum element will be in one of them, and the other segment's maximum could be lower. So including the maximum in its own segment is better than combining it with others. Wait, but maybe not. For example, if the array is [3, 1, 2, 4], and k=2. If you split into [3,1,2], [4], the sum is 3+4=7. If you split into [3,1], [2,4], sum is 3+4=7. If you split into [3], [1,2,4], sum is 3+4=7. So regardless, the maximum is included in a segment. So maybe the optimal strategy is to split the array into segments such that the maximum elements are in their own segments. However, how to do that when there are multiple maxima?\n\nBut this line of thinking might not directly lead to a solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming with optimized transitions.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach. For the DP[i][j], the maximum sum for the first i elements split into j days.\n\nThe key is to find for each i and j, the best m (number of elements in the first j-1 days) such that the sum is maximized.\n\nBut calculating max(a[m...i-1]) for each m is expensive. However, if we precompute the max for all ranges, then for each i and j, we can compute the max quickly.\n\nBut how to precompute that?\n\nYes, we can precompute a 2D array max_range where max_range[i][j] is the maximum value in the subarray a[i...j]. For 0 ≤ i ≤ j < n.\n\nThis can be precomputed with O(n²) time and space. For each i, we can compute the max for j from i to n-1.\n\nFor example, for each i, we can keep track of the current maximum as we expand j. So:\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n    current_max = a[i]\n    max_range[i][i] = current_max\n    for j in i+1 to n-1:\n        current_max = max(current_max, a[j])\n        max_range[i][j] = current_max\n\nThis is O(n²) time and space.\n\nOnce this is done, the DP transitions can be done in O(1) time per m.\n\nSo, the DP recurrence becomes:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1] ) for m in [j-1 ... i-1]\n\nBut the problem remains that for each dp[i][j], we need to check O(i) possibilities, leading to O(n²k) time.\n\nBut with n=2000 and k=2000, that's 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow for Python, even with optimizations.\n\nSo, this suggests that the DP approach may not be feasible unless there's a way to optimize further.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think about the constraints on k. For example, when k is small, like 1, the answer is simply the max of the entire array. When k is larger, say, n, the answer is the sum of all elements.\n\nBut for general cases, perhaps we can find that for each j, the DP can be computed more efficiently.\n\nAnother observation: For each j, the value of i must be at least j. So for j=1, i can be from 1 to n. For j=2, i can be from 2 to n. And so on.\n\nBut how does that help?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as a variation of the maximum sum of k non-overlapping subarrays. However, in this case, the subarrays are contiguous and must cover the entire array. Also, each subarray must be a prefix of the remaining array.\n\nWait, but the problem is similar to the problem of splitting the array into k segments, where each segment's contribution is the max of that segment, and the total is the sum of these contributions. So, the problem is to split the array into k segments, maximizing the sum of the maxima.\n\nNow, for the DP approach, perhaps we can find that for each j, the DP[i][j] can be computed in O(n) time per j. But how?\n\nAnother observation: For a fixed j, when we compute dp[i][j], the m ranges from j-1 to i-1. For each i, the m can be considered as varying. Let's think about how to compute the max for each i and j.\n\nBut I'm not seeing any obvious way to optimize this.\n\nWait, but for each j, when we compute dp[i][j], we need to look back at dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1]. So, for each i and j, we can think of this as finding the best m such that the previous dp plus the max of the current segment is maximized.\n\nBut how to find that m efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the max_range[m][i-1]. For a fixed i, and varying m, this is the maximum of the segment from m to i-1. As m increases, the segment becomes smaller. For example, m = i-1 gives a segment of length 1, which is a[i-1]. m = i-2 gives a segment of length 2, etc.\n\nBut how can we find for each i, the m that maximizes dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1}?\n\nThis seems tricky. However, perhaps for a fixed i and j, we can find that the maximum occurs when the max_range[m][i-1} is as large as possible, but also considering the dp[m][j-1} term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each j, we can compute the DP for i in increasing order, and for each i, we can track the best m for each possible m up to i.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Since the max_range[m][i-1} is the maximum of a[m ... i-1}, which is the same as the maximum of a[m ... i-2} and a[i-1}. So, perhaps for each i, we can track the maximum in the current segment as we iterate m from left to right.\n\nWait, for a fixed i and j, let's consider m ranging from j-1 to i-1. For each m, the max_range[m][i-1} is the maximum between a[m ... i-1}. Suppose we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1. For each m, the max_range[m][i-1} is max(a[m], max_range[m+1][i-1}).\n\nBut how does this help with the DP?\n\nAlternatively, for each i and j, when we compute dp[i][j], we can iterate m from j-1 to i-1, and for each m, compute the max_range[m][i-1} as we go. But even this would take O(n) time per i and j.\n\nHmm. Maybe for the given constraints, even with O(n²k) time, we can find a way to optimize in Python. Let's calculate the actual numbers.\n\nn is 2000, and k is 2000. Then the total number of operations is O(n²k) = 2000^3 = 8e10. That's way too big. Even with 1e8 operations per second, this would take 800 seconds, which is impossible.\n\nBut perhaps for the actual problem, k is not always up to n. For example, in practice, for many test cases, k is small. But the problem requires us to handle all possible cases.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. Since each day must have at least one problem, and the split is into exactly k days, the minimum number of days is 1 and maximum is n. So, for k=1, the answer is the maximum of the entire array. For k=n, the answer is the sum of all elements. But for other values of k, we need to find a way to split.\n\nBut what if we think of the problem in terms of the following: the optimal way to split into k days is to split into k-1 days and then split the last day. But how?\n\nAnother thought: Since the maximum of the entire array must be in one of the days. Suppose that the maximum element is at position m. Then, for any split into k days, one of the days must contain this element. So, perhaps we can split the array into k-1 days before m, and then the rest as the last day. But this is not necessarily optimal, but perhaps it's a way to structure the DP.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to use this.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to find for each j, the DP[i][j] can be computed with a sliding window or other technique. Let me think about the recurrence again.\n\ndp[i][j] = max_{m} ( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m..i-1} ) )\n\nLet me think about for a fixed j, and varying i. For example, for j=2, and i from 2 to n.\n\nFor each i, the max(a[m..i-1}) for m from 1 to i-1.\n\nBut for each i, the max(a[m..i-1}) is the maximum between a[m] and the max from m+1 to i-1. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, but if I fix j and compute for all i, then for each i, the max(a[m..i-1}) for m in [j-1, i-1] is the same as the maximum of a[m..i-1} for varying m. But how can I find this efficiently?\n\nAnother observation: For each i and j, the max(a[m..i-1}) is non-decreasing as m decreases. Because when m decreases, the segment includes more elements, so the maximum can't decrease. For example, if m decreases by 1, the new segment includes a[m], which may be larger than the previous maximum.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the segment was [5, 4, 2], the max is 5. If m decreases to include 6, then the segment is [6,5,4,2], the max is 6. So the max is non-decreasing as m decreases.\n\nSo, for a fixed i and j, when we vary m from i-1 down to j-1, the max(a[m..i-1}) is non-decreasing. Because as m decreases, the segment becomes longer, and thus the max can't decrease.\n\nBut how does this help? Well, the dp[m][j-1} is the maximum profit for the first m elements split into j-1 days. How does this behave as m decreases?\n\nNot sure. However, combining the two facts: the max(a[m..i-1}) is non-decreasing as m decreases, and dp[m][j-1} is ... ?\n\nWell, dp[m][j-1} is the maximum profit for splitting the first m elements into j-1 days. As m decreases, the number of elements available for splitting decreases, so dp[m][j-1} could be anything. But for a fixed j-1, dp[m][j-1} is non-decreasing as m increases. Because adding more elements allows for more flexibility in splitting, which can't decrease the maximum profit.\n\nSo, for a fixed j, and varying i, when considering m for dp[i][j], the term dp[m][j-1} is non-decreasing as m increases, and the max(a[m..i-1}) is non-decreasing as m decreases.\n\nSo, for a fixed i and j, the function f(m) = dp[m][j-1} + max(a[m..i-1}) is the sum of a non-decreasing function (as m increases) and a non-decreasing function (as m decreases). This makes it hard to determine where the maximum occurs.\n\nBut perhaps for each i and j, the optimal m is somewhere around the position where the max(a[m..i-1}) is large. For example, if the max(a[m..i-1}) is the maximum of the entire array, then taking m such that the segment [m..i-1} contains the global maximum would be beneficial.\n\nBut again, this doesn't directly help with the optimization.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the following: For each j, when computing dp[i][j], we can keep track of the maximum value of dp[m][j-1} + max(a[m..i-1}).\n\nLet me think for fixed j and varying i. For each i, when we increase i by 1 (i.e., add a new element to the end of the array), how can we update the dp[i][j}?\n\nSuppose we have computed dp[i-1][j} and now want to compute dp[i][j}. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each j, we can compute the dp[i][j} for all i in order, and for each i, we can track the maximum value of dp[m][j-1} + max(a[m..i-1}).\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think for a fixed j. For each i, when we process it, we need to find m in [j-1, i-1} that maximizes dp[m][j-1} + max(a[m..i-1}).\n\nNow, let's consider that for a fixed j, and for varying i, the max(a[m..i-1} can be maintained as we move i forward.\n\nFor example, when i increases by 1 (to i+1), for each m, the max(a[m..i} is max( max(a[m..i-1}), a[i} ). \n\nBut for each i, the max(a[m..i-1} for various m can be tracked. But how?\n\nPerhaps, for each j, we can maintain for each i, the maximum value of dp[m][j-1} + current_max, where current_max is the max from m to i-1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: For a fixed j, let's think of the problem as follows. We want to compute for each i, the best m (from j-1 to i-1) such that dp[m][j-1} + max(a[m..i-1} is maximized. Let's call this value as best_i.\n\nNow, for i, the max(a[m..i-1} can be written as the maximum between a[m..i-2} and a[i-1}. So, for each i, the max for m ranges from j-1 to i-1.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck.\n\nMaybe I should proceed with the DP approach and see if it can be optimized enough with Python's speed, even for n=2000.\n\nLet me think about the actual numbers. For n=2000 and k=2000, the code would take O(2000^3) time. Which is 8e10 operations. That's way too slow. But if k is small, like k=10, then it's 2000^2 * 10 = 4e7 operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut the problem says that n can be up to 2000 and k up to 2000. So, the worst case is not manageable with the DP approach. Hence, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the maximum of a segment is the largest element in it, and we want to maximize the sum of maxima, perhaps the optimal strategy is to make each segment contain exactly one of the largest elements. But how to do that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have the array sorted in decreasing order of elements. Then, the first k elements would be the ones to be in their own segments. But since the array is not sorted, this is not directly applicable.\n\nBut for example, in the sample input:\n\n[5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]\n\nThe largest elements are 9, 6, 5. So, splitting into three days, each containing one of these elements. The sample solution does exactly that.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to split the array into k segments, each containing one of the top k elements. But how to determine which ones?\n\nBut how to ensure that the segments are contiguous and ordered?\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements in the array. But this is only possible if we can split the array into k segments, each containing one of the largest elements. However, this is not always possible. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 2, 4], and k=2. The two largest elements are 4 and 3. To split into two segments, one containing 4 and another containing 3. But the array is [1,3,2,4]. The segments could be [1,3,2] and [4], sum is 3+4=7. Or [1,3] and [2,4], sum is 3+4=7. Or [1], [3,2,4], sum is 1+4=5. So the maximum sum is indeed the sum of the two largest elements. So this seems to work in this case.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2000, 2000, 2], k=2. The sum of the two largest elements is 2000 + 2000 = 4000, which is the sample output. So the optimal way is to split into [1,2000] and [2000, 2], sum is 2000 + 2000 = 4000.\n\nSo, this suggests that the maximum possible sum is the sum of the k largest elements in the array. However, this is only possible if there exists a way to split the array into k contiguous segments, each containing one of these k elements. But how to ensure that?\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 1, 5, 1, 5], and k=3. The three largest elements are 5, 5, 5. We can split into [5], [1,5], [1,5], sum is 5+5+5=15. Which is the sum of the three largest elements.\n\nAnother example: [5, 1, 5, 1, 5], k=2. The two largest are 5 and 5. The optimal split is [5,1,5,1,5], sum 5. Or split into [5,1,5], [1,5], sum is 5 +5 =10. Or [5], [1,5,1,5], sum 5+5=10. So the maximum sum is 10, which is the sum of the two largest elements.\n\nSo it seems that the maximum possible sum is indeed the sum of the k largest elements. But how to achieve this?\n\nIf this is true, then the problem reduces to selecting the k largest elements and ensuring that each of them is in its own segment. However, since the segments are contiguous, this requires that the positions of the k largest elements are such that they can be separated into different segments.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [3, 1, 2, 4], and k=2. The two largest elements are 4 and 3. To have each in their own segment, the split must be [3,1,2], [4], which gives sum 3+4=7. Alternatively, [3], [1,2,4], sum is 3+4=7. But what if the array is [3, 4, 1, 2], and k=2? The two largest are 4 and 3. Split into [3,4], [1,2], sum is 4+2=6. Or [3], [4,1,2], sum 3+4=7. So it works.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 3, 4], k=2. The two largest are 5 and 4. Split into [5], [3,4], sum is 5+4=9. Which is correct. But if the array is [5, 4, 3], then the same applies.\n\nSo it seems that the optimal solution is to select the k largest elements, and split the array into segments such that each of these elements is in its own segment. However, how to do that?\n\nBut how to find the positions of these elements and split the array accordingly?\n\nBut how to ensure that the segments are contiguous and that the split is possible?\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be transformed into selecting the k largest elements and arranging the splits so that each is in its own segment. But how to implement this?\n\nBut this approach might not work for all cases. For example, consider an array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and k=3. The three largest elements are 5,4,3. The optimal split would be [5], [4], [3,2,1], giving sum 5+4+3=12. Which is indeed the sum of the three largest elements. But what if the array is [5, 4, 3, 6, 2, 1], and k=3. The three largest are 6,5,4. To split into segments containing these elements, we need to have each of them in separate segments. The optimal split would be [5,4,3,6], [2], [1]. But no, because that would give maxima 6, 2, 1. Sum is 9. But if we split into [5,4,3,6], [2,1], but that's only two segments. Wait, k=3. So we need three segments. For example, [5,4], [3,6], [2,1]. The maxima are 5, 6, 2. Sum is 13. Which is higher than the sum of the three largest elements (6+5+4=15). Wait, no! Wait 6+5+4 is 15, but in this example, the sum of the maxima would be 5+6+2 = 13. So this contradicts the earlier hypothesis that the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements.\n\nWait, what's wrong here? Let me recheck.\n\nIn the array [5,4,3,6,2,1], the three largest elements are 6,5,4. So their sum is 15. Can we split the array into three segments, each containing one of these elements?\n\nYes. For example:\n\nSegment 1: [5,4,3,6] → max 6.\n\nSegment 2: [2] → max 2.\n\nSegment 3: [1] → max 1. Sum is 6+2+1=9. No, that's worse.\n\nBut another split:\n\nSegment 1: [5], segment 2: [4,3,6], segment 3: [2,1]. Maxima 5,6,2. Sum is 13.\n\nBut what about segment 1: [5,4], segment 2: [3,6], segment 3: [2,1]. Sum is 5 + 6 + 2 = 13.\n\nAlternatively, segment 1: [5,4,3], segment 2: [6], segment 3: [2,1]. Sum is 5+6+2=13.\n\nBut the sum of the three largest elements is 6+5+4=15. How can we achieve this?\n\nAh! If the segments are [5], [4,3,6], [2,1], then the maxima are 5, 6, 2. Sum is 13. But the three largest elements are 6,5,4. How to get the sum of 6+5+4=15?\n\nTo have each of these elements in separate segments.\n\nFor example, segment 1: [5], segment 2: [4], segment 3: [3,6,2,1]. The maxima are 5,4,6. Sum is 5+4+6=15. Yes! That's possible. So this is a valid split.\n\nSo the split would be [5], [4], [3,6,2,1]. The sum is 5+4+6=15.\n\nSo the maximum sum is indeed the sum of the k largest elements. So why didn't I think of that earlier?\n\nBecause the third segment includes the 6, which is one of the largest elements. But the segment [4] is the second segment, and [5] is the first. So the sum is 5+4+6 = 15, which equals the sum of the three largest elements.\n\nSo this suggests that the maximum sum is indeed the sum of the k largest elements. And the way to achieve this is to split the array into segments such that each of the k largest elements is in its own segment. But how to ensure that?\n\nThus, the problem reduces to selecting the k largest elements and ensuring that they are in separate segments. But how to do this?\n\nSo, the plan would be:\n\n1. Find the k largest elements in the array.\n\n2. Ensure that each of these elements is in its own segment.\n\nBut how to do this? Well, since the array must be split into contiguous segments, the positions of these elements must be such that they are not overlapping. For example, the first segment ends before the second segment starts, etc.\n\nBut how to choose the segments to include each of the k largest elements?\n\nThis sounds like a greedy approach: select the positions of the k largest elements, and split the array such that each of them is in a separate segment.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- Collect the indices of the k largest elements. Let's say we sort the elements along with their indices in descending order, and pick the first k elements. But if there are duplicates, we need to choose their positions carefully.\n\n- Then, arrange these positions in the order they appear in the array. For example, if the k largest elements are at positions p1, p2, ..., pk, sorted in increasing order.\n\n- Then, the segments would be:\n\n   segment 1: from start to p1.\n\n   segment 2: from p1+1 to p2.\n\n   ... \n\n   segment k: from pk-1+1 to end.\n\nBut this would ensure that each of the k largest elements is in its own segment, and the segments are contiguous.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements with the same value? For example, if the array is [5,5,5], and k=2. The two largest elements are both 5. We can split into [5], [5,5], giving sum 5+5=10. Or [5,5], [5], sum 5+5=10. Either way, the sum is 10, which is the sum of the two largest elements.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Select the k largest elements, and split the array so that each of these elements is in a separate segment.\n\nBut how to choose which elements to select, especially when there are ties?\n\nBut in any case, the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements.\n\nIf this is true, then the problem becomes much simpler. We can compute the sum of the k largest elements, and then find a way to split the array into k segments such that each of these elements is in its own segment.\n\nBut how to find this split?\n\nLet's think about the following algorithm:\n\n- Find all the positions of the k largest elements. For example, collect all elements, sort them in descending order, and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to split a list of problems into exactly `k` days such that the total profit, defined as the sum of the maximum difficulty of each day's problems, is maximized. The solution involves using dynamic programming (DP) with precomputed maximum values for subarrays to efficiently determine the optimal splits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum total profit for the first `i` problems split into `j` days.\n2. **Precompute Maximum Values**: Use a 2D array `max_range` where `max_range[i][j]` stores the maximum value of the subarray from index `i` to `j`. This helps in quickly determining the maximum difficulty of any segment during DP transitions.\n3. **DP Transitions**: For each possible number of days `j` and each possible number of problems `i`, compute the maximum profit by considering all possible previous splits and using the precomputed maximum values.\n4. **Reconstruct the Solution**: After computing the DP table, backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact distribution of problems across the days.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute max_range[i][j] = max(a[i..j])\n    max_range = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_max = a[i]\n        max_range[i][i] = current_max\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            current_max = max(current_max, a[j])\n            max_range[i][j] = current_max\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    INF = float('-inf')\n    dp = [[INF]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            if j > i:\n                continue\n            for m in range(j-1, i):\n                if dp[m][j-1] != INF:\n                    current_max = max_range[m][i-1]\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n    \n    # Now reconstruct the answer\n    res = []\n    curr_i = n\n    curr_j = k\n    while curr_j > 0:\n        if curr_j == 1:\n            res.append(curr_i)\n            break\n        for m in range(curr_j-1, curr_i):\n            if dp[curr_i][curr_j] == dp[m][curr_j-1] + max_range[m][curr_i-1]:\n                res.append(curr_i - m)\n                curr_i = m\n                curr_j -= 1\n                break\n    \n    res.reverse()\n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximum Values**: The `max_range` array is filled such that `max_range[i][j]` holds the maximum value from index `i` to `j` in the input array. This allows O(1) access to the maximum value of any subarray during DP transitions.\n2. **DP Initialization**: The `dp` table is initialized with `-inf` to represent impossible states, except `dp[0][0]` which is 0 (zero problems, zero days).\n3. **DP Transitions**: For each number of problems `i` and days `j`, we consider all possible previous splits `m` and update the DP table using the precomputed maximum values.\n4. **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact distribution of problems across the days by checking which splits yield the maximum profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal splits using dynamic programming and precomputed maximum values, leading to an optimal solution for the given constraints.",
