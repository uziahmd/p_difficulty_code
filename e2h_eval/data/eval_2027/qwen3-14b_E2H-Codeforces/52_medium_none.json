Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones into new candles. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take 'b' of them to make a new one. And this new one can be used again, and so on. The question is to find the total hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned ones are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are burned, so he can make 2/2 = 1 new. Uses that, adding 1 hour. Now, that one is burned, but he can't make another since 1 < 2. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Oh right, that's how it works.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStart with 'a' candles. Each time you burn a candle, you get one burned candle. Then, whenever you have enough burned candles (>=b), you can make new ones. Each time you make a new candle, you subtract 'b' burned ones and add 1 new candle. But that new candle will be burned again, adding to the total hours and eventually becoming another burned candle.\n\nSo maybe we can model this with a loop. Let's think:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\nburned_candles = 0\n\nBut wait, initially, he uses all the 'a' candles. So:\n\ntotal_hours starts as 'a', and then burned_candles is also 'a'.\n\nThen, while burned_candles >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned_candles // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    burned_candles = (burned_candles % b) + new_candles\n\nRepeat until burned_candles < b.\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me test this with the first example.\n\nExample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 4, burned_candles =4.\n\nLoop:\n\n4 >=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. burned_candles is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles=2//2=1. total is 6+1=7. burned_candles is 0 +1=1. Now, 1 <2, so stop. Total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input 6 3. Output is 8.\n\nInitial total is 6, burned_candles=6.\n\nFirst loop: 6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. burned_candles is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So total is 8. Which matches the sample. Wait, but what about the 2 burned candles? Can't make any more. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5, burned is 5. Then 5//5=1. total becomes 6. burned is 0 +1=1. Then no more. So total 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 5, burned is 5.\n\nFirst loop: 5//3=1, total becomes 5+1=6. burned is 5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nAgain, 3 >=3. So 3//3=1. total is 6+1=7. burned is 0 +1=1. So total is 7.\n\nSo the process works.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new = burned // b\n\n    total_hours += new\n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new\n\nreturn total_hours\n\nYes. So the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nWe need to read two integers from input. But the input is given as a list of test cases, like in the example. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is a single line with two integers. But in the example, the input is given as ['4 2', '6 3'] which is probably for multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is described as \"the single line contains two integers a and b\". But the example shows two inputs, perhaps for multiple test cases. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem's input is a single line, but in the example, there are two inputs. Wait, maybe the problem is that the user has to read multiple test cases, each being a line with a and b?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the input section, it says: \"The single line contains two integers...\" So for each test case, the input is a single line. But in the example, the input is given as two lines, perhaps for two test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, perhaps the example shows two different test cases, but the actual code should read one line per test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the code must read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows two test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single line. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['7', '8']\n\nBut in reality, the input is two lines, each with a and b. So perhaps the code needs to read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read one line, but in the sample, there are two test cases. Maybe the problem is that the original problem is from a programming competition where the input may have multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the actual code needs to read one line of input.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. For example, the first line of input is the number of test cases, but the problem's input description says that the input is a single line. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\nSo the input is a single line with two integers. But the sample input shows two lines. That's conflicting. But perhaps in the sample input, the first line is 4 2, and the second line is 6 3, but the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one line.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So for example, if the input is given as two lines, then the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's not matching the actual input. Or perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is given as two test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line. But how can that be?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process each line as a separate test case. For example, the code may read all lines from stdin, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect, or perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows two test cases. For example, the first input is '4 2' and output is 7, and the second input is '6 3' and output is 8. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input is a single line. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read a single line, but in the sample, the input is given as two lines. So maybe the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on their own line. For example, the code should read all lines from input, and for each line, process a and b.\n\nBut how to handle that? Well, the code should read from stdin. So in Python, perhaps the code should read all lines, split them into a and b, and process each line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list, but in reality, the input is one line. For example, perhaps the sample input is actually two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input is given as a list of two elements, perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So I'm confused.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input and output:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers. The output is a single integer. So the sample input is given as two test cases, but perhaps the user is supposed to process each line as a separate test case. However, the problem's original description may be from a source where the input is multiple test cases. For example, in some programming competition problems, the input may have multiple test cases, but the problem statement says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the problem statement is wrong, but the sample shows that for two test cases, the code should output two lines.\n\nBut the user's task is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin and outputs the correct answer. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a test case.\n\nBut how can we know? Well, the sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output shows two answers. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. But perhaps that's a mistake. For example, maybe the problem is from Codeforces or similar, where the input is multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut given that the user's sample input is given as a list of two strings, perhaps the code should read multiple lines. So in the code, perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a test case, and output the corresponding answer.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nFor example, the code could read all lines from stdin, split each into a and b, compute the answer for each, and print each answer on a separate line.\n\nBut the original problem's input may be only one line. However, the sample shows two test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each given on a separate line.\n\nIn that case, the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    a, b = map(int, line.strip().split())\n    # compute the answer and print\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a single line, but the sample shows two lines, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read a single line, but the sample input is given as two test cases. However, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read a single line. For example, the sample input is given as two test cases, but the code is supposed to read one line, and the sample output is given as two outputs. But that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is a single line, and the sample input is given as two lines, but that's a mistake. So perhaps the code should read a single line, and the sample input is just two examples.\n\nBut in that case, the code would read a single line, and process it. But the sample input shows two lines, but the sample output shows two outputs. So perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code needs to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line. Because the sample input and output show that.\n\nSo the code will read each line, split into a and b, compute the answer, and print.\n\nNow, the algorithm for each test case is as discussed.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead each line from stdin.\n\nFor each line:\n\nsplit into a and b.\n\ncompute total_hours as follows:\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new = burned // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burned = burned % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing this with the sample input:\n\nFor 4 2:\n\ntotal starts as 4, burned 4.\n\nLoop: 4//2=2, total 6. burned is 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1, total 7. burned is 0 +1=1. Now stop. So output 7.\n\nFor 6 3:\n\ntotal is 6, burned 6.\n\n6//3=2, total 8. burned is 0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 5 + 1 =6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. As discussed, output is 7.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead lines from stdin. For each line, process as a and b.\n\nBut how to read from stdin? For example, in Python, the code can be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    a, b = map(int, line.strip().split())\n    # compute and print\n\nBut for cases where there are multiple test cases.\n\nBut what if the input is given as a single line, like in the problem statement's description? Well, the code would process that line, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines, which would be processed as two test cases.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead all lines, for each line, process a and b, compute the answer.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_hours(a, b):\n    total = a\n    burned = a\n    while burned >= b:\n        new = burned // b\n        total += new\n        burned = burned % b + new\n    return total\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    line = line.strip()\n    if not line:\n        continue\n    a, b = map(int, line.split())\n    print(calculate_hours(a, b))\n\nBut perhaps the code needs to handle cases where there are multiple test cases, but in the problem's input, it's only one line. But regardless, the code will handle that.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 2\n\n6 3\n\nSample Output:\n\n7\n\n8\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5 → 6.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=2 → 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2 → 2 + 1 =3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can illuminate his room with candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out candles into new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and recycling the remnants optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`. Each candle burns for one hour.\n2. **Track Burned Candles**: After burning all initial candles, keep track of the number of burned-out candles.\n3. **Recycle Burned Candles**: Use the recycled candles to make new ones as long as there are enough burned-out candles to form a new one. This is done by repeatedly converting `b` burned-out candles into 1 new candle.\n4. **Iterative Process**: Continue the process of burning new candles and recycling the burned-out ones until there are not enough burned-out candles left to form a new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_hours(a, b):\n    total = a\n    burned = a\n    while burned >= b:\n        new = burned // b\n        total += new\n        burned = burned % b + new\n    return total\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    line = line.strip()\n    if not line:\n        continue\n    a, b = map(int, line.split())\n    print(calculate_hours(a, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each containing two integers `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of burned-out candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initial Calculation**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` since each candle burns for one hour.\n3. **Tracking Burned Candles**: After burning all initial candles, the number of burned-out candles is tracked.\n4. **Recycling Process**: The loop continues to convert burned-out candles into new ones as long as there are enough. Each iteration reduces the count of burned-out candles and increases the total hours by the number of new candles made.\n5. **Termination Condition**: The loop stops when there are not enough burned-out candles left to form a new one.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum number of hours Vasily can illuminate his room using the given number of candles and their recycling rules.",
