He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find these n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or some other count?) that satisfy this. Wait, the example shows for m=1, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Wait why? Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors, but the count remains the same until the next multiple of 5. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nFor example, 5! has 1 zero. 6! is 720, which also ends with one zero. Similarly, 7! is 5040, same. 8! is 40320, same. 9! is 362880. Then 10! has two zeros. So between 5 and 9 inclusive, there are 5 numbers where the trailing zero count is exactly 1. So for m=1, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key here is that for certain m values, there may be multiple n's that produce exactly m zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nThe approach I need to take is:\n\n1. Find all n's where the number of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that would result in exactly m zeros. Let's think about how the trailing zero count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, it adds at least one zero. If it's a multiple of 25, then it adds two, etc.\n\nSo for a given m, there might be a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I can find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there are either 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, the example shows 5 numbers. But why?\n\nWait, let's think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. For numbers between 5k and 5k+4, the f(n) would be the same as for 5k. Unless there's another multiple of 5 in that range. For example, when n is 25, which is 5^2. Then f(25) = 6 (since 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So for numbers from 25 to 29, the count would be 6. But when you reach 30, which is 5*6, then f(30) is 7 (since 30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). So between 25 and 29, the count is 6. So that's 5 numbers (25,26,27,28,29) that give 6 zeros. So again, 5 numbers. But wait, what if m is 6? Then the answer would be 5 numbers. But what if m is 5?\n\nWait, for example, let's compute f(24). Let's see:\n\nf(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. Then 25 gives 6. So there's a jump from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there is no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Hence, the answer would be 0. So in this case, for m=5, there are zero numbers.\n\nAh, so this suggests that for some m, there are no n's. So the problem requires us to check if such m exists.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that $ n! $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes in factorials are formed and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are always more factors of 2 than 5, and each pair of 2 and 5 contributes to one trailing zero. Thus, the count of trailing zeroes is given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis function increases in a non-linear way, meaning that for some values of $ m $, there may be multiple values of $ n $ that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes, while for others, there may be none.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to find the smallest and largest values of $ n $ that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes.\n2. **Check Validity**: After finding these bounds, check if they exist (i.e., whether any $ n $ gives exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes).\n3. **Generate Results**: If such values exist, generate all integers between the smallest and largest $ n $ that yield exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Binary search to find the lower bound of n with exactly m trailing zeros\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    left = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    left = low\n\n    # Binary search to find the upper bound of n with exactly m trailing zeros\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    right = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    right = high\n\n    # Check if the count of zeros for left is m\n    if count_trailing_zeros(left) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # Now collect all numbers from left to right inclusive\n    return list(range(left, right + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    inputs = input_line.split()\n    results = []\n    for m_str in inputs:\n        m = int(m_str)\n        n_list = find_n_values(m)\n        results.append(str(len(n_list)))\n        if len(n_list) > 0:\n            results.append(' '.join(map(str, n_list)))\n        else:\n            results.append('')\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`count_trailing_zeros(n)`**: Computes the number of trailing zeroes in $ n! $ using the standard method of summing floor divisions by increasing powers of 5.\n- **`find_n_values(m)`**: Uses binary search to find the range of $ n $ values that yield exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes.
