He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is, given an integer m, find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then output that count followed by the sorted list of such n's.\n\nHmm. So first, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s.\n\nThe formula for trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo for a given m, we need to find all n's where this sum equals m.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nFirst, let's think about how the trailing zero count changes as n increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases. Because adding a new number might add more factors of 5.\n\nWait, but sometimes when you cross a multiple of 5, like say 25, then you get an extra zero. So the count increases by 1 each time you hit a multiple of 5, but for multiples of 25, it's two, etc.\n\nBut the key point here is that for a given m, there could be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how many?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's see why. The trailing zeros for 5! is 1. For 6! it's also 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly for 7, 8, 9. But when you reach 10, it's 2 zeros. So between 5 and 9, there are 5 numbers that have exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\nSo the idea is that for some m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe more?\n\nWait, but how can there be more than 5? Let's think. Suppose m is such that there's a range of numbers where the trailing zero count is m. For example, if there's a number n where the count increases by 1, then the numbers after that until the next multiple of 5 would have the same count.\n\nBut the problem is that when you have numbers that are multiples of higher powers of 5, like 25, 50, etc., the count increases by more than 1. For example, 25! has 6 trailing zeros (25/5 = 5, plus 25/25=1, total 6). So when n increases from 24 to 25, the count jumps from 4 (for 24) to 6 (for 25). So between 25 and 29, the count is 6. So for m=6, the numbers would be 25,26,27,28,29. So five numbers again.\n\nWait, but what if there's a case where the count jumps by more than 1? Like, say, when n crosses a multiple of 5^k. For example, consider m=5. Let's see:\n\nLet's compute the trailing zeros for numbers around 25.\n\nn=24: floor(24/5)=4, floor(24/25)=0. Total 4.\n\nn=25: 5 + 1 = 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there are no n's. Because there's no n where the count is exactly 5. So in that case, the answer is zero.\n\nSo, the problem is to find for a given m, if there exists any n such that the count is m. And if so, how many such n's are there.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFirst, find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the steps needed:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that n?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's lie in a certain range. But how?\n\nAnother approach is to note that the number of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function as n increases. So for each m, there's a range of n's where the count is m. However, when there's a jump in the count",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of numbers that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n\n2. **Finding Trailing Zeros**: For a given number `n`, the number of trailing zeros can be calculated using the formula: \n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n\n3. **Binary Search for Range**: To find the minimum and maximum values of `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the possible range of `n`.\n\n4. **Checking Validity**: Once we find the range of `n` values, we check if they indeed result in exactly `m` trailing zeros. If no such `n` exists, we return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) <= m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low - 1\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if m == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    \n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    max_n = find_max_n(m)\n    \n    if count_zeros(min_n) != m:\n        print(\"0\")\n    else:\n        count = max_n - min_n + 1\n        print(count)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, max_n + 1))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing up the quotients.\n\n2. **find_min_n(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest number `n` such that `n!` has at least `m` trailing zeros.\n\n3. **find_max_n(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the largest number `n` such that `n!` has at most `m` trailing zeros.\n\n4. **main()**: This function reads the input value `m`, determines the range of valid `n` values using the helper functions, checks if such values exist, and prints the results accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `n` using binary search, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and handles edge cases effectively.",
