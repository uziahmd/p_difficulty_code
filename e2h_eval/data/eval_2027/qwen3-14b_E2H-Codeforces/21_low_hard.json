The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm. Let me think about the parity here. Because if a_i is even, then adding a key with an odd number would make the sum odd. Similarly, if a_i is odd, then adding an even key would make the sum odd. So, the key's parity needs to be opposite to the chest's parity.\n\nSo, the approach should be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, for the keys, count how many are even and how many are odd. Because each even chest needs an odd key, and each odd chest needs an even key. But since each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once, we need to find the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. That sum would be the maximum possible chests opened.\n\nWait, right! Because for example, if there are 3 even chests and 5 odd keys, then we can open 3 chests (each even chest uses an odd key). Similarly, if there are 2 odd chests and 4 even keys, then we can open 2 chests. So total is 3+2=5. But if the numbers are like, even chests are 3 and odd keys are 2, then the min is 2. So adding those two minima gives the total.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parities:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7).\n\nThen min(even_chests=3, odd_keys=1) is 1. min(odd_chests=2, even_keys=3) is 2. Total 3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nChests: 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0.\n\nKeys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0.\n\nSo min(5,1) is 1. min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests=1, odd_chests=0. Keys even=4, odd=0. So min(1,0) is 0. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nWe need to read n and m, then the list of a_i, then the list of b_j.\n\nThen count:\n\neven_chest = number of a_i even.\n\nodd_chest = n - even_chest.\n\nSimilarly for keys:\n\neven_key = number of b_j even.\n\nodd_key = m - even_key.\n\nThen answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes. So the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd?\n\nFor each number in a, check if it's even (mod 2 is 0). Same for b.\n\nBut since the numbers can be up to 1e9, but in Python, checking mod 2 is O(1) per element, so overall O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for n and m up to 1e5.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nLet me code this.\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the next line as list of integers for a. Then the next line for b.\n\nThen count even_chest and even_key.\n\nThen compute the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This translates to checking the parity (even or odd) of the numbers on the chests and keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers. Similarly, count how many keys have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n2. **Match Parities**: For a chest with an even number, it can be opened by a key with an odd number, and vice versa. Therefore, the maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the number of even chests and odd keys, plus the minimum of the number of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We iterate through the list of chest numbers and key numbers to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Calculating Result**: Using the counts of even and odd chests and keys, we determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The result is the sum of these two minimum values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the solution in linear time relative to the number of chests and keys, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
