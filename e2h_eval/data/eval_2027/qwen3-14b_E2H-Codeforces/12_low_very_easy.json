The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks in certain houses arranged in a ringroad. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. \n\nSo, the problem says that each task i requires her to be in house ai, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). Oh right, and moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Also, the houses are arranged in a circle, clockwise. So moving from house n to 1 would take 1 step, but moving from 1 to n would take n-1 steps if going clockwise? Wait, no. Because the movement is only clockwise. So moving from house x to house y in clockwise direction: the time is (y - x) mod n if moving forward. Wait, no. Let me think. If Xenia is at house 1 and needs to get to house 3, then moving clockwise takes 2 steps (1→2→3). But if she's at house 4 and needs to get to house 1, moving clockwise would take 1 step (since it's a ringroad). So the time between two houses x and y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - x + y). Or maybe (y - x + n) % n? That would give the correct number of steps. For example, when x=4, y=1: (1-4 +4) mod 4 = 1 mod 4 = 1. Which is correct. So the formula for the time between x and y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + n). Which can be written as (y -x + n) % n. But since we need to compute the time to move from current position to next target, we need to calculate that.\n\nBut how do we model the movement? Let's think about the process. Xenia starts at house 1. Then, for each task in order, she needs to move to the required house. But since the tasks have to be done in order, and each task depends on the previous ones, we have to process them sequentially.\n\nFor example, let's take the first sample input: n=4, m=3, tasks [3,2,3]. So the steps are:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. So she needs to move from 1 to 3. How many steps? Clockwise: 2 steps (1→2→3). Then she does the task. Then the second task is 2. But she's currently at 3. So moving from 3 to 2 clockwise. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going around the entire loop. Wait, no. Wait, the movement is clockwise. So from 3, moving clockwise to 4, then to 1, then to 2. That's 3 steps. So the time is 3 steps. Then she does the second task. Then the third task is 3. She's at 2. Moving to 3 is 1 step. So total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive task, we calculate the time needed to move from the current position to the next target, and accumulate that.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Keep track of the current position (initially 1).\n\n- For each task in the list, compute the time to move from current position to the target ai, then add that to the total time. Then update the current position to ai.\n\nBut how do we compute the time between current and ai?\n\nLet me think. Let's say current is at pos, and the next target is a_i. The number of steps is (a_i - pos) if a_i >= pos. Otherwise, (n - pos + a_i). Alternatively, (a_i - pos + n) % n. But since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\nWait, for example, pos=3, a_i=2. Then (2-3 +4) mod 4 = (-1 +4) mod4= 3 mod4=3. Which is correct.\n\nYes, that formula works.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total_time = 0\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\nfor each ai in the list of tasks:\n\n    if ai == current_pos: continue (no time needed)\n\n    else:\n\n        steps = (ai - current_pos + n) % n\n\n        total_time += steps\n\n        current_pos = ai\n\nSo, that's the plan. Now, let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample: tasks [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3. steps",
