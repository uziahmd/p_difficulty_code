The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task must be done in a specific house, and she can only do the i-th task after all tasks before it (with numbers less than i) are done. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nHmm, the input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks). Then the list of a_i's. The initial position is house 1.\n\nSo, the main thing is to calculate the total time she moves from one house to another, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks have to be done in order, and each task's position is given, we need to compute the cumulative movement between consecutive tasks.\n\nWait, but how does the movement work? Since the ringroad is a circle, moving clockwise. So, moving from house x to house y (clockwise) takes (y - x) mod n steps if y >=x? Or wait, no. Because if x is 3 and y is 2, then moving clockwise would require going through 4, 1, 2. Which is (n - x + y) steps? Let me think. For example, n=4. From 3 to 2: moving clockwise, you go 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) mod 4? Well, (2-3) is -1, adding 4 gives 3. So yes. So the formula for moving from current position to next target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). But since the movement is clockwise, the time between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). But since the movement is along the ringroad, which is one way, the time is (target - current) % n if moving clockwise? Wait, no. Because when target is less than current, like current is 3 and target is 2, the distance is (n - current + target) steps. So the general formula is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which can be written as (target - current) % n if the mod is handled properly. Wait, for example, (2-3) mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the time between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Alternatively, (target - current + n) % n. Because if target is larger, then (target - current) is positive, mod n would be same. If target is smaller, then (target - current) is negative, adding n and mod n gives the correct steps.\n\nBut since in the problem, the movement is always clockwise, so the time between current position and next target is (target - current) if target is >= current, else (target - current + n). So for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to calculate the time between them and sum them up.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in order. So the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So Xenia starts at 1, then moves to a_1, then from a_1 to a_2, then from a_2 to a_3, etc. But wait, the problem says that she needs to complete all tasks with numbers less than i before doing the i-th task. So the order is that the tasks are processed in the order given. So the sequence of positions is 1 → a_1 → a_2 → ... → a_{m-1} → a_m. But wait, no. Because the first task is a_1. So she has to be at a_1 to complete it. Then for the second task, she must be at a_2, but she can only do that after completing the first task. So the movement is from a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of the time taken between each consecutive pair of positions, starting from 1, then to a_1, then to a_2, etc.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple tasks in the same house? Like if a_1 is 3, a_2 is 3, then moving from a_1 to a_2 takes zero time. So the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So in that case, the movement between those tasks is zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   calculate the time to move from current position to a_i, add that to total time.\n\n   update current position to a",
