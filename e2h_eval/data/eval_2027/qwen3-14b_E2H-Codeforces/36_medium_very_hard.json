The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the conditions required for such a configuration to exist. The key seems to be how the towers are placed. For example, if there's a tower in town i, then its signal power must cover certain towns without overlapping with others. But how?\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. Each town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered. So, for any tower, its signal power p must be chosen such that it doesn't reach beyond its intended coverage.\n\nWait, the signal from a tower at i with power p reaches all cities c where |c -i| < p. So, the range is from i-p+1 to i+p-1. Wait, no. Because if p is the power, then the distance is less than p. So, for example, if p=2, then the tower at i covers i-1, i, i+1? Because |c -i| < 2 implies c can be i-1 (distance 1), i (distance 0), or i+1 (distance 1). So, the coverage is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), inclusive. So, the length of coverage is 2p-1. But the tower's own town is covered (distance zero).\n\nBut for the problem, the coverage needs to exactly cover each town once. Also, town 0 and n+1 must not be covered. So, for example, if there's a tower in town 1, then its signal power p must be such that 1 - p + 1 > 0? Wait, no. Let's think: the signal from tower at i with power p reaches town 0 only if |0 - i| < p → i < p. So, for town 0 not to be covered, any tower at position i must have p ≤ i. Similarly, for town n+1, any tower at position j must have p ≤ (n+1 - j). So, for a tower at position i, the maximum possible p is min(i, n+1 -i). But since we need to avoid covering town 0 and n+1, the power p must be chosen so that the coverage does not reach those.\n\nBut how do we arrange the towers so that their coverage regions exactly partition the towns 1..n, with each covered exactly once?\n\nThis feels similar to tiling or interval covering. Maybe the problem reduces to certain configurations of towers that can be arranged in a way that they can cover the towns without overlapping and without covering the ends.\n\nLet me think of possible valid tower configurations. For example, if there's a tower in town i, and it covers from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). But since the coverage must not reach town 0 or n+1, the p for each tower is limited. For example, if a tower is at position i, then p can be at most i (so that i - p + 1 ≥ 1?), wait:\n\nWait, for town 0 not to be covered, the tower's coverage must not reach 0. So for any tower at i, the signal power p must satisfy that i - p + 1 > 0 → p < i + 1 → p ≤ i. Similarly, for the right end, the coverage must not reach n+1. So, i + p - 1 < n+1 → p < (n+1 - i + 1) → p ≤ n - i + 1? Wait, solving i + p - 1 < n+1 → p < n+1 -i +1 → p < n -i + 2? Wait:\n\ni + p -1 < n+1 → p < n+1 - i +1 → p < n -i + 2? Wait, solving for p:\n\ni + p -1 < n +1 → p < (n +1) - i + 1 → p < n - i + 2 → p ≤ n - i + 1.\n\nSo for a tower at position i, the maximum allowed p is min(i, n - i + 1). But regardless, the choice of p must be such that the coverage does not reach the ends.\n\nBut how does this relate to the arrangement of towers? Let's think of the coverage regions. Each tower's coverage must be a contiguous segment of towns, and these segments must be non-overlapping and cover all towns 1..n exactly once.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a set of towers (positions) such that the towns can be partitioned into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower, and each interval is centered at a tower's position. Moreover, for each interval [a, b], the center is at i, and the length of the interval is 2p-1, where p is the signal power. Since the interval must be symmetric around i, the length is 2p-1. So, for example, if a tower at i covers from i - k to i + k, then the length is 2k+1, which would require p = k+1. But since the coverage must not reach the ends, for the left end of the interval, i -k ≥ 1, and for the right end, i +k ≤ n.\n\nWait, but the coverage of a tower with power p is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). So, the entire interval [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)] must lie within [1, n]. Because otherwise, it would cover town 0 or n+1. So, for each tower, the maximum possible p is such that i - (p-1) ≥ 1 and i + (p-1) ≤ n. Which gives p-1 ≤ i -1 → p ≤ i, and p-1 ≤ n - i → p ≤ n -i + 1. So p can be up to min(i, n -i + 1). \n\nBut the key is that the coverage intervals must be non-overlapping and cover all towns exactly once. How can such a configuration be achieved?\n\nThis seems similar to domino tiling or some kind of partitioning. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a valid configuration for the first k towns. How can we extend it?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as requiring that the towers are placed in such a way that each tower's coverage is exactly a certain interval, and these intervals form a partition of [1..n].\n\nFor example, consider that each tower must cover an interval of length 2p-1. For the tower to cover exactly that interval, the next tower must start after that interval. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as choosing a set of positions where each tower is responsible for covering a certain range. For instance, each tower must be the unique one covering its position, and the ranges must not overlap.\n\nAnother approach: For the configuration to be possible, the set of towers must be such that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain structure. For example, suppose we have towers at positions i and j, with i < j. Then, the coverage of i must end before j starts, and the coverage of j must start after i ends. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as requiring that the towers are placed in such a way that each tower is responsible for a certain segment of towns, and the segments are non-overlapping and cover all towns. For example, the segments could be of varying lengths, but each is centered at a tower.\n\nLet me think of possible valid tower arrangements. For example, if there is exactly one tower in the middle of the line. Then, its power can be set to cover the entire range. But that's possible only if the tower is at position i where i is such that min(i, n - i + 1) ≥ (n)/2. For example, when n is even, the middle positions are n/2 and n/2 +1. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to the problem of arranging dominoes or tiles. Let's model it with dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (towns 1 to i) that satisfy the conditions. Then, we can find a recurrence relation.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think. For the first i towns to be covered properly, the last tower must be placed at some position j, and it covers from j - (p-1) to j + (p-1). Since the coverage must end at i, then j + (p-1) = i. Also, the coverage must start at some position a, which is j - (p-1) = a. But since the previous towns must be covered by other towers, perhaps the recurrence is based on adding a new tower that covers the last few towns.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the last tower must cover the last town (i) and possibly some before. Let's think of the possible ways to end the coverage. For example, the last tower could be at position i, and it covers from i - (p-1) to i. The maximum p here is such that i - (p-1) ≥ 1. So p can be up to i. But since the coverage ends at i, the p must be such that j + (p-1) = i. If the tower is at position j, then j + (p-1) = i → p = i - j + 1. Also, since the coverage must not reach town 0, the starting point is j - (p-1) = j - (i -j) = 2j -i. This must be ≥ 1. So 2j - i ≥ 1 → j ≥ (i +1)/2. \n\nBut for the tower at position j, the coverage starts at 2j - i and ends at i. So, the previous part (from 1 to 2j -i -1) must be covered by a valid configuration. But how?\n\nSo, the recurrence could be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} (dp[2j - i - 1]) * (probability that the tower is placed at j and others are placed appropriately?)\n\nWait, but this seems like it's modeling the number of valid configurations. However, since the towers are built with probability 1/2 each, the total number of valid configurations is multiplied by 1/(2^n), but the problem requires us to calculate the probability. However, the DP approach would need to account for the number of valid subsets of towers (those that allow a valid signal setup) and then divide by 2^n.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S of {1, 2, ..., n} such that there exists a way to assign signal powers as per the problem's constraints. Then, the answer is (number of such subsets) / 2^n.\n\nSo, our task is to compute this count, then multiply by the modular inverse of 2^n modulo 998244353.\n\nNow, the key is to find the number of valid subsets S.\n\nHow can we model this with DP?\n\nLet me think again. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid subsets for the first i towns (i.e., towns 1..i) that can be covered under the constraints. Then, for the base case, dp[0] = 1 (empty set, which covers nothing, but maybe that's needed for the recurrence). \n\nFor dp[i], how can we form it? We can consider that the last tower is placed at position j, and it covers from some a to i. Then, the part before a must be covered by a valid subset. So, for each possible j where a = 2j - i (since the coverage of j is from a to i, and the length is i - a + 1 = 2p - 1. Here, p = i - j + 1. So, the coverage starts at j - (p-1) = j - (i -j) = 2j -i. So, the previous part is up to a-1 = 2j -i -1. Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} dp[2j - i -1] * (some factor for the tower at j being present and others not?)\n\nWait, but for the subset S to include j, and not include other towers in the coverage of j. Wait, but the subset S must contain exactly the towers that are used in the coverage. So, for the recurrence, when we choose j as the tower covering from a to i, then in the subset S, j must be present, and no other towers can be in the coverage of j. But since the coverage is from a to i, which is covered by j's tower, any tower in this interval would conflict. Therefore, the subset S must not contain any towers in the interval [a, i], except for j itself.\n\nBut how does that affect the DP? Well, the DP[i] counts the number of valid subsets for the first i towns. So, when we choose j as the tower covering a to i, then the subset S for the first i towns includes j, and the subset for the first a-1 towns is valid. Also, in the interval [a, i], there are no other towers except j. So, for the DP recurrence, we need to ensure that in the interval [a, i], only j is present. But how?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps the way the coverage is structured ensures that the towers are placed in a way that allows this. For example, if the coverage of j is from a to i, then in the DP, the subset S for the first i towns is formed by taking a valid subset for the first a-1 towns and adding the tower j. But then, the towers between a and i (except j) must not be present. However, since the DP counts the number of subsets S that allow for the coverage, perhaps the recurrence assumes that when you choose j as the tower covering a to i, the subset S includes j and excludes all other towers in a to i. But how do we account for that?\n\nAh, here's the thing: the DP[i] represents the number of valid subsets for the first i towns. Each valid subset corresponds to a way to arrange towers such that the coverage conditions are met. So, for the recurrence, when we add a new tower j that covers from a to i, the subset for the first i towns is the subset for the first a-1 towns plus the tower j. However, in this case, the towers in a to i (except j) must not be present. But since the subset for the first a-1 towns is valid, and the subset for the first i towns is that subset plus j, then the towers in a to i (except j) are not in the subset. So, the number of ways for this case is dp[a-1] multiplied by 1 (since j is included and the rest in a..i are excluded).\n\nBut how do we model that? Because the inclusion of j requires that the subset S includes j and excludes all other towers in the coverage area. However, the DP counts the number of subsets S that are valid. So, perhaps the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} dp[a-1], where a = 2j -i, and j must be such that a ≥ 1 and a-1 ≥ 0. Also, j must be in the range [ceil((i + 1)/2), i], because a = 2j - i ≥ 1 → j ≥ (i +1)/2.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible j values. For a given i, the possible positions j for the last tower are those that can cover up to i. For example, if the tower is at j, then the coverage ends at i. So, the maximum coverage length for j is such that j + p -1 = i. But p is the signal power. Also, since the tower is at j, the signal power p must be such that j - p + 1 ≥ 1 (so that it doesn't cover town 0). So, j - p +1 ≥ 1 → p ≤ j. Also, since p = i - j + 1 (because j + p -1 = i → p = i -j +1). Therefore, substituting, we have i -j +1 ≤ j → i +1 ≤ 2j → j ≥ (i+1)/2. So, j can be from ceil( (i+1)/2 ) to i.\n\nTherefore, for each i, the possible j's are from ceil( (i+1)/2 ) to i. And for each such j, the coverage starts at a = 2j - i. Then, the previous part is up to a-1, which must be covered by a valid configuration. Thus, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j = ceil((i+1)/2)}^i dp[ a-1 ] where a = 2j -i.\n\nBut what is a-1? For a = 2j -i, a-1 = 2j -i -1. So, the recurrence becomes:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} dp[2j -i -1]\n\nBut for each j in the valid range.\n\nNow, the base case is dp[0] = 1 (as the empty set for 0 towns). For i=1, the possible j is ceil( (1+1)/2 ) = 1. So j=1. Then a = 2*1 -1 = 1. So a-1 = 0. So dp[1] = dp[0] = 1. Which makes sense: the subset {1} is valid. Because setting the power to 1, which covers town 1. Towns 0 and 2 (n+1 is 2 when i=1, n=1) are not covered. So yes, this is valid.\n\nFor i=2. The possible j's are ceil( (2+1)/2 ) = 2 (since 3/2 is 1.5, ceil is 2). So j can be 2. Then a = 2*2 -2 = 2. a-1 =1. So dp[2] = dp[1] =1. But wait, what about j=1? Because for i=2, j must be ≥ (i+1)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5. So j can be 2. But j=1 would be 1.5, which is less than 1.5? No. Wait, ceil( (i+1)/2 ) for i=2 is ceil(3/2)=2. So j can be 2. So, according to the recurrence, dp[2] = dp[2j -i -1] = dp[2*2 -2 -1] = dp(4-2-1)=dp(1) = 1. So dp[2] = 1. However, in the sample input for n=2, the answer is 1/4. The number of valid subsets is 1 (the subset {1,2} ), which is 1. So the total is 1 / 2^2 = 1/4. Which matches the sample. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about another possibility? For i=2, is there another valid subset? For example, if the subset is {2}, can we set the signal power to 2? Let's see. The tower is at 2. The signal power is 2. The coverage is |c -2| < 2 → c can be 1, 2, 3. But town 3 is n+1 (since n=2). So that would cover town 3, which is invalid. So the maximum p for tower at 2 is min(2, n -2 +1) = min(2, 2-2+1)=1. So p=1. Then coverage is |c-2| < 1 → only town 2. Then town 1 is not covered. So that's invalid. So the only valid subset for i=2 is {1,2} where each has p=1. So the count is 1. Which matches dp[2] = 1.\n\nSo the DP approach seems to work here.\n\nAnother test case: for n=3. According to the sample input, the answer is 1/4. Let's see what dp[3] would be.\n\nFor i=3, the possible j's are ceil( (3+1)/2 ) = 2. So j can be 2 or 3.\n\nFor j=2:\n\na = 2*2 -3 = 1. a-1 = 0. dp[0] =1.\n\nFor j=3:\n\na = 2*3 -3 = 3. a-1 = 2. dp[2] =1.\n\nSo dp[3] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo the number of valid subsets for n=3 is 2. The total is 2 / 2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches the sample. So this seems to work.\n\nSo the recurrence seems correct.\n\nSo the DP[i] can be computed using this recurrence. Now, the problem is to compute dp[n], then multiply by inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently for n up to 2e5. Let's think about the time complexity. For each i, we have O(i) possibilities for j. But that would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2e5.\n\nWe need to find a way to compute this recurrence more efficiently. Let's analyze the recurrence:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j = m}^i dp[2j - i -1], where m is ceil( (i+1)/2 )\n\nLet me denote k = 2j - i -1. Let's express j in terms of k. Rearranged:\n\nk = 2j - i -1 → j = (k + i +1)/2.\n\nBut since j must be an integer, k + i +1 must be even. However, perhaps this isn't helpful directly. Let's think about the possible values of k for a given i.\n\nFor j in [m, i], where m = ceil( (i+1)/2 ), then:\n\nFor j = m, k = 2m -i -1.\n\nFor j = i, k = 2i -i -1 = i-1.\n\nSo the sum over j is equivalent to summing dp[k], where k ranges from (2m -i -1) to (i-1), but with steps depending on j. However, since j increases by 1, and k increases by 2 (since each j increases by 1, k increases by 2*1 = 2). Because for j+1, k_new = 2(j+1) -i -1 = 2j +2 -i -1 = (2j -i -1) + 2 = k_prev + 2.\n\nSo the values of k for j in [m, i] are: starting from k_start = 2m -i -1, and increasing by 2 each step, until k_end = i-1.\n\nSo the sum is over all k in the arithmetic sequence k_start, k_start + 2, ..., k_end.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum quickly?\n\nLet me compute k_start. For m = ceil( (i+1)/2 ), let's compute 2m -i -1.\n\nLet me take i as even and odd cases.\n\nCase 1: i is even. Let i = 2t. Then (i+1)/2 = (2t +1)/2 = t + 0.5 → ceil is t+1. So m = t+1. Then 2m -i -1 = 2(t+1) - 2t -1 = 2t +2 -2t -1 = 1. So k_start is 1. And k_end is i-1 = 2t -1. So the sum is over k=1, 3, 5,..., 2t-1. Which is all odd numbers from 1 to 2t-1.\n\nCase 2: i is odd. Let i = 2t-1. Then (i+1)/2 = (2t)/2 = t. So m = t. Then 2m -i -1 = 2t - (2t-1) -1 = 2t -2t +1 -1 = 0. So k_start is 0. And k_end is i-1 = 2t-2. So the sum is over k=0, 2, 4,..., 2t-2. Which is all even numbers from 0 to 2t-2.\n\nSo for any i, the sum is over all even or odd k's, depending on whether i is even or odd.\n\nBut how can we express this sum in terms of previous dp values?\n\nLet me think: for each i, the sum is the sum of dp[k], where k ranges from k_start to k_end, stepping by 2. Let's denote that as sum_{x} dp[x], where x is in the arithmetic sequence.\n\nTo compute this sum efficiently, we can precompute prefix sums for even and odd indices. For example, we can have two prefix sums: one for even indices and one for odd indices.\n\nLet me think: for each i, the sum is either the sum of dp[k] for even k in some range, or for odd k in some range. So if we can precompute prefix sums for even and odd positions, then for each i, we can compute the required sum quickly.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- even_prefix[i] = sum_{k=0}^{i} dp[k] if k is even.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, for even numbers, we can have a prefix sum array where even_prefix[i] is the sum of dp[0], dp[2], dp[4], ..., up to dp[2m], where 2m ≤ i.\n\nSimilarly for odd_prefix[i], which is the sum of dp[1], dp[3], ..., up to the largest odd ≤ i.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, for each index x, we can have two arrays:\n\n- even_sum[x] = sum_{k=0}^x dp[k] if k is even, else 0.\n\n- odd_sum[x] = sum_{k=0}^x dp[k] if k is odd, else 0.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to precompute for each x, whether it's even or odd, and use prefix sums accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, we can have two separate prefix sums: one for even indices and one for odd indices.\n\nLet me think. For example, for even indices:\n\nLet’s create an array even_sums where even_sums[m] is the sum of dp[0], dp[2], dp[4], ..., dp[2m]. Similarly for odd_sums[m] as the sum of dp[1], dp[3], ..., dp[2m+1].\n\nBut perhaps that's not the best approach. Let me think of the following:\n\nLet’s have two arrays, prefix_even and prefix_odd, where prefix_even[i] is the sum of dp[k] for all even k ≤ i, and prefix_odd[i] is the sum of dp[k] for all odd k ≤ i.\n\nBut how to compute these? For example, for any i, prefix_even[i] = prefix_even[i-1] + (dp[i] if i is even else 0). Similarly for prefix_odd.\n\nBut with this, for any range of even or odd numbers, we can compute the sum.\n\nBut in our case, for each i, the sum is over a range of numbers that are either all even or all odd. For example, when i is even, the sum is over all odd k from 1 to i-1. Wait, earlier analysis showed that when i is even, the k's are odd numbers from 1 to i-1 (which is 2t-1 when i=2t). So for i even, the sum is sum_{k odd} dp[k] where k ranges from 1 to i-1.\n\nSimilarly, when i is odd, the sum is sum_{k even} dp[k] where k ranges from 0 to i-1.\n\nSo for i even:\n\nsum = sum_{k is odd and 1 ≤ k ≤ i-1} dp[k] = prefix_odd[i-1] - prefix_odd[0] ?\n\nWait, prefix_odd[i-1] is the sum of all odd k up to i-1. Since 1 is the first odd, and the sum is from 1 to i-1. So yes.\n\nFor i odd:\n\nsum = sum_{k even and 0 ≤ k ≤ i-1} dp[k] = prefix_even[i-1].\n\nSo, with this, the DP can be computed in O(1) per step, using the prefix_even and prefix_odd arrays.\n\nBut how to compute prefix_even and prefix_odd?\n\nWe can compute them as follows:\n\nprefix_even[i] = prefix_even[i-1] + (dp[i] if i is even else 0)\n\nprefix_odd[i] = prefix_odd[i-1] + (dp[i] if i is odd else 0)\n\nSo, for each i, we can compute dp[i] based on whether i is even or odd, and then update the prefix arrays.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 1.\n\nprefix_even[0] = dp[0] if 0 is even (yes) → 1.\n\nprefix_odd[0] = 0.\n\nThen for i from 1 to n:\n\nif i is even:\n\n   sum_val = prefix_odd[i-1] \n\nelse:\n\n   sum_val = prefix_even[i-1]\n\ndp[i] = sum_val\n\nthen update prefix_even and prefix_odd.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, for each i, dp[i] is calculated based on the sum_val. Then, after calculating dp[i], we update prefix_even and prefix_odd.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test this with previous examples.\n\nFor i=1 (odd):\n\nsum_val = prefix_even[0] = 1.\n\ndp[1] = 1.\n\nThen, prefix_even[1] = prefix_even[0] + 0 (since 1 is odd) → 1.\n\nprefix_odd[1] = prefix_odd[0] + dp[1] (since 1 is odd) → 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nFor i=2 (even):\n\nsum_val = prefix_odd[1] = 1 → dp[2] = 1.\n\nprefix_even[2] = prefix_even[1] + dp[2] (since 2 is even) → 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nprefix_odd[2] = prefix_odd[1] + 0 (since 2 is even) → 1.\n\nFor i=3 (odd):\n\nsum_val = prefix_even[2] = 2 → dp[3] = 2.\n\nprefix_even[3] = prefix_even[2] + 0 (since 3 is odd) → 2.\n\nprefix_odd[3] = prefix_odd[2] + dp[3] (since 3 is odd) → 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nWhich matches our previous calculation of dp[3] = 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works. Thus, the recurrence can be computed in O(n) time with O(n) space.\n\nOnce we compute dp[n], the answer is dp[n] / (2^n) mod MOD.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this value modulo 998244353.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute dp[0...n], using the above recurrence.\n\n2. Compute inv_2n = inverse(2^n) mod MOD.\n\n3. The answer is (dp[n] * inv_2n) mod MOD.\n\nNow, for the modular inverse, since MOD is a prime (998244353 is a known prime), we can compute inv_2n as pow(2, MOD-1 -n, MOD).\n\nBut for large n (up to 2e5), we can precompute the powers of 2 modulo MOD, or compute it on the fly.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, even computing pow(2, n, MOD) is manageable.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn is given.\n\nCompute dp array up to n.\n\nCompute pow_2n = pow(2, n, MOD)\n\ninv_pow_2n = pow(pow_2n, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nans = (dp[n] * inv_pow_2n) % MOD\n\nprint(ans)\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the dp array.\n\nImplementing the dp with prefix_even and prefix_odd:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 1.\n\nprefix_even and prefix_odd arrays can be of size n+1.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nIn Python, for n up to 2e5, we can preallocate arrays of size n+1.\n\nBut for n=2e5, the arrays will be of size 2e5+1, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize dp = [0]*(n+1)\n\ndp[0] = 1\n\nprefix_even = [0]*(n+1)\n\nprefix_odd = [0]*(n+1)\n\nprefix_even[0] = 1 if 0 is even (yes) → 1.\n\nprefix_odd[0] = 0.\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n\n        # even, sum_val is prefix_odd[i-1]\n\n        sum_val = prefix_odd[i-1]\n\n    else:\n\n        # odd, sum_val is prefix_even[i-1]\n\n        sum_val = prefix_even[i-1]\n\n    dp[i] = sum_val\n\n    # update prefix_even and prefix_odd\n\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n\n        prefix_even[i] = (prefix_even[i-1] + dp[i]) % MOD\n\n        prefix_odd[i] = prefix_odd[i-1]\n\n    else:\n\n        prefix_odd[i] = (prefix_odd[i-1] + dp[i]) % MOD\n\n        prefix_even[i] = prefix_even[i-1]\n\nWait, but the prefix_even and prefix_odd arrays are cumulative sums. So for each i, prefix_even[i] is the sum of dp[k] for even k up to i. Similarly for prefix_odd.\n\nBut for example, when i is even, then prefix_even[i] = prefix_even[i-1] + dp[i], since i is even. And prefix_odd[i] remains the same as prefix_odd[i-1], since i is even and not added to the odd sum.\n\nSimilarly when i is odd.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for the code, the initial values are:\n\nprefix_even[0] = 1 (since 0 is even and dp[0] is 1).\n\nprefix_odd[0] = 0.\n\nThen for i from 1 to n:\n\nCompute sum_val based on i's parity.\n\nSet dp[i] = sum_val.\n\nThen, update prefix_even and prefix_odd.\n\nBut in Python, for large n (like 2e5), this should be manageable.\n\nOnce we have dp[n], compute the answer.\n\nBut wait, the dp[n] is the number of valid subsets for the first n towns. Which is exactly what we need.\n\nNow, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample 1: n=2.\n\ndp[0] =1.\n\nprefix_even[0] =1, prefix_odd[0]=0.\n\ni=1 (odd):\n\nsum_val = prefix_even[0] =1 → dp[1] =1.\n\nprefix_odd[1] = 0 + 1 =1. prefix_even[1] = prefix_even[0] =1.\n\ni=2 (even):\n\nsum_val = prefix_odd[1] =1 → dp[2] =1.\n\nprefix_even[2] = prefix_even[1] + 1 = 1 +1=2. prefix_odd[2] = prefix_odd[1] =1.\n\nSo dp[2] is 1. 2^2=4. 1/4 mod MOD is 748683265 as per sample. Which matches.\n\nSample 2: n=3.\n\ndp[3] is 2. 2 / 8 = 1/4. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=5. The real answer is 5/32. Let's see what dp[5] is.\n\nLet's compute step by step.\n\nInitialize dp[0] =1.\n\nprefix_even[0] =1, prefix_odd[0] =0.\n\ni=1 (odd):\n\nsum_val = prefix_even[0] =1 → dp[1] =1.\n\nprefix_odd[1] = 0 +1 =1. prefix_even[1] =1.\n\ni=2 (even):\n\nsum_val = prefix_odd[1] =1 → dp[2] =1.\n\nprefix_even[2] =1 +1=2. prefix_odd[2] =1.\n\ni=3 (odd):\n\nsum_val = prefix_even[2] =2 → dp[3] =2.\n\nprefix_odd[3] =1 +2=3. prefix_even[3] =2.\n\ni=4 (even):\n\nsum_val = prefix",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 through n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, while each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.
