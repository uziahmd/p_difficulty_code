After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column in the gradebook), find the maximum value.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count all such students.\n\nLet me think about how to process the input. The input is given as n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line represents a student's marks for m subjects.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. Let's say for the first example:\n\nInput is:\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nSo the students are:\nStudent 1: [2,2,3]\nStudent 2: [2,3,2]\nStudent 3: [1,1,2]\n\nFor each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (students 1 and 2 have 2)\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 2)\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 1)\n\nSo successful students are student 1 (subject 2), student 2 (subject 1), and student 3? Wait no. Wait for subject 0, the max is 2. Students 1 and 2 have 2. So for subject 0, both are best. Then student 1 is best in subject 2 (max 3). Student 2 is best in subject 1 (max 3). Student 3 isn't best in any. So total successful is 2 students. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n- Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns equals the maximum for that column. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nNow, how to represent the data. Let's read the gradebook as a list of lists. For example, for each student, their marks are stored as a list of integers.\n\nThen, for each subject (column), compute the maximum value.\n\nOnce we have the max values per column, we can iterate through each student and check if any of their marks in the columns equals the max for that column.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. Convert each string into a list of integers. So for example, the first line '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nThen, for each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nFind the maximum value in that column across all students.\n\nOnce we have these max values, for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max for that column. If yes, then count them.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, convert to a list of lists (each student's marks).\n\nCompute for each column, the max value.\n\nThen, for each student, loop through their marks. For each mark, check if it's equal to the max of that column. If any of them is, then the student is successful.\n\nNow, how to compute the max for each column.\n\nFor example, for the columns:\n\nLet's say the students are stored as a list of lists. For example, students = [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nFor column 0, the values are 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\n\nFor column 1: 2, 3, 1 → max is 3.\n\nFor column 2: 3, 2, 2 → max is 3.\n\nSo for each column j, we can loop through all students and collect their j-th mark, then take max.\n\nSo code for that:\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        val = students[i][j]\n        if val > max_val:\n            max_val = val\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nOnce that's done, for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to max_per_subject[j].\n\nSo for each student in students:\n\nfor student in students:\n    successful =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of students in different subjects.\n2. **Data Conversion**: Convert the gradebook into a list of lists where each sublist represents a student's marks in different subjects.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in at least one subject. If yes, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    students.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        val = students[i][j]\n        if val > max_val:\n            max_val = val\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            successful += 1\n            break\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains the integers n and m. The subsequent n lines are read and converted into a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the marks of a student in different subjects.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark achieved in that subject. This is stored in `max_per_subject`.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If a student meets this condition in at least one subject, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject and checking against these values for each student. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of students and subjects, making it efficient for the given constraints.",
