Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The challenge is to find the maximum number of such pairs, and output them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') is compatible only with the same specific color. A question mark (?) can pair with any color, including another ?. So for each left boot and right boot, we can pair them if either both are ?, or one is ? and the other is any, or both are the same letter.\n\nThe main goal is to maximize the number of pairs. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think of possible steps. Since each boot can be used once, we need to match them optimally. Let's think about the following approach:\n\n1. First, try to pair left boots with specific colors with right boots of the same color. For example, if a left boot is 'a', pair it with a right 'a' boot. This would be optimal because using a specific color here uses up both boots, and avoids using ?s which are more flexible.\n\n2. Then, handle the remaining boots which have ?s. These can be paired with any remaining boots (either ? or specific). But since ? can be matched with any, we need to find the best way to pair them.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe we can count the number of specific colors and ?s on both sides.\n\nLet me think in terms of counts. Let's consider for each color (excluding ?), the number of left boots and right boots. For each color c, the maximum possible pairs between left and right is min(left_c, right_c). But then, after that, we have some left and right ?s. Also, the ?s can be paired with each other, or with leftover specific colors.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the ?s can be used in multiple ways. For example, a left ? can pair with a right specific, or a right ? can pair with a left specific, or two ?s can pair. So perhaps the optimal strategy is:\n\n- First, pair all specific colors between left and right. For each color c, pair as many left c with right c as possible. This is straightforward.\n\n- Then, collect the remaining left ?s and right ?s. Also, collect any leftover specific colors (those that couldn't be matched). Wait, no: after pairing the specific colors, there might be some specific colors left. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, then after pairing 2, there's 1 left 'a' left. But that left 'a' can't be paired with any right boot except another 'a' or a '?'. However, since the right 'a's are already used up, maybe the left 'a' can be paired with a right '?', but that's part of the next step.\n\nSo after the first step, we have:\n\nLeft: some number of ?s and specific colors that couldn't be paired (because the other side didn't have enough of that color).\n\nRight: same.\n\nThen, the second step is to pair the remaining specific colors with ?s. For example, a left 'a' can be paired with a right '?'.\n\nSimilarly, a right 'a' can be paired with a left '?'.\n\nBut how to maximize this? Because pairing a left 'a' with a right '?' uses up one of each. Similarly for the reverse.\n\nBut since ?s can be used in either direction, perhaps we need to find the maximum possible pairs here.\n\nLet me think. Let's say after the first step, we have:\n\nLeft_has = {color counts for left} (including ?s)\nRight_has = {color counts for right} (including ?s)\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase.\n\nAfter pairing all possible same-color pairs (like left 'a' with right 'a'), the remaining left boots are those that couldn't be matched. So for each color c (not ?), the left has left_c = original left_c minus the number of pairs made. Similarly for right. Also, the ?s on left and right are still present.\n\nSo the next step is to pair the remaining specific colors with ?s. For example, for each left boot with color c (not ?), we can pair it with a right ? (if any). Similarly, for each right boot with color c (not ?), pair with a left ?.\n\nBut how to do this optimally? Because the ?s can be used in either way. Let's think:\n\nLet's say we have some number of left ?s (Lq) and right ?s (Rq). Also, we have some left specific colors (LS) and right specific colors (RS).\n\nFor the LS, each is a color that couldn't be matched with the opposite side. For example, left",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots, considering that each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The key is to efficiently pair specific colors with matching counterparts and use '?'s to fill in the remaining gaps.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), pair as many left boots with right boots of the same color as possible. This ensures that we use up the most restrictive pairs first.\n2. **Use '?' for Remaining Pairs**: After pairing specific colors, use the remaining '?'s from both left and right boots to form pairs. This includes pairing:\n   - Left '?' with right specific colors.\n   - Right '?' with left specific colors.\n   - Left '?' with right '?'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # We need to process multiple test cases, but the input seems to be provided as a list of test cases.\n    # Wait, looking back at the example input, it seems that the input is actually a list of test cases.\n    # However, the original problem description says that the input is one test case.
