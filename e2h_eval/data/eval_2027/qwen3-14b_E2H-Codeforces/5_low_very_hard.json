Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair. \n\nSo, first, I need to figure out how to pair them optimally. Let's think about the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') can only pair with another 'a' or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'. \n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. Maybe we can first pair the specific colors with each other, then use the question marks for the remaining ones. But how to handle that efficiently?\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots and right boots. For example, if there are x left boots of color 'a' and y right boots of color 'a', then the maximum possible pairs for this color is min(x, y). But since '?' can also pair with them, perhaps we need to first pair the specific colors, then use the '?'s.\n\nBut wait, the '?' can be used as wildcards. So maybe the optimal way is to first pair the specific colors where possible, then use the remaining '?'s to pair with whatever is left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the colors in a way that uses the '?'s optimally.\n\nLet me think of an approach:\n\n- First, create two dictionaries: left_count and right_count, which track the count of each color (excluding '?') on left and right boots.\n\n- For each color c (not '?'), the number of pairs that can be formed between left c and right c is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). However, once these are paired, the remaining left and right boots of color c can't be paired with others except with '?'s.\n\nBut wait, the '?'s can be used to pair with any color, so maybe we should first pair as many as possible between specific colors, then use the '?'s to pair with the remaining specific colors, and then pair the '?'s with each other.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nAnother idea: For each specific color (non '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, collect all the leftover left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired) and use the '?'s to pair them. Also, the '?'s can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Pair specific colors first.\n\n   For each color c (a-z), take the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c], and add that to the total. Then subtract those from the left and right counts. But wait, how do I track which specific boots are paired? Because the problem requires outputting the actual indices. Oh right, but for the initial pairing of specific colors, we need to find matching pairs. However, the problem allows any valid pairing, so maybe we can process the specific colors first and then handle the ?s.\n\nBut the problem is not just counting, but also generating the actual pairs. So for the first part, when we pair specific colors, we need to find left boots of color c and right boots of color c, and pair them. Once that's done, the remaining left and right boots (specific colors) would have to be paired with ?s or other ?s.\n\nBut perhaps the way to approach this is:\n\n- First, pair all same-color left and right boots. For example, for each color c, pair as many as possible. For example, if there are 5 left 'a's and 3 right 'a's, then 3 pairs are made, and 2 left 'a's remain. These 2 left 'a's can be paired with right ?s, or with other ?s.\n\nThen, after that, collect all the left boots that are not yet paired (could be specific or ?) and same for right boots.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots, we can pair them as follows:\n\n- For each left boot (specific or ?), try to pair with a right boot that is either ? or same color. But how to do this optimally?\n\nBut how to manage the pairing when there are ?s. Let's think of the remaining left and right boots. Let's say after pairing same colors, we have:\n\nLeft_remaining: some specific colors and some ?s.\n\nRight_remaining: same.\n\nNow, the idea is to pair the ?s with the specific colors, and then pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn efficient way could be:\n\nFor the left and right remaining:\n\n- For each specific color c in left_remaining, pair them with right_remaining's ?s. Similarly, pair right_remaining's specific colors with left_remaining's ?s.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot has a color, which can be a specific letter or a wildcard ('?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that their colors are compatible, considering that '?' can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), pair as many left boots with right boots of the same color.\n2. **Use Wildcards for Remaining Boots**: After pairing specific colors, use the remaining wildcards ('?') to pair with leftover specific color boots and with each other.\n3. **Track Indices**: Keep track of the indices of the boots used in pairs to ensure each boot is used at most once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # We need to process multiple test cases, but the input format seems to be\n    # multiple test cases concatenated.
