And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I need to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those weeks.\n\nHmm. So the input is n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output is the average of all the averages of the consecutive k-day periods.\n\nWait, but how do I compute this efficiently? Because if I just naively calculate each window's sum, that would be O(n*k) time, which might not be efficient enough for n up to 2e5. Oh right, because for each of the (n -k +1) windows, adding k elements each time. That would be O(nk) which for n=2e5 would be 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a better approach. Oh right, sliding window technique. Let's think about that.\n\nThe sum of the first window is the sum of the first k elements. Then, for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element that's entering. That way, each step takes O(1) time. So the total time would be O(n) for computing all the sums.\n\nOnce I have all the sums, I need to compute the average of each window (sum divided by k) and then take the average of all those averages.\n\nWait, but the average of averages is the same as the total sum of all elements in all windows divided by (number of windows * k). Because each window's average is sum_window / k. The average of all these averages is (sum of all sum_window) / (number_of_windows * k).\n\nSo maybe I can compute the total sum of all the window sums, then divide by (number_of_windows * k) to get the final answer.\n\nYes. So the problem reduces to calculating the sum of all the window sums, then dividing by ( (n -k +1) * k )\n\nSo how to compute the sum of all window sums?\n\nLet me think. For example, for the array [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], each element ai is part of some number of windows. How many times does ai contribute to the total sum of all windows?\n\nWell, for each element ai, the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of positions where the window starts before or at ai's position and ends after or at ai's position.\n\nAlternatively, for each ai, the number of windows that include ai is min(i, n -k +1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think of the number of windows that include ai. Let's say the window is of size k. For ai to be included in a window, the window must start at some position s such that s ≤ i ≤ s + k -1. Which implies that s can range from max(1, i -k +1) to min(i, n -k +1). Wait, maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, for each ai, the number of windows that include ai is equal to the number of possible starting positions s where s ≤ i ≤ s + k -1. Which can be rewritten as s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. But also, s has to be between 1 and (n -k +1). So the number of windows that include ai is the number of valid s values in that range.\n\nSo for the first element, a1, it's included in exactly the first window (if k is 1, then all windows). Wait, for example, if k is 2 and n is 3, then the first element is in the first window (days 1-2) and the second window (days 2-3)? No, wait the first window is days 1-2, the second is 2-3. So a1 is only in the first window. Similarly, a2 is in both windows. a3 is in the second window.\n\nSo for a general ai, the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of windows that start at s where s ranges from max(1, i -k +1) to min(i, n -k +1). Wait, maybe another approach: the number of windows that include ai is equal to the number of possible starting positions s such that s <= i and s +k -1 >=i. So s can be from s_min to s_max, where s_min is max(1, i -k +1) and s_max is min( i, n -k +1 ). But the number of such s is s_max - s_min +1 ?\n\nAlternatively, for each ai, the number of windows that include it is the minimum between i and (n -k +1) ) minus the",
