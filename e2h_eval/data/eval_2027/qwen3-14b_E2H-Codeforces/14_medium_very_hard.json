He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, the sample input m=1 gives 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors but the count of zeros remains the same until 10! which adds another 5 (from 10=2*5).\n\nWait, but how does the count of trailing zeros change with n? For each n, the count increases by 1 when n is a multiple of 5, but sometimes more if it's a multiple of higher powers of 5. So the count is non-decreasing as n increases. So for each m, there could be a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's?\n\nThe idea is: For a given m, find all n's such that the number of trailing zeros in n! is exactly m. However, there's a possibility that there are no such n's. For example, if m is 5, then maybe there are no n's that give exactly 5 zeros. Wait, let's check. Let's compute for n=24: trailing zeros are 24/5 =4 + 24/25=0 → 4. For n=25, it's 25/5=5 + 25/25=1 → total 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there is no n where the count is 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo, the problem is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nThe approach I can take is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimum n such that the count of trailing zeros is >=m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of n's that give exactly m.\n\nBut how to find the possible n's?\n\nAnother thought: For each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 possible n's. Wait, why 5? Because when you have a number like 5, adding numbers up to 9 (since 10 adds another 5). Wait, in the sample input m=1, the numbers 5-9 all have exactly one trailing zero. So that's 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause when you reach 5, the count increases by 1. Then for numbers 6,7,8,9, the count remains the same. But when you hit 10, the count increases again. So between the first occurrence of a certain count and the next occurrence, there's a range of numbers that have the same count.\n\nBut how to find the lower and upper bounds of n for a given m?\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFirst, find the smallest n where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then find the largest n where the count is exactly m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) are the possible n's. But how to find these?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower and upper bounds of n that would give exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find the lower bound?\n\nWe can use binary search to find the smallest n where the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, the lower bound is that n. Then, find the upper bound as the largest n where the count is exactly m.\n\nWait, but how to find the upper bound?\n\nAlternatively, the upper bound is the smallest n where the count is m+1 minus 1. Because once the count reaches m+1, all numbers after that will have at least m+1 zeros. So the upper bound for the current m is (the smallest n with count m+1) -1.\n\nSo for example, in the sample case m=1:\n\nThe smallest n with count >=1 is 5. The count at 5 is exactly 1. Then the smallest n with count >=2 is 10. So the upper bound is 10-1=9. So the numbers from 5 to 9 inclusive are the solutions. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor a given m, find the lower = first n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then find upper = first n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. Then the numbers from lower to upper-1 are the possible n's. But how to find lower and upper?\n\nBut how do I find the first occurrence of m?\n\nAlternatively, the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) = m+1. Call this high.\n\nThen, the numbers from low to high-1 are all the n's that have exactly m zeros. So the count is high - low.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of m?\n\nAlternatively, using binary search for the lower and upper bounds.\n\nWait, the count_zeros function is non-decreasing. So for a given m, if there exists any n where count_zeros(n) = m, then the first occurrence is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. The last occurrence is the maximal n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find these?\n\nLet me think. For example, if I want to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) is equal to m, I can perform a binary search on n. Similarly for the maximum n.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, and check if it's exactly m. Then, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1, and check if that is m+1. Then the range between the first and second minus one is the possible n's.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for a given m, find the lower bound as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. To find this, perhaps first find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, the lower bound is n. Then find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the upper bound is that n minus 1. So the numbers from lower to upper are the possible n's.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m? That can be done via binary search.\n\nSo for example, for m=1:\n\nbinary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1. That is 5. Then check count_zeros(5) is 1. So yes. Then find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2. That is 10. So the upper bound is 10-1=9. So numbers from 5 to 9.\n\nSo the count is 9-5+1=5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's see. What is the count_zeros(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) = 5+1=6. So for m=5, there's no n where count_zeros(n)=5. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the algorithm steps are:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_low such that count_zeros(n_low) >= m.\n\n2. Check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Find the minimal n_high such that count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1.\n\n4. The numbers from n_low to n_high -1 are the valid n's. So the count is (n_high -1) -n_low +1 = n_high -n_low.\n\nBut wait, if n_high is the minimal n where count_zeros is >= m+1, then the maximum n where count_zeros is m is n_high -1.\n\nSo the valid numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\nSo the count is (n_high -1) - n_low + 1 = n_high -n_low.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute the lower bound (n_low) and upper bound (n_high). Then the answer is the numbers between n_low and n_high -1, inclusive.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement the count_zeros function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, how to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. For that, we can perform a binary search.\n\nWhat's the possible range for binary search?\n\nThe minimal n can be 0 (but since we are looking for positive integers, perhaps 1?), but the maximum possible n for m is 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because for example, 5*m divided by 5 is m, and higher divisions add more. So for example, for m=1, 5*1=5, which gives 1 zero. For m=5, 5*5=25, which gives 6 zeros. But perhaps for binary search, the upper bound can be 5*m. But maybe even higher. Wait, but for m=1, the minimal n is 5. For m=5, the minimal n is 25? No, because count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25? But count_zeros(24) is 4, count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25. So for m=5, the count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6. So there is no n where count_zeros(n) is 5. Hence, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m is needed.\n\nBut what's the upper limit for binary search? Well, since for any m, the minimal n is at most 5*m. Because for 5*m, the count_zeros is m + floor(m/5) + ... which is >=m. So the upper limit can be set as 5*m. But for m=1, 5*1=5. For m=100000, 5*100000=500000. Which is manageable.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m can be done between 0 and 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps even higher. Wait, but for m=10^5, 5*m is 5e5. But for count_zeros(5e5) is 5e5 /5 + 5e5/25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + ... which is more than 1e5. So the upper bound is sufficient.\n\nSo, the code for binary search:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nWait, this is the standard binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target. Because for example, if the target is m, then the function returns the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we get that n_low, we check if count_zeros(n_low) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Else, proceed.\n\nSimilarly, for the next part, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the upper bound is that n_high -1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor given m:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: then output 0.\n\nelse:\n\nn_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\nSo the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample case m=1:\n\nn_low is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. Then n_high is find_min_n(2). Let's see what that returns.\n\nfind_min_n(2) would be 10? Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. So the minimal n is 10. So the upper bound is 10-1=9. So the numbers are 5 to 9 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: m=5.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5). Let's compute that.\n\nThe target is 5.\n\nWe need to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 = 4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6 which is greater than 5. So the check fails. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the code would return zero.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, what about edge cases?\n\nFor m=0: but according to the input constraints, m starts from 1. So we don't have to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: m=6. Let's see.\n\nFor n=25: count is 6. Then n_high is find_min_n(7). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 30/5 + 30/25 = 6 + 1 =7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So for m=6, the answer is 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code would output 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=6. So the code would return 5 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen:\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\nSo the count is (n_high -1) - n_low + 1 = n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to generate the list of numbers? For example, if the count is 5, then the numbers are [n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1].\n\nSo the code can generate a list from n_low to n_high-1, inclusive.\n\nNow, the code for the helper functions.\n\nImplementing count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nImplementing find_min_n(target):\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for some cases, 5*target may not be enough. Let's think: For example, if target is m=1, 5*target=5. Which is correct. For m=5, 5*target=25, which is the correct n_low.\n\nBut what if the target is very large? For example, m=1e5.\n\nBut 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable for binary search.\n\nBut let's think: for m=1e5, the actual n_low could be 5*1e5, but maybe even higher? Or not?\n\nNo, because the count_zeros(5*m) is at least m. Because count_zeros(5*m) is 5*m//5 + 5*m//25 + ... = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... which is larger than m. So the minimal n is <= 5*m.\n\nThus, the upper bound of 5*m is sufficient.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead m from input. But the input is given as a single integer. For example, the sample input is ['1', '5'] — but perhaps the input is read as a single line. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer m. But in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'] — which perhaps is for multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows that for input 1, output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for input 5, output is 0. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for two different test cases. However, the code needs to read a single m from input.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m...\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which may be a mistake. Probably, the sample input is for two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one m per run. So the code should read m from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo for example, if the input is 1, the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. If the input is 5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code needs to read m from stdin.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, because range(n_low, n_high) is from n_low to n_high-1, inclusive. So for example, if n_high is 10, then range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nnumbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n\nBut for large ranges, this could take time. However, given that m can be up to 1e5, and the maximum possible numbers is 5 (as in the sample), but perhaps for some m, there are 5 numbers, or 0, or 1?\n\nWait, for example, when m is 6, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29 → 5 numbers. For m=2, the numbers would be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 → 5 numbers. Wait, no. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. count_zeros(14) is 2. count_zeros(15) is 3. So for m=2, the n_low is 10, n_high is find_min_n(3) which is 15. So numbers are 10-14, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo in general, the number of n's is either 0 or 5, or perhaps other numbers?\n\nWait, what if m is 3?\n\nLet me see:\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0 → 3). count_zeros(19) is 3. count_zeros(20) is 4. So for m=3, n_low is 15, n_high is 20. So numbers from 15 to 19 → 5 numbers.\n\nSame as before. So why is that?\n\nBecause when you have a number that's a multiple of 5, but not higher powers, then the next 4 numbers will have the same count. So the range is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that the count is achieved by a higher power of 5?\n\nFor example, let's take m=24. Let's find the numbers.\n\nLet me compute for n= 99:\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5 = 19 + 99//25=3 + 99//125=0 → 22. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of a case where the count increases by more than 1. For example, when n is 25, the count increases by 2 (from 24 to 25, count_zeros(24) is 4, count_zeros(25) is 6). So for m=5, there is no solution. But for m=4, the numbers would be 20-24. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(20) = 4 + 0 = 4 (since 20//5=4, 20//25=0). count_zeros(24) is 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 → 4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=4, the numbers are 20-24 (5 numbers).\n\nSo even when there's a jump of 2, the numbers before the jump (like 20-24) are 5 numbers.\n\nSo in general, the number of n's is 5, except when there's a jump. But how?\n\nWait, if the count for m is achieved by a single n, then the numbers would be 1. But according to previous examples, this doesn't happen. Wait, how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose m=6. Let's say the count_zeros(25) is 6. Then, for n=25, the count is 6. Then, n=26, 27, 28, 29 also have count 6. Because when you reach 30, which is divisible by 5, the count increases. So for m=6, the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that the count_zeros(n) is m for only one n?\n\nIs that possible?\n\nSuppose m=2. Let's see. The numbers are 10-14. So 5 numbers. For m=2, there are 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: Let's take m=1. The numbers are 5-9: 5 numbers.\n\nSo why is that?\n\nBecause the count_zeros increases by 1 when you hit a multiple of 5. So for example, when you reach 5, the count increases by 1. Then, for 6,7,8,9, the count remains the same. Then when you reach 10, the count increases by 2 (because 10 is divisible by 5 and 25 is not, but 10 is 5*2. So count_zeros(10) = 2. So the count increases by 1 again. Wait, no. count_zeros(5) is 1, count_zeros(10) is 2 (10//5 = 2, 10//25=0. So 2). So the count increases by 1. So for numbers 10-14, the count is 2. So again 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if there's a number that is a multiple of 25. For example, n=25. count_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(24) is 4. So the count increases by 2. So for m=5, there's no solution. But for m=6, the numbers are 25-29. So again 5 numbers.\n\nSo regardless of how the count increases, the numbers that produce exactly m zeros are 5 consecutive numbers. Unless there's a jump of more than 1. For example, if the count jumps from m-1 to m+1, then there's no solution for m. But if the count increases by 1, then there's 5 numbers.\n\nSo in the code, the number of solutions is either 0 or 5? Or is there a case where the number of solutions is different?\n\nWait, what if m is such that the count_zeros(n) increases by 1, but the next number is not 5 numbers away?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where there is only 1 number. For example, if m is 3, but the count_zeros(n) is 3 for only one n. But I can't think of such a case.\n\nLet me try m=3. For example, n=15: count_zeros is 3. Then n=16,17,18,19: count_zeros is 3. n=20: count_zeros is 4. So the numbers are 15-19, which is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=24. Let's find the numbers. Let's compute for n= 99:\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5 = 19 + 99//25 = 3 + 99//125=0 → total 22. Not 24. Let me find the right m.\n\nLet me think of a case where m is 24. Let me compute for n= 100: count_zeros(100) = 20 + 4 = 24. So for n=100, count is 24. Then for n=101, 102, 103, 104, the count is still 24. Then for n=105, count_zeros is 25 (105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0 → 25). So the numbers are 100-104, which is 5 numbers.\n\nYes. So again 5 numbers.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the number of solutions is either 0 or 5. But wait, what about when m is such that the count_zeros(n) increases by 1, but the next n is not 5 numbers away?\n\nBut according to the previous examples, it's always 5 numbers. So why?\n\nBecause when you have a number n that is a multiple of 5, but not of higher powers, then the next four numbers (n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4) will not add any more 5s. So the count_zeros remains the same. Hence, the numbers from n to n+4 (5 numbers) will have the same count.\n\nBut if n is a multiple of 25, then count_zeros(n) increases by 2. For example, n=25. count_zeros(25) is 6. The previous count_zeros(24) is 4. So for m=5, there is no solution. But for m=6, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29. So again 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code can be optimized to check if there are any solutions. If yes, then the answer is 5 numbers. But wait, how?\n\nBecause for example, when m=6, the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers. But for m=24, the numbers are 100-104, which is 5 numbers. So the code can generate the list as [n_low, n_low+1, n_low+2, n_low+3, n_low+4], but only if the count_zeros(n_high -1) is m.\n\nBut according to the code logic, the code is generating the list from n_low to n_high-1. Which in all cases is 5 numbers. But what if the code returns a different number?\n\nWell, let's think. For example, in the case where the count_zeros(n_low) = m, and the next count is m+1. So the n_high is the first n where count_zeros is m+1. So the difference between n_high and n_low is 5. Because the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 is 5 numbers.\n\nBut why? Because for the first occurrence of m, the next occurrence of m+1 is 5 numbers ahead.\n\nBut how can we be sure?\n\nWell, because the first occurrence of m is at n_low. The next occurrence of m+1 is at n_low +5. Because for example, n_low is 5, and the next occurrence is 10. 10-5=5.\n\nIn the case of n_low=25, next occurrence is 30. 30-25=5.\n\nYes. So the difference between n_high and n_low is 5. Therefore, the number of elements is 5.\n\nBut what if the next occurrence is not 5 steps ahead?\n\nLet me think of a case where the next occurrence is more than 5 steps ahead. For example, m=6, and the next occurrence is 30. So n_high is 30, n_low is 25. 30-25=5. So the numbers are 25-29, 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=24. n_low is 100. n_high is 105. So 105-100=5. So numbers 100-104.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when m is 24, and the next occurrence is 105, which is 5 steps ahead.\n\nSo the code will generate 5 numbers. Thus, the code can be optimized to check if the count_zeros(n_low) is m. If yes, then the answer is 5 numbers, which are n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_low+4.\n\nBut why? Because the next occurrence is n_low +5.\n\nBut how can we be sure of that?\n\nWell, the next occurrence of m+1 is when we hit the next multiple of 5. Because the count_zeros increases by 1 when you hit a multiple of 5. Except for multiples of higher powers of 5, which increase by more than 1.\n\nBut for the case where the count_zeros(n_low) is m, and the next count_zeros(n_high) is m+1, then n_high is the next multiple of 5 after n_low.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause n_low is the first occurrence of m. For example, if n_low is 5, then the next occurrence of m+1 is when you hit 10. Which is 5 steps ahead. Similarly, if n_low is 25, the next occurrence is 30, which is 5 steps ahead.\n\nBut what if n_low is 100, which is a multiple of 5, but not of 25. So count_zeros(100) is 24. Then the next multiple of 5 is 105. count_zeros(105) is 25. So yes, n_high is 105.\n\nSo the code's calculation of n_high is find_min_n(m+1), which for m=24, returns 105. So the numbers are 100 to 104.\n\nSo the code will generate 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that the count_zeros(n_high) is m+1, but n_high is not n_low +5?\n\nFor example, suppose m=6. Let's say n_low is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. n_high is find_min_n(7). Let's compute that.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(26) is 6. ... count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 + 1 =7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So n_high is 30, which is 25 +5 =30. So yes.\n\nAnother example: m=24. n_high is 105, which is 100+5=105.\n\nSo, the code will always generate 5 numbers if there are any solutions.\n\nBut what if the count_zeros(n_high) is m+1, but n_high -n_low is not 5?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where n_high is 5 steps ahead. For example, m=6, n_low=25, n_high=30. 30-25=5.\n\nAnother example: m=2. n_low=10, n_high=15. 15-10=5. So numbers 10-14 (5 numbers).\n\nSo in all cases, the code will return 5 numbers if there are any solutions.\n\nBut how to confirm?\n\nBecause the first occurrence of m is at n_low, which is a multiple of 5. Because for example, for m=1, n_low is 5. For m=2, n_low is 10. For m=6, n_low is 25. For m=24, n_low is 100.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nWait, n_low is the first occurrence of m. But is that n_low necessarily a multiple of 5?\n\nNot necessarily. Let me think.\n\nFor example, suppose m=3. The first occurrence is 15. Which is a multiple of 5. But what about m=4?\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 4. So yes, 20 is a multiple of 5.\n\nBut what about m=5? The first occurrence is 25. Which is a multiple of 5.\n\nSo, in all cases, the first occurrence of m is a multiple of 5. Because the count_zeros increases when you hit multiples of 5.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause count_zeros(n) is the sum of floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + ... So for count_zeros(n) to be m, the first occurrence is when n is the first multiple of 5 that gives that count. So n_low must be a multiple of 5. Because for numbers not divisible by 5, their count_zeros is the same as the previous number. So the first occurrence of a new count is when you hit a multiple of 5.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose n is not a multiple of 5. Then, count_zeros(n) = count_zeros(n-1). Because n is not a multiple of 5. So the count only increases when n is a multiple of 5.\n\nTherefore, the first occurrence of a new count must be when n is a multiple of 5.\n\nThus, n_low must be a multiple of 5. So, for example, the first occurrence of m is at a multiple of 5. Then, the next occurrence of m+1 is at the next multiple of 5, which is n_low +5. Hence, the numbers from n_low to n_low+4 (5 numbers) have the same count_zeros(m).\n\nThus, the code can be optimized to check if the count_zeros(n_low) is m. If yes, then the answer is 5 numbers: n_low, n_low+1, n_low+2, n_low+3, n_low+4.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because the next multiple of 5 is n_low +5. And the count_zeros(n_low +5) is m+1. Hence, the numbers between n_low and n_low+4 will have count_zeros(m).\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nFor example, take n_low=25. count_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(25+5) = count_zeros(30) is 7. So the numbers 25-29 (5 numbers) have count_zeros 6.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code can be optimized to generate the list as [n_low, n_low+1, n_low+2, n_low+3, n_low+4] if the count is correct. This would avoid having to compute n_high, but perhaps it's easier to proceed with the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are always more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the number of trailing zeros.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: We use binary search to find the smallest number $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $. This helps in determining the valid range of $ n $ values efficiently.\n3. **Range Validation**: After finding the smallest $ n $ with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we check if there exists a valid range of numbers that also result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If such a range exists, it will consist of exactly 5 consecutive numbers due to the nature of trailing zero increments when encountering multiples of 5.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing the integer divisions of $ n $ by increasing powers of 5.\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least `target`.\n3. **main()**: This function reads the input value $ m $, determines the smallest $ n $ (n_low) where the trailing zeros count is exactly $ m $, and then checks if there is a valid range of numbers.
