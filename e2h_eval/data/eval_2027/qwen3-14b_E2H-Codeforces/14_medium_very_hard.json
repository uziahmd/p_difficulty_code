    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given m, find all n where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how do we find such n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that would give exactly m zeros. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing. For example, as n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for each m, there could be a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. However, sometimes there might be no n's for a particular m. Like, maybe some m's are skipped. For example, if m=5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Wait, but according to the sample input, when m=1, there are 5 numbers (5-9). Let me check that.\n\nWait, the sample input for m=1 gives output 5, with numbers 5,6,7,8,9. Let's see:\n\nFor n=5, the number of zeros is 1 (5/5=1). For n=6, it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly up to 9. Then at n=10, it's 2 (10/5=2, plus 10/25=0, so total 2). So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So the numbers 5-9 are all valid. Hence, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, there's a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. But how to find that range?\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's? Let's think about binary search. For example, given m, I can find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and the largest n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) would be the answer. But wait, how do I find that?\n\nBut first, perhaps there's no n for a given m. For example, if m is such that there's no n where f(n) equals m. For example, let's see. Let's say m=5. Let's compute f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4. f(25) is 25//5 + 25//25 =5+1=6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where f(n)=5. So for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo the approach is: find the lower and upper bounds of n that have exactly m zeros. If there are no such n, output zero. Otherwise, output the count and the numbers.\n\nSo how to find the possible n's?\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) would be the answer. However, how do I find these values?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, why 5? Because in the sample case, there were 5 numbers. But maybe for some m's, there are multiple numbers. Let me think. For example, m=2. Let's see:\n\nn=10: 2 zeros. n=11, 12, 13, 14: same as 10. Then n=15: 15/5=3, 15/25=0, total 3. So for m=2, the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. So again 5 numbers. Wait, but why?\n\nBecause when you add numbers, the count of zeros increases only when you hit multiples of 5. So for example, between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Between 10 and 14, it's 2. Between 15 and 19, it's 3. Wait, but 15/5 is 3, 15/25 is 0. So 3. Then 20/5 is 4, 20/25 is 0. So 4. Then 25 adds 5+1=6. So between 20 and 24, the count is 4. Then 25 gives 6. So for m=5, there's no n. So for m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo the pattern here is that for each m, the numbers that generate exactly m trailing zeros are consecutive numbers. So the count is either 0, 1, or 5? Or maybe other numbers?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose m is such that there's exactly one n. How can that happen? For example, when m=6. Let's see:\n\nFor n=25, the count is 6. What about n=26? Let's compute f(26) = 26//5 + 26//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. Similarly for 27, 28, 29. Then 30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7. So for m=6, the numbers are 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. So again 5 numbers. Wait, but what about when m is the count for a number that is a multiple of higher powers of 5?\n\nWait, let's take m=3. Let's see:\n\nn=15: 3 zeros. Then 16, 17, 18, 19 also have 3 zeros. Then 20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0. So 4. So for m=3, the numbers are 15-19. Again 5 numbers. So why is that?\n\nBecause each time, when you reach a multiple of 5, the count increases. But when you hit a multiple of 25, it increases by two. So for example, for n=25, the count is 6. But the previous count for n=24 was 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). So between 24 and 25, the count jumps by 2. So for m=5, there is no solution.\n\nSo the key idea is that for a given m, there could be a range of n's that produce exactly m trailing zeros. The length of this range depends on how the count increases. But how to find the range?\n\nThe approach is to find the lower bound and upper bound for n such that f(n) = m. Let's think about how to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Find the maximal n such that f(n) = m. Let's call this high.\n\nIf such n exists, then the numbers from low to high inclusive are the solutions. The count is high - low + 1. If no such n exists, then the answer is 0.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nTo find low, we can perform a binary search for the smallest n where f(n) = m. Similarly for high, the largest n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how do we know if such n exists?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the first n where f(n) >= m, and check if f(n) is exactly m. Similarly for the upper bound.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\nThe function f(n) is non-decreasing. So, for a given m, if there exists an n such that f(n) = m, then the numbers that satisfy this are a contiguous range. So the idea is to find the first occurrence of m and the last occurrence of m.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think about the binary search approach. For example, to find the smallest n where f(n) = m. But how do I find that?\n\nAlternatively, we can find the lower bound of n where f(n) >= m. Then check if that value is exactly m. Similarly for the upper bound.\n\nWait, here's a way to find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Then, if f(n) is not equal to m, there's no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is that value. But how to find the upper bound?\n\nAlternatively, for the upper bound, find the largest n such that f(n) = m. Which would be the largest n where f(n) = m. How to find that?\n\nLet me think. Let's first write a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way to compute the number of trailing zeros.\n\nNow, for a given m, we need to find all n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFind the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then find the largest n where count_zeros(n) = m. If there's no such n, output 0. Else, output the numbers from smallest to largest.\n\nBut how to find the smallest and largest n?\n\nLet me think. Since count_zeros(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, the possible n's form a contiguous interval. So, for example, if there exists an n such that count_zeros(n) = m, then there's a range [a, b] where all numbers in this range have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nSo, to find a and b, we can find the first occurrence of m and the last occurrence of m.\n\nHow to find the first occurrence?\n\nWe can use binary search. For example, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this x. Then check if count_zeros(x) is equal to m. If not, then there's no solution. Else, x is the minimal n.\n\nSimilarly, for the last occurrence, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call this y. Then the last occurrence is y-1. But again, we need to check if count_zeros(y-1) is equal to m. Otherwise, there's no solution.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, find the lower bound x where count_zeros(x) = m. Then find upper bound y where count_zeros(y) = m. Then the numbers from x to y are the answers.\n\nBut how to find x and y?\n\nLet me think. For x, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. To find x, we can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, and check if count_zeros(n) == m. If yes, then x is that n. Otherwise, no solution.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call that y. Then the upper bound is y-1. But again, check if count_zeros(y-1) == m.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nFind the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 1. That is 5. Check count_zeros(5) is 1. So x=5.\n\nThen find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2. That is 10. So upper bound is 10-1=9. Check count_zeros(9) is 1. So the numbers are 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the steps for the problem are:\n\nGiven m, find the lower and upper bounds as described. If the lower bound exists (i.e., count_zeros(lower) == m), then the upper bound is (the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1) -1. Then check if count_zeros(upper) == m. If yes, then the answer is upper - lower + 1 numbers from lower to upper. Else, zero.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m?\n\nThis can be done via binary search. Let's think about the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe minimal possible n is 0 (but since n must be positive, perhaps 1?), and the maximum possible n can be 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms contribute more). But perhaps for m=1, 5*1=5 is sufficient. For m=5, 5*5=25, which has count_zeros(25) = 6, which is larger than 5. So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. But perhaps even higher values may be needed. Wait, but what's the maximum possible n that can be considered?\n\nAlternatively, since for any m, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is <= 5*m. Because count_zeros(5m) is 5m//5 + 5m//25 + ... = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... which is >= m. So yes, 5*m is a safe upper bound for binary search.\n\nSo the binary search for the lower bound (minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m) can be done between low=0 and high=5*m.\n\nSimilarly for the upper bound (for m+1).\n\nOnce we find the lower and upper bounds, we can check if count_zeros(lower) == m and count_zeros(upper) == m.\n\nSo putting this into code:\n\nFirst, implement the count_zeros function.\n\nThen, implement a function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nLet me code that.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nWait, this returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nSo, for example, if target is m, then find_min_n(m) gives the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we get that, we check if count_zeros(n) == m. If not, then there is no solution.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound, we find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the upper bound is that n-1.\n\nSo for example, for m=1, find_min_n(1) returns 5, and find_min_n(2) returns 10. So upper is 10-1=9. Then check if count_zeros(9) is 1, which it is. So the range is 5-9.\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Compute lower = find_min_n(m)\n\n- if count_zeros(lower) != m → no solution → output 0\n\n- else:\n\n   compute upper = find_min_n(m+1) -1\n\n   if count_zeros(upper) != m → no solution → output 0 (but this shouldn't happen?)\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause find_min_n(m+1) gives the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So the upper bound is that n-1, which is the largest n where count_zeros(n) is <= m. But since we already have that count_zeros(lower) is m, then the upper bound must be >= lower, and count_zeros(upper) is m.\n\nWait, no. Suppose that there is a gap between m and m+1. For example, if m is 5, and the find_min_n(5) returns some n where count_zeros(n) is 5. But in reality, maybe there is no n with count_zeros(n) =5. For example, if m=5, then find_min_n(5) would return the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So find_min_n(5) would return 25, since for target=5, the first n where count_zeros(n)>=5 is 25. Then, count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So in that case, we have no solution.\n\nThus, the steps would be:\n\nCompute lower = find_min_n(m). Check if count_zeros(lower) == m. If not, then output 0.\n\nElse compute upper = find_min_n(m+1) -1. Then check if count_zeros(upper) == m. Well, since lower is the first occurrence of m, and upper is the last occurrence of m. But how to ensure that upper is indeed part of the m group?\n\nBut if lower is the first occurrence of m, then upper is the last occurrence of m. Because find_min_n(m+1) is the first occurrence of m+1. So the upper is the last occurrence of m.\n\nSo, for example, if m=1, find_min_n(1) is 5, find_min_n(2) is 10. upper is 9. count_zeros(9) is 1.\n\nSo in code, once we have lower, and upper, then the answer is all numbers from lower to upper, inclusive.\n\nBut how to confirm that upper is indeed such that count_zeros(upper) is m? Well, because find_min_n(m+1) is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So the previous number (upper) must have count_zeros(upper) = m.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause suppose that for upper = find_min_n(m+1) -1, then count_zeros(upper) < m+1. But since find_min_n(m+1) is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1, then for upper = find_min_n(m+1)-1, count_zeros(upper) < m+1. But since lower is the first occurrence of m, and upper is >= lower, then count_zeros(upper) must be >= m. So it's either m or m+1-1? Not sure. Wait, but if count_zeros(upper) is less than m+1, and >= m (since lower is the first occurrence of m, and upper is >= lower), then count_zeros(upper) is either m or m+1-1? No, m+1-1 is m. So count_zeros(upper) is either m or something else?\n\nWait, for example, if m=5, and find_min_n(5) returns 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). Then the check count_zeros(lower) == m would fail (6 !=5), so we output 0. So the code would handle that.\n\nBut if the check passes, then the upper is find_min_n(m+1)-1. So in that case, the count_zeros(upper) must be m. Because, since the find_min_n(m+1) is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So upper is the previous number. So count_zeros(upper) is less than m+1. Also, since lower is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m, and upper >= lower, then count_zeros(upper) >= m. So count_zeros(upper) is between m and m. So it's exactly m. Therefore, no need to check again.\n\nTherefore, once the initial check (count_zeros(lower) == m) passes, then the upper is valid.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nFor a given m:\n\nCompute lower = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m → output 0\n\nelse:\n\ncompute upper = find_min_n(m+1) -1\n\nthen the numbers from lower to upper are the answer. The count is upper - lower +1.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nfind_min_n(1) → returns 5. count_zeros(5) is 1 → okay.\n\nfind_min_n(2) → returns 10. upper = 10-1=9. So numbers 5-9 → 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: m=5.\n\nfind_min_n(5) → let's see.\n\nWhat's the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5?\n\nLet's compute for n=24: count_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 =4. For n=25: 6. So the first n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0. Which matches the second sample input where m=5 gives output 0.\n\nAnother example, m=6. find_min_n(6) → returns 25 (count_zeros(25)=6). Then find_min_n(7) is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7. Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(29) is 29//5=5 + 29//25=1 → 6. count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 →7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. upper is 30-1=29. So numbers from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So count is 5.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, the next step is to code this in Python.\n\nBut first, handle the edge cases. For example, m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead m from input. Then process.\n\nBut the input is given as a list, like in the example input ['1', '5']? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. But the example shows input as ['1', '5'] and output as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'] — perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example input, it's written as:\n\nInput\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut that seems like the input is a list of multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases, but the actual input is a single m. Or perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are handled. However, according to the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. So the code should read m from stdin.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as \"the only line of input contains an integer m\". So the code should read a single integer m. However, the sample input shows that for input ['1', '5'], the output is two lines. But that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut perhaps this is a formatting error. Maybe the actual input is a list of multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for two separate test cases. However, the code needs to read a single m and output the answer for that m.\n\nBut the user instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So in the example, when the input is 1, output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'; when input is 5, output is '0'.\n\nBut the code is supposed to handle a single m. So the code should read m from stdin as a single integer.\n\nSo the code should be written as follows:\n\nRead m from input. Then compute the answer.\n\nBut the code needs to handle m as per the problem statement.\n\nNow, coding in Python:\n\nImplement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nImplement find_min_n(target):\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nBut for large target, like 1e5, 5*target is 5e5. Which is manageable.\n\nOnce we have that, then:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen:\n\nlower = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper = find_min_n(m+1) -1\n\n    k = upper - lower +1\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper+1))))\n\nBut wait, for large ranges, generating the list may be memory intensive. However, given that m can be up to 1e5, and for each m, the range is up to 5 numbers (as in the examples), it's manageable.\n\nWait, but in the case where m is such that there are multiple numbers, like for m=6, the range is 25-29 (5 numbers). So the code will generate that.\n\nBut let's test for m=6:\n\nlower is find_min_n(6) → 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then upper is find_min_n(7) -1 → 30-1=29. So numbers from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the range is longer? For example, when m is 24?\n\nLet's see. Let's compute for m=24.\n\nWhat's the count_zeros(99)? 99//5=19, 99//25=3, 99//125=0. Total 22. 100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0 → 24. So for m=24, the lower is 100. Then find_min_n(25) would be the first n where count_zeros(n) >=25. Let's compute count_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(101) is same as 100. count_zeros(104) is same. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0 → 25. So find_min_n(25) returns 105. upper is 105-1=104. So numbers from 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. So again 5 numbers.\n\nSo seems that for all m where there is a solution, the number of solutions is 5. Except for some cases?\n\nWait, let's think. What if m is such that the next number after the range is m+1. For example, m=4. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the range is 20-24, which is 5 numbers. So again 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that the next step is m+1, but the range is longer than 5 numbers?\n\nWait, no. Because for any n, the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 when you pass a multiple of 5, but increases by more when passing multiples of higher powers. So the ranges where count_zeros(n) is m can be of varying lengths. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, for example, let's take m=24. The range is 100-104. Let's check count_zeros(100) = 24, count_zeros(101) = same, etc. So 5 numbers. So why is that?\n\nBecause when you reach 105, the count_zeros increases by 1. So the range between 100 and 104 is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if there is a case where the range is longer than 5 numbers?\n\nLet me think. Let's imagine m= some value where the next step is adding 1. For example, m=3. The numbers from 15 to 19. That's 5 numbers. So same as before.\n\nBut what if there's a case where between two multiples of 5, the count_zeros(n) is same. For example, for n= 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So 5 numbers. So for any m, the range is 5 numbers?\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause when you add numbers, the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 when you hit a multiple of 5. So between multiples of 5, the count_zeros(n) remains same. So for example, the numbers between 5k and 5k+4 (exclusive) will have same count_zeros(n) as 5k. But when you reach 5k+5, it's 5(k+1), which increases the count_zeros by 1. So the range for m is 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, if there is a number that is a multiple of 25, then adding it would increase the count_zeros by 2. For example, 25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=6, the range would be 25-29 (5 numbers). So same as before.\n\nSo regardless of whether the numbers are multiples of higher powers of 5, the range for m is always 5 numbers. Unless there's a jump. So in that case, when the count_zeros(n) jumps by more than 1, the m between the previous and next count_zeros(n) would have no solution.\n\nBut for the cases where there is a solution, the range is 5 numbers. Therefore, the answer is either 0 or 5 numbers. But wait, the first example has 5 numbers. But what if there's a case where the range is longer than 5 numbers?\n\nLet me think. Suppose m is 24. Let's say the range is 100-104. Which is 5 numbers. But what if m is 24, but there is another number beyond 104 that also has count_zeros(n) =24?\n\nNo. Because 105 has count_zeros(105) = 25. So the upper bound is 104. So the range is 5 numbers.\n\nSo in all cases, the answer is either 0 or 5 numbers. But wait, what if m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m starts from 1.\n\nWait, but why does the sample input have 5 numbers for m=1. So the code returns 5 numbers. So according to this logic, the code would return 5 numbers if there's a solution. But is that always true?\n\nWait, what about m=0? Well, for m=0, the numbers are 1-4, which is 4 numbers. But the problem says m starts from 1.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So for all m >=1, the answer is either 0 or 5 numbers?\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 when you pass a multiple of 5, but not a higher power. For example, for n=5, count_zeros increases by 1. For n=25, it increases by 2. But for the m that is the count_zeros(25) =6, the range is 25-29. Which is 5 numbers. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that the count_zeros(n) increases by 1. Then the range is 5 numbers. But what if the count_zeros increases by more than 1, but there are some numbers in between?\n\nFor example, if m is 5, which is skipped, then no solution. But for m=6, which is the count_zeros(25) =6, the range is 25-29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo in all cases, the answer is 0 or 5 numbers. But how to confirm that?\n\nWell, the code would generate the numbers from lower to upper. The upper is find_min_n(m+1) -1. The lower is find_min_n(m). For example, if the code returns 5 numbers, then upper - lower +1 is 5.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause find_min_n(m+1) is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So the difference between find_min_n(m+1) and find_min_n(m) is 5?\n\nNot necessarily. Let's take m=6. find_min_n(6) is 25, find_min_n(7) is 30. So difference is 5. So upper is 29, lower is 25 → 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=24. find_min_n(24) is 100. find_min_n(25) is 105. So upper is 104. 104-100 +1 =5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=3. find_min_n(3)=15. find_min_n(4)=20. upper is 19. 19-15+1=5.\n\nBut what if there is a case where the difference is more than 5?\n\nLet me think. Suppose m is 2. find_min_n(2) is 10. find_min_n(3) is 15. upper is 14. 14-10+1=5. So again 5 numbers.\n\nSo seems that the difference between find_min_n(m+1) and find_min_n(m) is always 5. So the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause find_min_n(m) is the first occurrence of m. find_min_n(m+1) is the first occurrence of m+1. So between them, there's exactly 5 numbers. Because the first occurrence of m+1 is 5 numbers after the first occurrence of m.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause the first occurrence of m is at n = 5k. For example, when m is the count_zeros(5k). Then, the next occurrence of m+1 is at 5(k+1). So the difference is 5.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's take m=1, which is count_zeros(5) =1. The next occurrence is count_zeros(10)=2. So difference is 5. So upper is 9, lower is 5 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would return 5 numbers whenever there is a solution. So the answer is either 0 or 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if the first occurrence of m is at 5k, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at 5k+5? Then the upper bound is 5k+4. So the range is 5 numbers.\n\nBut why is the first occurrence of m+1 at 5k+5?\n\nBecause when you reach 5k+5, which is 5(k+1), the count_zeros(5(k+1)) is m+1.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause count_zeros(5(k+1)) = (5(k+1))/5 + ... = (k+1) + ... which is m+1.\n\nBut why is m equal to count_zeros(5k)?\n\nBecause for 5k, count_zeros(5k) is k + count_zeros(k). Wait, maybe not. Let's think for 5k.\n\ncount_zeros(5k) = floor(5k/5) + floor(5k/25) + ... = k + floor(5k/25) + ... \n\nBut if k is not a multiple of 5, then floor(5k/25) = floor(k/5). So count_zeros(5k) is k + floor(k/5) + ... which may not be equal to m. So this line of thinking may not be helpful.\n\nBut regardless, the code seems to work. So the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m from input. Then compute lower = find_min_n(m). Check if count",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are determined and efficiently finding the valid range of `n` values using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the range of `n` values that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - Find the smallest `n` such that the number of trailing zeros is at least `m`.\n   - Find the smallest `n` such that the number of trailing zeros is at least `m + 1`, then subtract 1 to get the upper bound of the valid range.\n3. **Validation**: Check if the found bounds indeed result in exactly `m` trailing zeros. If not, there are no valid `n` values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lower = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(lower) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper = find_min_n(m + 1) - 1\n        k = upper - lower + 1\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper + 1))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by summing the integer divisions of `n` by increasing powers of 5.\n- **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `target`.\n- **main()**: Reads the input value `m`, determines the valid range of `n` values using the helper functions, and prints the results. If no valid range is found, it prints `0`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `n` using binary search, ensuring the solution handles large inputs within acceptable time limits.",
