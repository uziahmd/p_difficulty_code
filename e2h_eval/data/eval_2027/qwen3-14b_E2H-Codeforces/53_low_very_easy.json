Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. The input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring.\n\nFirst, let me think about the approach. Since the string length is up to 100, maybe a brute-force approach is acceptable here. Because even for 100 characters, checking all possible substrings might be manageable.\n\nSo the plan is: generate all possible substrings for all possible lengths, check if they appear at least twice, and keep track of the maximum length where this is true.\n\nBut how to generate all substrings efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check all possible substrings of length L. For each substring, check if it appears more than once. Once we find such a substring, return L as the answer.\n\nThe maximum possible length for a substring that can appear twice is floor(n/2), but maybe even longer if overlapping is allowed. Wait, for example, in 'aaaaa', the substring 'aa' can appear multiple times. But the maximum possible length would be 4 for a string of length 5? Like 'aaaaa' has substrings of length 4: 'aaaa' appears twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So yes. So for a string of length n, the maximum possible L is n-1, but for that to have two occurrences, the string must have at least two overlapping substrings. But for example, in a string of length 2, like 'aa', the maximum is 1, since the substring 'a' occurs twice. Wait, but the problem says the substring must be met at least twice. So for the string 'aa', the answer is 1. But for the string 'ab', the answer is 0.\n\nSo the approach would be to check for all possible L starting from the maximum possible (which is len(s) - 1) down to 1. For each L, check all possible substrings of length L. For each substring, check if it exists in the string at least two times. If any such substring is found, return L as the maximum.\n\nIf no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate L from the maximum possible (len(s)-1) down to 1.\n\n2. For each L, collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\n3. Once found, return L as the answer.\n\nBut how to check if a substring occurs at least twice?\n\nFor each L, we can generate all substrings of length L, and store their occurrences. For example, for each substring, count how many times it appears. If any count is >= 2, then return L.\n\nBut how to generate all substrings of length L? For a string of length n, there are n - L + 1 possible substrings of length L.\n\nFor example, for s = 'abcde', L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd', 'de'.\n\nSo for each L, we can generate all these substrings, and check if any of them appears more than once.\n\nBut how to check that? Let's think: for each L, create a set of substrings. If the number of unique substrings is less than the total number of substrings (n-L+1), then there's at least one duplicate. Wait, but that's not sufficient. Because if there are multiple duplicates, but the set size is smaller than the total number of substrings. For example, if there are two same substrings, then the set size is (total -1). So for each L, if the number of unique substrings is less than (n-L+1), then there's at least one duplicate. But how do I know that there's at least two occurrences?\n\nWait, for example, if there are two occurrences of the same substring, then the set will have one entry for that substring. So the number of unique substrings is (number of unique entries). So if the number of unique substrings is less than the total number of substrings (for that L), then there's at least one substring that occurs more than once. Because the total number of substrings is (n-L+1), and the set size is the number of unique ones. So if set size < (n-L+1), then there's at least one duplicate. So for each L, if this condition is true, then return L as the answer.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the string is 'aaa', then for L=2, the substrings are 'aa', 'aa'. The set size is 1, which is less than 2 (n-L+1 is 2). So that's correct",
