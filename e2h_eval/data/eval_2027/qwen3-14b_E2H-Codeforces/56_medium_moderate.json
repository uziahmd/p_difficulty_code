Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. So, the main task is to check if there's a way to pair each spaceship with a base, one-to-one, and all the lines between pairs don't cross each other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Since R and B are up to 10, maybe a brute-force approach is feasible. But how?\n\nThe key is that for any two pairs (ship1 → base1) and (ship2 → base2), the lines connecting them must not intersect. So, for each possible perfect matching, we need to check that all pairs of lines in the matching are non-intersecting.\n\nBut how do I check if two line segments intersect? Oh right, there's a computational geometry method for that. Let me recall.\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are also different. Also, need to handle cases where the points are colinear but overlapping. However, the problem says that no three points are on the same line. So, that simplifies things because if two lines are colinear, they can't have overlapping points (since all points are unique). Wait, but the problem states that no three points are colinear. So, any two line segments that are colinear would have to be between two pairs of points. But since no three points are colinear, two line segments can't be colinear unless they share a point. But since in the matching, each ship is connected to exactly one base, and vice versa, the line segments would be between distinct pairs. So, if two line segments are colinear, then they must be between two pairs of points that are colinear, but since the problem says that no three points are colinear, this is impossible. Therefore, two line segments can't be colinear. Therefore, the only way two line segments can intersect is if they cross each other, i.e., the usual case.\n\nSo, the line segment intersection check can be done using the orientation method. Let me think about the code for that.\n\nSo, first, I need to generate all possible perfect matchings between the R spaceships and B bases. Since R and B are up to 10, but for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Wait, the problem says that R and B are given. Oh, the input has R and B. So the first thing is that if R != B, then it's impossible. Wait, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", which implies that R must equal B. So, the first check is whether R equals B. If not, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo the first step is to check if R != B. If so, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for R = B, we need to check if there exists a perfect matching (permutation) of the spaceships to bases such that no two lines cross.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check if R != B. If yes, output No.\n- Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each permutation corresponds to a possible assignment of ships to bases).\n- For each permutation, check if all pairs of lines (connecting ship i to base perm[i]) do not intersect.\n- If any permutation satisfies this condition, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut wait, how to generate permutations? Let's say there are R ships and R bases. Each permutation represents a way to assign each ship to a base. For example, if we have ships S1, S2, S3 and bases B1, B2, B3, then a permutation [B1, B2, B3] would mean S1→B1, S2→B2, S3→B3. Another permutation [B2, B1, B3] would be S1→B2, S2→B1, S3→B3. So, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of lines in the matching.\n\nBut for each permutation, how do we check that all lines are non-intersecting?\n\nFor a given permutation, we have R lines. We need to check that for every pair of lines (i,j) in the permutation, the lines between ship i and base perm[i], and ship j and base perm[j], do not intersect.\n\nBut checking all O(R^2) pairs for each permutation. Since R can be up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking 10*10=100 pairs. So total operations would be around 3.6e5 * 1e2 = 3.6e7 operations. That's acceptable for Python, I think. Because even if each operation is a bit slow, but for 10^7 steps, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. However, given that R is small (up to 10), the brute-force approach is feasible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read R and B. If R != B, output No.\n2. Read R ships' coordinates.\n3. Read B bases' coordinates.\n4. Generate all permutations of the B bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of ships to bases).\n5. For each permutation, check if all pairs of lines in the matching are non-intersecting.\n6. If any permutation passes, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nNow, the key parts are:\n\n- Generating permutations of the bases. For example, if the bases are stored as a list, then itertools.permutations can be used.\n- Implementing the line segment intersection check.\n\nLet me think about the line segment intersection check. Let me find the code for that.\n\nThe standard approach is to compute the orientation of three points. The orientation can be 0 (colinear), 1 (clockwise), or 2 (counterclockwise). But since the problem states that no three points are colinear, we can ignore the colinear case. However, when checking for two line segments, the code needs to check if they cross each other.\n\nThe function to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect can be implemented as follows:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    ccw1 = ccw(A,B,C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A,B,D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C,D,A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C,D,B)\n    # If the points are on opposite sides for both segments\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    # Also need to handle the case where a point is on the other segment (but the problem says no three points are colinear, so this can't happen)\n    # Wait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, for example, if a point C lies on AB, then that would imply that A, B, C are colinear, which is not allowed. Hence, the case where a point is on the other segment can't happen. Therefore, the only way the segments can intersect is if they cross each other, which is captured by the above condition.\n\n    # But what if one segment's endpoint lies on the other segment? Well, according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. So, for example, if AB is a segment and C is an endpoint of another segment. Suppose C is on AB. Then, since A, B, C are colinear, which is not allowed. So that case is impossible. Hence, we can ignore those edge cases.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input says that no two points coincide. So, the endpoints can't be the same. But the problem allows for two line segments to share an endpoint? Well, in that case, the line segments would share a point. But the problem says that the paths must not intersect. So, if two line segments share an endpoint, then they do intersect at that point. However, the problem says that the paths must not intersect. So, for example, if two line segments share a common endpoint, then they are considered to intersect. Therefore, in our code, we need to check for that as well.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, in the first example, connecting in order works. So, for example, if the ships are arranged in a way that their lines don't cross. But how to handle the case where two lines share a point?\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the input ensures that no three points are colinear. So, if two line segments share an endpoint, then that's allowed? Or does that count as an intersection?\n\nFor example, suppose ship A is connected to base X, and ship B is connected to base X. Then, the line segments from A to X and B to X share the point X. So, they intersect. But according to the problem statement, each base is assigned exactly one ship. So, each base is connected to exactly one ship. Therefore, in any valid matching, each base is connected to exactly one ship. So, in that case, two line segments cannot share a base. Similarly, two line segments cannot share a ship. Because each ship is assigned to exactly one base. Therefore, in the matching, all line segments are between distinct pairs. So, two line segments can't share a common endpoint. Therefore, the only possible intersections are between two line segments that cross each other in the middle.\n\nTherefore, the code for checking segments_intersect can safely assume that the endpoints are not shared. So, the original condition of checking whether the two segments cross each other (the ccw product being negative) is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, what if two line segments are overlapping? But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, if two line segments are overlapping, then they must be colinear. But since no three points are colinear, that can't happen. Because, for example, if AB and CD are colinear, then A, B, C, D are colinear. But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So that's impossible. Therefore, two line segments can't be colinear. Hence, the only way two line segments can intersect is if they cross each other in the middle. Therefore, the code for segments_intersect can be as before.\n\nSo, the function segments_intersect returns True if the two segments cross each other.\n\nNow, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments. For example, for a permutation p, which is a list where p[i] is the base assigned to ship i. Then, for each pair of indices i and j (i < j), check if the line between ship i and p[i] intersects with the line between ship j and p[j]. If any such pair exists, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for the permutation, we can generate all possible pairs of lines and check for intersections.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplement the ccw and segments_intersect functions.\n\nThen, for each permutation of the bases:\n\n- For each pair of lines in the permutation, check if they intersect.\n\nIf any pair intersects, the permutation is invalid. Else, it's valid.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    read R and B\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    read R ships as list of tuples\n    read B bases as list of tuples\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                ship_i = ships[i]\n                base_i = perm[i]\n                ship_j = ships[j]\n                base_j = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(ship_i, base_i, ship_j, base_j):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, the permutation is of the bases. So, for each permutation, we have a mapping from each ship index to a base. For example, for the first ship (index 0), the base is perm[0], etc.\n\nBut in the code above, the for loops check all pairs of ships (i and j), and their respective bases.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of lines in the permutation. So, for each pair (i,j), i < j, check if the line between ships[i] and perm[i] intersects with the line between ships[j] and perm[j].\n\nIf any such pair exists, then the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, the problem is that for R=10, the permutations are 10! = 3.6 million. For each permutation, checking (10*9)/2 = 45 pairs. So total operations are 3.6e6 * 45 = 1.6e8 operations. Hmm, that might be a bit slow in Python, but perhaps acceptable given that the constraints are small.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to optimize. However, given that R is up to 10, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nShips are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nBases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nOne possible permutation is [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]. So the lines are:\n\nShip 0 (0,0) to base 0 (-2,1): line from (0,0) to (-2,1)\n\nShip 1 (2,0) to base 1 (0,3): line from (2,0) to (0,3)\n\nShip 2 (3,1) to base 2 (2,2): line from (3,1) to (2,2)\n\nCheck if any pairs of these lines intersect.\n\nLet me check between the first and second line.\n\nLine 1: (0,0) to (-2,1). Line 2: (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nDo these cross?\n\nCompute the ccw for points A(0,0), B(-2,1), C(2,0):\n\nccw(A,B,C) = (Bx - Ax)*(Cy - Ay) - (By - Ay)*(Cx - Ax)\n\nBx - Ax = -2 - 0 = -2. Cy - Ay = 0 - 0 = 0. By - Ay = 1 - 0 = 1. Cx - Ax = 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nSo (-2)*0 - (1)*2 = 0 - 2 = -2.\n\nThen ccw(A,B,D) where D is (0,3):\n\nSame calculation:\n\nCx is 0, Cy is 3.\n\nSo (Bx - Ax) = -2, (Cy - Ay) = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\n(Bx - Ax)*(Cy - Ay) = (-2)*3 = -6.\n\n(By - Ay)*(Cx - Ax) = (1) * (0 - 0) = 0. So overall, -6 - 0 = -6?\n\nWait, the formula for ccw(A,B,C) is (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x). So for A(0,0), B(-2,1), C(2,0):\n\n(B.x - A.x) is -2, (C.y - A.y) is 0. (B.y - A.y) is 1. (C.x - A.x) is 2. So the value is (-2)(0) - (1)(2) = 0 - 2 = -2.\n\nSimilarly, for D (0,3):\n\n(B.x - A.x) is -2. (D.y - A.y) is 3. (B.y - A.y) is 1. (D.x - A.x) is 0. So the value is (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6 - 0 = -6.\n\nSo ccw1 is -2, ccw2 is -6. Their product is positive. So the condition (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) is false. So the two lines do not cross. So this pair is okay.\n\nThen check between line 1 and line 3. Let's see.\n\nLine 1 is (0,0) to (-2,1). Line 3 is (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck if they cross.\n\nFor AB (A(0,0), B(-2,1)), CD (C(3,1), D(2,2)).\n\nccw1 = ccw(A,B,C) = ?\n\nA(0,0), B(-2,1), C(3,1).\n\n(B.x - A.x) = -2, (C.y - A.y) = 1. (B.y - A.y) = 1, (C.x - A.x) = 3. \n\nSo (-2)*1 - 1*3 = -2 -3 = -5.\n\nccw2 is ccw(A,B,D) where D is (2,2). \n\n(B.x - A.x) is -2, (D.y - A.y) is 2. (B.y - A.y) is 1, (D.x - A.x) is 2.\n\nSo (-2)*2 - 1*2 = -4 -2 = -6.\n\nSo ccw1 * ccw2 is (-5)*(-6) = 30 >0. So no crossing.\n\nThen check between line 2 and line 3.\n\nLine 2 is (2,0) to (0,3). Line 3 is (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck AB is (2,0) to (0,3), CD is (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCompute ccw for AB and C, D.\n\nccw(A,B,C) where A is (2,0), B is (0,3), C is (3,1).\n\n(B.x - A.x) is -2. (C.y - A.y) is 1-0=1. (B.y - A.y) is 3-0=3. (C.x - A.x) is 3-2=1.\n\nSo (-2)*1 - 3*1 = -2 -3 = -5.\n\nccw(A,B,D) where D is (2,2). \n\n(B.x - A.x) is -2. (D.y - A.y) is 2-0=2. (B.y - A.y) is 3. (D.x - A.x) is 2-2=0.\n\nSo (-2)*2 - 3*0 = -4 - 0 = -4.\n\nccw1 * ccw2 is (-5)*(-4) = 20>0. So again, no crossing. Hence, this permutation is valid.\n\nSo the code would return Yes.\n\nAnother sample input is the second case:\n\nInput is ['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, the input is:\n\n2 1\n\nThen the next lines are for the ships. Wait, the first line is R and B. For the second example, the input is:\n\n2 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. Since R != B, output is No. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the inputs correctly. Also, note that the input may be given as a list of strings (as per the example given in the problem description). Wait, no. The problem says that the input is read from standard input. The example shows that the first input is a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin. So, perhaps the code should read from stdin, split into lines, etc.\n\nNow, in Python, the code will read from stdin. For example, the first line is R and B. Then R lines of ships, then B lines of bases.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nBut this is probably a way to represent two test cases. However, the actual code must read from stdin. So, the code must read all input lines, split into the appropriate parts.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So, the code should process one test case per run. Wait, but looking at the sample input and output, the first example's input is a single test case, and the output is 'Yes'. The second example's input is another test case, with output 'No'.\n\nBut the problem says that the code must process the input as per the given format. So, for example, the code should read R and B, then read R lines of ships, then B lines of bases.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. Split into lines.\n\nBut in practice, for the code submission, the code must read from stdin. So, for example, the code could be written as:\n\nimport sys, itertools\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    # Generate all permutations of bases\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # Check if the line between ships[i] and perm[i] intersects with line between ships[j] and perm[j]\n                a = ships[i]\n                b = perm[i]\n                c = ships[j]\n                d = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, the code for permutations is generating all possible permutations of the bases. However, the bases are stored as a list. For example, if there are 3 bases, then permutations will generate all 3! possibilities.\n\nBut in the code, the bases are read as a list, and perm is a permutation of that list. So, each perm is a tuple of the bases in some order.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, the code checks all pairs of lines. So, for each i and j, i < j, check if the line between ships[i] and perm[i] and the line between ships[j] and perm[j] intersect.\n\nBut this code may have a problem. For example, if there are multiple permutations, but for some reason, the code checks all of them. However, for the first valid permutation, it returns 'Yes'.\n\nNow, considering that the code may take some time for R=10, but given that the constraints are small, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe code reads R=3, B=3. Ships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)], bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]. Then, permutations are generated. One of them is the identity permutation, which is checked. As discussed, the code would find that no lines cross, and return 'Yes'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nR=2, B=1. So, since R != B, code outputs 'No'.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Ships at (0,0) and (1,1). Bases at (0,1) and (1,0). Now, possible permutations are:\n\nperm1: [(0,1), (1,0)] → lines from (0,0) to (0,1) and (1,1) to (1,0). These lines are vertical lines, which are parallel. They don't cross. So valid.\n\nBut wait, the lines are from (0,0) to (0,1) (vertical line x=0), and (1,1) to (1,0) (vertical line x=1). They don't cross. So the code would return Yes.\n\nAnother permutation is [(1,0), (0,1)]. Lines from (0,0) to (1,0) (horizontal line y=0) and (1,1) to (0,1) (horizontal line y=1). Again, no crossing. So code returns Yes.\n\nAnother case: ships at (0,0), (2,2). Bases at (1,1), (3,3). Then, the lines would be (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(3,3). These are colinear. But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So in this case, the input would not be allowed. So the code can assume that no three points are colinear. So the code doesn't have to handle that case.\n\nBut in the code, the segments_intersect function would check for crossing. For the two lines (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(3,3), the code would check:\n\nccw1 = ccw(A,B,C) where A is (0,0), B is (1,1), C is (2,2). The value is (1-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) = (1*2) - (1*2) = 0. Similarly for others. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, this case is not possible. So the code can safely assume that for any two line segments, their endpoints are not colinear.\n\nBut in the code, the segments_intersect function would return False for this case, since the ccw1 * ccw2 would be zero (so not less than zero). So the code would not consider this as intersecting. Which is correct.\n\nBut in this case, the two lines are colinear and overlapping. But since the problem states that no three points are colinear, this can't happen. Because, for example, the points (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) would be colinear, which is not allowed. Hence, such an input is not possible.\n\nThus, the code is safe.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nBut note that the code uses permutations of the bases. However, the bases are stored as a list of tuples. When generating permutations, each element is a tuple. So, for example, in the code, for perm in permutations(bases), each perm is a tuple of the bases in some order.\n\nBut in Python, tuples are hashable and can be compared. So the code should work.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where R = B = 1. Then, there's only one possible permutation, and no pairs of lines. So output is 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case: R = B = 2. Ships and bases arranged in such a way that any permutation has crossing lines. For example, ships at (0,0), (0,1); bases at (1,0), (1,1). Permutation 1: (1,0) and (1,1). The lines are (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1). These are parallel, no crossing. So output is 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case: ships at (0,0), (1,0). Bases at (0,1), (1,1). Same as before. So output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case where the two lines cross. For example, ships are (0,0), (2,2). Bases are (2,0), (0,2). The permutation [ (2,0), (0,2) ] would have lines from (0,0) to (2,0) and (2,2) to (0,2). These lines are horizontal and vertical. Do they cross? The first line is from (0,0) to (2,0) (along y=0). The second line is from (2,2) to (0,2) (along y=2). No crossing. So valid.\n\nBut if the permutation is [ (0,2), (2,0) ]: lines are (0,0) to (0,2) (vertical line x=0) and (2,2) to (2,0) (vertical line x=2). No crossing. Valid.\n\nBut if ships are (0,0), (1,1). Bases are (1,0), (0,1). Now, possible permutations:\n\nPermutation [ (1,0), (0,1) ]: lines (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These are two horizontal lines, no crossing.\n\nPermutation [ (0,1), (1,0) ]: lines (0,0)-(0,1) (vertical) and (1,1)-(1,0) (vertical). No crossing. So output is Yes.\n\nAnother case: ships are (0,0), (2,2). Bases are (1,1), (3,3). But since the problem says no three points are colinear, this input is invalid. But the code can assume that the input is correct. So in this case, the code would generate permutations. For example, the permutation [ (1,1), (3,3) ] would have lines from (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,2) to (3,3). These are colinear, but since the problem says no three points are colinear, this case is not possible. Hence, the code can assume that such a case does not occur.\n\nAnother test case: R = B = 2. Ships at (0,0), (3,3). Bases at (1,1), (2,2). This is invalid input, but the code would process it. However, the code would check the lines between (0,0)-(1,1) and (3,3)-(2,2). These lines cross? Let's see.\n\nThe line between (0,0) and (1,1) is part of the line y=x. The line between (3,3) and (2,2) is also part of y=x. So they are colinear. But since the problem says no three points are colinear, this case is not allowed. So the code can assume that such input is not present.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement the code in Python.\n\nBut note that the code must read from stdin. Also, in the code, the input is read as a list of lines. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '3 3', then the next three lines are the ships, then three lines are the bases.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. Let's proceed to write it.\n\nBut in Python, for the permutations, the code uses itertools.permutations. Also, the code must import itertools.\n\nBut the code may have to import sys and itertools.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nThe code must read input from stdin. The code must process all input correctly.\n\nAnother possible edge case: R=0 and B=0? But according to the problem statement, R and B are at least 1. Wait, no. The problem says 1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10. So R and B can't be zero. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nSo, the code is as written above.\n\nNow, test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe code would process this, generate permutations, and find one that works.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nR=2, B=1 → output 'No'.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother test case where R=B=2 and the lines cross. For example:\n\nShips at (0,0), (2,2). Bases at (2,0), (0,2). Now, the permutation [ (2,0), (0,2) ] would have lines (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). Do these lines cross?\n\nThe first line is from (0,0) to (2,0) (y=0). The second line is from (2,2) to (0,2) (y=2). No intersection. So valid.\n\nAnother permutation: [ (0,2), (2,0) ] → lines (0,0)-(0,2) (x=0) and (2,2)-(2,0) (x=2). No intersection. So valid.\n\nAnother example where there is a crossing:\n\nShips at (0,0), (3,3). Bases at (1,2), (2,1). Let's see.\n\nFor permutation [ (1,2), (2,1) ].\n\nLines: (0,0) to (1,2), and (3,3) to (2,1). Do these cross?\n\nLet me compute the segments_intersect function.\n\nA = (0,0), B = (1,2), C = (3,3), D = (2,1).\n\nCheck if AB and CD intersect.\n\nCompute ccw(A,B,C) = (1-0)*(3-0) - (2-0)*(3-0) → (1*3) - (2*3) = 3 - 6 = -3.\n\nccw(A,B,D) = (1-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) → 1*1 - 2*2 = 1-4 = -3.\n\nSo ccw1 * ccw2 is (-3)*(-3) = 9>0. So no intersection.\n\nccw(C,D,A) = (2-3)*(0-3) - (1-3)*(0-3) → (-1)*(-3) - (-2)*(-3) → 3 - 6 = -3.\n\nccw(C,D,B) = (2-3)*(2-3) - (1-3)*(1-3) → (-1)*(-1) - (-2)*(-2) → 1 -4 = -3. So product is 9>0. So returns False.\n\nThus, no intersection.\n\nAnother permutation: [ (2,1), (1,2) ].\n\nLines (0,0) to (2,1), and (3,3) to (1,2).\n\nCheck if these cross.\n\nAB: (0,0) to (2,1).\n\nCD: (3,3) to (1,2).\n\nccw(A,B,C) = (2-0)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(3-0) → 2*3 - 1*3 = 6-3=3.\n\nccw(A,B,D) = (2-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(1-0) → 2*2 -1*1=4-1=3. Product is 3*3=9>0. No intersection.\n\nThus, the code would return Yes.\n\nAnother case where the lines cross:\n\nShips: (0,0), (2,0). Bases: (1,1), (1,-1).\n\nPermutation [ (1,1), (1,-1) ].\n\nLines: (0,0) to (1,1), and (2,0) to (1,-1). Do they cross?\n\nAB is from (0,0) to (1,1). CD is from (2,0) to (1,-1).\n\nCheck AB and CD.\n\nccw(A,B,C",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting paths intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments and verifying if any permutation meets the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Validation**: Check if the number of spaceships (R) equals the number of bases (B). If not, output \"No\" immediately.\n2. **Reading Coordinates**: Read the coordinates of the spaceships and bases.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the bases to consider every possible assignment of spaceships to bases.\n4. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, check if any pair of connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect using computational geometry principles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                a = ships[i]\n                b = perm[i]\n                c = ships[j]\n                d = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, parsing the number of spaceships and bases, followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Check for Equal Numbers**: If the number of spaceships (R) does not match the number of bases (B), it's impossible to form a perfect matching, so we immediately output \"No\".\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible assignments of bases to spaceships.\n4. **Checking Intersections**: For each permutation, we check every pair of connecting lines to see if they intersect using the cross product method (`ccw` function). If any intersection is found, the permutation is discarded; otherwise, it is valid, and we output \"Yes\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we exhaustively check all possible assignments while leveraging computational geometry to efficiently determine intersections. The complexity is manageable due to the small constraints (R, B ≤ 10).",
