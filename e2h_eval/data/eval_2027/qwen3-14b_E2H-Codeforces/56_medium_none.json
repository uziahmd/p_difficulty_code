Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. So, the main task is to check if such a matching exists.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The input gives R spaceships and B bases. But since it's a perfect matching, R must equal B. Wait, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base.\" So yes, R must be equal to B. Wait, but looking at the input description: the first line has R and B. Oh, but the problem says that it's guaranteed that there's a perfect matching? No, no. The problem says that we have to check if such a matching exists. But for that, R and B must be equal. Otherwise, it's impossible. Wait, the problem says that in the input, the first line has R and B. So, for example, if R is not equal to B, then the answer is immediately No. Because a perfect matching requires that R equals B. Oh right! So the first thing to check is whether R equals B. If not, output No.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first example is 3 3, which is okay. The second example is 2 1, so R=2, B=1. Then the answer is No because you can't have a perfect matching. But the sample output for the second input is 'No' which matches that.\n\nSo the first step in the code is to check if R != B. If they are not equal, output 'No'.\n\nNow, assuming R = B. Then, we need to check if there's a perfect matching between the spaceships and bases such that no two edges cross each other.\n\nSo how do we model this?\n\nThe problem reduces to checking if there's a bipartite matching between the two sets (spaceships and bases) where the edges are non-crossing. But how to model this?\n\nBut since the number of points is small (up to 10 each), maybe we can generate all possible permutations and check for each permutation whether the edges cross.\n\nWait, since R=B=n, the problem is to find a permutation of the bases (or spaceships) such that when each spaceship is matched to the corresponding base in the permutation, none of the line segments cross.\n\nSo for example, if we have n spaceships and n bases, we can try all possible n! permutations of the bases and check for each if the lines between the i-th spaceship and the permuted i-th base don't cross any other lines.\n\nBut for n up to 10, n! is 3.6 million for n=10. Wait 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of lines to see if they cross. For each permutation, checking O(n^2) pairs. For n=10, that's 100 per permutation. So total operations would be around 3.6e8 operations. That's 360 million. Which might be a bit slow for Python, but given that n is small (since R and B are up to 10), maybe it's manageable. But perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to model this as a bipartite graph where edges are non-crossing, and then find a perfect matching. But how to construct that graph?\n\nBut even for that, the problem is that the edges depend on the matching. For example, two edges may cross if they are part of a certain matching, but not if they are part of another. So the graph is not static; the allowed edges depend on the entire matching. Therefore, perhaps the only way is to check all possible perfect matchings and see if any of them has non-crossing edges.\n\nBut generating all possible perfect matchings is equivalent to generating all permutations (since each perfect matching is a bijection between the two sets). So for each permutation, check if all edges are non-crossing.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Check if R != B. If not, return No.\n- Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (or spaceships) and check for each permutation if the lines between the i-th spaceship and the i-th base in the permutation have no crossing lines.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments cross?\n\nWe need a function that takes two line segments (each defined by two points) and returns True if they intersect (properly, not just touching endpoints).\n\nBut in this problem, the note says that no three points are colinear. So, any two line segments that share an endpoint (i.e., if two lines are from the same spaceship to different bases, or same base to different spaceships) will not be considered as crossing. Because the problem says that the paths are straight lines from the spaceship to the base. So, two lines that share a common endpoint (like (s1, b1) and (s1, b2)) would not be considered as crossing. However, if two lines (s1, b1) and (s2, b2) cross each other in the middle, then that's a problem.\n\nSo the function to check if two line segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) intersect properly (i.e., not just at endpoints) is needed.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nI remember that there's a standard computational geometry approach for checking line segment intersections. The steps are:\n\nFirst, check if the two segments intersect by checking if their bounding boxes overlap. Then, use the orientation method to determine if the segments cross.\n\nAlternatively, use the cross product approach.\n\nLet me recall the method.\n\nFor two line segments AB and CD, they intersect if:\n\n- The orientation of A, B, C is different from the orientation of A, B, D, and the orientation of C, D, A is different from the orientation of C, D, B. (This is for proper intersection, not touching endpoints.)\n\nBut also, if one of the segments has an endpoint lying on the other segment, but since the problem states that no three points are colinear, this case cannot happen. Because if two segments share an endpoint, then that's a point, but since all points are unique, the only way for a segment AB and CD to have overlapping points is if one of the endpoints is on the other segment. However, since no three points are colinear, this can't happen. Because suppose AB and CD share a point. Let's say A is C. Then, the line segments AC and CD would be connected. But since all points are unique, the only way that could happen is if A=C. But the problem says that no two points coincide. So, the problem says that all points are distinct, so the line segments can't share endpoints. So, in our case, when checking for intersections between two line segments, we can assume that the segments are not sharing any endpoints, and thus, any intersection between them must be proper (i.e., crossing in the middle).\n\nWait, but in our problem, the line segments are from a spaceship to a base. So, for a permutation, each line segment is between a spaceship and a base. So, two different line segments (say, s1 to b1 and s2 to b2) can't share any endpoints, because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base and vice versa. So, for two different line segments in the permutation, their endpoints are all distinct. Thus, when checking for intersections between two line segments, we can safely assume that they are not sharing endpoints, and thus, any intersection between them is a proper crossing.\n\nTherefore, the function to check if two line segments AB and CD cross each other is to check if the orientations of ABC and ABD are different, and the orientations of CDA and CDB are different.\n\nSo, the first step is to implement a function that checks whether two line segments intersect.\n\nLet me think about how to implement that.\n\nFirst, define a helper function to compute the orientation of three points.\n\nOrientation of points p, q, r:\n\n- 0 if colinear\n- 1 if clockwise\n- 2 if counter-clockwise\n\nBut perhaps the standard way is to compute the cross product (q - p) × (r - p). The sign of this cross product tells us the orientation.\n\nThe cross product can be calculated as:\n\ncross = (qx - px) * (ry - py) - (qy - py) * (rx - px)\n\nIf cross is zero, colinear.\n\nElse, positive means counter-clockwise, negative means clockwise.\n\nBut for our purposes, the actual value isn't important. We need to know whether the points are colinear, or the orientation.\n\nSo the helper function:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # 1 for clockwise, 2 for counter-clockwise\n\nThen, the function to check if two segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases (but according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so these cases are not possible?)\n    # For example, if a point is on the segment. But since the problem says no three points are colinear, and all points are unique, this can't happen. So perhaps the code can ignore these cases.\n\n    # However, in the problem statement, the input ensures that no three points are colinear. So, the code can safely assume that the only possible intersection is the general case. Therefore, the above condition is sufficient.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but what if one of the segments is colinear with the other? Well, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, for example, if AB and CD are colinear, then the points A, B, C, D would be colinear, which would imply that there are three points on the same line. Which the problem says is not allowed. Therefore, the code can safely assume that any two segments that are colinear would not exist. Therefore, the function can be implemented as the general case.\n\nThus, the segments_intersect function can be written as follows.\n\nOnce that is in place, for a given permutation of bases (assuming that the spaceships are ordered as per their input, and the permutation represents the order of bases assigned to each spaceship), we need to check all pairs of line segments (from spaceship i to base permutation[i]) and see if any pair of them intersect.\n\nIf for any pair of segments in the permutation, they intersect, then this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each permutation of the bases:\n\n   For each pair of indices i < j:\n\n      Check if the segment between spaceship i and base perm[i] intersects with the segment between spaceship j and base perm[j].\n\n      If any such intersection exists, break and reject this permutation.\n\nIf all pairs are non-intersecting, then return \"Yes\".\n\nNow, the question is how to generate all permutations of the bases.\n\nBut the bases are given as a list. So for example, if the input has B bases, then the permutations are all possible orderings of the B bases.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So, for example, if there are R spaceships and B bases (R=B), then each permutation of the bases corresponds to a possible perfect matching. So, for each permutation, we assign the i-th spaceship to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\nBut since the spaceships are given in a certain order, and the bases are given in a certain order, the permutation represents the assignment of the bases to the spaceships.\n\nBut since the problem allows any perfect matching, we can generate all possible permutations of the bases, and check each one.\n\nBut for the code, the steps are:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read R spaceships, then read B bases.\n\nThen, generate all possible permutations of the B bases. For each permutation, check if the assignment of spaceship i to base perm[i] (for i from 0 to R-1) results in no intersecting segments.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nNow, the problem is that for R=10, there are 10! = 3.6 million permutations. For each permutation, we need to check O(n²) pairs of segments. For n=10, that's 10*9/2 = 45 pairs. For each pair, check if they intersect.\n\nSo for each permutation, 45 checks. For 3.6 million permutations, that's 3.6e6 * 45 = 162 million checks. Each check involves four orientation computations. But in Python, this may be acceptable for small n (like up to 10). But perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nBut given that the constraints are small, this approach should work.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead input:\n\nThe input is given as a string. Wait, but the user says that the input is read from stdin. Wait, the sample input shows something like ['3 3\\n0 0\\n...'] but perhaps the actual input comes as multiple lines. Wait, the problem says that the input is read from standard input. So for example, the first line is R and B. Then R lines for the spaceships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nBut for the code, we need to read from stdin. So in Python, read all lines, split into parts.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is provided via stdin, so the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No' and exit.\n\nElse, read R lines for the spaceships (coordinates), then B lines for the bases.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation, check all pairs of segments.\n\nIf any permutation is valid, output 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate permutations of the bases. For example, if the bases are stored as a list, then itertools.permutations can be used.\n\nBut in Python, permutations returns tuples, which can be handled.\n\nNow, implementing the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut for the code, the coordinates are integers, but the function works for any points.\n\nSo, code:\n\nImplement orientation as a helper function.\n\nImplement segments_intersect(a, b, c, d) as discussed.\n\nBut in the code, the spaceship positions are stored as a list, say ships = [ (x1, y1), ... ] and bases as bases = [ (x1, y1), ... ].\n\nFor a permutation p (which is a tuple of base indices?), no, the permutation is a permutation of the bases. For example, if the bases are stored as a list, then each permutation is a reordering of the bases. So for example, if the bases are [b1, b2, b3], then a permutation could be [b2, b1, b3], etc.\n\nWait, in Python, itertools.permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings of the bases. So for each permutation, the i-th element is the base assigned to the i-th spaceship.\n\nSo for each permutation in permutations(bases):\n\n   for i in 0..R-1:\n\n      ship_i = ships[i]\n\n      base_i = permutation[i]\n\n   Now, for all pairs (i, j), check if the segment between ship_i and base_i crosses the segment between ship_j and base_j.\n\nSo for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of segments (i, j) where i < j.\n\nSo for each permutation, generate all pairs of segments and check for intersections.\n\nIf any pair intersects, the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nBut what about the order of checking? For example, for each permutation, for all i < j, check if the segments (ships[i], perm[i]) and (ships[j], perm[j]) intersect. If any of them do, then the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, the code for checking a permutation is:\n\ndef is_valid(perm, ships, bases):\n\n    n = len(ships)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n\n            # get the two segments\n\n            seg1 = (ships[i], perm[i])\n\n            seg2 = (ships[j], perm[j])\n\n            if segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1]):\n\n                return False\n\n    return True\n\nBut in this code, the perm is a list (or tuple) of the bases in the order of assignment. For example, perm[i] is the base assigned to the i-th spaceship.\n\nSo, the code would generate all permutations of the bases list, and for each, check if all pairs of segments are non-crossing.\n\nNow, for the sample input:\n\nFirst example:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo the permutation could be the same order as the bases. So ships[0] (0,0) connects to base[0] (-2,1), ships[1] (2,0) connects to base[1] (0,3), ships[2] (3,1) connects to base[2] (2,2). Are there any crossings between these lines?\n\nLet me visualize:\n\nLine 1: (0,0) to (-2,1). Line 2: (2,0) to (0,3). Line 3: (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck if any of the pairs cross.\n\nLine 1 and line 2: Do they cross?\n\nWell, the line from (0,0) to (-2,1) is going up and left. The line from (2,0) to (0,3) is going up and left. Maybe they cross?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they don't. But according to the sample, the answer is Yes, so there exists at least one permutation where no crossings occur.\n\nBut regardless, the code would check all permutations and find one that works.\n\nNow, the code for the permutations.\n\nBut in Python, itertools.permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings. However, since the bases are stored as tuples (or lists), and the permutations are generated as tuples of those elements.\n\nBut in the code, the bases are read as a list of tuples. So for example, the code would read:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n\n    if val == 0:\n\n        return 0\n\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    R, B = map(int, input_lines[idx].split())\n\n    idx += 1\n\n    if R != B:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        return\n\n    ships = []\n\n    for _ in range(R):\n\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[idx].split())\n\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n\n        idx += 1\n\n    bases = []\n\n    for _ in range(B):\n\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[idx].split())\n\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Now generate all permutations of bases\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n\n        # Check if this permutation is valid\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(R):\n\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n                # check if the segments between ships[i] and perm[i], and ships[j] and perm[j] intersect\n\n                a = ships[i]\n\n                b = perm[i]\n\n                c = ships[j]\n\n                d = perm[j]\n\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n\n                    valid = False\n\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if valid:\n\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, this code has a problem. Because permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings of the bases. However, in the case where there are duplicate bases, but according to the problem statement, all points are unique. So no duplicates. So the permutations are all unique.\n\nBut in the code, the bases are stored as tuples, and permutations are generated correctly.\n\nBut in the code, the 'permutations' function will generate all possible orderings of the bases. However, for example, if there are two bases, the permutations would be all possible orderings.\n\nBut what about the time constraints? For R=10, 10! is 3.6 million, and for each permutation, checking 45 pairs. For each pair, four orientation checks.\n\nBut in Python, this may be slow. However, given that the constraints are small (R and B up to 10), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut for R=10, 3.6 million permutations, each with 45 checks, that's 162 million checks. Each check involves 4 orientation calculations, which are O(1) operations. But even so, in Python, this could be slow.\n\nBut given that the constraints are small, perhaps the code will pass.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo ships = [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases = [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nThe code generates permutations of the bases. One of the permutations is the original order. Let's check if this permutation is valid.\n\nCheck all pairs:\n\ni=0, j=1:\n\nseg1 is (0,0) to (-2,1)\n\nseg2 is (2,0) to (0,3)\n\nCheck if they intersect.\n\nCompute orientation for a=(0,0), b=(-2,1), c=(2,0):\n\norientation(a, b, c) = ?\n\nval = ( (-2 - 0) * (0 - 0) ) - ( (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) )\n\nWait:\n\n(q is b: (-2, 1), p is a: (0,0), r is c: (2,0).\n\nval = (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n\n= (-2 - 0) * (0 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) \n\n= (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2 → which is negative. So orientation is 2 (counter-clockwise? Or depends on the sign.)\n\nBut the code returns 1 if val>0 else 2. So here, val is -2, so returns 2.\n\no1 = 2.\n\no2 is orientation(a, b, d) where d is (0,3).\n\nSo, a=(0,0), b=(-2,1), d=(0,3).\n\nval = (-2-0)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) → (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6 → val <0 → orientation 2.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are same (both 2), so the first condition (o1 != o2) is false.\n\nThen check o3 and o4.\n\no3 is orientation(c, d, a) → c is (2,0), d is (0,3), a is (0,0).\n\nval = (0-2)*(0-3) - (3-0)*(0-2) → (-2)*(-3) - 3*(-2) → 6 +6 = 12 → positive → orientation 1.\n\no4 is orientation(c, d, b) → (2,0), (0,3), b is (-2,1).\n\nval = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(-2-2) → (-2)*(1) - 3*(-4) → -2 +12 = 10 → positive → orientation 1.\n\nSo o3 and o4 are same. So the condition o3 != o4 is false. So overall, returns false. So segments do not intersect.\n\nSo for this pair, no intersection.\n\nThen check i=0 and j=2.\n\nseg1 is (0,0) to (-2,1). seg2 is (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck if they cross.\n\nSimilarly, compute orientations.\n\nBut perhaps they don't cross. Then check i=1 and j=2.\n\nseg1 is (2,0) to (0,3). seg2 is (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nDo these cross?\n\nWell, the first line goes from (2,0) to (0,3) (slope is (3-0)/(0-2) = -3/2). The second line is from (3,1) to (2,2) (slope is (2-1)/(2-3) = 1/-1 = -1). The lines may cross.\n\nBut according to the sample, there is a valid permutation, so perhaps this permutation is not the correct one. But perhaps another permutation exists.\n\nBut regardless, the code would check all permutations.\n\nBut for the first sample, the code would find at least one permutation that works.\n\nAnother possible permutation is assigning the bases in a different order. For example, maybe the code finds that the permutation [base1, base2, base3] (original) is valid.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps the code would find that there are no intersections, hence returns Yes.\n\nBut how to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the sample input passes.\n\nNow, for the second sample input:\n\nInput is 2 1. Since R != B, output is No.\n\nAnother test case: when R=B=2, but the two lines cross.\n\nFor example, ships at (0,0) and (2,2). Bases at (1,1) and (3,3). Then, the only possible permutation is [ (1,1), (3,3) ] and [ (3,3), (1,1) ].\n\nIn the first case, the lines are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(3,3). These lines are colinear, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. Wait, but in this case, the points (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) are colinear. But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So this input would not be allowed. Hence, the code can assume that such cases are not present in the input.\n\nSo the code can safely proceed.\n\nBut the problem says that the input guarantees that no two points coincide and no three are colinear. So the code can rely on that.\n\nNow, considering that, the code is correct.\n\nBut there's one possible mistake in the code: the permutation is generated from the bases list, but perhaps the code should generate permutations of the indices, not the actual points. Because in the code, if there are duplicate bases (but the problem says no two points coincide, so no duplicates), but the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the code, the 'permutations' function returns tuples of the base points. But in the code, for each permutation, the code checks all pairs of segments. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about the order of the ships? The code assumes that the ships are ordered as per their input, and the permutation assigns the bases in the order of the permutation. So for example, the first ship is assigned to the first element of the permutation, etc. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nThe input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is parsed into R=3, B=3. Ships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]. Bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nThe code will generate all permutations of the bases. For example, the first permutation is [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)], which is the same as the input order. Then, for each pair of segments, check for intersection.\n\nAs discussed earlier, for this permutation, the code would check all pairs and find that none intersect, thus returning 'Yes'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWhich is R=2, B=1. So output is 'No'.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut in Python, the permutations can be generated with itertools.permutations.\n\nBut for the code to work, the code needs to import permutations.\n\nAlso, note that the code must read from stdin, and output 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nNow, the code as written above may have some issues with the order of the input. For example, in the code, after reading R and B, it reads R lines for the ships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example's input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is:\n\nFirst line: 3 3\n\nNext 3 lines: ships.\n\nNext 3 lines: bases.\n\nWhich is handled correctly.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nAnother edge case: R=B=1. Then, there is only one possible assignment. So output is 'Yes'.\n\nAnother edge case: R=B=2. Two ships and two bases. Suppose the lines cross. Then output is 'No'.\n\nFor example, ships at (0,0), (2,2). Bases at (2,0), (0,2). The only possible permutations are [ (2,0), (0,2) ] and [ (0,2), (2,0) ].\n\nIn the first permutation, the lines are (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These lines are horizontal and vertical, but they cross at (1, 1)? Wait, no. The first line is from (0,0) to (2,0) (along y=0). The second line is from (2,2) to (0,2) (along y=2). These lines are parallel and do not cross. So the answer is 'Yes'.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lines are parallel, so no crossing. So the code would return 'Yes'.\n\nBut if the ships are (0,0), (1, 1) and bases are (1, 0), (0, 1). Then, the permutation [ (1,0), (0,1) ] would have lines (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These lines are horizontal and parallel, no crossing. So 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case: ships at (0,0) and (2, 2). Bases at (1, 1) and (3, 3). But this is invalid input, since the problem says no three points are colinear. But in this case, the points (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) are colinear. So this input would not be allowed.\n\nBut the code can assume that the input is valid.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code can be written as:\n\nImporting sys and itertools.permutations.\n\nBut the code must not include any comments. So the code will be as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign each Rebel spaceship to a unique base such that the straight-line paths between each spaceship and its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of base assignments to ensure no two paths intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Validation**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If not, immediately return \"No\" as a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the bases, check if assigning each spaceship to the corresponding base in the permutation results in non-intersecting paths.\n3. **Intersection Detection**: Use computational geometry to check if two line segments intersect. This involves calculating the orientation of points to determine if segments cross each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input_lines[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[idx].split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                a = ships[i]\n                b = perm[i]\n                c = ships[j]\n                d = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and parsed into the number of spaceships (R), bases (B), their coordinates, and the coordinates of the bases.\n2. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible assignments of bases to spaceships are generated.\n3. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, every pair of line segments (from spaceship to base) is checked for intersection using the `segments_intersect` function. This function uses the orientation of points to determine if segments intersect.\n4. **Output Result**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting paths, \"Yes\" is printed. If no valid permutation is found, \"No\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible assignments are checked efficiently given the constraints, leveraging computational geometry principles to validate the non-intersection condition.",
