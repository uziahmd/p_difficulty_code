    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the inversion count of p is greater than that of q. And we have to do this for n up to 500, which is a pretty big number, so efficiency is crucial.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. Let's break it down. We have two permutations p and q. We need to count all pairs where:\n\n1. p is lexicographically smaller than q.\n2. inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nSo the total number of such pairs modulo mod is the answer.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 500, the total number of permutations is n! which is way too big to iterate through all possible pairs. So brute force is impossible. We need a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the properties of permutations and their inversion counts.\n\nFirst, note that for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of the following holds: p < q, p > q, or they are equal. But since p and q are distinct, the total number of unordered pairs is (total permutations choose 2). However, the problem counts ordered pairs where p is lex smaller than q, and then checks the inversion condition.\n\nBut the problem requires that p < q (lex order) and inv(p) > inv(q). So the question is, for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, how many of them satisfy (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q))?\n\nWait, but since for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of ordered pairs where p < q is (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) / 2. But in our case, we need to count among those pairs where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut maybe there's some symmetry here. Let me think: For all pairs (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of the following is true: inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). But how does this relate to the lex order?\n\nBut the problem requires that p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). So perhaps if we can compute for all pairs (p, q) with p < q, how many of them have inv(p) > inv(q), that would be the answer.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of all possible pairs (p, q) where p < q. Let's denote the number of such pairs as T. Then, among these T pairs, how many have inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nBut since for each pair (p, q) where p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or they are equal. Let me consider that for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for each such pair, exactly one of the two possibilities (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) or (q < p and inv(q) > inv(p)) could be true. But maybe not, because inv(p) and inv(q) could be equal. So for pairs where inv(p) = inv(q), neither contributes to the count.\n\nSo the total number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of pairs where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p) equals the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) != inv(q).\n\nBut since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of the two conditions (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) or (q < p and inv(q) > inv(p)) holds. Because if inv(p) > inv(q), then if p < q, it contributes to the first count. Otherwise, if q < p, then inv(q) < inv(p), which would contribute to the second count. Wait, no. Suppose inv(p) > inv(q). If p < q, then the pair (p, q) contributes to the first count. If q < p, then the pair (q, p) would be considered as q < p, and inv(q) < inv(p), so the condition inv(q) > inv(p) would not hold. So in this case, the pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) contributes exactly once to the count of (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) if p < q, or to the count of (q < p and inv(q) > inv(p)) only if inv(q) > inv(p) which is not the case. Wait, no. If inv(p) > inv(q), then for the pair (p, q), if p < q, it contributes to the first count. If q < p, then in the pair (q, p), since q < p, we check if inv(q) > inv(p). Which is false. So for the pair {p, q}, exactly one of the following is true: either inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q, or inv(q) > inv(p) and q < p. Or, if inv(p) = inv(q), then neither contributes.\n\nThus, the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) != inv(q)) divided by 2. Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the two possibilities (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) or q < p and inv(q) > inv(p)) holds. Therefore, the count of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs_with_different_inversions) / 2.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if for every unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of the two possibilities holds. Which seems to be the case. Because if inv(p) > inv(q), then either p < q or q < p. And in the case where p < q, then the pair contributes to the count. In the case where q < p, then the pair (q, p) would have inv(q) < inv(p), which is not the condition we want. So the total number of such pairs is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1 if p < q, but how does that sum up?\n\nAlternatively, think of all unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) != inv(q). For each such pair, exactly one of (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) or (q < p and inv(q) > inv(p)) holds. Because if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for each such pair, exactly one of the two conditions (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) or (q < p and inv(q) > inv(p)) is true. Therefore, the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the two possibilities (p < q or q < p) holds. Thus, the total number of such pairs is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1/2? No, because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the two possibilities (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) or (q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)) holds. Wait, if inv(p) > inv(q), then the unordered pair {p, q} contributes exactly once to the count of (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) if p < q, otherwise it contributes to the count of (q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)), which is not part of our desired condition. So the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Similarly, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and q < p is the same as the number of pairs where inv(q) < inv(p) and q < p, which is the same as the number of pairs where inv(q) < inv(p) and q < p, which is the same as the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and q < p. But since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of these two possibilities holds. Therefore, the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of (p, q) pairs with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of (p, q) pairs with q < p and inv(p) > inv(q). But since the latter is the same as the number of (q, p) pairs with p < q and inv(q) < inv(p). So the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of (p, q) pairs with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of (p, q) pairs with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if I denote A as the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), and B as the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q), then since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented. Also, the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) != inv(q) is equal to A + B. But since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds, and exactly one of the two possibilities (p < q or q < p) holds. So the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) != inv(q) is equal to A + B. But also, the total number of unordered pairs is C(n) = (total_permutations choose 2). Let me think about the total number of unordered pairs where inv(p) != inv(q). Let me denote that as D. Then, D = A + B. Also, since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of the two cases (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) or (p < q and inv(p) < inv(q)) occurs. Wait, no. Because for a pair {p, q}, if p < q, then it's counted in A or B. If q < p, then it's counted in another part. But the total number of unordered pairs is equal to the number of ordered pairs where p < q. Because for each unordered pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q is equal to total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1) / 2. Let me call this value T. Then, T = A + B + E, where E is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). But D = (T - E) = A + B. But how does this help us?\n\nBut our problem requires to find A, the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). If we can find the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q), then A would be equal to that number minus the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and q < p. But I don't see how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q), because for each such pair, swapping p and q would flip the inversion counts. But this is only true if the inversion counts are symmetric. However, the inversion counts for permutations are not symmetric in terms of their distribution. Wait, for example, the number of permutations with k inversions is the same as the number of permutations with (n*(n-1)/2 -k) inversions. Because reversing a permutation turns inversions into non-inversions and vice versa. So for example, the maximum number of inversions is n(n-1)/2, which is achieved by the reversed permutation. So the number of permutations with k inversions is equal to the number with max_k -k inversions, where max_k is n(n-1)/2. Therefore, the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q). Because for each pair where inv(p) > inv(q), there's a corresponding pair where inv(q) < inv(p). But wait, no, because when you swap p and q, the pair {p, q} is the same. So the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q). Therefore, the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q) is equal to 2 * X, where X is the number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q). But since D = 2X, and D is also equal to T - E (where T is the total number of ordered pairs (p < q), and E is the number of pairs (p < q) with inv(p) = inv(q)), then:\n\nBut this seems like a dead end. Let me think again.\n\nIf we can find the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), then since each such pair contributes exactly once to either A or B, depending on whether p < q or not. But how to relate that to A?\n\nAlternatively, suppose that for all unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly half of them have p < q and the other half have q < p. Is that true? Well, if the permutations are uniformly distributed with respect to lex order, then maybe. But that's probably not the case. For example, consider n=2. The permutations are [1,2] (inv=0) and [2,1] (inv=1). The unordered pair {p, q} has inv(p) > inv(q) only when p is [2,1], q is [1,2]. So there's exactly one such pair. Now, since p is [2,1], q is [1,2], then p > q lex-wise. So the pair (p, q) would contribute to the count of (q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)), but not to A. So in this case, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is 1, and the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is zero. So in this case, A is zero, but the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is 1. So the assumption that A equals X (the number of such unordered pairs) divided by 2 is incorrect.\n\nSo that approach doesn't work. Therefore, I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Let me think about generating functions or dynamic programming for inversion counts. But how?\n\nWe need to compute for all pairs of permutations p and q, where p < q, and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's denote that the answer is A.\n\nBut how can we compute A efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But for each such pair, we need to know if inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut even for n=500, n! is way too large to compute directly. So we need a way to compute the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) using some combinatorial properties.\n\nAnother idea: Let's precompute for each possible inversion count k, the number of permutations with exactly k inversions. Let's denote this as inv_count[k]. Then, the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is sum_{k > l} inv_count[k] * inv_count[l]. However, this includes all unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), regardless of their lex order. But we need to find how many of those pairs have p < q.\n\nBut how can we find the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)? It's equal to the sum over all k > l of (number of permutations with inv count k) * (number of permutations with inv count l) * (probability that a random permutation with inv count k is lex smaller than a random permutation with inv count l). But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair (p, q) where p < q, we can think of the pair (p, q) as contributing 1 if inv(p) > inv(q), else 0. The total sum is A.\n\nBut how to compute this sum? It's equivalent to:\n\nA = sum_{p < q} [inv(p) > inv(q)]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nA = (sum_{p < q} [inv(p) - inv(q) > 0]) \n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAnother approach: For all permutations p and q, where p != q, the sum over [p < q] * [inv(p) > inv(q)] is equal to the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me think about the entire sum over all p and q (including p = q, but those contribute zero). Let me denote:\n\nTotal = sum_{p, q} [p < q] * [inv(p) > inv(q)] \n\nBut this is exactly the A we need.\n\nNow, note that for all p and q, if p != q, then exactly one of [p < q] or [q < p] is true. So:\n\nsum_{p != q} [p < q] * [inv(p) > inv(q)] + sum_{p != q} [q < p] * [inv(q) > inv(q)] = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] * [p < q or q < p] ?\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nLet me think of the entire set of pairs (p, q) where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p is true. So:\n\nTotal = sum_{p != q} [p < q] * [inv(p) > inv(q)] \n\nBut this is the same as:\n\nTotal = sum_{p != q} [ (p < q) and (inv(p) > inv(q)) ]\n\nWhich is exactly the A we need.\n\nNow, consider that for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of the following is true:\n\nEither inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). So:\n\nsum_{p != q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) < inv(q)] \n\nBecause for each pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), there is a corresponding pair (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p). So the sum is equal. Let me denote this sum as S. Then, S = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) < inv(q)].\n\nBut the total number of pairs where inv(p) != inv(q) is 2S. Also, the total number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) is T_total = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2 - 2S ?\n\nNo, the total number of pairs (p, q) with p != q is n! * (n! - 1). This is equal to 2S + E, where E is the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q). Because for each pair with inv(p) != inv(q), it contributes 1 to S or to the other sum. But since S = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) < inv(q)], then the total number of pairs with inv(p) != inv(q) is 2S. Hence:\n\nn! * (n! - 1) = 2S + E, where E is the number of pairs with inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nWell, our problem is to compute Total = sum_{p < q} [inv(p) > inv(q)].\n\nBut note that:\n\nTotal = sum_{p < q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = sum_{p < q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] * 1 \n\nBut since for each pair (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So:\n\nTotal + sum_{p < q} [inv(q) > inv(p)] = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = S \n\nBut since sum_{p < q} [inv(q) > inv(p)] is the same as sum_{q < p} [inv(q) > inv(p)] which is the same as sum_{q < p} [inv(q) > inv(p)] = sum_{p < q} [inv(p) < inv(q)] (by substituting variables). \n\nSo, Total + (sum_{p < q} [inv(p) < inv(q)]) ) = S \n\nBut sum_{p < q} [inv(p) < inv(q)] is equal to sum_{p < q} [inv(p) < inv(q)] = B, where B is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). \n\nAnd since S = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = sum_{p < q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] + sum_{p < q} [inv(q) > inv(p)] \n\nWait, no. For each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So:\n\nsum_{p != q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = sum_{p < q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] + sum_{q < p} [inv(q) > inv(p)] \n\nBut sum_{q < p} [inv(q) > inv(p)] is equal to sum_{p < q} [inv(p) < inv(q)] (by substituting variables). \n\nTherefore:\n\nS = Total + B \n\nBut earlier, we had that S = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) < inv(q)] = same as sum_{p != q} [inv(p) < inv(q)] = same as sum_{p != q} [inv(p) > inv(q)].\n\nBut also, since the total number of pairs (p < q) is T = n! * (n! - 1) / 2. And since T = Total + B + E', where E' is the number of pairs (p < q) with inv(p) = inv(q). \n\nBut since Total + B = S, and T = Total + B + E', then:\n\nS = T - E'\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed from here.\n\nBut what if I can compute S and E'? Then, since S = Total + B, and T = Total + B + E', then S = T - E'.\n\nBut how does this help me find Total?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem requires Total, which is the answer we need. But how to compute it?\n\nLet me think again. If I can compute the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), then that's the answer. But how?\n\nLet me think about generating for each permutation p, the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p and have fewer inversions than p. Then, the answer is the sum over all p of the number of such q's.\n\nBut even this approach may be computationally expensive, as for n=500, there are 500! permutations. So we need a way to compute this without enumerating all permutations.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider that for each possible inversion count k, we have a certain number of permutations with that count. Let's denote inv_count[k] as the number of permutations of length n with exactly k inversions. Then, the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is sum_{k > l} inv_count[k] * inv_count[l]. But this counts all unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). However, we need to find how many of these pairs have p < q.\n\nBut how to compute how many pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) have p < q. \n\nSuppose that for each pair of inversion counts (k, l) where k > l, we can compute the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = k, inv(q) = l, and p < q. Then, the answer is the sum over all such (k, l) of this count.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each pair (k, l) with k > l, compute the number of (p, q) pairs where p < q, inv(p) = k, inv(q) = l. Summing over all such (k, l) gives the answer.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps there's a relationship between the inversion counts and the lex order. For example, for two permutations p and q with the same inversion count, how many of them have p < q?\n\nBut for general k and l, it's unclear. However, if we can compute for each pair (k, l), the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = k, inv(q) = l, and p < q, then the answer is the sum over all k > l of that count.\n\nBut how to compute this count?\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = k and inv(q) = l. This is inv_count[k] * inv_count[l]. For each such pair, exactly half of them will have p < q and the other half will have q < p, assuming that for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. But this is true. So for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = k, inv(q) = l, and p < q is equal to (inv_count[k] * inv_count[l] - same) / 2, where same is the number of pairs where p = q. But since p and q are distinct permutations, same is zero. So the count is (inv_count[k] * inv_count[l]) / 2 if k != l. However, this is only true when k != l. Because if k = l, then for each pair (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, so the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = k, inv(q) = k, and p < q is equal to (inv_count[k] * (inv_count[k] - 1)) / 2. \n\nBut in our case, we are considering k > l. So for each pair (k, l) where k > l, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) =k, inv(q)=l, and p < q is equal to (inv_count[k] * inv_count[l]) / 2. Because for each pair of permutations p and q with inv(p) =k and inv(q) =l (k != l), exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, and since k > l, the pair (p, q) contributes to the count if p < q. But why is that? Because the inversion counts are different, but the lex order is independent of the inversion counts. \n\nWait, no. For example, consider two permutations p and q with inv(p) =k and inv(q) =l, where k > l. But p could be lex smaller than q, or larger. The inversion counts have no direct relation to the lex order. So the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) =k, inv(q) =l, and p < q is equal to the number of such pairs (p, q) with p < q, which is (inv_count[k] * inv_count[l]) / 2, assuming that for any two distinct permutations p and q with inv(p) =k and inv(q) =l, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Which is true, since p and q are distinct permutations. \n\nSo, if this is the case, then the answer would be sum_{k > l} (inv_count[k] * inv_count[l]) / 2. \n\nWait, but that would imply that the answer is equal to (sum_{k > l} inv_count[k] * inv_count[l}) / 2. \n\nBut earlier, we saw that for n=2, the answer should be zero. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor n=2, the possible inversion counts are 0 (for [1,2]) and 1 (for [2,1]). \n\nThe sum over k > l is inv_count[1] * inv_count[0] = 1*1=1. Divided by 2 gives 0.5. But the actual answer is zero. Which contradicts this. So clearly, this assumption is wrong. \n\nSo why is this happening? Because for the pair (p, q) where p is [2,1] (inv=1), q is [1,2] (inv=0), then p > q lex-wise. So the pair (p, q) has inv(p) > inv(q) and p > q. So in this case, the pair (p, q) contributes to the count of (k=1, l=0) but since p is not less than q, it doesn't contribute to the answer. \n\nThus, the previous assumption that the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) =k, inv(q) =l, and p < q is (inv_count[k] * inv_count[l])/2 is incorrect. Because when k > l, the pair (p, q) could have p < q or p > q, but the inversion counts are not correlated with the lex order. \n\nSo, how can we find the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) =k, inv(q)=l, and p < q?\n\nThis seems really difficult. But perhaps there's a way to compute it using generating functions or dynamic programming.\n\nAlternative approach: For each permutation p, we can compute its inversion count, and then for all permutations q that are lex greater than p, we check if their inversion count is less than that of p. Summing over all such cases would give the answer. However, for n=500, this is impossible due to the sheer size of n!.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me denote this as A.\n\nAs before, the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Let me denote this as T.\n\nAlso, the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) is E. Then, the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) != inv(q) is T - E. And for these pairs, exactly half have inv(p) > inv(q) and the other half have inv(p) < inv(q), assuming that for any pair (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) != inv(q), the probability that inv(p) > inv(q) is 0.5. But this is not necessarily true, as shown in the n=2 example.\n\nBut wait, in the n=2 example, T = 1 (since there are two permutations, and only one pair (p, q) with p < q: ([1,2], [2,1])? No, wait, no. Wait, for n=2, there are 2 permutations. The number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is 1, which is ([1,2], [2,1])? No, no. Wait, [1,2] is lex smaller than [2,1]. So the only pair (p, q) where p < q is when p is [1,2] and q is [2,1]. So T is 1.\n\nIn this case, for this pair, inv(p) = 0, inv(q) = 1. So inv(p) < inv(q). So the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is zero. Which matches the example. \n\nBut according to the previous assumption that the number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is (T - E) / 2, since T - E is the number of pairs with p < q and inv(p) != inv(q), and for each such pair, exactly one of inv(p) > or < holds. Then, if this is true, then A = (T - E)/2. But in this case, T - E is 1 - 0 = 1. So A = 0.5, which is not possible. So this suggests that the assumption is wrong. \n\nBut why? Because in this case, for the single pair (p, q) where p < q, inv(p) is less than inv(q). So the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is zero. So the assumption that it's (T-E)/2 is invalid.\n\nThis indicates that the previous line of reasoning is incorrect. Hence, I need to find another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Consider that for all pairs (p, q) with p < q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(q) < inv(p). But this is trivially true. But how to find this number?\n\nPerhaps, if we can compute the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) + inv(q) = something, but I don't see how.\n\nLet me think about generating all possible inversion counts and their frequencies. For example, for each permutation p, we can compute its inversion count, and then for all permutations q that are lex greater than p, we can count how many have inversion count less than that of p. Summing this over all p gives the answer.\n\nBut again, for n=500, this is not feasible.\n\nAnother observation: The number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) with q < p and inv(q) > inv(p). Because for each such pair, swapping p and q gives the other condition. But this is not helpful unless we can find some symmetry.\n\nWait, but for the entire set of pairs (p, q) with p != q, the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p). So if we denote this number as A, then the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is A + B, where B is the number of pairs where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p). But since A = B, then the total is 2A. Which is equal to S, the total number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q). So S = 2A. But earlier, we had that S = sum_{p != q} [inv(p) > inv(q)] = sum_{k > l} inv_count[k] * inv_count[l].\n\nSo, if we can compute S, then A = S / 2. But in the n=2 example, S is 1 (since there is one pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q): when p is [2,1] and q is [1,2], but in this case, p > q, so it's not counted in S. Wait, no. S is the sum over all pairs (p, q) with p != q of [inv(p) > inv(q)]. In the n=2 case, there are two permutations: p1 = [1,2] (inv=0), p2 = [2,1] (inv=1). The pairs (p1, p2) and (p2, p1). For the pair (p1, p2), inv(p1) = 0 < inv(p2) = 1 → contributes 0",
