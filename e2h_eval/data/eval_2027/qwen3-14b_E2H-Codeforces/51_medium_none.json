Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from both names, they should exactly match the letters in the pile, with no extra letters and no missing letters.\n\nSo the input is three lines: guest, host, and pile. The output is YES or NO depending on whether the pile can be formed by combining the letters from guest and host.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nWell, the straightforward way is to check if the combined letters of guest and host have exactly the same count of each letter as the pile. So, for example, if guest is \"SANTA\" and host is \"CLAUS\", then combining them gives all letters, and we check if the pile has exactly those letters.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Concatenate the guest and host strings into one combined string.\n2. Check if the combined string and the pile have the same frequency of each character.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nWe can use the collections.Counter class, which counts the occurrences of each element. So, for example, Counter(guest + host) should give the counts of each letter in the combined names, and Counter(pile) gives the counts in the pile. Then, compare these two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts for each element. So if both Counters have the same counts for all letters, then it's a match.\n\nYes. So the plan is:\n\n- Read the three lines of input.\n- Combine the first two lines into a single string.\n- Create Counters for the combined string and the third line (pile).\n- Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length is different from the pile's length? For example, if the combined length is 5 and the pile is 6 letters. Then, even if the Counters are same, but the lengths differ, but that's impossible. Because the sum of counts in the combined string is the sum of the counts of guest and host. The pile's sum is the sum of its counts. So if the Counters are equal, their total lengths must be same. But perhaps checking the length first could be a quick check. But maybe it's redundant, since if the Counters are equal, their total lengths must be same. But perhaps checking the length first can save some time. However, for the problem constraints, since the maximum length is 100 per line, the total combined length could be up to 200, and the pile's length up to 200. So even if we don't check the length, the Counter comparison would take care of that.\n\nBut for example, if the combined string is length 5, and the pile is length 6, then the Counters can't be equal. So checking the length first could be a quick way to return NO. But perhaps it's not necessary. Let's think: if the combined string's length is not equal to the pile's length, then the Counters can't be equal. So, perhaps adding a check for that first would be efficient.\n\nBut in practice, the Counter comparison will handle that automatically. Because if the total counts are different, then the Counters would not be equal. So, for example, if the combined string has 5 letters and the pile has 6, then the sum of counts in the combined Counter is 5, and the pile's is 6. Therefore, the Counters can't be equal. So, the code can proceed without checking the length first.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile): print YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the Counter is a subclass of dict. So comparing two Counters with == checks if all elements have the same counts. So that's correct.\n\nBut let me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nguest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'.\n\nLet me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nBut perhaps the code will handle that correctly.\n\nAnother example: the second input is guest 'PAPAINOEL', host 'JOULUPUKKI', pile 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'.\n\nCombined is 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI'.\n\nLet me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nThe guest is PAPAINOEL: letters are P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L. So counts:\n\nP: 2, A: 2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nHost is JOULUPUKKI: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nCounts: J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2+1=3? Wait, guest's P is 2, host's P is 1. So combined P is 3?\n\nWait guest is PAPAINOEL: letters are P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L. So yes, P is 2.\n\nHost is JOULUPUKKI: letters J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. So P is once.\n\nSo combined P is 2+1=3.\n\nNow, the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile. Let me write it out:\n\nLetters are J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count each letter.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly compare the counts.\n\nIn the sample, the output is NO because there's a missing P and an extra L.\n\nWait, according to the note: in the second sample, the pile is missing a P and has an extra L.\n\nSo the combined guest and host has 3 P's. Let me check the pile.\n\nThe pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'.\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count each letter.\n\nLet me count:\n\nJ: 1\n\nO: appears in positions 2, 9? Let me count:\n\nOriginal pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me write it as letters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some letters. Let me count each letter:\n\nJ: 1\n\nO: appears in position 2, then again at position 9 (the 9th character?), maybe. Let me count:\n\nLet me write the pile as:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n\nSo that's:\n\nJ (1)\n\nO (positions 2, 9) → 2 times?\n\nWait, the string is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nJ: 1\n\nO: occurs in position 2, then again at position 9 (assuming the letters are as written). Let me count:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nSo O occurs at position 2 and 9 → 2 times.\n\nA occurs at position 6, 8 → 2 times.\n\nP occurs at position 7 and 15 → 2 times?\n\nWait, the original pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters step by step.\n\nLet me write the entire string as:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n\nWait, but the actual string is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' — let me check the exact letters.\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nJ (1)\n\nO (1)\n\nU (1)\n\nL (1)\n\nN (1)\n\nA (1)\n\nP (1)\n\nA (2)\n\nO (2)\n\nI (1)\n\nL (2)\n\nE (1)\n\nL (3)\n\nU (2)\n\nP (2)\n\nU (3)\n\nK (1)\n\nK (2)\n\nI (2)\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's count each character in the pile string.\n\nThe pile is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\".\n\nLet me count each letter:\n\n- J: 1\n- O: let's see, the letters are J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I. So O occurs in position 2 and 9 (assuming the string is split as such). So O: 2.\n- U: positions 3, 14, 16 → 3 times?\nWait, the string is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nJ: 1\n\nO: 2 (positions 2 and 9?)\n\nU: in positions 3, 14, 16 (third, then later?)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the letters in the pile string.\n\nLet me count each letter:\n\nJ: 1\n\nO: occurs in the first part as O, then again in the middle. Let me think of the pile string as:\n\n\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\nLet me count each letter:\n\nJ → 1\n\nO → 1 (from JOUL...), then later in \"PAO...\" there's an O. So O: 2.\n\nU: in JOUL, then later in the string, like in \"UPUKKI\". Let's count:\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n\nSo U occurs at position 3 (third character), then again at position 14 (the 'U' in 'LUPUKKI'?), then again at position 16 (another U? Maybe not. Let me think:\n\nThe string after \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" — perhaps splitting into individual letters:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nSo the letters are:\n\nJ (1), O (2), U (3), L (4), N (1), A (2), P (2), O (2), I (2), L (3), E (1), L (4), U (3), P (3), U (4), K (2), K (3), I (3).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me count the number of each letter in the pile.\n\nFor example, the pile is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\".\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\n- J: 1\n- O: appears in positions 2, 9 → 2 times?\n- U: appears in positions 3, 14, 16 → 3 times?\n- L: positions 4, 11, 13 → 3 times?\n- N: 1\n- A: positions 6, 8 → 2\n- P: positions 7, 15 → 2?\n- I: positions 10, 19 → 2?\n- E: 1\n- K: positions 17, 18 → 2.\n\nSo the counts for the pile would be:\n\nJ:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2.\n\nNow, the combined guest and host:\n\nguest is PAPAINOEL → letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → counts:\n\nP:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nhost is JOULUPUKKI → letters: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → counts:\n\nJ:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2+1=3\n\nA: 2\n\nI: 1+1=2\n\nN:1\n\nO:1+1=2\n\nE:1\n\nL:1+1=2\n\nJ:1\n\nU:3\n\nK:2.\n\nSo the combined counts are:\n\nP:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:3, K:2.\n\nComparing with the pile's counts:\n\nIn the pile, P is 2. But combined has 3. So that's a discrepancy. Hence, the answer is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code would correctly compare the counters and find that they are not equal, hence output NO.\n\nSo the approach of using Counter is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, note that the input is three lines. So, in Python, we can read them via input(). But in the sample input, the input is given as a list of three strings, but in reality, the actual input is three lines. So for example, in the first sample input, the three lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo, in code, we can read the three lines as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combine guest and host into combined = guest + host.\n\nThen, compare Counter(combined) == Counter(pile).\n\nBut in Python, the Counter is from collections.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about leading or trailing whitespaces? The problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. So the input lines don't have any whitespace except the newline, which is stripped by input().strip().\n\nYes, so the code should be okay.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's check the letters. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nBut the code would compare the counts. Let's assume that the code works.\n\nBut let me think about the third sample input:\n\nThird input is:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nThe combined string is BABBONATALE + FATHERCHRISTMAS.\n\nLet me count the letters in combined:\n\nBABBONATALE → B: 2, A: 3, N:1, T:1, L:1, E:1.\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS → F:1, A:1, T:1, H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H:1, R:1, I:1, S:1, T:1, M:1, A:1, S:1.\n\nWait, perhaps better to count all letters.\n\nBut the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile. Let's see:\n\nThe pile has BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nBut the code would compare the counts of the combined and the pile.\n\nIn the note, the third sample has an extra L. So the code would detect that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case when the combined string has the same letters as the pile, but in different counts?\n\nYes, the Counter would catch that.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nNow, what about the test case where the combined string is empty? But according to the problem statement, all lines are not empty. So guest and host are non-empty. So combined is non-empty. The pile is also non-empty.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. Also, the code should read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nif Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile):\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but the code may have to read three lines. But in some cases, perhaps the input is given with multiple lines, but the code is correct.\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, no, the sample input is given as three lines. The sample input is three lines, but the example shows that the input is given as a list of three strings. But in reality, the actual input is three lines. For example, the first sample input is three lines:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich would be read correctly by the code.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's check the second sample input:\n\nguest is PAPAINOEL, host is JOULUPUKKI, pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the code would compare the Counter of combined (guest + host) with the Counter of pile. Since the counts differ (for P and L), it would return NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the pile is exactly the combination of guest and host. For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → output YES. Or if pile is \"BA\", same result.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" → YES. If pile is \"A\", then NO.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in Python, the Counter is compared by the counts of each element. So the code should work.\n\nThus, the Python code should be as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the characters in the pile exactly match the combined characters of the guest and host names, considering both the count and type of each character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Character Counting**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string of the guest and host names, and the pile of letters.\n4. **Comparison**: Compare the character counts of the combined string and the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines from standard input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to form the combined set of characters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Counter Comparison**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile. If these counters are equal, it means the pile contains exactly the characters needed to form the combined names of the guest and host, allowing for rearrangement. If they are not equal, there are either extra letters or missing letters in the pile, resulting in a \"NO\" response.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of characters using a counter, ensuring correctness and optimal performance given the constraints.",
