    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph, and then among all such graphs with that minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a p-reachable graph is. It's a directed graph that has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So, for each such pair, both u can reach v and v can reach u. And we need exactly p of these pairs.\n\nThe first part of the problem is to find the minimal number of nodes needed for such a graph. The second part is, given that minimal number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs possible in such a graph.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for the minimal number of nodes. Let's think about how the number of reachable pairs (u, v) with u < v can be maximized for a given number of nodes. Because we want to find the minimal n where the maximum possible number of such pairs is at least p. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the graph must have exactly p such pairs. So we need to arrange the graph such that exactly p pairs are mutual reachable. But to minimize the number of nodes, we need to find the smallest n where it's possible to have exactly p such pairs.\n\nBut how do we model the number of mutual reachable pairs?\n\nHmm. Let's think about strongly connected components (SCCs). In a directed graph, the SCCs form a DAG. For two nodes u and v in the same SCC, they are mutually reachable. So the number of mutual reachable pairs (u, v) with u < v is the sum over each SCC of C(k, 2), where k is the size of the SCC. Because within an SCC of size k, there are k*(k-1)/2 ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and they are mutually reachable.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a set of integers (the sizes of the SCCs) such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) for each component equals exactly p. And we need to choose the sizes such that the total number of nodes (sum of k_i) is minimized.\n\nMoreover, since the sum of C(k_i, 2) must be exactly p, we need to find a way to split p into such terms, with the sum of k_i as small as possible.\n\nSo the first part of the problem is to find the minimal n such that there exists a collection of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m where sum_{i} (k_i choose 2) = p, and sum k_i is minimized.\n\nWait, but how do we find that? Because for a given n, the maximum number of such pairs is achieved when there's one component of size n. Then the number is C(n, 2). But if we have multiple components, the total would be less. For example, splitting into two components of size a and b, then C(a,2) + C(b,2) is less than C(a + b, 2).\n\nTherefore, to maximize the number of mutual pairs for a given n, you have one component of size n. To minimize the number of nodes for a given p, we need to find the smallest n such that C(n, 2) >= p. Wait, but maybe not exactly. Because perhaps p is not exactly C(n, 2), but we can split into components to get exactly p.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the graph has exactly p mutual pairs. So for example, if p is 3, then the minimal n is 3 because C(3,2) is 3. So that's the first example in the sample input.\n\nBut suppose p is 4. Then C(3,2)=3, which is less than 4. Then we need to find a way to split into components. For example, one component of size 3 (C(3,2)=3) and another component of size 2 (C(2,2)=1). Total sum is 4, and the total nodes is 3+2=5. But maybe there's a better way. Wait, what about a component of size 4. Then C(4,2) is 6, which is larger than 4. But we can't have that. So maybe the minimal n is 5? Or is there a way to have a smaller n?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to have two components. For example, if n=4, can we split into two components whose C(k_i, 2) sum to 4?\n\nLet's see. Suppose one component of size 3 (C(3,2)=3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-Reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs (u, v) where `u < v` and both nodes are mutually reachable. This can be modeled using Strongly Connected Components (SCCs), where each SCC contributes `C(k, 2)` mutual pairs for a component of size `k`.\n\n2. **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we need to find the smallest `n` such that the sum of combinations `C(k_i, 2)` for all components equals exactly `p`. This involves checking if `p` can be represented as the sum of combinations of integers, starting from the largest possible component sizes.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimal number of nodes is determined, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is calculated by considering all possible ordered pairs and subtracting the mutual pairs from the total possible pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    # Find minimal n\n    # We need the minimal n such that sum C(k_i, 2) = p, and sum k_i is minimized.\n    # To find minimal n, we try to use as large components as possible.\n    \n    # First, find the minimal n such that C(n, 2) >= p\n    # Then check if p can be formed with components of size <= n\n    # But since we need exactly p, we might have to split into components\n    \n    # Let's find the minimal n by trying different values\n    # The approach is to greedily take the largest possible component\n    # For example, start from the largest possible k such that C(k, 2) <= remaining p\n    \n    # Compute the minimal n\n    n = 0\n    remaining = p\n    components = []\n    \n    # Find the minimal n\n    # Start with the largest possible component\n    while remaining > 0:\n        # Find the largest k such that C(k, 2) <= remaining\n        k = 1\n        while (k * (k - 1)) // 2 <= remaining:\n            k += 1\n        k -= 1\n        components.append(k)\n        remaining -= (k * (k - 1)) // 2\n        n += k\n    \n    # Now, check if this n is minimal. However, there could be cases where splitting into smaller components gives a smaller n.\n    # For example, if p=4, the above would take k=3 (C(3,2)=3) and then k=2 (C(2,2)=1), total n=5. But maybe another way?\n    # Wait, let's think again. For p=4, C(4,2) is 6 which is larger than 4, so it's not possible. So the minimal n is indeed 5.\n    # So the approach of taking the largest possible component each time gives the minimal sum of sizes.\n    # Because for a given remaining p, taking the largest possible component minimizes the sum of sizes.\n    # For example, if you have remaining p=4, taking k=3 (3) and then 2 (1) gives sum 5. If instead you take 2+2+2, sum is 6, which is worse.\n    \n    # Therefore, the above approach gives the minimal n.\n    \n    # Now, the minimal n is the sum of components.\n    \n    # But wait, what if there is a better way? For example, for p=6, the minimal n is 4 (since C(4,2)=6). Which is better than 3+2 (sum 5) which would give C(3,2)+C(2,2)=3+1=4 <6. So the approach works.\n    \n    # Therefore, the code above computes the minimal n correctly.\n    \n    # Now, for the second part: compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n    # The total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1).\n    # The number of mutual pairs is p.\n    # The number of unidirectional pairs is total_pairs - mutual_pairs - same_pairs (but same_pairs is zero since u != v)\n    # Wait, the unidirectional pairs are those where u can reach v but v cannot reach u. But the mutual pairs are those where both can reach each other. The rest are either unidirectional or not reachable at all.\n    # However, the problem defines unidirectional pairs as those where u can reach v and v cannot reach u. But the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v is n*(n-1). Among these, some are mutual, some are unidirectional, and some are neither (if neither can reach each other).\n    # However, the problem says that the graph must have exactly p mutual pairs. So, the number of unidirectional pairs is the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u can reach v but v cannot reach u. But how to compute that?\n    \n    # However, the problem states that among all p-reachable graphs with minimal n, we need to find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs.\n    # To maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to minimize the number of mutual pairs (which is fixed as p) and also ensure that the rest of the pairs are as many as possible unidirectional.\n    # However, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is achieved when the graph is a DAG of components arranged in a way that allows maximum unidirectional paths between components.\n    \n    # The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is achieved when the graph is composed of components arranged in a DAG, and within each component, it's a single strongly connected component (so no unidirectional pairs within the component). Between components, all possible edges go from earlier components to later ones, thus creating unidirectional pairs.\n    \n    # However, in our case, the components are already chosen to have exactly p mutual pairs. The rest of the pairs can be considered as follows:\n    # The total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1).\n    # The number of mutual pairs is p.\n    # The number of unidirectional pairs is equal to the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u and v are in different components and there's a path from u to v but not vice versa.\n    # But since the components form a DAG, we can arrange them in topological order and add all edges from earlier components to later components. Thus, for any two components A and B, if A comes before B, then all pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B contribute to unidirectional pairs. Similarly, (b, a) would not be unidirectional if there's no path from B to A.\n    \n    # However, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is achieved when the components are arranged in a linear order (like a chain), and all possible edges between components are directed from earlier to later. Thus, for each pair of components (A, B), if A is before B, then all |A|*|B| pairs (a, b) are unidirectional. Similarly, (b, a) are not unidirectional.\n    \n    # So, the total number of unidirectional pairs is the sum over all ordered pairs of components (A, B), where A comes before B, of |A| * |B|.\n    \n    # But how to compute this given the components?\n    \n    # Let's suppose that the components are sorted in a certain order. The maximum number of such pairs is achieved when the components are arranged in a sequence where each component is connected to all subsequent components. Thus, the total number of such pairs is the sum_{i < j} size_i * size_j.\n    \n    # But this is exactly the same as (total_nodes^2 - sum (size_i^2)) / 2.\n    \n    # Because sum_{i != j} size_i * size_j = (sum size_i)^2 - sum size_i^2 = n^2 - sum size_i^2.\n    # And since for each unordered pair (i, j), i != j, we count size_i * size_j once. But in the unidirectional count, we have only the ordered pairs where i is before j. So the total is sum_{i < j} size_i * size_j = (n^2 - sum size_i^2) / 2.\n    \n    # However, in our case, the components are arranged in a DAG, and we can arrange them in a topological order. So the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (n^2 - sum (size_i^2)) // 2.\n    \n    # Therefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (n*(n-1) - sum (size_i^2)) // 2 - (number of mutual pairs?) No, because mutual pairs are counted in the components. Wait, the mutual pairs are already accounted for in the components. The sum of size_i choose 2 is p. The sum of size_i^2 is sum (size_i^2). But the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1). The number of mutual pairs is p. The number of unidirectional pairs is (sum_{i < j} size_i * size_j) * 2 ? No, because for each pair of components, the edges from i to j contribute size_i * size_j unidirectional pairs, and the edges from j to i contribute nothing if there's no path. But if we arrange the components in a linear order, then we can have all edges from earlier components to later ones, contributing size_i * size_j unidirectional pairs for each i < j. Thus, the total number of unidirectional pairs is sum_{i < j} size_i * size_j.\n    \n    # So the total unidirectional pairs is (sum_{i < j} size_i * size_j). Which is equal to [ (sum size_i)^2 - sum size_i^2 ] / 2.\n    \n    # Since sum size_i is n, then this becomes (n^2 - sum size_i^2) // 2.\n    \n    # But note that this counts all the pairs between components. However, the mutual pairs are already accounted for in the components. But in the components, the mutual pairs are already included in the p value. So the unidirectional pairs are the ones between components, and the ones within components are mutual or not?\n    \n    # Within a component, all pairs are mutual (since they are in the same SCC). So the unidirectional pairs are only between components. So the formula (n^2 - sum size_i^2) // 2 is correct for the number of unidirectional pairs.\n    \n    # Let's test this with the sample input.\n    \n    # Sample Input 1: p=3\n    # Minimal n is 3. The components are [3]. sum size_i^2 = 9. n^2 = 9. So (9 -9)/2 = 0. Which matches the sample output.\n    \n    # Sample Input 2: p=4. The components are [3,2], sum size_i^2 = 9 +4=13. n=5. n^2=25. (25-13)/2 = 6. Which matches the sample output of 5 6.\n    \n    # So the formula is correct.\n    \n    # Therefore, the steps are:\n    # 1. Compute the minimal n as explained.\n    # 2. Compute the sum of squares of the component sizes.\n    # 3. Compute (n^2 - sum_squares) // 2.\n    \n    # Now, how to get the components? Well, in the code above, the components list is generated by taking the largest possible component each time. However, this may not be the optimal way to get the maximum number of unidirectional pairs. Because the way we split the components affects the sum of squares.\n    \n    # For example, suppose p=4. The code above would generate components [3,2], sum_squares 9+4=13. If instead, we had components [2,2,1], then sum_squares is 4+4+1=9, and n=5. Then (25-9)/2=8, which is higher than 6. But why isn't this possible?\n    \n    # Wait, the components must have sum C(k_i, 2) = p. For [2,2,1], C(2,2) + C(2,2) + C(1,2) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2, which is less than 4. So that's not valid. So the code's approach of greedily taking the largest component is correct.\n    \n    # Therefore, the components list generated by the code is correct. So, we need to track the components during the process.\n    \n    # So modifying the code to collect the components:\n    \n    # Let's redo the code with the components collected.\n    \n    # Let's rework the code:\n    \n    # Let's recompute the components again, and calculate sum_squares.\n    \n    # So, here's the corrected code:\n    \n    # Reset variables\n    components = []\n    remaining = p\n    n = 0\n    \n    while remaining > 0:\n        k = 1\n        while (k * (k - 1)) // 2 <= remaining:\n            k += 1\n        k -= 1\n        components.append(k)\n        remaining -= (k * (k - 1)) // 2\n        n += k\n    \n    sum_squares = sum([k*k for k in components])\n    total_unidirectional = (n * n - sum_squares) // 2\n    \n    print(f\"{n} {total_unidirectional}\")\n    \nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The code determines the minimum number of nodes by greedily selecting the largest possible component sizes that contribute to the required number of mutual pairs.\n2. **Calculating Unidirectional Pairs**: After determining the components, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is calculated using the formula derived from the sum of squares of component sizes, ensuring optimal arrangement of components to maximize unidirectional paths.",

Thus, the total number of unidirectional pairs is sum_{i < j} size_i * size_j.\n    \n    # So the total unidirectional pairs is (sum_{i < j} size_i * size_j). Which is equal to [ (sum size_i)^2 - sum size_i^2 ] / 2.\n    \n    # Since sum size_i is n, then this becomes (n^2 - sum size_i^2) // 2.\n    \n    # But note that this counts all the pairs between components. However, the mutual pairs are already accounted for in the components. But in the components, the mutual pairs are already included in the p value. So the unidirectional pairs are the ones between components, and the ones within components are mutual or not?\n    \n    # Within a component, all pairs are mutual (since they are in the same SCC). So the unidirectional pairs are only between components. So the formula (n^2 - sum size_i^2) // 2 is correct for the number of unidirectional pairs.\n    \n    # Let's test this with the sample input.\n    \n    # Sample Input 1: p=3\n    # Minimal n is 3. The components are [3]. sum size_i^2 = 9. n^2 = 9. So (9 -9)/2 = 0. Which matches the sample output.\n    \n    # Sample Input 2: p=4. The components are [3,2], sum size_i^2 = 9 +4=13. n=5. n^2=25. (25-13)/2 = 6. Which matches the sample output of 5 6.\n    \n    # So the formula is correct.\n    \n    # Therefore, the steps are:\n    # 1. Compute the minimal n as explained.\n    # 2. Compute the sum of squares of the component sizes.\n    # 3. Compute (n^2 - sum_squares) // 2.\n    \n    # Now, how to get the components? Well, in the code above, the components list is generated by taking the largest possible component each time. However, this may not be the optimal way to get the maximum number of unidirectional pairs. Because the way we split the components affects the sum of squares.\n    \n    # For example, suppose p=4. The code above would generate components [3,2], sum_squares 9+4=13. If instead, we had components [2,2,1], then sum_squares is 4+4+1=9, and n=5. Then (25-9)/2=8, which is higher than 6. But why isn't this possible?\n    \n    # Wait, the components must have sum C(k_i, 2) = p. For [2,2,1], C(2,2) + C(2,2) + C(1,2) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2, which is less than 4. So that's not valid. So the code's approach of greedily taking the largest component is correct.\n    \n    # Therefore, the components list generated by the code is correct. So, we need to track the components during the process.\n    \n    # So modifying the code to collect the components:\n    \n    # Let's redo the code with the components collected.\n    \n    # Let's rework the code:\n    \n    # Let's recompute the components again, and calculate sum_squares.\n    \n    # So, here's the corrected code:\n    \n    # Reset variables\n    components = []\n    remaining = p\n    n = 0\n    \n    while remaining > 0:\n        k = 1\n        while (k * (k - 1)) // 2 <= remaining:\n            k += 1\n        k -= 1\n        components.append(k)\n        remaining -= (k * (k - 1)) // 2\n        n += k\n    \n    sum_squares = sum([k*k for k in components])\n    total_unidirectional = (n * n - sum_squares) // 2\n    \n    print(f\"{n} {total_unidirectional}\")\n    \nmain()",
