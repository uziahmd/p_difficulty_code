Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Vanya has some cards, and the sum of the found ones needs to be zero. The task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to achieve that. The cards can have any integer between -x and x, inclusive. \n\nSo the approach here is: first calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. Then, we need to find the minimal number of cards (each with values between -x and x) such that when added to S, the total becomes zero. That means the sum of the new cards must be -S. \n\nLet me think. Let's say the current sum is S. We need to find the minimal number of cards whose sum is -S. But each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of steps to reach a sum of -S, using numbers in the range [-x, x]. \n\nWait, but how do we find that minimal number? Let's think about the absolute value. Let's say the target sum is T = -S. So the sum of the new cards must be T. \n\nThe maximum possible contribution per card is x. So the minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of |T| divided by x. Wait, but maybe not exactly. Let me think. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to 2. So 5 / 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2+2+1=5. But since each card can be any value between -x and x, perhaps we can use the maximum possible per card. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is exactly divisible by x? Then it's |T|/x. Otherwise, it's (|T|//x) + 1.\n\nBut wait, let's take some examples. \n\nIn the first sample input: the sum is -1 + 1 + 2 = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 = 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the example.\n\nIn the second sample input: sum is -2 + (-2) = -4. T is 4. x is 3. So 4 / 3 is 1.333, so ceil is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo yes, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), where T is the target sum (which is -S). But wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero. So that's the case when the sum is already zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S. If T is zero, return 0.\n3. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach T, which is ceil( |T| / x )\n\nWait, but why is that correct? Because each card can contribute up to x. So for example, if T is 5 and x is 3, then 5 /3 is 1.666, so ceil is 2. Which would be 3 + 2 = 5. So two cards. Which is correct.\n\nBut how do we know that there's no way to get a lower number of cards? Because if you have k cards, the maximum possible sum they can contribute is k * x. So to reach T, you need k * x >= |T|. So the minimal k is ceil( |T| / x ). \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if you have k cards, each can contribute up to x. So the maximum possible sum is k*x. So to reach T, you need k*x >= |T|. So the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k >= |T| / x. Which is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Let's code it.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x from input. Then read the list of numbers. Compute the sum S. Then compute T = -S. If T is zero, output 0. Else, compute the absolute value of T, divide by x, take the ceiling. But how to compute ceiling in Python?\n\nWait, in Python, for positive numbers, ceil(a / b) can be done as (a + b - 1) // b. For example, 5 / 3 is 1.666. (5 +3 -1) //3 = 7//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo for |T| divided by x, the",
