In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimal number of draws required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. The output for each case is the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nSo for each of the three cases, I have to check if there's already a mentsu. If yes, output 0. Otherwise, find the minimum number of tiles needed to form one.\n\nLet me think about how to check for possible mentsu.\n\nFor a triplet (koutsu), all three tiles must be the same. So if the three tiles are all same, then it's already a triplet. Otherwise, we need to check if adding some tiles can make a triplet. But wait, the problem says that after drawing tiles, she can have a mentsu. So for example, if she has two of a kind, she needs to draw one more. But if she has one, she needs two. But maybe there's a better way with sequences.\n\nBut for the problem, the minimal number of draws is required. So for each possible scenario, we need to check all possibilities and find the minimum.\n\nBut first, let's consider the initial case. For the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each input case:\n\nCheck if there's already a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases for forming a triplet or sequence.\n\nFirst, check for possible triplet:\n\nIf there are three same tiles, then it's already a triplet. But in the initial case, the three tiles may not be same. So for example, if two are same, then adding one more would make a triplet. So for that, the number of draws is 1. But if there's only one of a certain tile, then you need two draws. But maybe there's another way with sequences that requires fewer tiles.\n\nSimilarly for sequences. For example, if the three tiles can form a sequence when sorted. For example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s, then it's a sequence. But if they are 1s, 2s, 4s, then you need to add 3s to make a sequence. That would require 1 draw. Or if they are 1s, 3s, 4s, then adding 2s would make a sequence. Also 1 draw. But if the tiles are 1s, 1s, 2s, then maybe you can form a sequence by adding 3s (so that you have 1s, 2s, 3s) but that would take 1 draw. Or maybe you can form a triplet by adding another 1s (so you have three 1s). Which would take 1 draw. So in that case, the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for each case, we need to check both possibilities: whether forming a triplet requires fewer draws than forming a sequence, or vice versa.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each input case:\n\nCheck if current tiles already form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a triplet (call this min_triplet) and the minimal number of tiles needed to form a sequence (min_sequence). Then the answer is the minimum between these two.\n\nBut how to compute min_triplet and min_sequence?\n\nLet's tackle min_triplet first.\n\nFor a triplet, we need three identical tiles. So, the current tiles may have counts of each type. Let's count how many of each tile there are.\n\nFor example, if the three tiles are 1s, 1s, 2s. Then, the counts are:\n\n1s: 2, 2s: 1, others zero.\n\nTo form a triplet, we need to have three of the same tile. So for each possible tile (including those not present), what's the minimal number of draws needed?\n\nFor example, for the tile 1s, we need 3 - 2 = 1 more. For the tile 2s, we need 3 - 1 = 2. For any other tile, like 3s, we need 3. So the minimal is 1. So min_triplet is 1.\n\nSo the way to compute min_triplet is:\n\nCheck for each possible tile (all 9*3=27 possible tiles?), how many of them are already present. For each such tile, the number of draws needed is 3 - count. But since the existing tiles may have counts, but maybe we can choose to form a triplet of any tile. So the minimal among all possible tiles.\n\nBut since the existing tiles may have counts, but maybe even if there are two tiles of the same type, but not three, we can add one more.\n\nSo for the triplet, the minimal number of draws is the minimal over all possible tiles (the ones in the current hand, or not) of (3 - count of that tile in current hand). But since we can choose any tile (even ones not present), but for that, the count is zero. So for example, if the current hand has no tile of a certain type, then 3-0=3 draws needed.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal is the minimal between:\n\n- for existing tiles, the number needed to reach 3.\n\nBut maybe there's a better option.\n\nSo, for example, if the current hand has two tiles of type A and one of type B. Then, for triplet, the minimal is 1 (add one more A) or 2 (add two B's). So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the min_triplet is the minimum of (3 - count) for all possible tiles. But since the current tiles can be part of that.\n\nBut how do I compute that?\n\nWell, for the current three tiles, I can create a frequency dictionary. For each tile in the current hand, count how many times they appear. Then for each possible tile (like all possible 9*3 types), compute how many are needed to reach 3. But since we can choose any tile, including those not present.\n\nBut for example, if the current hand has 1s, 1s, 2s. Then the frequency is {1s:2, 2s:1}. So for the possible tiles, the 1s would need 1 more, 2s would need 2 more, any other tile would need 3. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the min_triplet is the minimal (3 - count) for each tile in the current hand, but also considering tiles not present. Wait, but for tiles not present, their count is zero, so 3-0=3. So the minimal would be the minimal between the existing counts and possible new ones.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal is the minimal between all the existing counts. Because for example, if there's a tile with count 2, then adding one more is 1. If there's no such tile, then the minimal would be 3 (if all are unique, for example).\n\nWait, suppose the current hand is three different tiles, like 1s, 2p, 3m. Then, for any triplet, we need to add three of the same tile. For example, if we choose to form a triplet of 1s, then we need 3-1 = 2 more. Similarly for 2p, need 2 more. Or 3m, need 2. Or any other tile, which would require 3. So the minimal is 2. So the min_triplet is 2.\n\nSo, in this case, the min_triplet is 2. So the code would need to calculate that.\n\nSo, for the triplet, the minimal number of tiles needed is the minimum between (3 - count) for all possible tiles. But how to get all possible tiles? Well, the possible tiles are all 9 numbers for each of the three suits. However, since the current hand may have some counts, but for the other tiles, the count is zero. So, for example, the current hand may have counts for some tiles, but for others, zero. So, the min_triplet is the minimum of (3 - count) for all possible tiles. But since we can choose any tile, including those not in the current hand, but for those, count is zero.\n\nBut how can we compute that?\n\nWell, for the current hand, we can collect all the counts of each tile. Then, for each tile in the current hand, we can compute 3 - count. Also, for any tile not in the current hand, 3 - 0 = 3. So, the minimal would be the minimum between the existing (3 - count) values and 3. But since for existing tiles, if there are any with count >= 1, then the minimal could be lower than 3.\n\nBut for example, if the current hand has three different tiles, then for each of them, the count is 1. So 3-1=2. So the minimal is 2. Which is better than 3.\n\nSo the way to compute min_triplet is:\n\nCollect the counts for each tile in the current hand. For each tile in the current hand, compute 3 - count. Also, for any tile not present, the value is 3. However, the minimal among all possible tiles is the minimum between the existing (3 - count) and 3. But since there are tiles not present, but their 3 - count is 3. So the minimal is the minimum between all (3 - count) of existing tiles and 3. But perhaps the existing tiles have some with 3 - count less than 3.\n\nSo the minimal is min( [3 - count for each tile in current hand] + [3] )\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for example, if there's a tile in the current hand with count 2, then 3 - 2 = 1, which is better than 3. So the min is 1.\n\nBut if there are no tiles with count >= 1, then the min would be 3. But that's impossible because the current hand has three tiles. So for example, if all three tiles are different, then each has count 1. So the 3 - count is 2 for each. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo to compute the min_triplet, we can:\n\n- create a frequency dictionary for the current tiles.\n\n- for each tile in the current hand, compute 3 - count. Take the minimum of these values. Then compare with 3 (the case when we choose to form a triplet of a new tile not present in the current hand). But wait, the minimal between the existing ones and 3. But in the case where all existing tiles have counts 1, then the min is 2, which is less than 3. So the overall min_triplet is the minimum between the existing (3 - count) and 3?\n\nNo, because for the existing tiles, the 3 - count could be 2 (as in the example) and 3 is higher. So the min is 2. So the way to compute it is:\n\nTake the minimum of all (3 - count) for each tile in the current hand. Then, compare that with 3 (the case where we choose a new tile not present in the current hand). But why would we choose that? Because if all existing tiles have counts that are 3 - count higher than 3? Which is impossible. Because for example, if the current hand has three tiles, all same. Then 3 - count is 0. So the min is 0.\n\nBut if the current hand has three different tiles, then for each tile, count is 1. So 3 - count is 2. So the min is 2. So the minimal between that and 3 is 2. So the min_triplet is 2.\n\nSo in general, the min_triplet is the minimum between the existing (3 - count) and 3. But since the existing (3 - count) can't be larger than 3, because if the current hand has a tile with count 0 (but that's not possible, because the current hand has three tiles. So for example, if the current hand has three tiles of different types, then each has count 1. So 3 - count is 2. So the min is 2. Which is better than 3.\n\nSo the way to compute min_triplet is:\n\nCalculate for each tile in the current hand, the 3 - count. Then the min_triplet is the minimum of these values. Because for any tile not present, the 3 - count is 3, which is larger than the min of the existing ones.\n\nWait, but suppose the current hand has two tiles of the same type and one of another. For example, 1s, 1s, 2p. Then the counts are 1s: 2, 2p:1. So the existing (3 - count) for 1s is 1, for 2p is 2. So the min is 1. Which is better than 3. So the min_triplet is 1.\n\nYes. So the min_triplet is the minimum of (3 - count) for all existing tiles. Because even if there are tiles not present, their 3 - count is 3, which is worse than the existing ones. So the min_triplet is the minimum of (3 - count) for all existing tiles.\n\nWait, but what if there are no existing tiles with count >= 1? No, because the current hand has three tiles. So for example, if the three tiles are all different, then each has count 1, so (3 - count) is 2 for each. So the min is 2.\n\nSo for the triplet, the minimal number of draws is the minimal (3 - count) across all tiles in the current hand.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a tile that is not present in the current hand, but adding three of that tile would require 3 draws. But that's worse than the existing options. So the min_triplet is the minimal of the existing (3 - count) values.\n\nSo the code for min_triplet is:\n\ncounts = frequency dictionary of current tiles.\n\nmin_triplet = min( [3 - count for count in counts.values()] )\n\nBut wait, no. Because for example, if the current hand has two tiles of the same type and one of another. Like 1s, 1s, 2s. Then counts are {1s: 2, 2s: 1}. The [3 - count] would be [1, 2], min is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: three different tiles. The counts are {tile1:1, tile2:1, tile3:1}. The [3 - count] is [2, 2, 2]. So min is 2.\n\nSo yes, that's the way to compute min_triplet.\n\nNow for the sequence (shuntsu). How to compute the minimal number of draws needed to form a sequence.\n\nA sequence is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. Or 5m, 6m, 7m. So the tiles must be same suit and consecutive numbers.\n\nSo the problem is, given the three tiles, how can we find the minimal number of draws to form a sequence.\n\nBut the current three tiles may have some that can be part of a sequence. For example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then adding 3s would form a sequence. So that's one draw. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal number of draws for forming a sequence?\n\nThe approach here is to look for all possible sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles. Then, compute the number of tiles needed to reach that sequence.\n\nBut since the current tiles may have some overlapping with the sequence, we can find the minimal number of draws.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, the steps for checking sequences:\n\nWe need to consider all possible sequences (three consecutive numbers in same suit). For each such possible sequence, determine how many tiles are already present in the current hand. The number of draws needed is 3 minus the count of tiles in the current hand that are part of that sequence.\n\nSo for example, if the current hand has two tiles of the sequence, then we need 1 draw. If it has one, then 2. If none, then 3.\n\nBut the problem is that there are many possible sequences. How to generate them all?\n\nFor each suit (m, p, s), and for each possible starting number from 1 to 7 (since the sequence is x, x+1, x+2). So for each suit, there are 7 possible sequences (1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9).\n\nSo for each of these 3 * 7 = 21 possible sequences, check how many tiles in the current hand are part of that sequence. Then, the minimal number of draws needed for that sequence is 3 - count.\n\nThen, the min_sequence is the minimal of all these values across all possible sequences.\n\nBut also, there's the possibility that the current hand already contains a sequence. For example, if the current hand is 1s, 2s, 3s. Then, the count is 3, so 3-3=0. So min_sequence is 0.\n\nSo the code for min_sequence is:\n\nGenerate all possible sequences (each is a set of three tiles). For each sequence, count how many of the tiles in the current hand are part of that sequence. Then, the required draws for that sequence is 3 - count. The min_sequence is the minimum of all these values.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences?\n\nLet me think. For each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n   for start_num in 1 to 7:\n\n       the sequence is start_num, start_num+1, start_num+2.\n\n       So for example, start_num=1: 1,2,3.\n\n       For each of these, create three tiles (like 1m, 2m, 3m).\n\nSo for each such sequence, we can check how many of the current tiles are in that sequence.\n\nSo for example, the current hand has tiles [1s, 2s, 4s]. Then, the sequence 1s, 2s, 3s would have two tiles (1s and 2s), so 3-2=1. The sequence 2s,3s,4s would have two tiles (2s and 4s) but 3s is missing. So again, 3-2=1. The sequence 3s,4s,5s would have one tile (4s) so 3-1=2. So the minimal for this case is 1.\n\nSo for the current hand, the minimal number of draws to form a sequence is 1.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nIn code:\n\nWe can generate all possible sequences as sets of three tiles. Then for each sequence, check how many of the current tiles are in that sequence. Then compute 3 - count. Find the minimum of these values across all sequences.\n\nBut how to represent the tiles? For example, for a sequence in suit 'm' starting at 1, the tiles are '1m', '2m', '3m'.\n\nSo for each possible sequence, create a set containing these three tiles. Then, for the current hand, count how many of the current tiles are in that set.\n\nBut the current hand may have duplicates. For example, if the current hand has two 1s and one 2s. Then, for the sequence 1s, 2s, 3s, the count is 2 (two 1s and one 2s, but the sequence requires one of each). Wait, but the count is how many of the current tiles are part of the sequence. But the sequence requires exactly three distinct tiles. So even if the current hand has multiple copies of a tile in the sequence, it's counted once per tile. Wait, no. For example, if the current hand has two 1s and one 2s. Then, the sequence 1s, 2s, 3s requires one 1s, one 2s, one 3s. The current hand has two 1s and one 2s. So the count is 2 (for 1s and 2s) and 0 for 3s. So total of 2 tiles in the sequence. So the required draws is 3 - 2 = 1. But even though there are two 1s, only one is needed for the sequence. So the count is the number of unique tiles in the current hand that are part of the sequence.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the tiles in the hand can be used in any way. For example, if the current hand has two 1s and one 2s, then to form a sequence of 1s, 2s, 3s, you can use one of the 1s and the 2s, and need to add one 3s. So the count is 2 (the 1s and 2s) and the required draws is 1.\n\nBut if the current hand has two 1s and two 2s, then the count is 2 (the 1s and 2s) and required draws is 1 (add 3s).\n\nSo the way to compute the count is: for the current hand, how many distinct tiles are present in the sequence. Because even if there are multiple copies, you can use one of each.\n\nSo for example, the current hand has two 1s and one 2s. For the sequence 1s, 2s, 3s, the count is 2 (1s and 2s). So the required draws is 1.\n\nThus, for each sequence, the count is the number of unique tiles in the current hand that are part of the sequence.\n\nSo in code, for each possible sequence (set of three tiles), we can check for each tile in the current hand, whether it is part of the sequence. But since the current hand can have duplicates, but each tile is considered once. So the count is the number of unique tiles in the current hand that are in the sequence.\n\nWait, but the current hand is three tiles. For example, if the current hand has two 1s and one 2s, then the unique tiles are 1s and 2s. So for the sequence 1s, 2s, 3s, the count is 2. So the required draws is 1.\n\nSo the code steps for min_sequence would be:\n\nGenerate all possible sequences (each is a set of three tiles, e.g., {'1m', '2m', '3m'}).\n\nFor each such sequence:\n\n   count = number of unique tiles in the current hand that are in the sequence.\n\n   required_draws = 3 - count.\n\n   keep track of the minimum required_draws across all sequences.\n\nSo the min_sequence is the minimal required_draws over all possible sequences.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences?\n\nLet me think. For each suit in ['m', 'p', 's'], and for each start_num from 1 to 7 (since start_num + 2 can't exceed 9):\n\n   sequence_tiles = [f\"{start_num}{suit}\", f\"{start_num + 1}{suit}\", f\"{start_num + 2}{suit}\"]\n\n   add this as a possible sequence.\n\nSo for example, for suit 'm', start_num=1: ['1m', '2m', '3m'], start_num=2: ['2m', '3m', '4m'], etc.\n\nOnce all sequences are generated, for each of them, check how many of the current hand's unique tiles are in the sequence.\n\nSo for the current hand, we can create a set of the three tiles. For example, if the input is ['1s', '2s', '3s'], the set is {'1s', '2s', '3s'}, which is exactly one of the sequences, so count is 3, required_draws is 0.\n\nAnother example: current hand is ['1s', '2s', '4s']. The set is {'1s', '2s', '4s'}. For the sequence ['1s', '2s', '3s'], the count is 2 (1s and 2s). For the sequence ['2s', '3s', '4s'], the count is 2 (2s and 4s). For the sequence ['3s', '4s', '5s'], the count is 1 (4s). So the minimal required_draws is 1.\n\nSo the code for min_sequence is:\n\ncurrent_tiles_set = set(current_tiles)\n\nfor each possible sequence in all_sequences:\n\n   sequence_set = set(sequence_tiles)\n\n   intersection = current_tiles_set & sequence_set\n\n   count = len(intersection)\n\n   required = 3 - count\n\n   min_sequence = min(min_sequence, required)\n\nSo the min_sequence is the minimal required over all sequences.\n\nNow, the problem is that for the current hand, the set of tiles may have duplicates, but converting to a set removes duplicates. For example, if the current hand is ['1s', '1s', '2s'], the current_tiles_set is {'1s', '2s'}, which is correct. So for the sequence ['1s', '2s', '3s'], the count is 2, required is 1.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nOnce we have min_triplet and min_sequence, the answer for the case is the minimum between them.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the current hand already has a mentsu? For example, if the current hand has a triplet or a sequence. Then, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the steps for each input case are:\n\nCheck if the current hand already has a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   compute min_triplet and min_sequence, then the answer is min(min_triplet, min_sequence).\n\nSo the first thing to do is to check if the current hand already has a mentsu.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nCheck for triplet: if all three tiles are same. For example, ['9m', '9m', '9m'].\n\nCheck for sequence: if the three tiles form a sequence.\n\nSo for checking if the current hand has a mentsu:\n\nCheck for triplet:\n\nif all three tiles are same. So len(set(current_tiles)) == 1.\n\nCheck for sequence:\n\nif the three tiles are in the same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo for example, the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s. Or 5m, 6m, 7m. Or 2p, 3p, 4p. But the order doesn't matter.\n\nSo to check for sequence:\n\nFirst, check that all three tiles have the same suit. Then, extract the numbers, sort them, and check if they are consecutive.\n\nFor example, tiles are ['2s', '1s', '3s'] → sorted numbers are [1,2,3] → consecutive.\n\nAnother example: ['3p', '5p', '4p'] → sorted numbers [3,4,5] → consecutive.\n\nSo code steps for checking sequence:\n\nif all three tiles have same suit:\n\n   numbers = list of the numbers (integers) of each tile.\n\n   sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n   if sorted_numbers[2] - sorted_numbers[0] == 2 and sorted_numbers[1] - sorted_numbers[0] == 1:\n\n       then it's a sequence.\n\nSo for example, [1,2,3] → yes. [1,3,5] → no.\n\nSo combining these two checks: if either triplet or sequence exists, then output 0.\n\nSo the code for checking existing mentsu is:\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if len(set(tiles)) == 1:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    # check same suit\n\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    # same suit, check numbers\n\n    nums = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n\n    nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n\n    if nums_sorted[2] - nums_sorted[0] == 2 and nums_sorted[1] - nums_sorted[0] == 1:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nSo if this returns True, then output 0.\n\nElse, compute min_triplet and min_sequence.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each input case:\n\ntiles = list of three strings.\n\nif has_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    compute min_triplet and min_sequence, then print min(min_triplet, min_sequence).\n\nNow, how to compute min_triplet and min_sequence.\n\nLet's code min_triplet.\n\nFor the current tiles, create a frequency dictionary. For example, using collections.Counter.\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounts = Counter(tiles)\n\nthen, for each tile in counts, compute 3 - count. Take the minimum of these.\n\nBut since counts.values() is the counts for each tile. So:\n\nmin_triplet = min(3 - cnt for cnt in counts.values())\n\nBut for example, if the current tiles are ['1s', '2s', '3s'], then counts is {'1s':1, '2s':1, '3s':1} → 3-1=2 for each, min is 2. But the min_sequence would be 0 (since the current tiles form a sequence). But since the code checks for existing mentsu first, this case would have been caught and output 0.\n\nSo in the else case, the current tiles don't have a mentsu. So for example, if the current tiles are ['1s', '2s', '4s'], then the code would proceed to compute min_triplet and min_sequence.\n\nFor min_sequence, generate all possible sequences and compute the minimal required draws.\n\nNow, generating all possible sequences:\n\nall_sequences = []\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for start_num in range(1, 8): # 1-7 inclusive\n\n        seq = [f\"{start_num}{suit}\", f\"{start_num+1}{suit}\", f\"{start_num+2}{suit}\"]\n\n        all_sequences.append(seq)\n\nBut for each of these, we need to check how many of the current tiles are in the sequence.\n\nBut for the current tiles, we can create a set (unique tiles). For example:\n\ncurrent_tiles_set = set(tiles)\n\nThen, for each sequence in all_sequences:\n\nsequence_set = set(seq)\n\ncommon = current_tiles_set & sequence_set\n\ncount = len(common)\n\nrequired = 3 - count\n\nkeep track of the minimum required.\n\nSo the code for min_sequence is:\n\ncurrent_tiles_set = set(tiles)\n\nmin_seq = float('inf')\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for start_num in range(1, 8):\n\n        seq_tiles = [f\"{start_num}{suit}\", f\"{start_num+1}{suit}\", f\"{start_num+2}{suit}\"]\n\n        seq_set = set(seq_tiles)\n\n        common = current_tiles_set & seq_set\n\n        count = len(common)\n\n        required = 3 - count\n\n        if required < min_seq:\n\n            min_seq = required\n\nSo min_sequence is min_seq.\n\nThen, the answer is min(min_triplet, min_seq).\n\nSo putting all together.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n['1s', '2s', '3s']\n\nhas_mentsu returns True (it's a sequence), so output 0.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n['9m', '9m', '9m'] → triplet, output 0.\n\nSample input 3:\n\n['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nCheck if has_mentsu:\n\nCheck triplet: all same? No. Check sequence: same suit? The tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p. Suits are p, m, p. So not same. So no sequence. So proceed.\n\nCompute min_triplet:\n\ncounts for tiles:\n\n3p:1, 9m:1, 2p:1. So 3 - cnt for each is 2, 2, 2. min_triplet is 2.\n\nCompute min_sequence:\n\ncurrent_tiles_set is {'3p', '9m', '2p'}\n\nNow, for all possible sequences.\n\nFor example, for suit p:\n\nstart_num 1: 1p, 2p, 3p → the sequence. current_tiles_set has 2p and 3p. So count is 2 → required is 1.\n\nSo this sequence would have required 1. So min_seq is 1.\n\nSo the answer is min(2, 1) → 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nAnother test case: input is ['1s', '1s', '2s'].\n\nCheck has_mentsu: triplet? No. Sequence? Suits are same. Numbers are 1,1,2. Sorted is [1,1,2]. The difference between first and third is 1, but the middle is same as first. So not consecutive. So no sequence.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nmin_triplet: counts are 1s:2, 2s:1. 3 - 2 = 1, 3-1=2. min is 1.\n\nmin_sequence: check all sequences. For example, for the sequence 1s, 2s, 3s. current_tiles have 1s and 2s → count 2 → required 1. So min_seq is 1. So answer is min(1, 1) → 1.\n\nBut what's the actual minimal? Either add one more 1s (triplet) or add 3s (sequence). Either way, 1 draw. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input is ['1s', '1s', '1s'] → has_mentsu returns True. Output 0.\n\nAnother example: input is ['1s', '2s', '4s'].\n\nCheck for mentsu: no. min_triplet is 2 (each tile has count 1). min_sequence: for the sequence 1s,2s,3s → count is 2 → required 1. Or 2s,3s,4s → count is 2 (2s and 4s) → required 1. So min_seq is 1. Answer is 1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about cases where the current tiles can form a sequence by adding two tiles? For example, input is ['1s', '1s', '2s'].\n\nBut the code would compute for min_sequence:\n\nLooking for sequences. For example, the sequence 1s, 2s, 3s. current_tiles have 1s and 2s. So required is 1. So the answer is 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: input is ['1s', '3s', '5s'].\n\nCheck for mentsu: no. For min_triplet: each tile has count 1 → 3-1=2. min_triplet is 2. For min_sequence: check all possible sequences. For example, for 1s,2s,3s → current has 1s and 3s → count is 2 → required 1. But to form the sequence, need to add 2s. So 1 draw. So answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: input is ['1s', '3s', '3s'].\n\nCheck for mentsu: no. min_triplet: counts are 1s:1, 3s:2. So 3-1=2, 3-2=1. min_triplet is 1. min_sequence: check for sequences. For example, 1s,2s,3s → current has 1s and 3s → count 2 → required 1. So min between 1 and 1 → 1. So answer is 1.\n\nSo the code would return 1. Which is correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where all three tiles are same suit, but not consecutive. For example, ['1s', '2s', '4s'].\n\nNo mentsu. min_sequence is 1 (add 3s). min_triplet is 2 (need to add two more of same tile). So answer is 1.\n\nAnother edge case: input is ['1m', '1m', '2m']. So for triplet, need one more. For sequence, need 3m. So required is 1. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: input is ['1m', '2m', '4m'] → min_sequence is 1 (add 3m). min_triplet is 2 (need to add two of same tile). So answer is 1.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, the code needs to read three input strings. Wait, the input is given as a list of three strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid meld (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking if the current hand already contains a valid meld and, if not, calculating the minimum draws required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Meld**: First, check if the current hand already contains a valid triplet or sequence. If it does, no additional tiles are needed.\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: If no existing meld is found, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet. This is done by determining how many more tiles of each type are needed to complete a triplet.\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: Similarly, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form a sequence. This involves checking all possible sequences in each suit and determining how many tiles are missing from the current hand to complete any of these sequences.\n4. **Determine Minimum Draws**: The result is the minimum value between the draws required for a triplet and those required for a sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n    # Check for triplet\n    if len(set(tiles)) == 1:\n        return True\n    # Check for sequence\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n        return False\n    nums = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n    nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n    if nums_sorted[2] - nums_sorted[0] == 2 and nums_sorted[1] - nums_sorted[0] == 1:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef min_draws(tiles):\n    if has_mentsu(tiles):\n        return 0\n    # Calculate min_triplet\n    counts = Counter(tiles)\n    min_triplet = min(3 - cnt for cnt in counts.values())\n    # Calculate min_sequence\n    current_tiles_set = set(tiles)\n    min_seq = float('inf')\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for start_num in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [f\"{start_num}{suit}\", f\"{start_num+1}{suit}\", f\"{start_num+2}{suit}\"]\n            seq_set = set(seq)\n            common = current_tiles_set & seq_set\n            count = len(common)\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < min_seq:\n                min_seq = required\n    return min(min_triplet, min_seq)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split into three tiles\n    tiles = input_line.split()\n    result = min_draws(tiles)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **has_mentsu Function**: Checks if the current hand already contains a valid triplet or sequence. This is done by checking if all tiles are the same (triplet) or if they form a consecutive sequence in the same suit.\n- **min_draws Function**: Determines the minimum number of tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence. It calculates the minimum draws required for a triplet by considering how many more tiles of each type are needed. For sequences, it checks all possible sequences in each suit and calculates the number of tiles needed to complete any of these sequences.\n- **Main Function**: Reads input, processes the tiles, and prints the minimum number of draws required based on the calculated values from `min_draws`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for both possible meld types and ensures the minimum number of additional tiles needed is determined accurately.",
