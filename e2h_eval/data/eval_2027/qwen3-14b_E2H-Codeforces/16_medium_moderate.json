Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent each block? Since there are n roads, each block can be represented by the set of roads that separate it from the origin or something? Wait, maybe not. Another approach: think of each block as being determined by the sign of each road's equation. Because each road divides the plane into two halves. For a given point not on any road, for each road, the point lies on one side or the other. So, the block can be uniquely identified by the signs of all the equations evaluated at that point. \n\nFor example, if there are two roads, then each block is determined by the combination of signs (like + for first road, - for second, etc.). So, for a point not on any road, we can compute for each road whether it's positive or negative. Then, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if two regions share a common border, they must be separated by exactly one road. Because moving across that road would flip the sign of that road's equation. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of sign changes needed to go from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration. Each step allows changing exactly one sign (since moving across a road changes exactly one sign). Therefore, the minimum steps is the number of differing signs between the two configurations. \n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me think again. Suppose the home and university are in blocks that differ in k roads. Then, the minimal steps would be k? Because each step can flip one sign. But wait, how does that correspond to moving through adjacent regions?\n\nWait, if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are adjacent. So, the problem becomes equivalent to finding the hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each step allows you to change one sign, so the minimal steps is the hamming distance between the two vectors.\n\nBut that's only if the regions are connected via steps that change one sign at a time. However, is that always possible? For example, if two regions differ in two signs, can you find a path that changes one sign at a time? Like, if you have two differing signs, then you can go from the home region to a region that differs in one sign, then to another that differs in another sign. So the minimal steps would be the hamming distance. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of that road. \n\nWait, but how do I check that? For each road, evaluate the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. If they are different, then that road contributes 1 to the count. The total count is the answer. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So to get from one block to another, you need to cross roads where the signs differ. And each crossing is a step. So the minimal number of steps is the number of differing roads. \n\nYes, because each differing road requires crossing once. So the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nLet me test this against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0, and 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor road 1: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 >0 → sign is positive.\nFor road 2: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → positive.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFor road 1: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → negative.\nFor road 2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → negative.\n\nSo the signs for home are (positive, positive), for university (negative, negative). So for both roads, the signs differ. So the count is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x + y -3 =0. \n\nCheck for each road:\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1 (x=0): 1>0 → positive.\nRoad 2 (y=0): 1>0 → positive.\nRoad 3: 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → negative.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: -1 <0 → negative.\nRoad 2: -1 <0 → negative.\nRoad 3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → same as home. \n\nSo the signs for home are (+, +, -), university is (-, -, -). So differing roads are road 1 and 2. Count is 2, which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nYes! So the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. \n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. For each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) for the home point, and similarly for the university point. \n\n2. For each road, check if the signs of these two values are different. If they are, increment the count.\n\n3. The answer is this count. \n\nBut wait, what if the home and university are in the same block? Then the count is zero. But how do we handle that? Well, according to the problem statement, the home and university are in different blocks. Or not? Wait, the problem says that the home and university are located in some block. But it's possible that they are in the same block. But according to the problem statement, the answer is the minimum steps to get to the university block. So if they are already in the same block, the answer is 0. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is such that the home and university are not on any road. But they could be in the same block. So the code needs to check that. \n\nBut how do we check if the home and university are in the same block? Well, if for all roads, the signs of the home and university are the same. Then they are in the same block. So the answer is 0. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n roads. For each road, compute s1 = a_i *x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i, s2 = a_i *x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. Check if s1 and s2 have different signs. If yes, increment count. Finally, output the count. \n\nBut wait, how to check if two numbers have different signs? Well, the product of s1 and s2 is negative. So for each road, check if (s1 * s2) < 0. If yes, then count +=1. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nBut wait, what about when s1 is zero? But the problem states that neither home nor university is on any road. So s1 and s2 are never zero. So no problem. \n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen for each of the n lines, read a, b, c.\n\nFor each road, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nIf val1 * val2 < 0, then increment the count.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nYes. That's the solution. \n\nLet me check the sample inputs again.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0 1 0 → equation 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0. For home, val1 is 1*1 + 0*...? Wait, no. Wait the equation is a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. So for the first road, a is 0, b is 1, c is 0. So for home (1,1), val1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. For university (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * (-1) is -1 <0 → count increases by 1. \n\nSecond road is 1 0 0 → x=0. val1 for home is 1*1 + 0*... +0 → 1. val2 is 1*(-1) + ... → -1. Product is -1 → count increases by 1. Total is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: home (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads. \n\nFirst road: 1 0 0 → x=0. val1 is 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 0 1 0 → y=0. val1 is 1, val2 is -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → equation x + y -3 =0. val1 is 1+1-3 = -1. val2 is (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0 → no count. So total is 2. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code works for samples.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nNow, the code needs to read input. But the input is given as a list of strings? Or perhaps the input is read from stdin. Wait, the original problem says that the input is read from standard input. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nThe input format is:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines, each with a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each a, b, c:\n\ncompute val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c.\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nAt end, print count.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about the data types? Since the numbers can be up to 1e6, multiplied by 1e6, so 1e12, but in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code it.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\ncount starts at 0.\n\nFirst road: a=0, b=1, c=0. val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2=0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=1, b=0, c=0. val1 =1*1 +0 +0 =1. val2=1*(-1) +0 +0 =-1. product -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Output is 2.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst road: val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2=1*(-1) +0 +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 0*1 +1*1 +0=1. val2: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 =-1. val2: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. So total is 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works. \n\nEdge cases: What if home and university are in the same block? For example, if all roads have same sign for both points. Then output is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: n=0? But according to input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, the third line is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So no. So no need to handle n=0.\n\nAnother case: when a road is such that home is on one side, university on the other. So that road contributes 1.\n\nSo the code is correct. So the Python code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input. Then x2, y2. Then n. Then n lines.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That's the code. Let me test it with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1 input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nSample 2 input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nOutput is 2. \n\nYes. So the code works. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as per the problem. The sample input shows two examples, but in reality, the code is supposed to process a single test case. Because the input is given as per the problem's input description.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the input description. The sample input shows two examples, but in practice, the code is supposed to read one test case. So the code above is correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common border between blocks, which is defined by the roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each road divides the plane into two halves. The home and university are located in different blocks, and we need to find the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Each block can be represented by the signs of the values obtained by evaluating the equations of the roads at a given point. If two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides of a road, they are in different blocks separated by that road. The minimum number of steps required to move from one block to another is determined by the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road, compute the value of the equation at the home and university coordinates.\n   - Check if the signs of these values are different. If they are, increment the count as this indicates the home and university are on opposite sides of that road.\n   - The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n- **Sign Evaluation**: For each road, evaluate the equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these evaluations is negative, it means the points lie on opposite sides of the road.\n- **Counting Steps**: Each road that separates the home and university blocks contributes one step. The total count of such roads is the answer, representing the minimum steps needed to move between the blocks.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their sign evaluations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
