Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a block here. Each block is a region divided by the infinite roads. The roads are lines, and their intersections create regions. The key thing is that moving between blocks requires that they share a common segment (not just a point). So, two blocks are adjacent if their boundary shares a line segment, which would happen when they are separated by exactly one road. But how do I model this?\n\nThe challenge is to model the blocks and their adjacency. But since there are potentially an infinite number of blocks, we can't model them all directly. However, the problem is about moving between blocks, and the movement depends on crossing roads. So maybe we can model the problem in terms of the roads and the positions of the home and university relative to them.\n\nAnother idea: think of each block as being determined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, a point lies on one side or the other. The combination of all these signs determines which block the point is in. But since there are n roads, there are 2^n possible combinations. However, some combinations might not be possible (like if the roads are parallel, etc.), but for the purposes of modeling, perhaps we can represent each block by the sign vector of each road.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that even if two points have different sign vectors, they might be in the same block. However, given that the roads divide the plane into regions, the sign vector (for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side) uniquely identifies the block. Because each road divides the plane into two parts, and the regions are determined by the intersection of these half-planes. So, for a given point not on any road, the sign vector (for each road, +1 or -1) determines which block it's in. Therefore, two points are in the same block if and only if their sign vectors are the same for all roads.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of steps between the sign vectors of the home and university. But how do steps work? Each step corresponds to crossing a road, which changes the sign of exactly one road. But wait, no. Because when you cross a road, you change the sign of that road. However, moving from one block to another adjacent block requires that you cross exactly one road. So, the adjacency between blocks would be when their sign vectors differ in exactly one road's sign. Because changing one road's sign would take you from one block to an adjacent one. However, this is only true if the two blocks are separated by that road. But perhaps that's the case. Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, two blocks are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position. But is this correct?\n\nWait, suppose there are two roads. Let's say the first road divides the plane into two regions, and the second road also divides it into two. Then the four possible regions are determined by the sign vectors. Each region is adjacent to two others. For example, the region (+, +) is adjacent to (-, +) (crossing the first road) and (+, -) (crossing the second road). So, in this case, the adjacency is indeed when the sign vectors differ in exactly one position. So, this suggests that the graph of blocks can be represented as a hypercube, where each node is a sign vector, and edges connect nodes differing in exactly one bit. However, this is only true if the roads are in general position, but perhaps in reality, the adjacency is determined by whether the two regions are separated by exactly one road. \n\nBut in reality, two regions that differ in exactly one sign are separated by that road, so they are adjacent. Thus, the adjacency graph is such that each node is connected to others that differ in exactly one road's sign. Therefore, the problem becomes equivalent to finding the minimum number of steps to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step flips one bit (i.e., changes the sign of one road). But wait, the minimum number of steps would be the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each step can flip one bit. However, this seems too simple. Let me check with the examples.\n\nLooking at the first example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\nHome is (1,1), University is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0, and 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. So the roads are x=0 and y=0. The home (1,1) is in the region where x>0 and y>0. The university is (-1,-1) which is x<0 and y<0. The sign vectors for the home are for road 1 (y=0): 1*1 +0*...? Wait, the equation for the road is a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. For the first road, 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. For the home (1,1), substituting into the equation gives 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 > 0. So the sign is +. For the second road, 1x + 0y + 0 =0 → x=0. The home's value is 1*1 +0 +0 = 1>0. So the sign vector is (1,1). The university is (-1,-1). For the first road, 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign -1. For the second road, 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1 <0. So sign vector is (-1,-1). The Hamming distance between (1,1) and (-1,-1) is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one. Let's see. Home (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, and x + y -3=0. Let's compute sign vectors for home and university.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → 1*1 +0 +0 = 1>0 → +1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1>0 → +1.\n\nRoad 3: 1x +1y -3 = 0 → 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -1.\n\nSo sign vector is [1,1,-1].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → -1 → -1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → -1 → -1.\n\nRoad 3: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -1.\n\nSo sign vector is [-1,-1,-1]. The Hamming distance between [1,1,-1] and [-1,-1,-1] is 2 (the first two bits differ). So the answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to hold. Therefore, the problem reduces to computing the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university. Because each step allows us to flip one bit (crossing a road), and the minimal steps is the number of differing bits.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each differing bit represents a road where the home and university are on opposite sides. To get from one to the other, you need to cross those roads. But since each step can cross one road, you need as many steps as the number of differing roads.\n\nBut why can't there be a shorter path? For example, suppose two roads are crossed in a way that you can reach the target in fewer steps. But since each step can only cross one road, and each differing bit requires crossing that road once, the minimal steps must be the Hamming distance. Because each differing road must be crossed once. \n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each road, determine the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. For each road, if the signs are different, then that contributes 1 to the answer. The total is the answer.\n\nWait, but that's the Hamming distance. So the answer is simply the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). Since the home and university are not on any road, these values are non-zero. Then, check if the signs of these two values are different. If they are, increment the count. The answer is this count.\n\nWait, this is a very simple solution. Let me test this against the samples.\n\nSample 1: two roads.\n\nFor home (1,1) and university (-1,-1).\n\nFirst road: 0x +1y +0 =0. For home, value is 1*1 =1. For university, 1*(-1) = -1. Signs differ → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y +0=0. Home value is 1, university is -1 → signs differ → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2: three roads.\n\nHome (1,1): for the third road (1x +1y -3=0) → 1+1-3 = -1. University (-1,-1): (-1)+(-1)-3 = -5. Both negative → same sign. So for this road, no difference. The first two roads, same as before. So two differences. Answer is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then the answer is zero steps. Which makes sense because they are in the same block.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads, and home and university differ in two roads. Then the answer is 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nBut why is this correct? Because each such road must be crossed once. Since each step can cross exactly one road, the minimal steps is the number of roads where the signs differ. \n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where crossing a road multiple times (but that's not allowed, since the steps are moving between adjacent blocks, and each step crosses exactly one road). \n\nBut the problem says that you can move from one block to another if they share a common border. So, each step is moving across a single road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks. \n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The number of such roads is the answer.\n\nThis is a very simple solution, which is surprising. But according to the examples, it works. \n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), then n roads. For each road, compute val1 = a_i *x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i, val2 = a_i *x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. If val1 * val2 < 0, then increment the count. The answer is the count.\n\nBut wait, why is that the case? Because if val1 and val2 have opposite signs, then the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. So, the road is part of the boundary between their blocks. Therefore, the minimal steps must cross this road once. \n\nSo, the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nWe need to read the input. For each test case, read x1, y1, then x2, y2, then n, then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nFor each of the n roads, compute for home and university:\n\nval1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0, then count +=1.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 are non-zero. So, val1 * val2 can't be zero. So, for each road, the product is either positive or negative. So, the code is safe.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead the first two lines as home and university coordinates.\n\nThen read n, then read n lines.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each line, compute a, b, c.\n\nCompute val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c.\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nAt the end, print count.\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the first case is:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSo for the first road, a=0, b=1, c=0. val1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=1, b=0, c=0. val1 is 1*1 +0 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), univ (-1,-1), n=3.\n\nRoads:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0. val1 is 1*1 +0 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0 +0 =-1 → product negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond road 0 1 0 → same as before, count +=1.\n\nThird road 1 1 -3 → val1 is 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 is 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3=-5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. So total count is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nSo this is the solution. The code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input format is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line contains two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line contains n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, the sample input seems to have two test cases. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 — the coordinates of your home.\n\nThe second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 — the coordinates of the university.\n\nThird line contains an integer n — the number of roads.\n\nThen n lines follow.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, in the sample input provided, there are two examples. The first example's input is:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nOutput: 2\n\nThe second example input is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nOutput: 2.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of two inputs, but the actual program should process one input per run.\n\nSo the code should read from standard input. So, for the code, we need to read the input as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n from third line.\n\nThen read n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nThen compute the count as explained.\n\nThus, the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input lines. But in Python, the code can read from stdin via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nBut for handling multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. So the code will process one test case.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nThen for each of these lines, compute val1 and val2, check if their product is negative.\n\nCount the number of such cases.\n\nPrint the count.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead x1, y1: can be done via input().split()\n\nSame for x2, y2.\n\nThen n = int(input())\n\nThen for n lines, read a, b, c.\n\nBut note that the input could have leading or trailing spaces, but split() handles that.\n\nSo:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, this is the code. But let me test with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nval1 for first road is 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count increases.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1 → product -1 → count is 2. Output is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → val1 is 1*1 +0 +0 =1, val2 is -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road 0 1 0 → val1 is 1, val2 is -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road 1 1 -3 → val1 = 1*1 +1*1 -3 = -1. val2 = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. So total count is 2. Correct.\n\nYes, the code works.\n\nBut why is this the correct approach? Because each road that separates the home and university blocks must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is exactly the number of such roads. Because each step can cross one road, and you need to cross all roads that separate the two regions.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where two roads are crossed in a way that allows fewer steps? For example, if two roads cross each other, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads, but there's a path that crosses both roads in one step? No, because each step can only cross one road. So, you need to cross each road once. Hence, the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nThis is a very clever problem. The key insight is realizing that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. This is because each such road must be crossed once, and each step can cross exactly one road. Thus, the answer is the count of roads where the two points are on opposite sides.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block to a target block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If a point lies on one side of a road, and another point lies on the opposite side, then these points are separated by that road. The minimum number of steps required to move from the starting block to the target block is equivalent to the number of roads that separate these two points.\n\nTo determine if a road separates the two points, we evaluate the sign of the value obtained by substituting the coordinates of the starting and target points into the equation of the road. If the signs of these values are different, the road separates the points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Separation:** For each road, we compute the value of the road equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the two points lie on opposite sides of the road, meaning the road separates them.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads:** The number of such separating roads is counted, which directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each step involves crossing one road.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads, ensuring it handles the problem constraints effectively.",
