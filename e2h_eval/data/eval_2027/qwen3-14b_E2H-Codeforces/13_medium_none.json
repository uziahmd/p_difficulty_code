For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three notes forms a major, minor, or strange chord. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the chord is made of three notes, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor triad definitions. Since the order doesn't matter in the chord, but the definition requires a specific ordering (X, Y, Z) with certain distances between them, I need to check all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Convert the note names into their corresponding numerical positions. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H (which is B in some notations, but according to the problem statement, the list is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait. Wait the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh, so H is the 12th note? Let me check the order again. Let me count:\n\nThe list is:\n\nC (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11). Then after H comes C again. So the total is 12 notes.\n\nSo each note can be mapped to a number from 0 to 11. So first, I need a way to convert the note names into these numbers.\n\nSo for example, 'C' is 0, 'H' is 11, and then 'C' again is 0.\n\nNext, for each permutation of the three notes, I need to check if there's a way to arrange them as X, Y, Z such that:\n\nFor a major triad: distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. The total distance from X to Z would be 7 semitones.\n\nBut how do I calculate the distance between two notes? The problem says that the distance is measured along the musical scale from the lower to the upper note. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. But between E and C, it's 8 semitones, since you go the other way around.\n\nWait, but how is the distance calculated? Let me think. The distance between two notes is the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher one. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (Y - X) mod 12? No, wait, no. Because if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) ?\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the upper one. So for example, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. But between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because when you go from E to C, you can go up by 8 semitones (E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, ..., up to C).\n\nSo the distance between two notes X and Y is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12 if Y is higher than X, but if X is higher than Y, then it's (Y + 12 - X) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think of it as (Y - X + 12) % 12? No. Because if Y is higher than X, then (Y - X) is positive, and that's the distance. If Y is lower than X, then (Y - X) is negative, but adding 12 would make it positive. But that's not correct. For example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 - 4 + 12) = 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). But another way to compute that is (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if Y is lower than X, then (Y - X) mod 12 would be (Y - X + 12) if Y < X. For example, if Y is 0 and X is 4, then (0-4) is -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because if you have X and Y, the distance from X to Y is the number of semitones you need to go up from X to reach Y. So, for example, if X is C (0) and Y is C (0), the distance is zero. If X is C and Y is C#, the distance is 1. If X is C and Y is H (11), then the distance is 11. But if X is H (11) and Y is C (0), then the distance is 1 (since you go up from H to C is one semitone). So the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y - X + 12). Which can be written as (Y - X) % 12? Wait, no. Because (Y - X) mod 12 gives the same as (Y - X + 12) mod 12. So for example, if Y is 0 and X is 11, then Y - X is -11, mod 12 is 1. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Wait, but that's only when considering the distance from X to Y. So, for example, between X and Y, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12. But in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is defined as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8. Which is (C - E) mod 12? Wait, C is 0, E is 4. (0 - 4) mod 12 is 8. Yes. So the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, if X is lower than Y, then (Y - X) mod 12 is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then (Y - X) mod 12 is Y - X + 12. Which is exactly the distance. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. However, in the problem's example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Which is (E - C) mod 12 = 4 - 0 = 4. Correct. And between E and C, the distance is (C - E) mod 12 = (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Correct. So that's how the distance is computed.\n\nSo, given that, for any two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, no. Wait, if X is Y, then the distance is zero. So that works.\n\nNow, for the triad. For a major triad, there must be an ordering of the three notes X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones. But how do I check that?\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. But since the distance is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but in the case of X to Y being 4, that would mean that Y is X + 4 (mod 12). Similarly for Y to Z being 3 semitones, Z is Y + 3 (mod 12). So the total distance from X to Z would be 7 semitones.\n\nBut how do I check that for a given set of three notes?\n\nSo for each permutation of the three notes, I can check whether the first two notes have a distance of 4, and the next two have a distance of 3. Or perhaps, for all possible orderings of the three notes, check if any of them satisfy the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut since the chord is unordered, there are 3! = 6 possible permutations. For each permutation, check if the first two notes have a distance of 4 and the next two have a distance of 3 (for major), or if the first two have 3 and the next two have 4 (for minor). If any permutation satisfies that, then the chord is major or minor accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations (all possible orderings).\n- For each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor conditions.\n- If any permutation meets the major condition, output \"major\".\n- If any permutation meets the minor condition, output \"minor\".\n- Else, output \"strange\".\n\nBut how to generate all permutations of the three notes?\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, for the list [A, B, C], permutations would generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nSo, first, I need to map the note names to their numerical values. Let's create a dictionary for that.\n\nThe notes are ordered as follows:\n\nNotes list:\n\n['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, the problem says the order is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo for example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, 'D' is 2, 'D#' is 3, 'E' is 4, 'F' is 5, 'F#' is 6, 'G' is 7, 'G#' is 8, 'A' is 9, 'B' is 10, 'H' is 11.\n\nSo the mapping can be done with a dictionary. Let's create a list of note names in order, then for each note, its index is the value.\n\nSo:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, for a note name, its index is note_order.index(note). But since the input may have the notes in any order, but the code needs to process them.\n\nBut note that in Python, using index() can be O(n), but since the list is small, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, create a dictionary mapping each note to its index.\n\nnote_to_num = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nWait, but what about the note 'B'? In the list, it's 10, and 'H' is 11. So that's correct.\n\nSo, for example, the input 'C E G' would be mapped to 0, 4, 7.\n\nNow, for each permutation of these three numbers, check for major or minor.\n\nSo for each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck if distance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3. If yes, then it's a major triad.\n\nOr check if distance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4. Then it's a minor triad.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between x and y? As (y - x) mod 12? Wait, no. Because the distance between x and y is (y - x) mod 12? Wait, no. Wait the distance is (y - x) if y is higher than x, else (y - x + 12). But that's equivalent to (y - x) % 12? Let me check.\n\nFor example, x=0 (C), y=4 (E): (4-0) mod 12 is 4. Correct. For x=4 (E), y=0 (C): (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between x and y is (y - x) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper note. So, for example, if x is lower than y, then the distance is y - x. If x is higher than y, then the distance is (y + 12 - x). Which is the same as (y - x) mod 12. So yes.\n\nBut in the case of checking for the major triad, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones. So for the ordered triplet X, Y, Z, the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. So in terms of the numerical values, (Y - X) mod 12 must equal 4, and (Z - Y) mod 12 must equal 3.\n\nWait, but how? Because suppose X is 0 (C), Y is 4 (E), then (Y - X) is 4, which mod 12 is 4. So that's correct. Then Z is Y + 3 mod 12. For example, Y is 4, Z is 7 (G). (7 - 4) mod 12 is 3. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if the actual values are such that Y is X + 4 mod 12, and Z is Y + 3 mod 12. But how do we check that? Because for example, if X is 11 (H), Y is (11 +4) mod 12 = 3 (D#). Then Z would be (3 +3) mod 12 = 6 (F#). So the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. So the code would check that for each permutation.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each permutation of the three notes (as numbers):\n\nCheck if (y - x) mod 12 == 4 and (z - y) mod 12 == 3 → major.\n\nOr check if (y - x) mod 12 == 3 and (z - y) mod 12 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then answer is major. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead the three notes as a list.\n\nConvert them to their numerical values.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three numbers.\n\nFor each permutation, check for major or minor conditions.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the condition, return the appropriate result.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So there's no case where both major and minor conditions are satisfied.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the input. For example, input is a list of three notes. For example, the first sample input is ['C E G'], which is split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo the code should read the input line, split into three elements, then process them.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\n1. Read the input line. Split into three notes.\n\nFor example:\n\ninput_line = input().strip()\n\nnotes = input_line.split()\n\nBut the input is given as a list of three notes. For example, in the sample input, it's given as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] but perhaps in the actual input, the user inputs three notes separated by spaces. Wait, the problem says the input is the only line contains 3 space-separated notes. So for example, the first example input would be:\n\nC E G\n\nThen the output is major.\n\nSo the code reads the input line, splits into three parts.\n\nOnce the three notes are read, convert them into their numerical values.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the three numbers.\n\nFor each permutation, check for major or minor.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the major condition, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nImplementing the note_to_num dictionary.\n\nBut how to handle the note names. For example, 'C#' is a note, as is 'D#', 'F#', 'G#', 'B' (which is 10), and 'H' (which is 11).\n\nSo the note_to_num dictionary can be built as:\n\nnote_to_num = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nBut what if the note is written as 'B' or 'H'? According to the problem statement, the input uses the notation given, which includes 'B' and 'H'.\n\nSo the code should correctly map 'B' to 10 and 'H' to 11.\n\nOnce the three notes are converted into numbers, say, a, b, c, then generate all permutations of [a, b, c].\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck if (y - x) % 12 == 4 and (z - y) % 12 == 3 → major.\n\nCheck if (y - x) % 12 == 3 and (z - y) % 12 == 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then return 'major'.\n\nSimilarly for minor.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nimport itertools.\n\nThen:\n\nnotes_input = input().split()\n\nThen, convert each note to its numerical value.\n\nFor example:\n\nnotes = [note_to_num[note] for note in notes_input]\n\nThen generate all permutations of notes.\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print('major')\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print('minor')\n\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none found, print 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, what if multiple permutations meet the condition? But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So the code can check for the first occurrence and return.\n\nBut for example, if there are multiple permutations that meet the major condition, but the code returns on the first occurrence.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unique, it's okay.\n\nSo the code would proceed as follows.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: C E G → converted to 0,4,7.\n\nPermutations:\n\n(0,4,7): d1 = 4-0 =4 mod 12 is 4. d2=7-4=3 mod 12 is 3 → major. So output 'major'.\n\nSample Input 2: C# B F → converted to 1, 10, 5.\n\nCheck permutations. One of the permutations is B, C#, F → which is 10, 1, 5.\n\nCheck d1 = (1 -10) mod 12 → (1-10) = -9 mod 12 is 3. Then d2 is 5-1=4 mod 12 is 4. So 3 and 4 → minor.\n\nAnother permutation could be (10, 5, 1) → d1 is 5-10 = -5 mod 12 is 7. Not 3 or 4. So the code would find that permutation (10,1,5) which gives d1=3 and d2=4 → minor.\n\nSample input 3: A B H → converted to 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck permutations.\n\nLet's see:\n\nCheck all permutations. For example:\n\n9, 10, 11 → d1 is 1, d2 is 1 → no.\n\nCheck 9, 11, 10 → d1 is (11-9) = 2 mod12=2. d2 is 10-11 = -1 mod12=11 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: 10, 9, 11 → d1 is 9-10 = -1 mod12=11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 10, 11, 9 → d1 is 1, d2 is 9-11 = -2 mod12=10 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: 11, 9, 10 → d1 is 9-11 = -2 mod12=10 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: 11, 10, 9 → d1 is 10-11 = -1 mod12=11, d2 is 9-10=-1 mod12=11. No. So none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, code.\n\nImplementing that in Python.\n\nBut first, the note_to_num dictionary.\n\nBut how to handle the note names? For example, 'C#', 'D#', 'F#', 'G#', 'B', 'H'.\n\nSo the code can have:\n\nnote_to_num = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nBut what if the input has a note like 'H'? It's mapped to 11.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_num = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes_input = input().split()\n\nnotes = [note_to_num[note] for note in notes_input]\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but what if the same note is repeated? For example, if the input is three same notes. But according to the problem statement, the chord is a set of no less than three notes. But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. But for example, if all three are same note, then the distances between them would be zero, so no major or minor. So output 'strange'.\n\nBut the code would process that correctly.\n\nBut what about the case where the three notes are C, E, G. Which is the first sample. The code checks all permutations. The first permutation is (C, E, G) → d1 is 4, d2 is 3 → major. So it prints 'major' and exits.\n\nAnother case: for example, the input is C, E, G. But in a different permutation. For example, (E, G, C). Then:\n\nd1 is (G - E) → 7 -4 =3 → mod12 is 3. d2 is (C - G) → 0 -7 = -7 mod12 is 5. So no. So that permutation would not trigger anything. But the code would check all permutations, and in the first one that meets the condition, it would return.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the second sample input: 'C# B F' → which is ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nConverted to numbers: 1, 10, 5.\n\nLooking at permutations. For example, the permutation (10, 1, 5):\n\nd1 = (1 -10) mod 12 → (1-10) is -9 mod12 is 3. d2 = 5-1 =4 mod12 is 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So the code would print 'minor'.\n\nAnother permutation could be (1, 10, 5) → d1 is (10-1) =9 mod12=9 → no. So the code would check all permutations until it finds the correct one.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the third sample input: A B H → 9,10,11. All permutations checked. None would meet the conditions, so output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, what about a minor triad? For example, the input is B, C#, F → which is 10,1,5. So the permutation (10,1,5) → d1 is (1-10) mod12 = 3, d2 is (5-1) mod12=4 → minor. So code outputs 'minor'.\n\nAnother example: let's take a minor triad. Suppose the input is B, C#, F. Which is the sample input. The code would find that permutation and output 'minor'.\n\nNow, what about a case where the notes are ordered in a different way, but the distances are correct. For example, the minor triad could be C#, B, F. But when permuted as B, C#, F, which is the same as before.\n\nSo the code should handle all permutations.\n\nTherefore, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. Also, note that in Python, the exit() function may not be the best practice, but for code submission, it's acceptable. However, in practice, using sys.exit() is better, but in code submission, returning after print is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, the code can use 'exit()' but perhaps in some environments, it's better to break after finding the answer. However, for code submission, perhaps using a flag is better. But for code efficiency, since once a condition is found, we can immediately print and exit.\n\nBut the code as written would work.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All three notes are same. For example, C C C. The code will check all permutations. For each, d1 is 0, d2 is 0. So no match. Output 'strange'.\n\nEdge case 2: Two notes same. For example, C C E. The code would check permutations. For example, C, C, E. d1 is 0, d2 is (E - C) =4 → no. Any permutation would not meet the conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: a major triad where the order is not the first permutation. For example, the input is E G C. The code would check permutations. One of them is E, G, C. d1 is G - E = 7-4=3 → no. But another permutation is C, E, G → which would be detected as major.\n\nSo the code would find it.\n\nAnother case: a minor triad. Let's say the input is B, C#, F. Which is the sample. The code would find the permutation B, C#, F → d1 is 3, d2 is 4 → minor.\n\nAnother example: a minor triad with different order. Let's say input is F, B, C#. The code would generate permutations. For example, B, C#, F → which is the same as before. So the code would find it.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code should be written as per the problem statement. The code reads from stdin, and writes to stdout.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut note that in Python, the input is read as a single line. For example, in the sample input given, the input is a list of three notes. So, for example, in the sample input given, the input is:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably not the actual input. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the input is a single line, e.g., for the first example, the input is \"C E G\" (without the quotes), and the output is \"major\".\n\nSo the code should read the input as:\n\nnotes_input = input().split()\n\nWhich would split the input into a list of three elements.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_num = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nnums = [note_to_num[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(nums):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, exit() may not be allowed. Well, in code submission, using sys.exit() is better, but in practice, the code can use return, but in a script, using exit() would work. However, in Python, exit() is from the sys module. So perhaps in some environments, it's better to use sys.exit(). However, the code as written may raise an error. For example, in a script, the exit() function may not be available. So perhaps replacing exit() with sys.exit().\n\nBut the code as written would require importing sys. However, the code as written may not work if the code is run in an environment where exit() is not available. So to make it more robust, perhaps using sys.exit().\n\nBut for the code to run, the code must import sys.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_num = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nnums = [note_to_num[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(nums):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting it with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: C E G → output 'major'.\n\nSample Input 2: C# B F → output 'minor'.\n\nSample Input 3: A B H → output 'strange'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: input is C# B F → which is the second sample. The code would generate permutations, and one of them is B, C#, F. Which gives d1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 = (5 -1) mod12 =4. So it prints 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: input is B C# F → same as above.\n\nAnother test case: input is E G C → the code would check permutations, and one of them is C, E, G → d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nAnother test case: input is C E G → same as before.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves converting the notes into numerical values based on their positions in the musical scale and checking all permutations of these values to see if they meet the criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numerical Values**: Convert each note to a numerical value based on its position in the sequence of 12 notes (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if it meets the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distances between consecutive notes in each permutation using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Determine Triad Type**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major triad (distance of 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones), print \"major\". If it meets the criteria for a minor triad (distance of 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones), print \"minor\". If no permutation meets either criteria, print \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_num = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nnums = [note_to_num[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(nums):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_num` dictionary maps each note to its corresponding numerical value based on its position in the musical scale.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of three notes, which are then converted to their numerical equivalents.\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three numerical values are generated.\n4. **Checking Distances**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale. If the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad, the corresponding result is printed immediately.\n5. **Final Check**: If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to determine the correct classification of the chord.",
