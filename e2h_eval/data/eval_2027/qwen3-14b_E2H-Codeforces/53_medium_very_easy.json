    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with the examples given. For instance, the input 'ababa' has substrings like 'aba' which appears twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4). So the output is 3. For 'zzz', the substrings of length 2 are 'zz' which appears multiple times, so output is 2.\n\nThe challenge is to find the maximum possible length of such a substring. The brute force approach would be to check all possible substrings for each possible length, starting from the maximum possible down to 1, and see if any of them appear at least twice.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. For a given string, iterate possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (which is len(s)//2, since if a substring is longer than half the length, it can't appear twice) down to 1.\n2. For each length L, generate all possible substrings of length L, check if any of them appears at least twice.\n3. Once found, return L as the answer.\n4. If no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nWait, but for example, the first sample input is 'abcd'. The maximum possible length is 2 (since len(abcd) is 4, len//2 is 2). But checking substrings of length 2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — none appear more than once. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the approach would be to start checking from the largest possible length downwards, and return the first length where there's a duplicate substring.\n\nNow, how do I generate all substrings of a certain length and check for duplicates?\n\nFor each length L, generate all substrings of length L, store them in a dictionary or a set, and check if any substring occurs more than once.\n\nBut for checking duplicates, perhaps using a set. For example, for each L, iterate through all possible starting indices (from 0 to len(s) - L), collect the substrings, and check if any of them appears more than once.\n\nWait, but how to check that? For example, for each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and then check if the count of any substring is >=2.\n\nSo for each L, we can do:\n\nsubstrings = [s[i:i+L] for i in range(len(s) - L + 1)]\n\nthen check if there's any element in this list that occurs at least twice.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nWe can use a set. For each substring in the list, check if it's already in a set. If yes, then return True for this L. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a frequency dictionary. But for the purpose of checking existence, the set approach is sufficient. Because once a substring is found again, we can immediately return that this L is valid.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nfor L in range(max_len, 0, -1):\n\n    create a set for substrings of length L\n\n    for each starting index i from 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr is already in the set, then return L as the answer\n\n        else add to the set\n\n    if after checking all substrings for this L, none are duplicates, proceed to next L.\n\nIf no L found, return 0.\n\nBut wait, for example, for the string 'aaaaa', the maximum L is 2 (since len(s) is 5, max L is floor(5/2) = 2?), but for L=2, there are multiple substrings of 'aa', so the answer would be 2. But actually, for L=3, the substring 'aaa' occurs multiple times. Wait, len(s) is 5, so for L=3, the possible substrings are 3 (indices 0,1,2). So for 'aaaaa', the substrings of length 3 are 'aaa' (positions 0-2), 'aaa' (positions 1-3), 'aaa' (positions 2-4). So they are all same. So the answer would be 3, which is larger than 2. So my initial idea of checking up to len(s)//2 is incorrect.\n\nWait, the maximum possible length of a substring that can appear at least twice is floor(len(s)/2). Wait, for example, if the string is of length 5, the maximum possible is 2? Because for a substring of length 3, you need two occurrences. The first occurrence takes 3 characters, the second occurrence needs 3 characters. So the minimal total length is 3 + 3 - overlap. But if the string is length 5, the maximum possible length of a substring that can appear twice is 2. Because for example, in 'aaaaa', the substring of length 2 appears 4 times. But for length 3, the first occurrence is positions 0-2, the next occurrence can be 1-3, etc. So the maximum possible length is len(s) - 1, but only if the string is all same characters. For example, in 'aaaaa', the maximum length is 4, but that's impossible because the substring of length 4 can appear only once. Wait, for a string of length 5, a substring of length 4 can occur once. So for it to appear twice, the string must be of length at least 4*2 - overlap. But for overlapping, the maximum possible is len(s) - 1. For example, in a string of length 5, the substring of length 4 can appear once, but if the string is 'aaaaa', then the substrings of length 4 are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3) and 'aaaa' (positions 1-4). So two occurrences. So for len(s) =5, the maximum possible L is 4. So the initial idea of checking from max_len = len(s)-1 down to 1 is better.\n\nSo the previous approach was wrong. The maximum possible L is len(s) -1. For example, in the case of 'ababa' (length 5), the maximum possible L is 4. But for L=4, the substrings are 'abab' (positions 0-3) and 'baba' (positions 1-4). So no duplicates. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo the correct way is to check for all possible L from len(s)-1 down to 1. For each L, check if there are two occurrences of the same substring.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nFor the given string s:\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    check all substrings of length L. If any occurs at least twice, return L.\n\nOnce we find the first such L, return it. Else, return 0.\n\nThis approach will cover all possibilities.\n\nNow, the question is, for each L, how to check if there's a duplicate substring.\n\nSo for each L, we can generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut for that, we can use a set. For each substring in the list, if we see it again, then return True.\n\nSo, for example, for L=3 in 'ababa':\n\nsubstrings are:\n\n0-2: aba\n\n1-3: bab\n\n2-4: aba\n\nSo when processing the first 'aba', add to the set. Then when processing the third substring (which is also 'aba'), we check if it's already in the set, which it is. So return True.\n\nThus, the code for checking a particular L is:\n\ndef has_duplicate(L, s):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            return True\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\n    return False\n\nSo for each L, we check this function. If returns True, then return L as the answer.\n\nNow, the code structure would be:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nThen, for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    if has_duplicate(L, s):\n\n        return L\n\nreturn 0\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the same substring appears more than once, but not overlapping? For example, 'aaaaa' with L=4. The substrings are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3) and 'aaaa' (positions 1-4). So the code will detect that.\n\nYes, because when the code checks for the second substring (positions 1-4), it's already in the set (from the first occurrence?), no. Wait, the first occurrence is 0-3, which is 'aaaa'. Then when i=1, substr is s[1:5], which is 'aaaa' (since s is 'aaaaa'). So the code checks substr in seen. The first substr is added to the set. Then, when i=1, substr is 'aaaa', which is in the set. So returns True. Thus, the code will return L=4 for 'aaaaa'.\n\nSo this code seems to work.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is a string, but the sample input shows something like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] — but that's probably a mistake. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as the first line containing the string. But the sample input shows something like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] — but perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different strings. Oh, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases. Like, for example, the sample input is three separate test cases, each of which is a string, and the outputs are 0, 3, 2 respectively.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list, but in reality, the code should read one string from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nSo the code should read one line from input, which is the string. For example, in the sample input, perhaps the user input is 'ababa', and the output is 3.\n\nBut the sample input shows ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] — which may be a mistake. Maybe the sample input is a list of test cases. However, the code should read a single string from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one string, not multiple. So the sample input is probably a typo, and the actual input is one string per test case.\n\nSo for the code, the input is a single string, and the output is the number as per the problem.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the input string from stdin. For example, using input().strip().\n\nThen process that string.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: string of length 1. Then, no possible substring can appear twice. Output is 0.\n\nCase 2: string of length 2. For example, 'aa' → the substring of length 1 is 'a' which appears twice. So the answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → no duplicates. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: 'aaa' → for L=2, substrings are 'aa' (positions 0-1) and 'aa' (positions 1-2). So returns 2.\n\nSo the code would handle that.\n\nNow, the code structure in Python:\n\nRead the string s.\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    if check for duplicates:\n\n        return L\n\nreturn 0\n\nBut how to implement the check.\n\nImplementing the check as a helper function.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nSample code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but for the case where L is 1, and the string has multiple same characters. For example, 'aaa', then for L=1, the substrings are 'a', 'a', 'a' — so the code would check for the first occurrence, then the second occurrence, and return 1.\n\nBut for the code, when L is 1, the loop runs for i in 0 to n - L + 1 (i.e., 0 to 3-1+1 = 3, but for n=3, L=1, n-L+1 is 3-1+1=3. So i ranges from 0 to 2 inclusive. So 3 elements.\n\nSo the code would check for each substr of length 1. The first two substrings are 'a' and 'a', so the code would return 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut the code for the sample input 'zzz' would process L=2 first. For L=2, the substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). So during the first iteration, the code checks substr 'zz' not in the set, adds it. Then for i=1, substr is 'zz', which is in the set. So returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example, 'ababa' (length 5). For L=4, the substrings are 'abab' (i=0), 'baba' (i=1). No duplicates. Then L=3. Substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). When i=2, substr is 'aba' which is already in the set (from i=0). So returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears more than once but with overlapping? Like 'aaaaa' for L=4. The code would check substrings 'aaaa' (i=0) and 'aaaa' (i=1). The code returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → len is 4. The loop starts with L=3. For L=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bcd' → no duplicates. Then L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no duplicates. Then L=1: check for 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' → no duplicates. So output is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → output 3. Which is correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → output 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → output 4.\n\nAnother test case: 'aa' → output 1.\n\nAnother test case: 'a' → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'abab' → for L=3, substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1). No duplicates. For L=2: 'ab', 'ba', 'ab' → when i=0: 'ab' added. i=1: 'ba' added. i=2: 'ab' is in the set. So returns 2. So output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input string, and output the correct value.\n\nNow, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the string, then loop as above.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function may not be the best. Alternatively, we can break and return.\n\nBut in code, for the purposes of the problem, once we find the first L, we can print and exit.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the code to handle all cases, including when the string is empty. But according to the problem statement, the string is non-empty.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, this should solve the problem.\n",
