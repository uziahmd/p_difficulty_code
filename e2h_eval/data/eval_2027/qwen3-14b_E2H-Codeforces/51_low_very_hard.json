Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is to take the first two strings (guest and host), concatenate them, then check if the third string (pile) is a permutation of that concatenated string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to count the frequency of each character in the combined guest+host string, and compare it with the frequency in the pile string.\n\nFor example, for each character in the combined string, we count how many times it appears. Then do the same for the pile. If all counts match, then output YES, else NO.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string, let's call it combined.\n3. Check if the length of combined is equal to the length of the pile. If not, immediately return NO.\n4. Else, compare the frequency counts of each character in combined and pile.\n\nBut how to compare the frequencies? Well, in Python, we can use the collections.Counter class. But since the problem says that all letters are uppercase, we don't have to worry about case.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # compare Counter(combined) and Counter(pile)\n    # if they are equal, print YES else NO\n\nBut wait, what about when the lengths are equal but the counts differ? Like, for example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AA\". The combined length is 2, pile length is 2. But counts are different. So the code would catch that.\n\nYes, so using Counter would work here.\n\nBut in Python, comparing two Counters directly would check if all counts are the same. So Counter(combined) == Counter(pile) ?\n\nYes. So the code would be something like:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nThen, in the else part:\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each element. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about if there are letters in the pile that are not in the combined string? For example, combined is \"ABC\" (length 3), pile is \"ABD\" (length 3). Then Counter would have different counts. So yes, the code would catch that.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's see the letters. Then the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check the length. Let's see:\n\nLength of guest: len(\"SANTACLAUS\") is 10 letters. Host: len(\"DEDMOROZ\") is 8 letters. Combined length is 18. Pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" — let me count. Let's see:\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS — perhaps 18 letters. So the lengths match. Then the Counter would check if all letters are present in the same counts.\n\nIn the first sample, the answer is YES.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL\nHost: JOULUPUKKI\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's count the letters. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's check the length. Let me calculate:\n\nGuest length: len(\"PAPAINOEL\") is 9. Host: len(\"JOULUPUKKI\") is 10. Combined is 19 letters. The pile is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" — let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile. Let me think: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count letters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nWait, maybe the length is 19? Let me check:\n\nOriginal guest and host: 9 + 10 = 19. The pile's length is 19?\n\nBut according to the sample output, the answer is NO",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Concatenation**: Combine the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Length Check**: If the length of the combined string does not match the length of the pile, immediately return \"NO\" since they cannot be permutations of each other.\n4. **Character Frequency Comparison**: Use a frequency counter to compare the characters in the combined string with those in the pile. If both have the same frequency of each character, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` to handle the three lines efficiently.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into one string to check against the pile.\n- **Length Check**: A quick check ensures that the lengths of the combined string and the pile are equal. If not, it's impossible for them to be permutations.\n- **Counter Comparison**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile. If these counters match exactly, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the required conditions using a frequency comparison, ensuring correctness and optimal performance given the constraints.",
