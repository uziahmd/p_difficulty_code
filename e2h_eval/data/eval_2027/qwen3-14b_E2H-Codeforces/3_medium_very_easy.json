Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. The key idea is probably to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would be the point that requires the largest d to cover.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. But since the lantern covers up to d, then the left end (0) would be covered if a1 - d <= 0. So d needs to be at least a1. Similarly for the right end: if the last lantern is at a_n, then the distance from a_n to l is l - a_n. So d must be at least that. \n\nSo the steps might be:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in order.\n2. Check the distance between the first lantern and 0. That's one candidate for max gap.\n3. Check the distance between the last lantern and l. Another candidate.\n4. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair, the gap is (current - previous). The maximum of these gaps divided by 2 would be the required d for that gap. Because the worst case is the middle of the gap, which is (gap)/2 away from each lantern.\n\nSo the overall minimum d is the maximum between the first part (distance from start to first lantern), the last part (distance from last lantern to end), and the maximum (gap/2) between consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose two consecutive lanterns are at positions a and b, with a < b. The gap between them is (b - a). The maximum distance from any point in this interval to the nearest lantern would be (b - a)/2. Because the midpoint between a and b is (a + b)/2. The distance from this midpoint to either lantern is (b - a)/2. So for this gap, the required d is (b - a)/2. \n\nSo yes, the maximum of all these values (the first distance, the last distance, and all the gaps divided by two) will be the minimal d needed.\n\nSo the algorithm steps would be:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance from 0 to the first lantern. Let's call this first_dist.\n- Compute the end distance from last lantern to l. Call it last_dist.\n- Compute the max gap between consecutive lanterns. For each consecutive pair, compute the difference, then take the maximum of these differences.\n- The required d is the maximum between first_dist, last_dist, and (max_gap / 2).\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1. Then the first_dist is a[0], the last_dist is l - a[0]. The max_gap between consecutive lanterns is zero (since there's only one). So the maximum between first_dist, last_dist, and 0. So the answer would be the maximum of those two. Which makes sense.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. When sorted, they are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nFirst_dist is 0 - 0 = 0. Last_dist is 15 - 15 = 0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns are:\n\n3-0 =3 → 3/2=1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nSo the max gap is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the maximum between 0, 0, 2.5 → 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input: 2 5, positions 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5]. \n\nFirst_dist is 2 - 0 = 2. Last_dist is 5 -5 =0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum between 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: if the lanterns are at 0 and l. Then the first_dist is 0, last_dist is 0, and the gap between them is l, so l/2. So the answer is l/2.\n\nAnother case: if the lanterns are at 0 and 3, and l is 5. Then first_dist is 0, last_dist is 5-3=2. The gap between 0 and 3 is 3, so 1.5. So the max is 2. So answer is 2.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nSort the array of ai.\n\nCompute first_dist as a[0] - 0.0? Or wait, no. Wait, the first lantern's position is a[0], and the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. But the lantern's coverage is d. So for 0 to be covered, d must be >= a[0] - 0.0? No, because the lantern is at a[0], and the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. So the lantern's coverage must reach 0, so d must be at least a[0]. Because the lantern covers up to d from itself. So if the lantern is at a[0], then the left end (0) is covered if d >= a[0] - 0. So yes, the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0], so d must be at least that. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo for the first part, the distance is a[0], and for the last part, it's l - a[-1].\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute first_dist = a[0]\n\nlast_dist = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = max( a[i+1] - a[i] for i in 0..n-2 )\n\nthen the answer is the maximum between first_dist, last_dist, and max_gap / 2.\n\nBut wait, in the case where the first lantern is not at 0. For example, if the first lantern is at 3, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 3. So d must be at least 3. Because the lantern can't cover beyond its position. So the left end (0) is exactly at distance 3 from the lantern. So d must be >= 3. Similarly for the right end.\n\nSo yes, the first_dist and last_dist are as mentioned.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute first_dist = a[0] (but wait, if a[0] is 0, then first_dist is zero, which is correct.)\n\nCompute last_dist = l - a[-1]\n\nCompute max_gap between consecutive elements.\n\nThen the answer is the maximum of first_dist, last_dist, max_gap / 2.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort it.\n\nBut wait, the input for the first example is given as:\n\nThe first line is '7 15' and the next line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'. So when split, the list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, it becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nThen compute first_dist = a[0], last_dist = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nthen d = max( first_dist, last_dist, max_gap / 2 )\n\nThen print d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1?\n\nLike n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then first_dist is 3, last_dist is 5-3=2. max_gap is 0. So the maximum is 3. So the answer is 3. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. Then first_dist is 2, last_dist is 0. max_gap is 3. So max(2, 0, 1.5) is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then first_dist is 0, last_dist is 0, max_gap is 10. So max(0, 0, 5) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the output. The problem says that the answer must be printed with enough decimal digits, such that absolute or relative error is within 1e-9. So we need to print it with sufficient decimal digits. For example, in the sample outputs, they have 10 decimal digits. So in Python, we can format the output as a float with 10 decimal places.\n\nBut in Python, when using floating points, sometimes precision can be an issue. However, since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, using floating point calculations should be okay.\n\nBut for the maximum gap, when we compute max_gap / 2, we need to make sure that it's calculated accurately. However, since all the a_i are integers, the max_gap is an integer. So dividing by 2 would give a float that can be represented exactly if it's a .5 value, but for others, perhaps not. However, in Python, when you do division, it's handled as a float, which has enough precision for this problem.\n\nSo the code:\n\nOnce we compute the maximum d as described, we can print it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead input, sort, compute the three values, take the maximum, and print with 10 decimals.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the output is 2.5000000000. Which is exactly 2.5. So the code would compute that as 2.5, and when formatted with 10 decimals, it would show as such.\n\nNow, in Python, to print with 10 decimal digits, we can use the format string like '%.10f' % d, but we have to be careful with floating point numbers. However, since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, using the '%.10f' format should be acceptable. However, in some cases, for example, when the actual value is something like 2.5, the format would show 2.5000000000, which is correct.\n\nSo the code:\n\nAfter computing the maximum d, print it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i.\n\nBut wait, in the input, the second line is the list of a_i. For example, in the first sample input, the second line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which is split into 7 integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nif n == 0:\n\n    # but according to constraints, n >=1\n\nfirst_dist = a[0]\n\nlast_dist = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nd = max(first_dist, last_dist, max_gap / 2)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but in Python, when you have integers, for example, when max_gap is 5, then 5/2 is 2.5, which is a float. So that's correct.\n\nBut for cases where the max_gap is even, like 4, then 4/2 is 2.0, which is correct.\n\nBut what if the max_gap is 3? Then 3/2 is 1.5, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nsorted a is [2,5]\n\nfirst_dist is 2, last_dist is 5-5=0.\n\nmax_gap is 5-2=3. So max_gap/2 is 1.5. The maximum between 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. So output is 2.0000000000. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then first_dist is 5, last_dist is 5. max_gap is 0. So d is 5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then first_dist is 0, last_dist is 0, max_gap is 10. So d is 5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then first_dist is 0, last_dist is 0. max_gap is 5. So max_gap/2 is 2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nBut if the street is l=10, and lanterns at 0, 3, 10. Then first_dist is 0, last_dist is 0. max_gap is 7 (between 3 and 10). So 7/2=3.5. So the answer is 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about cases where the lanterns are not sorted? Well, the code sorts them, so that's handled.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nCase 1: All lanterns are at 0. For example, n=3, l=5, a=[0,0,0]. Then sorted a is [0,0,0]. first_dist is 0, last_dist is 5-0=5. max_gap is 0. So d is max(0,5, 0) → 5. Which is correct. Because the lanterns are at 0, and the end of the street is 5. So the radius needs to be 5 to cover the end.\n\nCase 2: Lanterns are at 0 and l. So for example, n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then the max_gap is 10, so d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=0. Wait, but according to the input constraints, l is at least 1. So no, l is 1<= l <=1e9. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1. a=[0]. Then first_dist is 0, last_dist is 1-0=1. So d is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1. a=[1]. Then first_dist is 1, last_dist is 0. So d is 1. Correct.\n\nSo code handles all these cases.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut note that in the input, the second line may have n numbers. So for example, in the first sample input, the second line is \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\", which has 7 numbers, which is equal to n=7.\n\nSo the code reads that correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort.\n\nCompute first_dist, last_dist, max_gap.\n\nCompute d.\n\nPrint with 10 decimals.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nfirst_dist = a[0]\nlast_dist = l - a[-1]\nmax_gap = 0\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    if gap > max_gap:\n        max_gap = gap\nd = max(first_dist, last_dist, max_gap / 2)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but what about when the first_dist is 0? For example, if the first lantern is at 0. Then the first_dist is 0, which is correct. Because the lantern covers from 0 -d to 0 +d. So for the street's start (0) to be covered, d must be >=0. Which is always true. But the code is considering the first_dist as a[0], which is 0. So the maximum between 0, ... etc. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: if the first lantern is at 0, and the next is at 3. Then the first_dist is 0, the gap is 3, so max_gap is 3. So the required d is max(0, ... , 3/2=1.5). Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nfirst_dist = 0, last_dist = 15 - 15 = 0.\n\nmax_gap is 14-9=5 (between 9 and 14?), no:\n\nWait, the sorted list is 0,3,5,7,9,14,15. So the consecutive gaps are:\n\n3-0=3\n\n5-3=2\n\n7-5=2\n\n9-7=2\n\n14-9=5\n\n15-14=1.\n\nSo max_gap is 5. So d is max(0, 0, 5/2=2.5) → 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nfirst_dist is 2, last_dist is 5-5=0. max_gap is 3. So d is max(2, 0, 1.5) → 2.0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case where the max_gap is between two lanterns.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given their positions. The key insight is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns and ensure that the radius covers both the ends of the street and the largest gap between any two consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Distances from Ends**: Compute the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Determine Maximum Gap**: Calculate the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns after sorting their positions.\n4. **Compute Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius required is the maximum value among the distances from the ends of the street and half of the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. This ensures that all parts of the street are covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nfirst_dist = a[0]\nlast_dist = l - a[-1]\nmax_gap = 0\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    if gap > max_gap:\n        max_gap = gap\nd = max(first_dist, last_dist, max_gap / 2)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting the positions of the lanterns allows us to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Distance from Ends**: The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street are critical because these areas might not be covered by adjacent lanterns.\n3. **Maximum Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted positions, we determine the largest gap between any two consecutive lanterns. The radius must be at least half of this gap to ensure the entire gap is illuminated.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The required radius is the maximum of the distances from the ends of the street and half the maximum gap between lanterns. This ensures all parts of the street are covered with the minimum possible radius.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the solution is computed in linear time after sorting, making it optimal for the given constraints.",
