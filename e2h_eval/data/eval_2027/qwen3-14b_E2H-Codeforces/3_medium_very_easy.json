Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l.\n\nHmm. So the approach here is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance between them, then divide that by two. Because if two lanterns are placed with a certain distance apart, the minimal radius needed to cover the area between them would be half of that distance. But wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if a lantern is at the start (0), then the first part is covered up to some point. Similarly for the end.\n\nWait, right. Let me think. For example, if there's a lantern at position a_i and the next one at a_j (sorted order), then the middle point between them is (a_j - a_i)/2. The maximum of these values across all consecutive pairs would be the required d. But also, we have to check the beginning and the end. Like, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is something. Similarly for the end.\n\nWait, for example, if the first lantern is at position x, then the distance from 0 to x is x. So the radius needs to be at least x, because otherwise the area from 0 to x - d would not be covered. Wait, no. Because the lantern's light covers up to d distance from it. So if the first lantern is at x, then the leftmost point it can cover is x - d. To cover the start of the street (0), we need x - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ x. Similarly, for the end, if the last lantern is at y, then the rightmost point it can cover is y + d. To cover l, we need y + d ≥ l → d ≥ l - y.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the first lantern to 0, and from the last lantern to l. These are initial candidates for d.\n3. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair, compute the gap (a[i+1] - a[i]), divide by 2. The maximum of these values is another candidate.\n4. The answer is the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nYes. Because for the gaps between two consecutive lanterns, the worst case is the middle point between them. So the required radius is half the gap. For example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then the middle is 2 units away from each. So d needs to be at least 2 to cover the entire area between them.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSort the array. Then compute:\n\nmax_d = max( (a[0] - 0), (l - a[-1]) )\n\nThen for each i from 0 to n-2:\n\ngap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent_max = gap / 2\n\nif current_max > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nFinally, return max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1. Then the max_d would be max( a[0], l - a[0] ), which is correct. Because the lantern has to cover from 0 to l. So the radius needs to be the maximum between a[0] (distance from 0 to lantern) and l - a[0] (distance from lantern to end). So that's handled.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the input.\n\nThe input is given as two lines. First line is n and l. Second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the example given, the first input is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0'. So after splitting, the list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. Then when sorted, it becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then the first check is a[0] (0) - 0 is 0. The last check is l (15) - a[-1] (15) is 0. Then the gaps between consecutive elements are 3-0=3 → 1.5, 5-3=2 → 1, 7-5=2 →1, 9-7=2 →1, 14-9=5 →2.5, 15-14=1 →0.5. So the maximum of these is 2.5, which is the answer. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: input is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted is [2,5]. The first check is 2 - 0 = 2. The last check is 5 - 5 = 0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which is the sample output. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works for these cases.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them. Then compute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]). Then loop through consecutive elements, compute the gap, divide by 2, and compare to max_d. Finally, output max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? No, the constraints say n ≥1. Because input says 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l. Then read list of a_i. Sort them. Compute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]). Then for i from 0 to len(a)-2, compute gap between a[i+1] and a[i], divide by 2. Compare with max_d. Take the maximum. Then output with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead input. For example, the first line is split into n and l. Then the second line is split into list of integers.\n\nBut note that in the sample input, the first input line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which would be split into n=7, l=15, and the list [15,5,3,7,9,14,0].\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but for the first sample, the max_d is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the lanterns are at 0 and l? For example, n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 5-5=0) →0. Then the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: if the lanterns are at 0 and 3, and l=5. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 5-3=2). Then the gap between 0 and 3 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max is 2. So the answer is 2. Which is correct. Because the lantern at 3 needs to cover up to 5, so d must be 2 (since 3 + 2 =5).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the first part, it's max(a[0], l - a[-1]). But a[0] is the first lantern's position. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0] - 0 = a[0]. But the required d is that value. Because the lantern's coverage starts at a[0] -d. To cover 0, a[0] -d <=0 → d >= a[0]. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, test the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. a[0] is 2, so max(2, 5-5=0) →2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So max_d remains 2. So output is 2.0000000000. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) →5. So the answer is 5.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then initial max is max(0, 10-10=0) →0. The gaps between 0 and5 is 5/2=2.5, between 5 and 10 is 5/2=2.5. So max_d is 2.5. Which is correct. Because each lantern covers up to 2.5 distance. So 0's coverage is up to 2.5, 5's covers from 2.5 to 7.5, and 10's covers from 7.5 to 10. So the entire street is covered.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code formatting: the output needs to have 10 decimal digits. So using Python's string formatting with .10f.\n\nBut in Python, when you print a float with .10f, it will show 10 decimal digits, even if trailing zeros. For example, 2.5 becomes 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, handling the input. Wait, the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line has n and l. The second line has n integers. So for each test case, the code reads two lines. But in the sample input, there are two examples. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output the answer. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and l. The next line contains n integers. So the code should process a single test case. But in the sample input, there are two examples given. However, that's probably for illustrating the problem. The actual input for the code is a single test case. Because in programming competition problems, each test case is processed once.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows two examples. But in reality, the code is supposed to read one input. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich is one test case. The second example's input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nWhich is another test case. But the code is supposed to read from stdin, which in programming competition problems would be one test case per run. So the code should process one test case.\n\nSo the code is correct as written.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead n and l from first line, then read the list of a_i. Sort, compute max_d as described, and print with 10 decimals.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can light up a segment of length `2d` around its position. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are initial candidates for the minimum radius.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the gap between them and determine the radius required to cover the midpoint of this gap. The maximum of these values will be considered.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required minimum radius is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the endpoints and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    \n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in easily calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Endpoint Check**: The first lantern's position from the start and the last lantern's position from the end are checked to ensure the entire street is covered from both ends.\n- **Gap Calculation**: For each gap between consecutive lanterns, the radius required to cover the midpoint of the gap is calculated as half the gap length. This ensures that the entire segment between two consecutive lanterns is illuminated.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum radius required by considering all critical points on the street, ensuring optimal coverage with minimal radius.",
