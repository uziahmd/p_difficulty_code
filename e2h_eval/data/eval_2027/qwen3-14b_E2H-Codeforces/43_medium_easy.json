He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is: A starts with some number of 'a's. Then B adds some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C adds 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the count of 'c's could be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the final string must have all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters must be all a's, followed by all b's, followed by all c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. For example, if there's a 'c' before some 'b's, that's impossible.\n\nSo first, I need to check the order of the string. The string should consist of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So any deviation from this order (like a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b', etc.) would make it invalid.\n\nSo first step: check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. How to do that?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and check that once a 'b' is encountered, there are no more 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there are no more 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into parts. For example, the first part is all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So the counts of a, b, c can be determined by their positions.\n\nOnce the order is correct, then we need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts. Let's say the counts are:\n\ncount_a = number of a's\n\ncount_b = number of b's\n\ncount_c = number of c's\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\n- The original string from A has some a's. Let's say count_a_initial = count_a. Then B appends some b's. So count_b_initial is count_b. But after that, when C appends the c's, the count of c's must be equal to either count_a_initial or count_b_initial. Wait, no. Wait, when C appends the c's, the count of c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the string at that time. Wait, the string at that time is the a's + b's. So the count of a's is count_a_initial, and the count of b's is count_b_initial. So the count_c must be equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nBut in the final string, count_c is the number of c's added by C. So the total count of c's is exactly equal to either count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nBut count_a_initial is the number of a's in the entire string (since A's original string was all a's, and then B added b's, then C added c's. So the total a's is count_a_initial. Similarly for b's. So the count of c's must be equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nWait, but the count of a's in the string is count_a_initial. The count of b's is count_b_initial. So the count of c's must be equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nSo for the string to be valid:\n\n1. The order must be all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n2. The count of c's must be equal to count_a or count_b (the counts of a and b in the entire string).\n\nAdditionally, since B made sure that there is at least one a and one b. So count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. Because the original string from A had some a's (so count_a >=1), and B added some b's (so count_b >=1). Also, since C added c's, the count_c must be >=1? No. Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. So the number of c's could be zero? No, because the problem says \"some number of letters\". Wait, the problem says \"some number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\nWait, but the problem says that C appends some number of letters. So the count of c's must be equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. Which could be zero? No, because count_a_initial is the number of a's in the original string. Since A's original string had some a's (count_a_initial >=1), and B added some b's (count_b_initial >=1). So the count_c is equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. So count_c must be at least 1. Because count_a_initial is at least 1, and count_b_initial is at least 1. So the count_c is at least 1. Therefore, the total string must have at least one c as well. Wait, but the problem says that C appends some number of letters. So the count of c's is equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. So, for example, if count_a_initial is 2, and count_b_initial is 3, then C appends either 2 or 3 c's. So the count_c is at least 1. So the total string must have at least one c. But the problem says that the input string may have any number of letters, but the original process requires that the string has at least one a, one b, and one c. Because C appends some number of c's, which is at least 1? Or not?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.\" So when B gives the string to C, it has at least one a and one b. Then C appends some number of c's. So the final string will have at least one a, one b, and one c (since C appends some number of c's, which is at least 1? Or can it be zero? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So \"some number\" implies that it's at least one? Or maybe zero? Well, in programming problems, sometimes \"some number\" can include zero. But in this case, the problem says that C appends some number of letters. However, the note says that in the third example, the input is 'aabc', which has 2 a's, 1 b, 1 c. So the count of c's is 1, which equals the count of b's (1). So in that case, C added 1 c. So the count of c's is 1. So the problem says that the count of c's is equal to the count of a's (or b's) in the string before adding the c's. So the count of c's is equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. Which are both at least 1. So the count_c must be at least 1. Therefore, the input string must have at least one c. So if the input string has no c's, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, putting all together, the conditions are:\n\n- The string must consist of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the order is correct.\n\n- The count of c's must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\n- Also, the count of a's must be at least 1, count of b's at least 1, count of c's at least 1.\n\nBut wait, since the original string from A has at least one a, and B appends at least one b, then the count of a and b in the string before C adds the c's is at least 1. Then C adds some number of c's (at least 1). So the final string must have count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1. So the input string must have at least one of each. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nSo, for example, if the input string is 'aabb', then there are no c's. So it's invalid.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\nFirst, check that the string is in the form a*b*c*.\n\nThen, check that the counts of a, b, c are all >=1.\n\nThen, check that the count of c's is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to check the order?\n\nFor example, in the string 'aaabccc', the order is a's, then b's, then c's. So valid.\n\nIn 'bbacc', the order is b's, then a's, then c's. Which is invalid. Because after the initial a's (which are none here), there's a b, then an a. So the order is wrong.\n\nSo to check the order, we can iterate through the string and ensure that once a 'b' is encountered, there are no more 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there are no more 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nSo for the string S:\n\nWe can track the allowed characters. Initially, allowed is 'a'. Once a 'b' is found, allowed becomes 'b' and 'c'? No. Wait, the order must be all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So the first part is a's. Then comes the b's. Then comes the c's.\n\nSo the first transition is from a to b. Once a b is found, the rest of the string can't have a's. Then, once a c is found, the rest can't have a's or b's.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be split into three parts:\n\n- All a's (possibly zero length? No, because the count of a's must be at least 1. Wait, no. Because the original string from A has some a's, so count_a >=1. So the string must have at least one a. Similarly for b and c. So the string must have at least one a, one b, one c. So in the input string, if any of the counts is zero, it's invalid.\n\nSo during the order check, we can also check that the string has at least one a, one b, one c. But perhaps that's redundant with the other checks.\n\nBut for the order check, let's think. For example, if the string is 'aabcc', then the order is correct. But if it's 'aabbc', then the order is correct. But if it's 'abacb', then the order is invalid.\n\nSo, to check the order:\n\nWe can iterate through the string, and check that the characters are non-decreasing in terms of their order (a < b < c). So each character must be >= the previous one. Because once you have a 'b', you can't have an 'a' after. Once you have a 'c', you can't have 'a' or 'b' after.\n\nSo, for example, the string 'aabbcc' is okay. The string 'abac' is invalid because after the first 'a', 'b', then 'a' comes again.\n\nSo, the code can check that for each i from 1 to len(S)-1, S[i] >= S[i-1]. But that's only if the string is in order a's followed by b's followed by c's. Because for example, 'aabbcc' would have each character >= the previous. But 'aabbc' would have each character >= previous. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code can check that the string is non-decreasing in the order a, b, c. So that's a way to check the order.\n\nSo, for the order check, the code can check that the string is in non-decreasing order. But also, the characters can only be a, b, c. Which they are, according to the problem statement.\n\nSo, for example, the string 'abba' would not be non-decreasing. So it's invalid.\n\nSo, that's the first check. Then, the counts of a, b, c must be at least 1. Then, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFirst, check that the string is non-decreasing (each character is >= previous). If not, return NO.\n\nThen, check that the counts of a, b, c are all >= 1. If any is zero, return NO.\n\nThen, check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. If yes, return YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the count of c's being equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. But count_a_initial is the count of a's in the string, since the original string from A was all a's, and B added b's. So the count of a's in the string is count_a_initial. Similarly for count_b_initial. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. So that's the check.\n\nSo, for example, the sample input:\n\nFirst example: aaabccc. The counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. So count_c is 3, which equals count_a (3). So valid. Output YES.\n\nSecond example: bbacc. The string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The order is not non-decreasing. Because the third character is 'a' which is less than the previous 'b'. So the order check fails. So output NO.\n\nThird example: aabc. The counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. The order is a, a, b, c. Which is non-decreasing. All counts are >=1. count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So valid. Output YES.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbcc' → counts a:2, b:2, c:2. So count_c is 2, which equals count_a or count_b. So valid. Output YES.\n\nAnother example: 'abcc' → a:1, b:1, c:2. count_c is 2. Is 2 equal to a (1) or b (1)? No. So output NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abbbc' → a:1, b:3, c:1. count_c is 1, which equals a's count. So valid. Output YES.\n\nAnother example: 'abc' → counts a:1, b:1, c:1. count_c is 1, which equals a or b. So valid. Output YES.\n\nWhat about 'aabcc'? a:2, b:1, c:2. count_c is 2, which equals a's count (2). So valid. Output YES.\n\nNow, what about a string that has a's followed by c's followed by b's? Like 'aaccbb'? The order check would fail because after the c's, there are b's, which are less than c. So the string is not non-decreasing. So output NO.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead the string.\n\nCheck if the string is non-decreasing. How?\n\nLoop through each character from index 1 to end, check if current character is >= previous.\n\nIf any violation, return NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nIf any of them is zero, return NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b. If yes, return YES, else NO.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck order:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        invalid, return NO.\n\nThen, count a, b, c.\n\nif count_a ==0 or count_b ==0 or count_c ==0 → return NO.\n\nelse check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b → yes else no.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the note says that in the second example, the order is not correct. For example, 'bbacc' → the order is b, b, a, c, c. The third character is a, which is less than previous (b). So the order check would catch that.\n\nSo code:\n\nImplement that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead S from input.\n\nThen:\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n\n    # check order\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    # check counts\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a ==0 or count_b ==0 or count_c ==0:\n\n        return False\n\n    return (count_c == count_a) or (count_c == count_b)\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'? The counts are a=2, b=2, c=2. So count_c is 2, which equals a and b. So returns True. Correct.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → the counts are a=1, b=1, c=0. So returns False. Because count_c is zero.\n\nBut according to the problem, the string must have at least one of each. So that's handled.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, test the examples.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts a=3, b=1, c=3. Check order: a a a b c c c → yes. counts are all non-zero. c is 3 equals a (3). So returns YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order is b, b, a, c, c → during the loop, i=2 (third character) is 'a' which is less than previous 'b' → returns false. So output is NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is a a b c → yes. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. c equals b (1). So returns YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=2. c is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabb' → no c. returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → order is a a b b a a c c → during the loop, when i=4, the character is 'a' which is less than previous 'b' → invalid. So returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcc' → valid. counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=4. So returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaabccc' → count a=4, b=1, c=3. c is 3, which is not equal to a (4) or b (1). So returns NO.\n\nSo code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input string. For example, the input is given as a list, but in the problem statement, the input is a single string. Wait, the input is given as a string. Wait, the input is given as a single line. The sample input shows something like ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'] but that's probably for the example. The actual input is a single string.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S. So for the code, the input is a single string.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user shows a list of strings, but that's probably for the example of multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. So the code should read a single string.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nBut this is probably for the example of multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read a single string. However, in the sample input, there are three test cases. But that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo for example, the sample input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps the actual input is a single string. But the sample input shows that the code is given a list of strings. But that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 5000). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo the input is a single string. The sample input shows a list of strings, but that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple test cases, but in reality, the code must read a single string and output a single YES or NO.\n\nBut in the sample input and output, the user shows that for example, the input is ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], and output is ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']. But that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Because the code is supposed to process a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's confusing.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code must read a single string and output a single answer.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the first example is 'aaabccc', which outputs 'YES'.\n\nSo, the code should read a single string from stdin, process it, and output YES or NO.\n\nTherefore, the code would be:\n\nRead the input string S from stdin.\n\nThen perform the checks as discussed.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead the input string, check the order, counts, etc.\n\nSo, the code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef check(s):\n\n    # check order\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    # check counts\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n\n        return False\n\n    return count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b\n\nif check(s):\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 'aaabccc' → check order: yes. counts a=3, b=1, c=3. So returns True. Output YES.\n\nSample input 2: 'bbacc' → during the order check, the third character is 'a' which is less than previous 'b' → returns False. So output NO.\n\nSample input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. c equals b → returns True. Output YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → returns True. Output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → count_c is zero → returns False. Output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcc' → returns True. Output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → order check fails (after the first two a's, then two b's, then a's again). So returns False.\n\nAnother case: 'abba' → order check fails.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=2. c is not equal to a or b → returns False. Output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abbc' → counts a=1, b=2, c=1. c equals a → returns True. Output YES.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'c'? Well, the code would check the order (no problem, since it's a single character). Then count_a is 0, count_b is 0, count_c is 1. So returns False. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'a' → same as above. returns False.\n\nAnother case: 'b' → same. returns False.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → order is a then c. counts a=1, b=0, c=1. So returns False.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by appending 'b's to a string of 'a's, followed by appending 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string. The string must follow a specific order and meet certain count conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Order Check**: The string must be in non-decreasing order of characters, i.e., all 'a's followed by all 'b's followed by all 'c's. This ensures that the string was formed by appending characters in the specified order.\n2. **Count Check**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. This ensures that the initial conditions set by A and B are met.\n3. **C Count Check**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string. This ensures that C appended the correct number of 'c's as per the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n    # Check if the string is non-decreasing\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    # Count the occurrences of each character\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    # Check if all counts are at least 1\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        return False\n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    return count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b\n\nif is_valid(s):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The loop iterates through the string to ensure that each character is not less than the previous one. This ensures the string follows the order of 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's.\n2. **Count Check**: We use the `count` method to determine the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. If any of these counts are zero, the string cannot be valid as it must contain at least one of each character.\n3. **C Count Check**: Finally, we check if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If it does, the string meets the criteria set by the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limit of the input size.",
