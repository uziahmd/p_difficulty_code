Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the minimum radius d that the lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment around it with radius d. We need to find the minimal d such that all points on the street are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the radius needs to cover that gap. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have two adjacent lanterns at positions a and b. The distance between them is (b - a). The worst case for coverage is the middle of this gap. Because each lantern can cover up to d distance. So for the middle point of the gap, the distance from each lantern is (b - a)/2. So the required d must be at least (b - a)/2. But wait, that's only if the lanterns are placed in a way that their coverage areas just touch each other. But if the gap is larger than that, then the middle point would not be covered.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the entire street must be covered. So the first thing to do is to sort the lantern positions. Because the lanterns might not be given in order. So the first step is to sort the array of ai's.\n\nOnce sorted, we can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance between them divided by two would be the required d for that gap. But also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is something. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nWait, right. For example, if the first lantern is at position x, then the area from 0 to x needs to be covered. The radius must be at least x, because the first lantern's coverage starts at x - d. To cover 0, x - d <= 0 => d >= x. Similarly, for the end of the street. If the last lantern is at position y, then the coverage must reach l. So y + d >= l => d >= l - y.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance between the first lantern and 0. The required d for this is the first lantern's position (since 0 is the start).\n3. Check the distance between the last lantern and l. The required d for this is l - last lantern's position.\n4. Then, for each consecutive pair of lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns would require d to be half of that gap. Because if two lanterns are spaced by g, then the middle point is at g/2 away from each. So the radius needs to be at least g/2 to cover that point.\n5. The answer is the maximum among all these values: the first part, the last part, and the maximum of the consecutive gaps divided by two.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSort the array. Then:\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nthen for i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2\n\nif current_required > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nSo the final answer is max_d.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting, the array is [2,5].\n\nFirst check a[0] = 2. So the distance from 0 is 2. So initial max_d is 2. Then l - a[-1] is 5 -5=0. So max_d remains 2.\n\nThen check the gap between 5 and 2: 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. Which is less than 2. So the maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the first one:\n\nInput is 7 15, with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, the array is [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nCheck first lantern is 0. So the distance from 0 is 0. Then the last lantern is 15, so l - a[-1] is 0. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 =3 → 3",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that there are `n` lanterns placed at various positions along the street. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and ensuring that the entire street from 0 to `l` is covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are critical as they determine the minimum radius needed to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Calculate Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap will determine the radius required to cover the middle of this gap, which is half the gap's length.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the ends of the street and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n    \n    # Check the last lantern\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting Lanterns**: Sorting the lantern positions ensures that we can easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Ends of the Street**: The initial and final distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns are checked to ensure these areas are illuminated.\n- **Gaps Between Lanterns**: By iterating through the sorted positions and calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns, we determine the worst-case scenario where the largest gap would require the largest radius to cover its midpoint.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements for accuracy.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required using sorting and linear traversal, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
