Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance d from their position. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would require the largest d. Also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine part of the required d. Similarly for the end at l.\n\nSo here's my plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, we can't easily check consecutive gaps.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d must cover this distance. Similarly for the end (l) and the last lantern.\n3. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum of these distances divided by two would be the required d for that gap. Because the worst case is the middle of the gap, which needs to be covered by both lanterns. So for a gap of size g, the required d is g/2.\n4. The overall answer is the maximum between the initial and final distances and the maximum of the consecutive gaps divided by two.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the entire street has to be covered by that lantern. So the distance from 0 to the lantern's position, and from the lantern's position to l. The maximum of those two would be the required d. Because the lantern's coverage needs to reach both ends.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial gap: first lantern's position minus 0. The required d for this is that value.\n- Compute the end gap: l minus the last lantern's position. Required d is that value.\n- For the middle gaps between consecutive lanterns, compute the difference between them, divide by two. Take the maximum of all these.\n- The answer is the maximum between the initial gap, end gap, and the max middle gap.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Let's take an example. Suppose the first lantern is at position a1, then the initial gap is a1 - 0. But the lantern's coverage needs to reach from 0 to a1 + d. Wait, no. The lantern's coverage is from a_i -d to a_i +d. So for the beginning of the street (0) to be covered, 0 must be within [a1 -d, a1 +d]. So the maximum distance between 0 and a1 is a1 -0. So d must be at least a1. Because if a1 is at 3, then d has to be at least 3 to cover 0. Similarly, for the end, l must be covered. So the distance between the last lantern and l is l - a_last. So d must be at least that.\n\nBut for the middle gaps, between two consecutive lanterns, say a and b. The maximum distance between them is (b - a). The middle point is (a + b)/2. The distance from a to that point is (b -a)/2, and same for the distance from b to that point. So to cover that point, d must be at least (b -a)/2. So the maximum of all these (b -a)/2 values is the required for the middle gaps.\n\nSo the overall answer is the maximum between the initial distance (a1 - 0), the end distance (l - a_last), and the maximum (b -a)/2 for consecutive lanterns.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and l. Then read the array of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nThen:\n\nmax_d = 0\n\nif there are no lanterns? Well, according to input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nCompute initial gap: a[0] - 0. So initial_d = a[0]\n\nCompute end gap: l - a[-1]. end_d = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_d is the maximum between initial_d and end_d.\n\nThen for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif this is larger than max_d, update max_d.\n\nSo after checking all consecutive pairs, the max_d is the answer.\n\nWait, but in the example given.\n\nTake the",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining the minimum light radius required for all lanterns to cover the entire street, we need to consider both the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach Overview**\n\n1. **Input Reading and Initial Setup**:\n   - Read the number of lanterns `n` and the length of the street `l`.\n   - Read the list of lantern positions `a` and sort them in ascending order.\n\n2. **Edge Case Handling**:\n   - If there's only one lantern, the maximum distance it must cover is from the start or end of the street to that lantern.\n   - If there are multiple lanterns, we also consider the gaps between them.\n\n3. **Gap Analysis**:\n   - The initial gap from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern.\n   - The final gap from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n   - The largest gap between any two adjacent lanterns, which requires the radius to be half of that gap (to ensure the middle point of the gap is covered).\n\n4. **Determine the Maximum Required Radius**:\n   - The answer is the maximum of:\n     - The distance from the start to the first lantern,\n     - The distance from the last lantern to the end,\n     - Half the largest gap between any two adjacent lanterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    n, l = map(int, data[0].split())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    a.sort()\n\n    max_d = 0.0\n\n    # Check the beginning of the street\n    max_d = a[0]\n\n    # Check the end of the street\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current_d = gap / 2.0\n        if current_d > max_d:\n            max_d = current_d\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Example Execution**\n\nFor the input:\n\n```\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n```\n\nThe sorted lantern positions are: `[0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]`\n\n- Start to first lantern: `0` → distance is `0`\n- End to last lantern: `15` → distance is `0`\n- Largest gap between lanterns is between `9` and `14`, which is `5`. So required d is `5 / 2 = 2.5`.\n\nThus, the output is `2.5000000000`.\n\n---\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently and accurately, with a time complexity of **O(n log n)** due to sorting, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
