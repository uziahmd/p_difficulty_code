He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the given prefixes and suffixes. And our job is to assign P or S to each input string such that there exists some s that matches.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find the correct assignments. Let's think about the properties of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nFor example, the original string s has certain prefixes and suffixes. For each possible length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings given: one is a prefix of s, and the other is a suffix. Wait, no. Wait, the input says that there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. But each of those two could be either a prefix or a suffix. So for each length l, one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Or maybe both are prefixes? No, because the original string has exactly one prefix of each length (from 1 to n-1) and similarly exactly one suffix of each length. So the input has exactly two strings for each length, but for each length, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Because the original string s has exactly one prefix and one suffix of each length l (from 1 to n-1). Therefore, in the input, for each length l, there are two strings: one is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding for each length l, which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. Once we have that, we can assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we determine which one is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we can find the original string s. Then for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix or suffix of s. But since we don't know s, how can we find it?\n\nAlternatively, the original string s must be such that for each l, the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l are present in the input. Also, for l = n-1, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1]. So these two must be present in the input. Moreover, the original s must be such that when you take the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l, they are among the input strings.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, perhaps the original s can be determined by looking for the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be in the input. Let's consider that for the original string s, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 are two of the input strings. Then, combining them, perhaps we can find s.\n\nWait, the original s is a string of length n. The prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1]. So, if we take the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1, then their concatenation would be s[0...n-2] + s[1...n-1]. But the original s is s[0...n-1]. So, the overlapping part would be s[0...n-2] and s[1...n-1]. The only way that these two can be combined into s is if the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 share a common part. For example, if the prefix of length n-1 is \"abc\" and the suffix of length n-1 is \"bcd\", then the original s would be \"abcd\".\n\nSo, for the two strings of length n-1, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Let's say the prefix is A and the suffix is B. Then the original string s would be A + (last character of B). Because the suffix B is s[1...n-1], so the first character of B is s[1], and the last character is s[n-1]. The prefix A is s[0...n-2], so the original s is A[0...n-2] followed by B's last character. But also, since B is s[1...n-1], then the first character of B is s[1], which is the second character of s. So for the original s to exist, the prefix of length n-1 (A) and the suffix of length",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct assignment of 'P' (prefix) and 'S' (suffix) for each input string such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: For the longest possible lengths (i.e., `n-1`), there will be two strings. One of these must be the prefix of length `n-1` and the other the suffix of length `n-1`. By combining these, we can reconstruct the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct Original String**: Using the identified prefix and suffix of length `n-1`, we can infer the original string `s` by combining the prefix with the last character of the suffix.\n3. **Validate All Strings**: Once we have the candidate string `s`, we check each input string to determine if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n - 2]\n    \n    # Group strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    candidates = len_to_strings[n-1]\n    # Try both possibilities for the prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(2):\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1 - i]\n        # Reconstruct the possible s\n        s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n        # Check if the suffix_candidate is indeed a suffix of s\n        if s[-(n-1):] == suffix_candidate:\n            # Now check all strings against this s\n            result = []\n            for s_str in strings:\n                if s.startswith(s_str):\n                    result.append('P')\n                elif s.endswith(s_str):\n                    result.append('S')\n                else:\n                    # This should not happen as per the problem statement\n                    pass\n            print(''.join(result))\n            return\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to easily access the ones of length `n-1`.\n3. **Reconstructing the Original String**: By considering both possible assignments of the two strings of length `n-1` as prefix and suffix, we attempt to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: For each reconstructed string `s`, we validate all input strings to check if they are prefixes or suffixes, then generate the corresponding 'P' and 'S' sequence.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes by leveraging the properties of string prefixes and suffixes, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
