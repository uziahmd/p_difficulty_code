Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we have a string of digits and perform substitution queries on it. Then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be large and the number of queries can be up to 1e5. Directly replacing each occurrence in the string for every query might be too slow, especially if the string becomes very long after substitutions. So I need a smarter way.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each query replaces all occurrences of a certain digit with another string. But if we process the queries in order, each substitution affects the current state of the string. However, if we process them in reverse order, maybe we can track the replacements more efficiently. Wait, but the problem says that the queries are applied in the order given. So for example, if first we replace 2 with 00, then replace 0 with something else, the original 2s would have been replaced by 00, which would then be replaced again.\n\nWait, but processing the queries in reverse order might not be possible. Let me think: suppose we have two queries: first replace 2 with 00, then replace 0 with 1. The final result would be that each original 2 becomes 00, which then becomes 11. If we process the queries in reverse, first replacing 0 with 1, then replacing 2 with 00. But that would mean that the original 2s would be replaced with 00, but since the 0s were not replaced yet (since we did the reverse order), but that's not the same. So processing in reverse order isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternative approach: model each digit's replacement as a function. For example, when we process a query, say 'd -> t', we need to update the mapping for d. However, if a digit has already been replaced, then the substitution for that digit would be replaced by the new string. But since substitutions are applied in sequence, perhaps we can track for each digit what it's currently mapped to. However, when a substitution is done, it's replacing all instances of that digit in the current string. But if we have multiple substitutions for the same digit, the later ones override the previous ones. So, for example, if first we have 2->00, then 2->11, then any original 2s would be replaced by 11, not 00. But during processing, the substitutions are applied in order. So, the key is that each substitution replaces all occurrences of the digit in the current string. Therefore, if we process the substitutions in order, and for each substitution, we need to replace all instances of the current digit in the string with the new string.\n\nBut if the string is large, doing this naively by replacing each occurrence for every query would be O(n * len(s)) time, which could be O(1e5 * 1e5) = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo, we need a way to represent the substitutions in a way that avoids processing the entire string for each query.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of keeping track of the actual string, we can track for each digit what it's currently expanded to. For example, initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a query comes in, say 'd -> t', we update the mapping for d to be t. However, when expanding, we need to consider that any occurrence of d in the original string would be replaced by the current expansion of d. But how do we compute the final value?\n\nBut the problem is that the substitutions are applied in sequence. So, for example, if we have a query that replaces d with t, and then another query that replaces a digit in t with something else, then the original d's expansion would be affected by that later substitution.\n\nSo, the idea is that each substitution affects the current mapping. So, for example, if we have a mapping where digit d is replaced by some string, and then later, another substitution replaces a digit in that string, the expansion of d would automatically take that into account.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the mappings as a kind of recursive structure. For example, when we want to compute the expansion of a digit, we look up its current mapping, which may be a string that contains other digits. Those digits would then be expanded recursively according to their current mappings.\n\nBut how do we compute the final value of the entire string? Because the original string is made up of digits, each of which may be expanded through multiple substitutions. So, the approach is:\n\n- For each query, we update a mapping from digits to their replacement strings. However, the replacement strings may contain digits that are also mapped. So, when we need to compute the final expansion of a digit, we need",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly applying each substitution on the entire string is inefficient due to potential large string sizes. Instead, we can use dynamic programming to track the value of each digit after substitutions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming Mapping**: Use an array `dp` where `dp[d]` represents the current value of digit `d` after all substitutions. Initially, each digit maps to itself.\n2. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since we need the result modulo $10^9 + 7$, we maintain values in `dp` using modulo arithmetic to prevent overflow and ensure efficiency.\n3. **Handling Substitutions**: For each substitution query, update the mapping for the specified digit. If the replacement string contains digits, recursively compute their current values using the `dp` array.\n4. **Final Computation**: After processing all substitutions, compute the final value of the initial string using the updated mappings and take the result modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize dp: dp[d] is the value of digit d as a number mod MOD\n    dp = [0] * 10\n    for d in range(10):\n        dp[d] = d\n    \n    for q in queries:\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_str = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip()\n        d = int(d_str)\n        # Compute the value of t_str using current dp\n        val = 0\n        for ch in t_str:\n            val = (val * 10 + dp[int(ch)]) % MOD\n        dp[d] = val\n    \n    # Now compute the value of the original string s\n    result = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        result = (result * 10 + dp[int(ch)]) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized such that each digit maps to its numeric value.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each substitution query, the replacement string is converted into its numeric value using the current state of the `dp` array. This ensures that any subsequent substitutions are correctly accounted for.\n3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all queries, the initial string is evaluated using the updated `dp` values to compute the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles substitutions by maintaining a dynamic mapping of digit values, ensuring that each substitution is processed in constant time relative to the length of the replacement string, leading to an overall efficient solution.",
