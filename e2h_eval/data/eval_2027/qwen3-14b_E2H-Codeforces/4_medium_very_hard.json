The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly isn't feasible. So we need an efficient way to compute the results without iterating through all n rounds.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The key here is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can calculate the number of losses in each full cycle and then multiply by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the sequences work. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros uses A[i % m], and Polycarpus uses B[i % k]. So for each round, we can determine the moves of both players based on their respective sequences.\n\nThe challenge is to compute for each round from 0 to n-1, which player loses, but doing this for 2e9 rounds is impossible. So we need to find a way to compute the total losses in O(1) or O(m*k) time.\n\nLet's think about the possible cycles. Since the sequences A and B are periodic with periods m and k respectively, the combined sequence of moves for both players will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the combination of moves for each round in this LCM period will repeat.\n\nSo the idea is to compute the number of losses in one full LCM period, then multiply that by the number of full periods in n rounds, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds (n mod LCM).\n\nBut first, we need to compute LCM(m, k). To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need to compute the GCD of m and k.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, let's call it period, then:\n\ntotal_periods = n // period\nremaining_rounds = n % period\n\nSo for each full period, we can calculate the number of times Nikephoros loses (let's call it loss_A) and Polycarpus loses (loss_B). Then multiply those by total_periods.\n\nThen, we need to compute the losses for the remaining_rounds, which is up to period-1 rounds. So for that, we can simulate each of these rounds once.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible value of period? Since m and k are up to 1000, their LCM can be up to 1000*1000 = 1e6. So even if we simulate each period (up to 1e6 rounds), that's manageable. Because for each period, we can precompute the number of losses.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to period_length-1, determine the moves of A and B, check who wins, and count the losses for each.\n\n3. Multiply the counts by the number of full periods (total_periods = n // period_length).\n\n4. Then, simulate the remaining rounds (remaining_rounds = n % period_length) and add their losses.\n\nThis way, the total time complexity is O(period_length) which is up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, for n up to 2e9, but period_length up to 1e6, this approach would be feasible.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, compute the GCD of m and k. Then compute LCM.\n\nBut how to compute GCD? Well, Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, it's okay. Also, since m and k are lengths of the strings, they are positive.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, we can proceed.\n\nNow, for each round in 0 to period_length-1:\n\nFor that round, the index for A is (i % m), and for B is (i % k). Then, compare the two moves.\n\nWe need to determine for each pair (a, b) who wins.\n\nLet's think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\nIf same, no loss.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a, b) is (R, S) or (S, P) or (P, R): then A wins, so B gets a pinch (so B's loss count increases by 1).\n\nElse, B wins, so A's loss count increases by 1.\n\nSo for each round, we can check which case it is.\n\nSo for the period_length rounds, we can loop through each i from 0 to period_length-1, compute the moves, and accumulate the losses per period.\n\nOnce we have the per-period counts, multiply by total_periods, then process the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n, then read A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute GCD(m, k), then LCM = m * k // GCD.\n\nThen, compute for each i in 0 to LCM-1:\n\nget a_move = A[i % m], b_move = B[i % k]\n\ncheck who wins, and increment the counts for the period.\n\nOnce we have per_period_loss_A and per_period_loss_B, then:\n\ntotal_periods = n // LCM\n\nremaining = n % LCM\n\ntotal_A = total_periods * per_period_loss_A\n\ntotal_B = total_periods * per_period_loss_B\n\nThen, simulate the first 'remaining' rounds (from 0 to remaining-1), and add their losses.\n\nBut how to simulate the remaining rounds? For each i in 0 to remaining-1:\n\nsame as before, check a and b moves, and add to total_A and total_B.\n\nBut for the remaining rounds, it's possible that remaining is up to LCM-1, which is up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the overall time is O(LCM) + O(remaining) which is O(1e6) in worst case.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, that's manageable.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo for each of 12 rounds, compute the per-period counts.\n\nThen, n=7, which is less than 12. So total_periods is 0, and remaining is 7. So simulate 7 rounds.\n\nLet me check the example's explanation.\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are:\n\nRound 0: A is R (i=0 mod 3), B is R (i=0 mod 4). Draw. No loss.\n\nRound 1: A is P (i=1 mod 3), B is S (i=1 mod 4). P vs S: S beats P? Wait, no. Wait:\n\nWait, the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beats paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nSo for a_move = P, b_move = S. S beats P. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So total_A increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the example's note:\n\nIn the first sample, the first round is R vs R: draw. Then the second round (probably i=1?), P vs S. Nikephoros loses. Then third round (i=2?), S vs P. Polycarpus loses. Then i=3: A is R (i=3 mod 3 is 0), B is i=3 mod 4 is 3: P. R vs P: P beats R, so A loses. So Nikephoros loses again. Then i=4: A is 4 mod 3 is 1 (P), B is 4 mod 4 is 0 (R). P vs R: P beats R. So B loses. So Polycarpus loses. So Nikephoros gains a point here? Or wait, in the example note, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R-R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P vs S. Nikephoros (A) loses. So his count increases by 1.\n\nRound 3: S vs P. B is P. So A's move is S, B's move is P. S beats P. So B loses. So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nWait, the example says in the first sample:\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R-R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses (so his count increases by 1).\n\nRound 3: S - P. Polycarpus loses (so his count increases by 1).\n\nWait, how does that happen?\n\nWait, in the example's note, the rounds are numbered from 1 to 7. So maybe the rounds are 0-based or 1-based? Let me check the example:\n\nThe first sample input is 7 rounds. The note says:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses.\n\nRound 3: S - P. Polycarpus loses.\n\nRound 4: R - P. Nikephoros loses.\n\nRound 5: P - R. Polycarpus loses.\n\nRound 6: S - S. Draw.\n\nRound 7: R - P. Nikephoros loses.\n\nSo total of 3 losses for Nikephoros (rounds 2,4,7) and 2 for Polycarpus (rounds 3,5).\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds, the code should compute that.\n\nNow, for the code's approach, when n=7, the LCM is 12. So total_periods is 0, and remaining is 7. So simulate 7 rounds.\n\nSo for each of the 7 rounds, check the moves.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFor i from 0 to 6 (since remaining is 7 rounds, 0-based):\n\ni=0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R. Draw. No loss.\n\ni=1: A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S. P vs S. S beats P. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So total_A +=1.\n\ni=2: A[2%3] = S, B[2%4] = P. S beats P. So B loses. So total_B +=1.\n\ni=3: A[3%3=0] = R, B[3%4=3] = P. P beats R. A loses. total_A +=1.\n\ni=4: A[4%3=1] = P, B[4%4=0] = R. P beats R. B loses. total_B +=1.\n\ni=5: A[5%3=2] = S, B[5%4=1] = S. Draw. No loss.\n\ni=6: A[6%3=0] = R, B[6%4=2] = P. P beats R. A loses. total_A +=1.\n\nSo after 7 rounds, total_A is 3 (from i=1,3,6), and total_B is 2 (i=2,4). Which matches the sample. So the approach works.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich is n=5, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). So LCM(8,1) is 8.\n\nSo per_period_loss_A and per_period_loss_B are computed for 8 rounds. But since all A's moves are R, and B's moves are R. So all rounds are draws. So per_period_loss_A and per_period_loss_B are zero. So total_periods is 5//8=0, remaining is 5. So simulate 5 rounds. All draws. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n, then A, then B.\n\nBut wait, the input format is:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is:\n\nThe first line is n, then the second line is A, third line is B.\n\nSo in the first sample, the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nNow, compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute GCD(m, k). Then LCM.\n\nBut for Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. However, note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nBut for cases where m or k is zero? No, the constraints say 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000. So no problem.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nThen, period_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nThen, for the period_length rounds, simulate each and count the number of losses for A and B in one period.\n\nThen, multiply by total_periods.\n\nThen simulate the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, code for that:\n\nper_period_A = 0\n\nper_period_B = 0\n\nfor i in range(period_length):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    # determine outcome\n\n    if a_move == b_move:\n\n        continue\n\n    # else, check who wins\n\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n        # A wins, B loses. So B's count increases.\n\n        per_period_B += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # B wins, A loses. So A's count increases.\n\n        per_period_A += 1\n\nOnce that's done, total_periods = n // period_length\n\nremaining = n % period_length\n\ntotal_A = total_periods * per_period_A\n\ntotal_B = total_periods * per_period_B\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds, do the same:\n\nfor i in range(remaining):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    if a_move == b_move:\n\n        continue\n\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n        total_B += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        total_A += 1\n\nThen print(total_A, total_B)\n\nBut wait, the code for the remaining rounds is similar to the code for the period. So perhaps we can make a helper function to compute the number of A and B losses for a given number of rounds. But for code efficiency, perhaps better to just code as above.\n\nBut for code clarity, perhaps write a helper function.\n\nBut for code brevity, perhaps not. Let's proceed.\n\nBut what if the period_length is 0? Well, m and k are at least 1, so LCM is at least 1.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4). LCM is 12.\n\nper_period_A and per_period_B are computed for 12 rounds. Then, total_periods is 7//12=0, remaining is 7. So the code processes 7 rounds, as before.\n\nSo the code would correctly compute 3 and 2.\n\nAnother sample is when n=5, A is RRRRRRRR (m=8), B is R (k=1). LCM(8,1)=8. For each of 8 rounds, A and B are R, so no loss. So per_period_A and per_period_B are 0. Then, remaining is 5 rounds, which are all R vs R. So total_A and total_B are 0.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where n is exactly equal to period_length. Then, remaining is zero, and the code adds nothing.\n\nAnother case: when the sequences have overlapping periods.\n\nWhat about when one sequence is longer than the other?\n\nAnother test case: m=2, A = RS, k=2, B=SR. LCM is 2. For period_length=2.\n\nRound 0: A is R, B is S. R vs S: A wins. B loses. So per_period_B +=1.\n\nRound 1: A is S, B is R. S vs R: B wins. A loses. So per_period_A +=1.\n\nSo per_period_A is 1, per_period_B is 1. For n=2, total_periods is 1. So total_A is 1, total_B is 1. For n=4, total_periods is 2, so total_A is 2, total_B is 2.\n\nBut if n=3, then period_length is 2. total_periods is 1 (3//2=1), remaining is 1. So for the remaining 1 round (i=0), which is R vs S. So B loses. So total_A is 1 (from period) + 0 (remaining?) Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, n=3: total_periods is 1 (2 rounds processed), and remaining is 1 round (i=0). So for that round, A is R, B is S. So B loses. So total_B increases by 1. So total_A is 1 (from period) + 0 (remaining rounds?), no. Wait, in the code:\n\ntotal_A starts as 1 (from per_period_A * 1). Then, the remaining rounds is 1, which is i from 0 to 0. So for that round, the code checks:\n\na_move is R, b_move is S. A wins. So B loses. So total_B increases by 1. So total_A is 1, total_B is 1 (from period) + 1 (from remaining) = 2. So for n=3, the total is A:1, B:2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the modulo operations correctly. For i in 0 to period_length-1, the i%m and i%k are correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake is in the condition for when A wins. Let me recheck:\n\nThe condition is:\n\nif (a_move, b_move) is (R, S), (S, P), or (P, R). Then A wins. Else, B wins.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code for that part is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that for very large n (like 2e9), the code will process O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nperiod_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nper_period_A = 0\nper_period_B = 0\n\nfor i in range(period_length):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        per_period_B += 1\n    else:\n        per_period_A += 1\n\ntotal_periods = n // period_length\nremaining = n % period_length\n\ntotal_A = total_periods * per_period_A\ntotal_B = total_periods * per_period_B\n\nfor i in range(remaining):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        total_B += 1\n    else:\n        total_A += 1\n\nprint(total_A, total_B)\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the code would compute per_period_A and per_period_B for 12 rounds. Let's see what that would be.\n\nBut for the first sample, the code would compute for 12 rounds. Let's see:\n\nBut in the first sample, the code for the first 7 rounds gives 3 and 2. But for the full 12 rounds, what's the total?\n\nBut perhaps it's not necessary to check. The code seems correct.\n\nBut what if the period_length is larger than n? Then the code handles that correctly by processing the remaining rounds.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when n is zero? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when m=1 and k=1. Then period_length is 1. So for each round, the same moves. So if A and B are same, no loss. Else, check once.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when A and B are same sequences. For example, A and B are same. Then, for all rounds, same moves. So no loss.\n\nSo code would return 0 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThe code would compute period_length = LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nThen, per_period_A and per_period_B are calculated for 12 rounds. Then, since n=7, total_periods is 0, remaining is 7. So the code simulates 7 rounds, which gives 3 and 2. So output is 3 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo m=8, k=1. LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nper_period_A and per_period_B are 0 for all 8 rounds. Then, n=5, total_periods=0, remaining=5. Simulate 5 rounds, all draws. So output 0 0.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, A=RS, B=SR. As discussed earlier.\n\nperiod_length is LCM(2,2)=2.\n\nper_period_A is 1, per_period_B is 1.\n\ntotal_periods = 2//2 = 1. remaining=0. So total_A = 1, total_B=1. Output is 1 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, same A and B. Then total_periods=1 (3//2=1), remaining=1. So total_A = 1, total_B = 1. Then for the remaining 1 round (i=0), which is R vs S. So B loses. So total_B increases by 1. So total_B is 1+1=2. total_A remains 1. So output is 1 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player follows a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use an efficient approach leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Each player uses a sequence of moves that repeats cyclically. The combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their individual sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period after which the move combinations repeat.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For one full period (LCM length), simulate each round to count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Scale Up for Full Periods**: Multiply the losses from one period by the number of complete periods within the total number of rounds.\n5. **Handle Remaining Rounds**: Simulate the remaining rounds after accounting for the full periods.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_period_A = 0\n    per_period_B = 0\n    \n    for i in range(period_length):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            per_period_B += 1\n        else:\n            per_period_A += 1\n    \n    total_periods = n // period_length\n    remaining = n % period_length\n    \n    total_A = total_periods * per_period_A\n    total_B = total_periods * per_period_B\n    \n    for i in range(remaining):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_B += 1\n        else:\n            total_A += 1\n    \n    print(total_A, total_B)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds and the sequences of moves for each player.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the sequences determines the period after which the move combinations repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: By iterating through each round in the period, we count how many times each player loses.\n4. **Scaling Up**: Using the number of complete periods within the total rounds, we scale the losses from one period to cover all complete periods.\n5. **Handling Remaining Rounds**: Any remaining rounds after the complete periods are simulated individually to account for the final partial period.\n\nThis approach efficiently reduces the problem complexity by leveraging periodicity, ensuring it handles the large constraints effectively.",
