The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Nikephoros and Polycarpus play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The input gives n, then the sequence A for Nikephoros, and sequence B for Polycarpus. The sequences are strings of R, P, S. For each round, we need to determine who wins, if anyone.\n\nThe challenge is that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round one by one. So simulating each round step by step is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, the key is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats after some number of rounds. Since both players' moves are cyclic, their move sequences repeat every m and k rounds respectively. The combined cycle would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = T. So, in T rounds, the entire sequence of moves for both players repeats. Therefore, if we can compute the number of losses for each player in one full cycle of T rounds, then we can calculate how many full cycles fit into n rounds and multiply by that count. Then handle the remaining rounds (n mod T) separately.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it T.\n2. For each round in 0 to T-1, determine the moves of both players. Then determine who wins, and count the number of times each loses in this T-length cycle.\n3. The total number of full cycles is q = n // T. The remainder is r = n % T.\n4. Multiply the counts from the cycle by q, and then add the counts from the first r rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute the moves for each round? Let's think. For round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k]. So for each round in the T rounds, we can compute their moves and check who wins.\n\nBut since T can be up to m*k, and m and k are up to 1000, then T can be up to 1e6. Which is manageable. Because even if m and k are 1000 each, LCM could be up to 1e6. So for each of the T rounds, we can compute the outcome once, and then multiply by q.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n- Precompute for each round in 0..T-1: who loses (if anyone)\n- Count for each of the T rounds, how many times Nikephoros loses (countA) and Polycarpus loses (countB)\n- Then totalA = countA * q + countA_partial (from first r rounds)\n- Similarly for totalB.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but that returns the absolute value. But since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nWait, but in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists. So for m and k, compute their GCD, then LCM is m*k // GCD.\n\nOnce I have T, then for each of the T rounds, I can compute the moves.\n\nNow, for each round i (from 0 to T-1):\n\na_move = A[i % m]\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine the outcome between a_move and b_move.\n\nHow to determine who wins? Let's think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\nScissors beats paper (S beats P)\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\nIf same, draw.\n\nSo for a_move and b_move:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a, b) is (R, S) or (S, P) or (P, R): then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (since he lost)\nelse: Nikephoros loses, so he gets a spot.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we can check which case it is.\n\nSo for each of the T rounds, we can compute whether Nikephoros loses (add 1 to his count) or Polycarpus loses (add 1 to his count) or neither.\n\nOnce we have the counts for the full cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles, and then add the counts from the first r rounds.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each of the T rounds, the outcome. But T can be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1e3 each, their LCM is up to 1e6). For 1e6 rounds, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B. Let m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the T rounds, the a and b moves, and count the number of losses for each.\n\nThen, compute q = n // T, r = n % T.\n\ntotalA = countA_full * q + countA_partial (from first r rounds)\ntotalB = countB_full * q + countB_partial (from first r rounds)\n\nBut how to compute countA_full and countB_full?\n\nWell, during the T rounds, we can precompute for each round, the number of times Nikephoros loses (a_loss) and Polycarpus loses (b_loss). So for each of the T rounds, we can accumulate these counts.\n\nSo:\n\ncountA_full = sum of a_loss over T rounds\ncountB_full = sum of b_loss over T rounds\n\nSimilarly, for the first r rounds, we can compute the same way.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nImplement a helper function to compute the outcome between a and b.\n\nLet me think about that function.\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)  # no loss for either\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So Nikephoros has 0, Polycarpus has 1.\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        # Nikephoros loses, so he gets 1, Polycarpus 0.\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes. So for each pair, we can get the increments for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nSo, for the T rounds, we can loop from 0 to T-1, compute the a and b moves, and accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce that's done, the rest is straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute T. Let's code that.\n\nBut first, compute GCD of m and k.\n\nIn Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. However, note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's fine.\n\nSo:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to make sure that a and b are not zero. But since m and k are at least 1, as per input constraints.\n\nOnce T is computed, proceed.\n\nNow, for the example given:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\", m=3. B is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo T=12.\n\nFor each of the 12 rounds, compute the moves and the results.\n\nBut let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input says n=7, so q=7//12=0, r=7. So we need to compute the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the example explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw. So no spots.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (since P vs S: S beats P? Wait, no. Wait, the first round is round 1. Let me think.\n\nWait, the example's explanation says:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses? Let me check.\n\nWait, the sample input's first example is:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is RPS (length 3), B is RSPP (length 4).\n\nSo for each round, the move of Nikephoros is A[i % 3], and Polycarpus is B[i % 4], where i starts from 0?\n\nWait, for the first round (i=0?), the first round. Let's check the sample explanation.\n\nIn the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that in the first sample, Nikephoros has 3 losses and Polycarpus 2.\n\nLet me check the example.\n\nSample input's first example's explanation:\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses. Wait, what's the outcome here?\n\nP (paper) vs S (scissors). Scissors beats paper. So the winner is Polycarpus (since his move is S). So Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros gets a spot. So in this case, Nikephoros's move is P, and Polycarpus's is S. So according to our function, (a, b) is (P, S). Which is not in the winning conditions for Nikephoros. So the function returns (1, 0). Which means Nikephoros has 1 loss (so his count increases by 1). So that's correct.\n\nIn the sample explanation, the second round Nikephoros loses. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, for the first sample, the 7 rounds would be processed as follows.\n\nBut let's not get stuck here. The code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to code this.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of T rounds, the a and b moves, and accumulate the counts for full cycle.\n\nThen, compute how many full cycles and the remainder.\n\nNow, for the remainder, we need to process the first r rounds (r = n % T).\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, and T up to 1e6, the code will run in O(T) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement:\n\nRead n from input. But the input is given as a list? Wait, looking back at the problem statement's example input:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A as a string.\n\nThird line contains sequence B as a string.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, that's probably a mistake in the way the sample input is presented. Probably, the actual input is:\n\nThe first line is n, then the next line is A, then the next line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 7, then RPS, then RSPP. So the code should read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input given, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. Anyway, the code should read three lines: first n, then A, then B.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    # Now compute for each of T rounds, the a and b moves\n    # precompute the counts for full cycle\n    countA = 0\n    countB = 0\n    for i in range(T):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        # determine result\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            pass\n        else:\n            # check who wins\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n                # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (countB += 1)\n                countB += 1\n            else:\n                # Nikephoros loses, countA +=1\n                countA += 1\n    # Now compute how many full cycles and remainder\n    q, r = divmod(n, T)\n    totalA = countA * q\n    totalB = countB * q\n    # Now process the first r rounds\n    for i in range(r):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            pass\n        else:\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n                totalB += 1\n            else:\n                totalA += 1\n    print(totalA, totalB)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first sample input is:\n\nn =7\n\nA = RPS (m=3)\n\nB = RSPP (k=4)\n\nT = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds (r=7), the code would process the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the totalA is 3 and totalB is 2.\n\nLet me check with the code.\n\nLet me simulate for the first 7 rounds.\n\nLet's compute for each i from 0 to 6 (since r=7):\n\ni ranges from 0 to 6 (7 rounds).\n\nFor each i, compute a_move and b_move.\n\ni=0:\n\na: 0%3=0 → 'R'\n\nb: 0%4=0 → 'R' → draw. No change.\n\ni=1:\n\na:1%3=1 → 'P'\n\nb:1%4=1 → 'S'\n\nP vs S. S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So totalA +=1.\n\ni=2:\n\na: 2%3=2 → 'S'\n\nb: 2%4=2 → 'P'\n\nS vs P. S beats P. Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. totalB +=1.\n\ni=3:\n\na: 3%3=0 → 'R'\n\nb: 3%4=3 → 'P'\n\nR vs P. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. totalA +=1.\n\ni=4:\n\na:4%3=1 → 'P'\n\nb:4%4=0 → 'R'\n\nP vs R. P beats R. Nikephoros wins. totalB +=1.\n\ni=5:\n\na:5%3=2 → 'S'\n\nb:5%4=1 → 'S'\n\ndraw. no change.\n\ni=6:\n\na:6%3=0 → 'R'\n\nb:6%4=2 → 'P'\n\nR vs P. Nikephoros loses. totalA +=1.\n\nSo after 7 rounds, totalA is 1 (i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) → 3. totalB is 1 (i=2) + 1 (i=4) → 2. Which matches the sample output. So code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, when processing the first r rounds, it's for i in range(r), which is 0 to r-1. So for r=7, i runs from 0 to 6. Which is correct.\n\nNow, what about when T is larger than n? For example, if n is smaller than T, then q is 0 and r is n. So the code correctly processes the first r rounds.\n\nAnother test case: when n=0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when A and B are same sequences. For example, A and B are same, then all rounds are draws. So output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: when A is length 1, B is length 1. Then T=1. So for each round, same as the first round. So for n=5, q=5, r=0. So the counts are multiplied by 5.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case where T is 0? Well, since m and k are at least 1, T can't be zero.\n\nNow, the code may have a problem with the LCM calculation. Let me check.\n\nFor example, m=2, k=2. LCM is 2.\n\nBut for m=2, k=2, the LCM is 2. So for T=2, the code would process 2 rounds.\n\nBut in that case, the code would process for i=0 and 1.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code is written, but need to test for possible errors.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses sys.stdin.readline() for reading the input. However, sometimes, after reading the first line, the next lines may have leading or trailing spaces. But the problem says that the input is given as per the description, so the code should read the lines properly.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSample Output: 3 2.\n\nWhich the code produces correctly.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich is the second example in the problem statement. The output is 0 0.\n\nLet me see.\n\nA is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). So T = LCM(8,1) = 8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds:\n\nEach round, A's move is R, B's move is R. All draws. So countA and countB are 0. So for any n, the total is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then, Nikephoros's move is R, B's is S. R beats S. So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So output is 0 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1, A is 'S', B is 'R'. Then S vs R: R beats S. So Nikephoros loses. Output is 1 0.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 2e9, but the code runs in O(T) time, which is up to 1e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a large number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player follows a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences of moves. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use a more efficient approach leveraging the periodic nature of the players' strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The combined cycle length for both sequences is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the number of rounds after which both sequences repeat simultaneously.\n3. **Precompute Outcomes**: For each round within one full cycle (LCM length), determine the outcome and count the losses for each player.\n4. **Scale Results**: Use the precomputed results from one cycle to calculate the total losses over the given number of rounds by considering the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    countA = 0\n    countB = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            countB += 1\n        else:\n            countA += 1\n    \n    q, r = divmod(n, T)\n    totalA = countA * q\n    totalB = countB * q\n    \n    for i in range(r):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            totalB += 1\n        else:\n            totalA += 1\n    \n    print(totalA, totalB)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using standard input functions, with the number of rounds and the sequences for each player.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the cycle length after which both sequences repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within the cycle length, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome of each round is evaluated to count losses for each player.\n4. **Scaling Results**: The number of full cycles and remaining rounds are calculated. The results from one cycle are multiplied by the number of full cycles, and the remaining rounds are processed separately to get the final counts of losses.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the players' strategies, ensuring that the solution is computed in linear time relative to the cycle length, which is feasible given the constraints.",
