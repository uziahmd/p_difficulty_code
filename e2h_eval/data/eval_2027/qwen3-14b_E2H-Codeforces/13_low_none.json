For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The input is three notes, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart. So, for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone, between C and D is 2, and so on. But since the notes are cyclic, after H (which is B in some notations?), comes C again. Wait, the problem statement says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, maybe there's a typo here? Because normally, the 12 notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B. But the problem lists H as the last note. Oh right, in some countries, like Russia, they use H for B. So here, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, no, the list says: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, that's 12 notes? Let me count:\n\nC (1), C# (2), D (3), D# (4), E (5), F (6), F# (7), G (8), G# (9), A (10), B (11), H (12). Oh right, so H is the 12th note. Then, the next note after H is C again. So, the order is cyclic.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is map each note to its position in this list. For example, C is 0 (if we index from 0), or maybe 0-based or 1-based? Well, the distance between consecutive notes is 1 semitone. So, the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, but considering the direction. Wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper note. So, for example, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. Let's check: C is position 0, E is position 4. So 4-0 = 4. That's correct. But if we have E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because from E to C, you go up by 8 steps (since E is 4, then F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11), C (0) — wait, that's 8 steps? Wait, E to F is +1, E to F# is +2, etc. So from E to C, the distance is (C's position - E's position + 12) mod 12? No, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if you have two notes, X and Y, the distance is computed as (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). But since the notes are cyclic, the distance between X and Y is the minimal number of semitones when moving upwards from X to Y. Wait, no. The problem says that the distance between X and Y is taken from the lowest tone to the upper. So, for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. So, the distance is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but if Y is lower than X, then adding 12? Or perhaps the distance is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). So for example, between E (4) and C (0), the distance is (0 - 4 + 12) = 8. So yes, that's the case.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two notes. So, given two notes, X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y's index - X's index) if Y is higher than X, else (Y's index - X's index + 12). Wait, but that's equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12, but since the distance is measured as the number of",
