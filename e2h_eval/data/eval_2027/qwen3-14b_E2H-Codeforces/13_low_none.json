For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the notes are in a cyclic order of 12 notes. The order is given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, the problem mentions that after H comes C again. Also, the distance between consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tones. But when calculating distances, it's from the lower note to the higher. So for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me confirm: C to C# is 1, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4. Yes. So between C and E, there's 4 semitones. And between E and C, it's 8 semitones because you go the other way around.\n\nBut for the problem, when checking the triad, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. Because the triad is unordered. So for each possible permutation of the three notes, we need to check if they fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, the steps I need to do are:\n\n1. Convert the three input notes into their numerical positions in the scale. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11 (assuming the list is ordered as given). Wait, let me check the order again. The problem lists them as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is:\n\nIndices 0 to 11:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nWait, but the problem says that after H comes C again. So the next note after H is C. So the distance between H and C is 1 semitone. But when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the minimal way? Or is it based on the order? Wait, no. The problem says that the distance is taken from the lower note to the upper. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones from X to Y. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is calculated as the number of semitones from X to Y going the other way? Or is it that the distance is always the minimal?\n\nNo, the problem says that the distance is measured along the musical scale. For example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. Because when you go from E to C, you have to go through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 semitones. So the distance is not the minimal. It's always calculated in the direction from the lower note to the higher note. Wait, but how do you know which is lower? Because the notes are arranged in a cycle, but for the distance between two notes, the problem says that the distance is from the lower to the upper. So perhaps the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but only if Y is higher than X? Or maybe the problem defines the distance as the number of semitones when moving forward from X to Y, considering the cyclic nature. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones from the lower note to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then it's the difference. But if X is higher than Y, then it's (12 - (X - Y))? Or maybe the problem defines the distance as (Y - X) mod 12, but since the distance is from X to Y, but when X is higher than Y, you have to wrap around.\n\nWait, the example given says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's check that. If the notes are arranged in order, then E is at position 4, C is at 0. So the distance from E to C would be (0 - 4) mod 12? No, that's not. Wait, the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones when moving from X to Y along the scale. But how is that determined? For example, between C and E, moving forward gives 4",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves converting the notes into numerical positions within a 12-note scale and checking all permutations of the triad against the criteria for major and minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Notes to Numerical Positions**: Map each note to its corresponding index in the 12-note musical scale.\n2. **Check All Permutations**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if they form a major or minor chord based on the specified semitone distances.\n3. **Determine Chord Type**: A major chord has a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note. A minor chord has a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    scale = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return scale.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Calculate the distance from x to y and y to z\n    # Since the scale is cyclic, the distance is (y - x) % 12 and (z - y) % 12?\n    # Wait, no.

If no valid major or minor chord is found, it returns \"strange\".",
