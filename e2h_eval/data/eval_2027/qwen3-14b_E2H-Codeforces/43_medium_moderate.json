He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all 'a's, and there's at least one 'a'.\n2. B appends some number of 'b's. So after this step, the string has 'a's followed by 'b's. Also, there's at least one 'b' here. So the string must have both 'a's and 'b's at this point.\n3. Then C appends some number of 'c's. The number of 'c's added must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before adding the 'c's. Also, it's possible that the count of 'c's equals both, but that's just a special case.\n\nSo the final string must consist of a bunch of 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters in the string must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. If there's any other order, like a 'c' before a 'b', then it's invalid.\n\nSo first thing I need to check: the string must have all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. So the characters should be in groups. Like, the string should be something like a^x b^y c^z, where x >= 1, y >= 1, z >= 1. But wait, the initial steps: when B appends the 'b's, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So x >= 1, y >= 1. Then C adds z 'c's, which must be equal to x or y. Also, z must be >= 1 because the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. So the number of 'c's can't be zero. Because the problem says \"some number\", which implies at least one. Wait, but looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that when C appends the 'c's, the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string. So the original string before adding 'c's has some number of 'a's and 'b's. Let me think: when C appends the 'c's, the count of 'c's added is equal to the count of 'a's (before adding 'c's) or the count of 'b's (before adding 'c's). So, for example, if the original string before adding 'c's has x 'a's and y 'b's. Then the number of 'c's added is either x or y. So the total number of 'c's in the final string is z = x or z = y. But since C appends some number of 'c's, that number must be at least 1. So, in the final string, the count of 'c's is equal to x or y, which must be >= 1. But since x and y are each >= 1 (since A had at least one 'a' and B added at least one 'b'), then z is also >= 1. So the final string must have all three characters present. So the input string must contain at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nSo first, check if the string contains all three characters. If not, return NO.\n\nBut wait, what if the string is like 'aabb'? Then there's no 'c's. So that's invalid. So the first check is that the string has at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nBut then, the order must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So the string must be in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So for example, 'aabbc' is okay, but 'ababc' is not.\n\nSo how do I check that? Let's think: the string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So, the string can be divided into three parts. So, the first part is all a's, then comes all b's, then all c's. So, the characters must be in non-decreasing order according to their order in the alphabet. Because 'a' comes before 'b' which comes before 'c'. So, for example, the string must not have any 'b's before 'a's, or 'c's before 'b's, etc.\n\nWait, but the string is built by appending. So the order is a's first, then b's, then c's. So the entire string must be a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. So, the string must not have any 'c's before the 'b's, and no 'b's after the 'c's. So for example, 'aabcc' is okay, but 'abcb' is not.\n\nSo, the first step is to check that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. How can I check that?\n\nOne way is to check that the string is composed of a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's. So, for example, the string can be split into three parts. So, the first part is all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So, the transitions between characters can only be from a to b, then from b to c. So, for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b', etc.\n\nSo, perhaps we can check that the string is in the correct order by checking that all a's are before any b's, and all b's are before any c's. So, for example, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all a's. And the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all b's.\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is in the order of a's, then b's, then c's. For example, the string can be divided into three parts, and each part consists of only one character.\n\nSo, here's a plan: iterate through the string and check that the characters are in non-decreasing order according to their type. For example, once a 'b' is encountered, no 'a's can come after. Once a 'c' is encountered, no 'a's or 'b's can come after.\n\nAnother approach: check that the string is made up of a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's. So, the string can be split into three parts. Let me think about how to code that.\n\nLet me think of the string as being in three sections. For example, the first section is all a's. Then the second is all b's. Then the third is all c's. So, the string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So, for example, the string can be checked by checking that:\n\n- All characters before the first 'b' are 'a's.\n\n- All characters before the first 'c' are either 'a's or 'b's.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to check that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, for example, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all 'a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all 'b's.\n\nSo, let's find the positions where the characters change. For example, the string can be split into groups. Let's say the first group is all a's, then the second group is all b's, then the third group is all c's. So, the string must have exactly three groups, and the order must be a, b, c.\n\nBut what if the string has only a's and c's? Well, that would not be possible because B added some 'b's. So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\nSo, first, check that the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nThen, check that the order is correct.\n\nOnce that is done, then check the counts.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, check that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If not, return 'NO'.\n\nThen, check that the order is correct. For example, the string must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nHow to check this? Let's think of the string as a sequence. For example, once we see a 'b', all subsequent characters must be 'b's or 'c's. Once we see a 'c', all subsequent characters must be 'c's.\n\nSo, we can track the allowed characters. Initially, allowed characters are 'a's. Then, once a 'b' is encountered, allowed characters are 'b's and 'c's. Then, once a 'c' is encountered, allowed characters are 'c's.\n\nSo, here's a possible code approach:\n\nInitialize a variable that tracks the current allowed characters. Initially, it's 'a'. Then, when we see a 'b', the allowed characters become 'b' and 'c'. When we see a 'c', the allowed characters become 'c'.\n\nBut perhaps more simply, the string must be in non-decreasing order of the characters. Because 'a' < 'b' < 'c'. So, for example, the string must be such that each character is >= the previous one. Because the order is a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, the entire string must be in non-decreasing order. Wait, that's true. Because for example, the first part is a's, then b's, then c's. So, each character is >= the previous one. So, if the string is in non-decreasing order, then it's valid. However, the converse is not true. For example, a string like 'aabbc' is non-decreasing and valid. But if the string is 'aabcc', that's also non-decreasing. But if the string is 'abac', then it's not non-decreasing. So, checking that the string is non-decreasing would ensure that the order is correct. Because any transition from a to b to c is allowed, but no backtracking. So, the entire string must be non-decreasing. So, for example, the string 'aabbcc' is valid. 'aaabbbccc' is valid. But 'abba' would not be non-decreasing. So, this seems like a good way to check the order.\n\nSo, for the order check, we can check that the string is non-decreasing. So, for each i from 1 to len(s)-1, check that s[i] >= s[i-1]. If this is true for all, then the order is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbc'? That's non-decreasing. So yes. But what if the string is 'aabcb'? Then, the third character is 'b', then 'c', then 'b' again. So, the last 'b' is less than 'c', so the string is not non-decreasing. So, that's invalid. Which is correct, because the order is not a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\nSo, checking that the string is non-decreasing is sufficient for the order check. That's a good way to handle that.\n\nSo, the first two checks are:\n\n1. The string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\n2. The string is non-decreasing.\n\nIf either of these checks fail, return 'NO'.\n\nNow, assuming those are passed, then we need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts.\n\nThe string is made up of x a's, y b's, z c's. Where x >= 1, y >= 1, z >= 1.\n\nBut according to the process:\n\nAfter A and B, the string is x a's and y b's. Then C appends z c's, where z is equal to x or y.\n\nSo, in the final string, the number of c's (z) must be equal to x or y.\n\nBut in the final string, the counts are x a's, y b's, z c's. So, z must be equal to x or y.\n\nSo, for the given string, we can compute x, y, z as the counts of a, b, c respectively.\n\nThen, check whether z == x or z == y.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because when C appends the c's, the number of c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string before adding the c's. So, the number of a's and b's before adding the c's is x and y. So, the number of c's added is x or y. So, in the final string, the count of c's is exactly x or y. So, z must equal x or y.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input 'aaabccc':\n\ncount a's is 3, b's is 1, c's is 3. So z is 3. Which equals x (3). So valid.\n\nIn the third example, 'aabc' has counts a:2, b:1, c:1. So z=1 equals y (1). So valid.\n\nIn the second example, 'bbacc' — the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. But that's not non-decreasing. Because after the first two 'b's, there's an 'a' which is less than 'b'. So the order check would fail. Hence, output is 'NO'.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCheck that the string has all three characters. Check that the string is non-decreasing. Then check that the count of c's equals the count of a's or the count of b's.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbc' (counts a:2, b:2, c:1). Then z is 1. Which is not equal to x (2) or y (2). So that would be invalid. So the answer would be 'NO'.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nCheck that S contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If not, return 'NO'.\n\nCheck that the string is non-decreasing. If not, return 'NO'.\n\nCompute counts: count_a = number of 'a's, count_b = number of 'b's, count_c = number of 'c's.\n\nCheck if count_c equals count_a or count_b. If yes, return 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'abc'? Then counts are a:1, b:1, c:1. So count_c is 1, which equals count_a (1) and count_b (1). So it's valid. So the answer is 'YES'.\n\nAnother example: 'abcc' — counts a:1, b:1, c:2. So count_c is 2. Which is not equal to count_a (1) or count_b (1). So invalid. So answer is 'NO'.\n\nBut wait, what if the string is 'aabbcc'? Then count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c equals count_a and count_b. So valid. So answer is 'YES'.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts a:3, b:1, c:3. So c equals a. So yes.\n\nSample input 2: 'bbacc' → the string is not non-decreasing. So the order check fails. So output is 'NO'.\n\nSample input 3: 'aabc' → counts a:2, b:1, c:1. c equals b. So yes.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabcc'? Let's see. The counts are a:2, b:1, c:2. So count_c is 2. Which equals count_a (2). So valid. So answer is yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → counts a:1, b:3, c:1. c is 1, which equals count_a (1). So yes.\n\nWhat about 'abbbc' → the order is correct, non-decreasing. So yes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abc' → yes. 'abcc' → no. 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nSo, the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck if 'a' in S, 'b' in S, 'c' in S. If not, return 'NO'.\n\nCheck if the string is non-decreasing. How?\n\nWe can loop through the string and check that each character is >= the previous one.\n\nFor example:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        return 'NO'\n\nBut that's O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 5000.\n\nOnce that is done, compute counts of a, b, c.\n\nThen check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf yes, return 'YES', else 'NO'.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'aabbaacc'? Wait, but that's not non-decreasing. Because after the first two a's, then two b's, then a's again. So the third character is 'b' which is greater than 'a', but then the next character is 'a' which is less than 'b'. So the string is not non-decreasing. So the order check would catch that.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead S.\n\nif any of 'a', 'b', 'c' is missing → NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   check if the string is non-decreasing.\n\n   if not → NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      count_a = S.count('a')\n\n      count_b = S.count('b')\n\n      count_c = S.count('c')\n\n      if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n          return YES\n\n      else:\n\n          return NO\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aaabbbcc'? Let's see. The counts are a:3, b:3, c:2. Then count_c is 2. Which is not equal to a or b. So returns 'NO'.\n\nBut according to the process, the C appends the 'c's. So the number of 'c's is equal to the number of a's or b's in the string before adding the 'c's. So in this case, the original string before adding 'c's was 'aaabbb' (with 3 a's and 3 b's). Then C added 2 'c's. Which is not equal to 3 or 3. So invalid.\n\nSo code correctly returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother example: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a:4, b:4, c:4. So count_c is 4, which equals a and b. So returns 'YES'.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The first check for presence of a, b, c is okay. Then the non-decreasing check: the third character is 'a', which is less than the previous 'b' → the string is not non-decreasing. So returns 'NO'.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts a:2, b:2, c:2. So count_c equals a and b. So returns 'YES'.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → count_c is 2, which equals a's count (2). So yes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'abba'? It has a, b, c? No, no c. So first check fails. So returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nBut what about a string that has all three characters but the order is wrong. For example, 'abcb' → the order is not non-decreasing. So returns 'NO'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead S from input. Then:\n\nif 'a' not in S or 'b' not in S or 'c' not in S:\n\n    print('NO')\n\nelse:\n\n    check if the string is non-decreasing.\n\n    for i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n        if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n            print('NO')\n\n            exit\n\n    then compute counts.\n\n    count_a = S.count('a')\n\n    count_b = S.count('b')\n\n    count_c = S.count('c')\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print('YES')\n\n    else:\n\n        print('NO')\n\nBut wait, the code needs to check that the string is non-decreasing. So, in Python, perhaps:\n\ndef is_non_decreasing(s):\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if not is_non_decreasing(s):\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are a:2, b:2, c:2. So count_c is equal to both a and b. So returns yes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabcc' → count_c is 2, which is equal to a's count (2). So yes.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → a:3, b:1, c:3. So yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → the order is not non-decreasing. So returns no.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → counts a:2, b:1, c:1. So c equals b. So yes.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'a' → no, because it's missing b and c. So code returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → counts a:1, b:1, c:2. So c is not equal to a or b. So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → a:1, b:3, c:1. c equals a. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaacc' → the string is not non-decreasing. Because after the first two a's, then two b's, then a's again. So the third character is a 'b' (assuming the string is 'aabbaacc')? Wait, the string is 'aabbaacc' → let's check the order:\n\nCharacters are a, a, b, b, a, a, c, c. So the fifth character is a, which is less than the previous character (b). So the string is not non-decreasing. So the code returns no.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, what about a string that has all three characters, is non-decreasing, but the count_c is not equal to count_a or count_b?\n\nLike 'aabbc' → counts a:2, b:2, c:1. So count_c is 1, which is not equal to 2 or 2. So returns no.\n\nSo the code returns no.\n\nNow, what about the string 'abbbcc' → counts a:1, b:3, c:2. So c is 2, which is not equal to a (1) or b (3). So returns no.\n\nBut if the string is 'abbbccc' → counts a:1, b:3, c:3. So c equals b. So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in code, how to check the non-decreasing?\n\nIn Python:\n\ndef is_non_decreasing(s):\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nBut in the code, for the input, we can do:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # check non-decreasing\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are 2, 2, 2 → yes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' but the counts of c is 2, which equals count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aaabbbccc' → counts are 3,3,3 → yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a:4, b:4, c:4 → yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabb' → no, because no 'c's.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nBut let me think about the case where the string is 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. So c is equal to a and b. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → counts are 1,1,2. So c is not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → counts a:1, b:3, c:1. So c equals a. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → the string is non-decreasing. So code returns yes.\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by appending 'b's to a string of 'a's, followed by appending 'c's such that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before adding the 'c's. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Presence of Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Check Order**: The string must be in non-decreasing order of characters. This ensures that all 'a's come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's.\n3. **Check Counts**: After confirming the order, we check if the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if all three characters are present\nif 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check if the string is non-decreasing\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Presence Check**: The first condition checks if the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the string cannot be formed according to the problem's rules.\n2. **Order Check**: By iterating through the string and ensuring each character is not less than the previous one, we confirm that the string is in non-decreasing order. This ensures the correct sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's.\n3. **Count Check**: After validating the order, we count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The final check ensures the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's, which is a requirement based on the problem's constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, ensuring it handles the upper constraint of 5000 characters effectively.",
