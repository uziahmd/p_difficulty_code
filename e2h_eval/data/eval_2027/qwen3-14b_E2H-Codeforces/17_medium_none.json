He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the given prefixes and suffixes. And our job is to assign P or S to each input string such that there exists some s that matches.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find the correct assignments. Let's think about the possible approach.\n\nLet me think: For each possible candidate string s, check if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, for that s, assign P/S accordingly. But since n can be up to 100, trying all possibilities might not be feasible. Wait, but what's the possible number of candidates? Well, the original string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But how can I generate possible candidates?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find s based on the given strings. Because the original string s has all the proper prefixes and suffixes. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be parts of s. Also, the full string s must be such that all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input strings are exactly all the improper prefixes and suffixes of s. So, for example, for a string of length 5, there are 4 prefixes (lengths 1-4) and 4 suffixes (lengths 1-4). So the input has 8 strings, which are all of these, but mixed.\n\nSo, the key idea here is that the original string s must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. Therefore, the original s can be determined by looking for the string that has all the given strings as prefixes or suffixes. Once we find such an s, we can then assign P/S to each input string based on whether they are a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, considering that the original s must have exactly the given set of prefixes and suffixes. But how can we find s from the input?\n\nAnother approach: the original string s must be such that the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) are present in the input. Also, the original s must be the concatenation of the first character and the longest prefix (but that's not necessarily true). Alternatively, perhaps the original s can be found by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. Wait, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nThe input strings include \"abab\" (length 4) and \"baba\" (length 4). Since the original string is length 5, the longest prefix is of length 4, and the longest suffix is of length 4. The original string must be such that the longest prefix is a prefix of s, and the longest suffix is a suffix of s. So, for example, if the original s is \"ababa\", then the longest prefix is \"abab\" (length 4), and the longest suffix is \"baba\" (length 4). So combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix, perhaps the original s is the combination of the longest prefix and the longest suffix. But how? Because the longest prefix is of length n-1, and the longest suffix is of length n-1. So their overlap would be n-2 characters. So the original s can be constructed by taking the longest prefix and appending the last character of the longest suffix. Or vice versa?\n\nWait, for example, the original s is ababa. The longest prefix is abab (length 4), and the longest suffix is baba (length 4). The original s is formed by taking the longest prefix (abab) and adding the last character of the longest suffix (a). So abab + a = ababa. Similarly, taking the longest suffix (baba) and adding the first character of the longest prefix (a) gives a + baba = ababa. So that's how the original s can be reconstructed.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find the two strings of length n-1 in the input. Let's call them long_prefix_candidate and long_suffix_candidate. Then, the original s could be long_prefix_candidate + last character of long_suffix_candidate, or long_suffix_candidate + first character of long_prefix_candidate. But how do we know which one is correct?\n\nBut wait, the original s must have both of these as a prefix and suffix. So for example, if the original s is s = long_prefix_candidate + c, where c is the last character of the long_suffix_candidate. Then, the long_suffix_candidate must be a suffix of s. Let's see: the long_suffix_candidate is of length n-1, and s is of length n. So the suffix of length n-1 of s is s[1...n], which is the original s without the first character. So if the long_suffix_candidate is a suffix of s, then s must be equal to the long_suffix_candidate's first character plus the long_suffix_candidate. But that's only possible if the long_suffix_candidate is the suffix of s, which would imply that s starts with the first character of the long_suffix_candidate and ends with the long_suffix_candidate.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Let's think again. Suppose that the original s is of length n. The longest proper prefix (length n-1) is a prefix of s. The longest proper suffix (length n-1) is a suffix of s. So, the original s must be the concatenation of the longest proper prefix and one character (the last character of s), which is the same as the last character of the longest proper suffix. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, the original s must be such that the longest proper prefix (say, p) and the longest proper suffix (say, s) must overlap. For example, the original s can be formed by combining p and the last character of s. Or combining s and the first character of p. But how to choose between these options?\n\nWell, perhaps the correct s is the one that is the combination of the longest prefix and the last character of the longest suffix. But how do I know which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nWait, but the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes. So, for the original string s, the longest proper prefix (length n-1) is a prefix of s, and the longest proper suffix (length n-1) is a suffix of s. Therefore, the original s must be the longest proper prefix plus the last character of the longest proper suffix. Or the longest proper suffix plus the first character of the longest proper prefix. But which one is correct?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the longest proper prefix is \"abab\" (length 4) and the longest proper suffix is \"baba\" (length 4). So the original s is \"ababa\" which is \"abab\" + 'a' (the last character of \"baba\") or \"baba\" + 'a' (the first character of \"abab\" is 'a').\n\nSo in this case, both possibilities give the same s. But in other cases, perhaps they may differ. So how can we find the correct s?\n\nMaybe we can take the two strings of length n-1 from the input, and check both possibilities for s. Then, for each possible candidate s, check if all the other input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. If any of these candidates is valid, then proceed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all the strings of length n-1 in the input. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each of these two, try to form a possible s by combining with the other's first or last character.\n\nWait, no. For example, take the first string of length n-1 (let's call it A), and the second string of length n-1 (call it B). Then possible candidates for s are:\n\n- A + last character of B (since B is a suffix of s, so the last character of B is the last character of s).\n\n- B + last character of A (since A is a prefix of s, so the first character of A is the first character of s. Wait, no. If B is a suffix of s, then the suffix of s is B. So s is B's first character plus B? No, because B is of length n-1. So s is length n. So the suffix of length n-1 is B. That implies that s is equal to the first character of B followed by B? No, that would be length n-1 +1 = n. Wait, for example, if B is the suffix, then s is B with a character added in front. So for example, if B is 'baba', then s is x + 'baba', where x is a single character. But also, the longest proper prefix of s is A, which is of length n-1. So the prefix of s of length n-1 is A. Which would be the entire s except the last character. So, in that case, the s is A + (last character of B). Because the last character of B is the last character of s. So the prefix of length n-1 is A, which is s[0...n-2], which is A. And the suffix of length n-1 is B, which is s[1...n-1].\n\nSo for example, if s is A + c, then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1] = A[1...n-2] + c. Which must be equal to B. So in that case, B should be A[1...] + c. But how to find c? Well, c is the last character of B. Because B is the suffix of s, which is of length n-1. So B is s[1...n-1], which is the suffix of s. Therefore, the last character of B is the last character of s. So the s is A + (last character of B). \n\nSo for the first possibility, the candidate s is A + B[-1]. Similarly, the other possibility is B + A[-1]. Because if B is the suffix, then s is B's first character plus B? No, because the prefix of length n-1 is A. So for that case, the s is B + A's first character? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the other possibility is that B is the prefix and A is the suffix. Then, the same logic applies. So the candidate s would be B + A[-1], and also A + B[-1]. Wait, but how to decide which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nBut since the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes, the two strings of length n-1 must be one prefix and one suffix. So, for example, in the original string s, one of them is the prefix (length n-1) and the other is the suffix (length n-1). Therefore, the correct s is formed by combining the prefix (A) with the last character of the suffix (B) (since B is a suffix of s, so the last character of B is the last character of s). Similarly, if B is the prefix and A is the suffix, then s is B + last character of A.\n\nTherefore, the possible candidates for s are:\n\n- A + last character of B\n\n- B + last character of A\n\nWe need to check which of these candidates is valid, i.e., all other input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of this candidate.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate s, then we can assign P/S to each input string based on whether they are a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read all the input strings.\n\n2. Find the two strings of length n-1.\n\n3. Generate two possible candidates for s: candidate1 = A + last_char_of_B, candidate2 = B + last_char_of_A.\n\n4. For each candidate, check if all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of it.\n\n5. Once a valid candidate is found, assign P/S accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle cases where both candidates are valid? For example, in the third sample input, n=2, input strings are 'a' and 'c'. The two candidates would be 'a' + last_char_of_c (which is 'c') → 'ac', and 'c' + last_char_of_a → 'ca'. Both are valid. So the answer could be either PS or SP.\n\nBut the problem allows any valid assignment, so once we find any valid s, we can proceed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the given input, extract the two strings of length n-1.\n\n- Generate the two possible candidates for s.\n\n- For each candidate, check if all the input strings are either a prefix or suffix of it.\n\n- Once a valid candidate is found, proceed to assign P/S.\n\nNow, how to check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of the candidate s.\n\nBut how to do that? For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s or a suffix of s. If all of them are, then the candidate is valid.\n\nOnce we have a valid s, we can process the input strings, and for each, determine if it is a prefix or suffix of s. Then, assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the second sample input, the string is 'aaa'. All the input strings are 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'. For example, 'a' is both a prefix and suffix. But in that case, the problem allows us to assign either P or S as long as the overall assignment is correct.\n\nBut when building the answer, how to decide which to choose? Well, since the problem allows any valid assignment, as long as there exists at least one s that is consistent with the assignments, we can choose any. So for the strings that are both prefix and suffix, we can assign them as P or S as needed, but in practice, the code needs to assign them correctly based on the actual s.\n\nBut for the code, once we have the correct s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. However, there's a possibility that a string is both a prefix and suffix. In that case, the code can assign it as P or S, but the problem allows any choice as long as the overall assignments are correct.\n\nBut how to handle that? Well, in the code, when generating the answer, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Else, check if it's a suffix, assign S. But if it's both, then we can assign P or S. However, since the input strings are all proper prefixes and suffixes of s, but in the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to have exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for example, for the string of length 1, there are two entries. But for s, the length 1 prefix is the first character of s, and the length 1 suffix is the last character of s. So if the first and last characters of s are the same, then those two input strings are the same. But the problem says that the input is such that the given strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So perhaps the code can handle that by checking for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the sample input 2, the string is 'aaa'. So the input strings are a, aa, aa, a. For the string 'a', it is both a prefix and a suffix. But the code can assign it as P or S. However, since the problem requires that the number of P and S is equal (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, total 2n-2 strings), but the code will need to assign exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. So, for each input string, if it is both a prefix and a suffix, the code must choose whether to assign P or S, but in such a way that the total counts are correct.\n\nBut how can that be done? Well, in the code, once we have the correct s, we can for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then we can mark it as P. Otherwise, check if it is a suffix and mark as S. However, if it is both, then the code must choose between P or S. But how to ensure that the counts are correct?\n\nBut wait, the code can't just assign arbitrarily. For example, suppose there are multiple strings that are both prefixes and suffixes. How to decide which to assign as P or S to get the correct counts.\n\nBut perhaps in this scenario, the code can first assign all the strings that are unique (i.e., only prefix or only suffix) and then assign the ambiguous ones as needed.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can proceed by checking for each input string if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Else, check if it's a suffix, assign S. However, in cases where it's both, the code may assign P, but then the counts may not match. However, the problem states that the input is such that there exists at least one s that is consistent with the assignments. Therefore, in such cases, there must be a way to assign P and S such that the counts are correct.\n\nBut how to ensure that? For example, in the sample input 2, the correct s is 'aaa'. The input strings are a, a, aa, aa. For each of the input strings:\n\n- The two 'a's: each is a prefix and a suffix.\n\n- The two 'aa's: each is a prefix and a suffix.\n\nSo, the code can assign any combination of P and S as long as there are exactly 2 P's and 2 S's. For example, the sample output is 'PPSS', which assigns the first two a's as P and the two aa's as S. But other combinations are allowed.\n\nBut when the code is processing the input strings, how does it know which to assign? Well, perhaps the code can first collect all the input strings, and for each, check if it's a prefix. If it is, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. However, if a string is both, then the code can assign P. But then, if there are more P's than required, perhaps the code needs to adjust. But this seems complex.\n\nBut perhaps the problem guarantees that for the correct s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix, but not both. However, that's not necessarily the case. For example, the sample input 2 shows that some strings can be both.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed as follows: for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Else, check if it is a suffix of s. Assign S. If both, then assign P. This way, the code will assign P for strings that are both, and then the counts may vary. However, the problem says that there exists at least one valid assignment, but the code may not find it. How?\n\nBut perhaps, for the correct s, the number of prefixes and suffixes in the input is exactly n-1 for each. Therefore, even if some strings are both, the code can assign them as P or S in a way that the total counts are correct.\n\nBut how to handle that in code? For example, if the code assigns all ambiguous strings as P, but that leads to more than n-1 P's, then the code would have a problem.\n\nBut perhaps the code doesn't need to worry about this. Because, the input is guaranteed to be such that there exists at least one valid assignment. Therefore, for the correct s, the code can assign each input string as P if it is a prefix (even if it is also a suffix), and S otherwise. But in that case, the code may have overlapping assignments, but the counts would be correct.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input 2, the correct s is 'aaa'. For each of the input strings:\n\n- The first 'a' is a prefix (yes) and suffix (yes). Assign P.\n\n- The second 'a' is also a prefix and suffix. Assign P.\n\n- The first 'aa' is a prefix (yes) and suffix (yes). Assign P.\n\n- The second 'aa' is also a prefix and suffix. Assign P.\n\nThat would result in 4 P's and 0 S's, which is invalid. But the sample output shows that the correct answer is 'PPSS'.\n\nAh, so this approach is flawed. So, the code cannot just assign P whenever the string is a prefix. Because that would lead to incorrect counts.\n\nSo, how can this be handled?\n\nAlternative approach: for the correct s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of s. So, for each input string, it's either in the set of prefixes or in the set of suffixes. However, some strings may be in both sets. For example, the string 'a' in sample input 2 is both a prefix and a suffix of 'aaa'.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of all the prefixes and suffixes. So, for the original s, the set of prefixes and suffixes includes all the input strings. However, the input has exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1. For example, in sample input 2, for length 1, there are two 'a's. These correspond to the prefix of length 1 and the suffix of length 1. But since the first and last characters are the same, both are the same string. So, in this case, the code must assign one of them as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to distinguish between them? Since they are the same string, the code can't know which is which. However, the problem allows any valid assignment. So, for example, the code can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that programmatically?\n\nThe problem is that for the same string, which appears multiple times in the input, the code must assign some as P and others as S. But how to track that.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\nOnce the correct s is determined, for each input string, determine whether it is a prefix or a suffix. But in cases where it is both, the code must assign it as P or S, but ensuring that the total count of P and S is exactly n-1 each.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAn alternative approach is to first collect all the prefixes of s (excluding the full string s itself), and all the suffixes of s (excluding the full string). Then, for each input string, check if it's in the prefixes. If yes, assign P. Else, check if it's in the suffixes, assign S. However, this would work only if the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes. But since the input is guaranteed to be exactly the prefixes and suffixes, then each input string must be in either prefixes or suffixes.\n\nBut how to handle duplicates? For example, in sample input 2, the input strings are a, a, aa, aa. The prefixes of s (aaa) are a, aa, aaa. But since we are considering only proper prefixes, the prefixes are a, aa. Similarly for suffixes. So the input strings are exactly the proper prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, the two 'a's are both prefixes and suffixes. The two 'aa's are both prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSo, for the code, when checking whether a string is a prefix, it's possible that it's also a suffix. But how to decide which to assign.\n\nIn this case, the code can assign all of them as P, but that would result in 4 P's and 0 S's, which is invalid. Therefore, this approach is not sufficient.\n\nThus, the problem is that when a string is both a prefix and a suffix, the code needs to assign it as P or S, but in such a way that the total counts are correct.\n\nSo, the code must track how many P's and S's have been assigned so far, and when a string is both, decide whether to assign it as P or S based on that.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nPerhaps, the code can first collect all the input strings, and for each, determine whether it is a prefix or a suffix. Then, for those that are both, the code can assign them to whichever (P or S) is needed to balance the counts.\n\nBut how to do that in practice.\n\nLet me think of an algorithm:\n\nOnce the correct s is determined, for each input string:\n\n- Check if it's a prefix of s. Let's say, is_prefix = True if it is.\n\n- Check if it's a suffix of s. is_suffix = True if it is.\n\nThen, for each input string, the code must decide to assign 'P' or 'S'.\n\nBut how?\n\nIf the string is only a prefix (not a suffix), assign 'P'.\n\nIf it is only a suffix (not a prefix), assign 'S'.\n\nIf it is both, then assign 'P' or 'S' depending on the current counts.\n\nBut how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, the code can check whether it's a prefix of s, and if it is, add it to a list of possible prefixes. Similarly for suffixes. Then, for the input strings, the code can assign 'P' if it's in the prefix list, else 'S' if in the suffix list. However, since some strings may be in both lists, this approach would require that the code selects which one to use.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nPerhaps, the code can first generate the set of all prefixes of s (proper), and the set of all suffixes of s (proper). Then, for the input strings, each must be in the union of these two sets. Then, for each input string, if it's in the prefixes and not in the suffixes, assign P. If it's in the suffixes and not in the prefixes, assign S. If it's in both, then assign it to whichever (P or S) is needed to balance the counts.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nLet me think of the sample input 2 again. The s is 'aaa'. The prefixes of length 1 and 2 are 'a' and 'aa'. The suffixes of length 1 and 2 are 'a' and 'aa'. So the set of prefixes is {'a', 'aa'}, and the set of suffixes is {'a', 'aa'}.\n\nThe input strings are ['a', 'a', 'aa', 'aa'].\n\nNow, for each input string, the code must assign P or S such that there are exactly 2 P's and 2 S's.\n\nOne approach is to first assign all strings that are in the prefixes but not in the suffixes (but in this case, none), then assign those in the suffixes but not in the prefixes (also none), and then for the remaining (those in both), assign them to P or S as needed.\n\nBut since all are in both, the code needs to distribute them between P and S. For example, assign two as P and two as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can:\n\n- Create a list of all input strings.\n\n- For each string, determine if it's a prefix, suffix, both, or neither (but the input is guaranteed to be valid, so neither is impossible).\n\n- For the strings that are in both, we can count how many are there, and then assign them to P or S as needed to reach the required total of n-1 P's and S's.\n\nBut how to track the required counts.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem of counting.\n\nThe total number of P's required is n-1, and the same for S's.\n\nLet's imagine that for each input string, the code can assign it to P or S, but for those that are in both, we need to choose.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nOnce s is determined:\n\n- For all input strings, compute which are prefixes (P_candidates) and which are suffixes (S_candidates).\n\nBut note that some strings are in both.\n\n- The total number of P's needed is n-1.\n\n- The number of strings that are only prefixes (exclusive) is (number of prefixes) - (number of strings in both).\n\nSimilarly for S's.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, we can determine if it is a prefix (possibly also a suffix). Then, the code can first assign all the exclusive prefixes and exclusive suffixes, then handle the overlapping ones.\n\nBut how to find exclusive prefixes and suffixes.\n\nFor example, for the input strings, the code can:\n\ncount_p = number of input strings that are prefixes but not suffixes.\n\ncount_s = number of input strings that are suffixes but not prefixes.\n\ncount_both = number of input strings that are both.\n\nThen, the required number of P's is n-1. The required number of S's is n-1.\n\nThe count_p + count_both_p (the number of both strings assigned as P) must equal n-1.\n\nSimilarly, count_s + count_both_s (number of both strings assigned as S) must equal n-1.\n\nBut since count_p + count_s + count_both = 2n-2 (the total number of input strings), and count_p + count_s + count_both = 2n-2.\n\nBut how to find count_p and count_s.\n\nAlternatively, the code can:\n\nFor each input string:\n\nif it is a prefix and not a suffix: assign P.\n\nif it is a suffix and not a prefix: assign S.\n\nif it is both: add to a list of ambiguous strings.\n\nOnce that is done, the number of P's so far is count_p, and the number of S's is count_s. The ambiguous strings need to be assigned to P or S to reach the required totals.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nrequired_p = n-1\n\ncurrent_p = count_p\n\nrequired_s = n-1\n\ncurrent_s = count_s\n\nambiguity_count = len(ambiguous_strings)\n\nThe number of P's needed from ambiguous strings is required_p - current_p.\n\nSimilarly, the number of S's needed is required_s - current_s.\n\nBut since required_p = required_s = n-1, and current_p + current_s + ambiguity_count = 2n-2.\n\nBut required_p - current_p + required_s - current_s = 2(n-1) - (current_p + current_s) = 2(n-1) - (2n-2 - ambiguity_count) ) = 2n-2 - (2n-2 - ambiguity_count) ) = ambiguity_count.\n\nSo the number of P's needed from ambiguous is (n-1 - current_p), and the number of S's needed is (n-1 - current_s). But since current_p + current_s + ambiguity_count = 2n-2, and required_p = n-1, required_s = n-1, the sum of (n-1 - current_p) + (n-1 - current_s) = 2(n-1) - (current_p + current_s) = ambiguity_count.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code can assign the ambiguous strings as follows: assign (n-1 - current_p) of them as P, and the rest as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code.\n\nOnce the ambiguous list is built, the code can take the first (n-1 - current_p) of them and assign P, and the rest as S.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each input string, we check if it is a prefix and/or suffix.\n\nWe create:\n\nexclusive_p: list of strings that are prefixes but not suffixes.\n\nexclusive_s: list of strings that are suffixes but not prefixes.\n\nambiguous: list of strings that are both.\n\nThen, the number of P's needed from ambiguous is (n-1 - len(exclusive_p)).\n\nWe assign that number of ambiguous strings to P, and the rest to S.\n\nThis way, the total number of P's is len(exclusive_p) + (n-1 - len(exclusive_p)) ) = n-1.\n\nSimilarly for S's.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in sample input 2:\n\nexclusive_p is empty, exclusive_s is empty, ambiguous is all four strings.\n\nn-1 is 2. So required_p is 2.\n\ncurrent_p is 0. So need to assign 2 ambiguous strings as P, and the remaining 2 as S.\n\nThus, the code can assign the first two ambiguous strings as P, the next two as S. Which would give the output PPSS, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, generate the exclusive_p, exclusive_s, and ambiguous lists. Then assign accordingly.\n\nSo, now the steps for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings into a list.\n\nFind the two strings of length n-1.\n\nGenerate the two possible candidates for s: candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nFor each candidate, check if all the input strings are either prefix or suffix of it.\n\nOnce a valid candidate is found, proceed.\n\nOnce the candidate is found, process the input strings as follows:\n\nFor each input string, check:\n\nis_prefix = (string is a prefix of s)\n\nis_suffix = (string is a suffix of s)\n\nif is_prefix and not is_suffix: add to exclusive_p.\n\nelif is_suffix and not is_prefix: add to exclusive_s.\n\nelse: add to ambiguous.\n\nThen, calculate the number of P's needed from ambiguous: needed_p = (n-1) - len(exclusive_p).\n\nAssign the first 'needed_p' elements of ambiguous to P, the rest to S.\n\nThen, construct the output string by combining the exclusive_p (each marked as P), exclusive_s (each marked as S), and the ambiguous strings assigned as per above.\n\nBut how to track the order of the input strings. Because the code must output the P/S in the same order as the input strings.\n\nAh, right. The code must process each input string in the order they were given, and for each, determine whether it's P or S.\n\nSo, the previous approach of grouping the strings into exclusive_p, exclusive_s, ambiguous is not sufficient, since the code needs to know for each input string in the original order what its assignment is.\n\nTherefore, the code must process each input string in the original order, and for each, determine whether it's P or S.\n\nThus, the approach would be:\n\nOnce the correct s is found, for each input string in the original order:\n\nCheck if it's a prefix of s. Check if it's a suffix of s.\n\nIf it's a prefix and not a suffix: assign P.\n\nIf it's a suffix and not a prefix: assign S.\n\nElse, it's both. Add to a list of ambiguous strings.\n\nOnce all input strings are processed, collect the ambiguous strings and determine how many need to be assigned as P and S.\n\nBut how to track which ambiguous strings are which in the original order.\n\nThis seems complicated. So perhaps, during the initial processing, for each input string, we can store whether it is a prefix, suffix, or both. Then, during the assignment phase, we can iterate through all the input strings again and assign P/S accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle the ambiguous strings.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each input string in the original order, we can determine if it's a prefix, suffix, or both. We can store this information as a list of tuples, like (is_prefix, is_suffix).\n\nThen, we can collect all the ambiguous strings (those with both is_prefix and is_suffix true) in the order they appear in the input.\n\nThen, we need to assign P or S to them such that the total number of P's is n-1.\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\ncount_p = number of input strings that are exclusively prefix.\n\ncount_s = number of input strings that are exclusively suffix.\n\nambiguity_count = total number of ambiguous strings.\n\nWe need to assign (n-1 - count_p) of the ambiguous strings as P, and the rest as S.\n\nSo, during the assignment, for each input string:\n\nif it's exclusive prefix: assign P.\n\nif it's exclusive suffix: assign S.\n\nif ambiguous: decide whether to assign P or S based on how many are left to assign as P.\n\nThus, during the assignment process, we can keep a counter for how many ambiguous strings are left to be assigned as P.\n\nLet me think of code steps:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, and for each input string, we have stored whether it's a prefix, suffix, or both.\n\nInitialize a variable needed_p = (n-1) - count_exclusive_p.\n\nThen, for each input string in order:\n\nif it's exclusive prefix: assign P.\n\nelif it's exclusive suffix: assign S.\n\nelse:\n\n   if needed_p > 0:\n\n      assign P, decrement needed_p.\n\n   else:\n\n      assign S.\n\nThis way, the total number of P's is count_exclusive_p + (needed_p_initial - needed_p_final) = count_exclusive_p + (needed_p_initial) ?\n\nWait, needed_p_initial is (n-1 - count_exclusive_p). Initially, needed_p is that value. For each ambiguous string that is assigned P, needed_p decreases by 1. At the end, needed_p is zero.\n\nBecause, the total number of ambiguous strings is ambiguity_count. The number of P's to assign from ambiguous is needed_p_initial. So, after assigning them, needed_p becomes zero.\n\nYes. Thus, this approach works.\n\nFor example, in sample input 2, count_exclusive_p is 0, needed_p_initial is 2. For each ambiguous string, assign P until needed_p reaches zero.\n\nThus, the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves reconstructing the original string `s` from the given input and then classifying each input string as either a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix Candidates**: The input contains exactly two strings of each length from 1 to `n-1`. The longest proper prefixes and suffixes (of length `n-1`) are crucial for reconstructing the original string `s`.\n2. **Generate Possible Candidates for `s`**: Using the two strings of length `n-1`, generate two possible candidates for `s` by appending the last character of one string to the other.\n3. **Validate Candidates**: Check which of the generated candidates is valid by ensuring all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n4. **Classify Input Strings**: Once a valid candidate `s` is found, classify each input string as a prefix or suffix of `s`. Handle cases where a string can be both a prefix and a suffix by balancing the counts of 'P' and 'S'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_prefix(s, candidate):\n    return candidate == s[:len(candidate)]\n\ndef is_suffix(s, candidate):\n    return candidate == s[-len(candidate):]\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    long_strings = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == n-1:\n            long_strings.append(s)\n    \n    # Generate possible candidates for s\n    candidate1 = long_strings[0] + long_strings[1][-1]\n    candidate2 = long_strings[1] + long_strings[0][-1]\n    \n    # Check which candidate is valid\n    def is_valid(candidate):\n        for s in strings:\n            if not is_prefix(candidate, s) and not is_suffix(candidate, s):\n                return False\n        return True\n    \n    valid_candidate = None\n    if is_valid(candidate1):\n        valid_candidate = candidate1\n    elif is_valid(candidate2):\n        valid_candidate = candidate2\n    else:\n        # This should not happen as per problem statement\n        pass\n    \n    s = valid_candidate\n    \n    # Now process each input string to determine P/S\n    result = []\n    count_exclusive_p = 0\n    needed_p = (n-1) - count_exclusive_p  # will be adjusted later\n    \n    # First pass: collect info about each string\n    is_prefix_list = []\n    is_suffix_list = []\n    for st in strings:\n        prefix = is_prefix(s, st)\n        suffix = is_suffix(s, st)\n        is_prefix_list.append(prefix)\n        is_suffix_list.append(suffix)\n    \n    # Second pass: assign P/S\n    needed_p = (n-1) - sum(1 for i in range(len(strings)) if is_prefix_list[i] and not is_suffix_list[i])\n    for i in range(len(strings)):\n        if is_prefix_list[i] and not is_suffix_list[i]:\n            result.append('P')\n        elif is_suffix_list[i] and not is_prefix_list[i]:\n            result.append('S')\n        else:\n            # ambiguous case\n            if needed_p > 0:\n                result.append('P')\n                needed_p -= 1\n            else:\n                result.append('S')\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Long Strings**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for constructing the original string `s`.\n3. **Generating Candidates**: Two possible candidates for `s` are generated by appending the last character of one long string to the other.\n4. **Validation**: Each candidate is validated by checking if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n5. **Classification**: For each input string, determine if it is a prefix, suffix, or both.
