He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine for each given string whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string. The input gives me 2n-2 strings, which are all the improper prefixes and suffixes of some string s of length n. My job is to assign each of these strings as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there's at least one possible s that fits.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the original string s could be. Because once I know s, I can check each input string to see if it's a prefix or suffix of s, then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do I find s? Well, the original string s must have all the given strings as its prefixes or suffixes. So, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be part of the input. But since there are two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, maybe the longest ones can help.\n\nWait, for a string of length n, the longest proper prefix is of length n-1, and the same for the suffix. So among the input strings, there are two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the prefix, and the other must be the suffix. But how do I know which is which?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original string can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, if I take the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1), then the original string s must be such that the prefix is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1]. So combining these two, the original string s would be the first string (prefix) plus the last character of the suffix. Wait, but the prefix is length n-1, and the suffix is also length n-1. So the first n-1 characters of s is the prefix, and the last n-1 characters is the suffix. Therefore, the original string s must be the prefix plus the last character of the suffix. But wait, the suffix is the last n-1 characters. So the first character of the suffix is s[1], and the last character is s[n-1]. So the original string is the prefix (s[0..n-2]) and then the suffix's last character (s[n-1]). But how do I find that?\n\nAlternatively, the original string can be found by taking the longest prefix and the longest suffix. For example, suppose the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S. Then, the original string must be P + last character of S. Or maybe S + first character of P? Wait, no. Let me think: the longest proper prefix is of length n-1. So that's s[0...n-2]. The longest proper suffix is of length n-1, which is s[1...n-1]. So the original string s is s[0] + s[1...n-2] + s[n-1]. So the first n-1 characters are the prefix, and the last n-1 characters are the suffix. Therefore, the first character of the prefix is s[0], the last character of the suffix is s[n-1]. So the original string s is the prefix concatenated with the last character of the suffix. But wait, the prefix is length n-1, and the suffix is also length n-1. So the prefix is s[0..n-2], the suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the original string s is the prefix's first n-1 characters plus the last character of the suffix. Wait, the suffix is s[1..n-1], so its last character is s[n-1]. So the original string is prefix + s[n-1], but the prefix is s[0..n-2], which is length n-1. So the original string s is (prefix) + (suffix's last character). But how do I find which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nAlternatively, for the two strings of length n-1, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Let's call them A and B. Then, the original string s must be A concatenated with the last character of B. But also, B must be the suffix of s. So B must be equal to s[1..n-1]. Which would be s[1..n-1] = B. But s is A concatenated with B's last character. So s is A + B[-1]. Therefore, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:] which is (A[1:] + B[-1]). So B must equal A[1:] + B[-1]. Let me see:\n\nLet me write A as a string of length n-1. Let me say that s is A + x, where x is the last character of s. Then, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:] = A[1:] + x. But this must be equal to B. So B must be equal to A[1:] + x. However, since x is the last character of s, which is the same as the last character of B. Because B is s[1..n-1], which ends with x. So B's last character is x. Therefore, B must be equal to A[1:] + (last character of B). Which implies that B's first n-2 characters are A[1:], and the last character is B's last character. That's always true. So that condition is automatically satisfied. Therefore, for any pair of A and B (the two strings of length n-1), we can construct a candidate s as A + B[-1], and check whether B is indeed the suffix of s. But wait, since B is supposed to be the suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1], which is A[1:] + B[-1]. So B must be equal to A[1:] + B[-1]. Which implies that B's first n-2 characters are A[1:] and the last character is B[-1]. Which is obviously true. Therefore, for any pair of A and B (the two length n-1 strings), constructing s as A + B[-1] will make B be the suffix of s. But then, the original string s must also have A as a prefix (which it does, since it's the first n-1 characters). So this suggests that for any pair of the two length n-1 strings, we can generate a candidate s. But how do we know which one is the correct one?\n\nWait, but there may be multiple candidates. For example, in the first sample input, the two strings of length 4 (since n=5) are 'abab' and 'baba'. Let's take A as 'abab' and B as 'baba'. Then s would be A + B[-1] = 'abab' + 'a' → 'ababa'. Then the suffix of length 4 is 'baba', which matches B. So that works. Alternatively, if we took A as 'baba' and B as 'abab', then s would be 'baba' + 'b' → 'babab'. Now the suffix of length 4 is 'abab' (from position 1 to 4), which is B. So that would also work. So there are two possibilities for s. However, in the sample input, the correct s is 'ababa', which is the first case. So why is that the correct one? Because the other possibilities may not be compatible with the rest of the input strings.\n\nAh, right. Because the other input strings (of shorter lengths) must be prefixes or suffixes of s. So, for each candidate s generated by choosing the two length n-1 strings as A and B, we need to check that all the other input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. If there's at least one such s, then we can proceed with that.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Find all possible candidates for the original string s. Each candidate is generated by taking the two strings of length n-1, and for each possible pairing (A as prefix, B as suffix) and (B as prefix, A as suffix), create s as A + B[-1] and B + A[-1], respectively.\n\nWait, no. Because for each pair of the two length n-1 strings (say, A and B), we can try both possibilities:\n\nCase 1: A is the prefix (so the original string is A + B's last character).\n\nCase 2: B is the prefix (so the original string is B + A's last character).\n\nThen, for each of these possible s, check whether all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. If there's at least one such s, then we can use that to assign P and S to the input strings.\n\nOnce we have such an s, then we can go through each input string and check if it's a prefix of s (then assign P) or a suffix (assign S). However, note that some input strings may be both a prefix and a suffix of s. For example, in the second sample input, the string 'a' is both a prefix and suffix of 'aaa'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, Ivan's input has exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1. So for each length, there are two entries. But when we generate s, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), exactly one of the two strings must be a prefix and the other must be a suffix. But perhaps in some cases, both are prefixes and suffixes. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there's at least one s that satisfies the conditions.\n\nSo the steps I need to perform are:\n\nFor the given input, generate all possible candidate s's. For each candidate, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. Once such an s is found, then assign P/S accordingly.\n\nBut how to generate the candidate s's?\n\nFirst, collect all the input strings. Then, for the two strings of length n-1, try both possibilities:\n\nTake the two strings of length n-1, say, str1 and str2. Then:\n\nCandidate 1: s_candidate = str1 + str2[-1]\n\nCheck if str2 is a suffix of s_candidate (since str2 is supposed to be the suffix of length n-1). But since we built it that way, it's guaranteed. But also, for the other input strings, they must be prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\nSimilarly, Candidate 2: s_candidate = str2 + str1[-1]. Check if str1 is a suffix of s_candidate. Again, since we built it that way, it's guaranteed. But again, need to check other input strings.\n\nBut how do I know which of the two (str1 and str2) are the ones of length n-1?\n\nSo first, I need to process the input and group the strings by their lengths. Then, for the length n-1, there are exactly two strings. Let's call them candidates.\n\nOnce I have those two, I can generate the possible s_candidate for each possible pairing.\n\nOnce I have a valid s_candidate (i.e., all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it), then I can proceed to assign P and S.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate?\n\nFor each input string, check whether it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with the string) or a suffix (ends with the string). If for all input strings, at least one of these is true, then the s_candidate is valid.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, then the answer can be generated by checking each input string against s_candidate.\n\nNow, the problem is that there may be multiple possible s_candidates. For example, in the third sample input, n=2, the input strings are 'a' and 'c'. The two possible s_candidates are 'ac' and 'ca'. Both are valid. So when generating the output, any assignment that is consistent with either of them is acceptable.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nLoop through all possible s_candidate generated from the two length n-1 strings (each possible pairing as prefix and suffix). For each candidate, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it. Once a valid candidate is found, proceed to assign P/S based on that.\n\nOnce we have such a candidate, we can generate the output string by checking for each input string whether it is a prefix of s_candidate (then assign P) or a suffix (assign S). However, note that some input strings may be both a prefix and a suffix. In such cases, we can choose either P or S, but the problem allows any valid assignment. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have at least one valid solution, so there must be a way to assign P/S for each string.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the second sample input, the string 'a' is both a prefix and suffix of 'aaa'. So for that input string, we can assign either P or S. However, since there are exactly two strings for each length, and for each length, exactly one must be a prefix and one a suffix. So for example, for length 1, there are two strings (in the second sample input, 'a' and 'a'). But since the original string is 'aaa', both are prefixes and suffixes. However, since there are two strings of length 1, one must be marked as P and the other as S. But since they are the same, it doesn't matter. So in such a case, the code can assign P to one and S to the other.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nOnce we have a valid s_candidate, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. But wait, what if it is both a prefix and a suffix? Then, we can choose either. However, the problem says that the answer can be any valid one. So for such cases, the code can choose either. But how to ensure that for each length, exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input contains exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1. And the output must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. So for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each length, the two input strings must be one prefix and one suffix of s_candidate. So when we check for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate, but not both (but perhaps in some cases, both are possible, but the problem says that the input is valid, so there exists at least one s_candidate where for each length, exactly one is prefix and the other is suffix).\n\nSo in practice, when checking for each input string, it's possible that a string is both a prefix and a suffix of s_candidate. However, in that case, the code can choose to assign it as P or S, but the other string of the same length must be assigned the opposite.\n\nBut how to ensure that for each length, exactly one is P and the other is S? Because the code may assign both to P, which would be invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for the correct s_candidate, for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings of that length is a prefix of s_candidate, and the other is a suffix. Therefore, when checking for the input strings, for each length l, exactly one of the two is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix, but not both. So in that case, when checking for each input string, if it's a prefix, assign P, else assign S.\n\nBut how to confirm that? Because for example, in the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, but for that length, the other string is not. For example, suppose s_candidate is 'aaa', and for length 1, there are two input strings 'a' and 'a'. Both are prefixes and suffixes. But the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S. So in that case, the code can assign P to one and S to the other.\n\nBut how to do that? Because when checking for the first 'a', it's a prefix, so assign P. Then for the second 'a', it's also a prefix, but the code would assign P again, which would make two P's for that length, which is invalid. But the problem says that the input is valid, and that there exists at least one s_candidate where for each length, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, in that case, the code must choose between P and S for the two same strings. How to do that?\n\nBut perhaps in the code, for each input string, when checking whether it's a prefix or suffix, we can prioritize prefix. But that may not work in all cases. Alternatively, perhaps for the code, when building the answer, for each input string, if it is a prefix, assign P, else assign S. But in cases where both are possible, but the other string of the same length is not, that's handled by the fact that the input is valid. For example, for the two 'a's in the second sample input, when s_candidate is 'aaa', each of them is both prefix and suffix. But the code can assign one as P and the other as S. However, if the code checks for prefix first, then both would be marked as P, leading to two P's for length 1, which is invalid. But according to the problem statement, the input is valid, so there must be at least one s_candidate where for each length, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. However, in this case, the code may have generated a s_candidate where for that length, both are prefixes and suffixes. How to resolve this?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is wrong in the way it selects the s_candidate. Let me think again. Suppose the input is for n=3, and the two strings of length 2 are 'aa' and 'aa'. Then the original string must be 'aaa', because the proper prefixes and suffixes are 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'. So in this case, the two strings of length 2 are both 'aa', which are both prefixes and suffixes of 'aaa'. So when generating the answer, for each of these two strings, we need to assign one as P and the other as S. However, the code's approach of checking if it's a prefix (and assigning P) would assign both as P, which is invalid.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nThe problem here is that the code's method of checking whether the string is a prefix or suffix may not be sufficient to distinguish between the two. So perhaps the code needs to find for each length l, which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. But how?\n\nAn alternative approach: once we have the correct s_candidate, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two input strings. For each of these two, check if they are a prefix of s_candidate. Exactly one of them should be a prefix (since the original string has exactly one prefix of each length l). Similarly, exactly one of them should be a suffix. Therefore, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Therefore, even if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, the other string of the same length must be neither. Wait, but that's not possible. For example, in the case of s_candidate 'aaa', the two strings of length 1 are both 'a', and both are prefixes and suffixes. However, according to the problem statement, the input is valid, which implies that there exists at least one s_candidate where for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. However, in this example, the input is valid, but for the s_candidate 'aaa', both are both prefix and suffix. How to resolve this?\n\nAh, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So in this case, there must be a way to assign P and S. But how? Because for each length, the two strings are the same. So for the two strings of length 1, we can assign one as P and the other as S. Since they are the same, it doesn't matter. So the code can just assign one as P and the other as S regardless of their actual status.\n\nSo perhaps the code can proceed as follows: once the s_candidate is found, for each input string, check whether it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. However, in cases where both are prefixes (like the two 'a's in the example), this would assign both as P. Which is invalid. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is that the code needs to ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is assigned as P and the other as S. How to do that?\n\nAlternative idea: group the input strings by their lengths. For each length l, collect the two strings. Then, for each length l, check which of the two is the prefix of s_candidate (there should be exactly one), and assign that as P, and the other as S.\n\nBut how to find which one is the prefix. Because for example, in the case of s_candidate 'aaa' and two strings of length 1 being 'a' and 'a', both are prefixes. So how to choose which one is P and which is S?\n\nWell, the problem allows any valid assignment. So in this case, the code can choose arbitrarily. For example, for each length l, check if the first string in the group is a prefix. If yes, assign P to it and S to the other. Else, assign S to the first and P to the other. But how to ensure that exactly one is a prefix?\n\nWait, the input is guaranteed to be valid, meaning that for the correct s_candidate, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix of s_candidate, and the other is a suffix. So even if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, the other string is not. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the case of the two 'a's in the example, both are prefixes and suffixes. But according to the problem statement, the input is valid. So how can that be?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem statement's input is guaranteed to be valid. So for the correct s_candidate, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But in the example where the two strings are the same, how can that be?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the original string is 'aaa' (n=3). Then the proper prefixes and suffixes are:\n\nLength 1: 'a' (prefix), 'a' (suffix).\n\nLength 2: 'aa' (prefix), 'aa' (suffix).\n\nSo for each length, the two strings are the same. Therefore, for each length, both are prefixes and suffixes. But the problem says that the input is valid. However, according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. Therefore, in this case, the code can assign for each length, one as P and one as S. So for example, for the two 'a's, assign one as P and the other as S. Even though both are prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSo the code must find for each length l, which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. However, when both are prefixes and suffixes, how to decide?\n\nThe answer is that the code can choose either. So, for example, for each length l, check if the first string is a prefix. If yes, assign P to it and S to the other. If not, assign S to it and P to the other. But in cases where both are prefixes, the code can choose to assign P to the first and S to the second.\n\nBut how to find which one is the prefix? Because in the case where both are prefixes, the code can't tell. However, the problem allows any valid assignment. So, for the code, the approach is:\n\nOnce we have the correct s_candidate, for each length l, collect the two strings. For each of the two strings, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. Exactly one of them should be a prefix (since the original string has exactly one prefix of each length). But in cases where both are prefixes, this is not true. However, according to the problem's input validity, this scenario can't happen. Because the input is generated from a valid string. So for example, in the case of s_candidate 'aaa', the two strings of length 1 are both 'a', which are prefixes and suffixes. But in this case, the original string's prefixes of length 1 is 'a', and the suffixes of length 1 is 'a'. So the input has two copies of 'a' for length 1. So when generating the answer, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each length l, group the two input strings. For each group, check which of the two is a prefix of s_candidate. If exactly one is a prefix, assign that as P and the other as S. If both are prefixes (which can only happen if they are the same string), then assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nIn code, for each group (for each length l), we can check for each string in the group whether it's a prefix. If exactly one is, assign accordingly. If both are, then assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to check if a string is a prefix. For example, in the case of the two 'a's, both are prefixes. So for the group, we can assign the first as P and the second as S.\n\nBut how to track which input strings belong to which group. So the code can first group the input strings by their lengths. Then, for each group, process the two strings.\n\nBut the code needs to generate the output string in the same order as the input. So the code must remember the order of the input strings.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nOnce the correct s_candidate is found:\n\n- For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, mark as P. Else, mark as S.\n\nBut in cases where both strings of a certain length are prefixes (like two 'a's), this approach would mark both as P, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to handle this scenario. So the code must ensure that for each length, exactly one of the two strings is marked as P and the other as S.\n\nTo do this, the code can:\n\nFor each length l, collect the two input strings. For each of these two strings, check if they are prefixes of s_candidate. If exactly one is a prefix, assign P to that and S to the other. If both are prefixes (which implies they are the same string), assign P to one and S to the other. Similarly, if neither is a prefix, then they must be suffixes. But according to the input validity, exactly one of the two must be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nBut how to handle this in code?\n\nAlternative approach: for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, assign P. Else, assign S. However, after doing this, for each length l, check that exactly one is P and the other is S. If not, then there's a problem. But since the input is valid, this should not happen. However, in the case where both are prefixes (same string), the code would assign both as P. Which is invalid. Therefore, the code must handle this case.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the code can, for each length l, check which of the two strings is the correct prefix. For example, the original string's prefix of length l is unique. So for each l, there is exactly one string that is the prefix. Therefore, in the input, one of the two strings must be that prefix. So for each l, the code can check which of the two strings is the prefix of s_candidate. If both are, then they are the same string, and we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each length l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   get the two strings in the input for this length.\n\n   check if the first string is a prefix of s_candidate.\n\n   check if the second string is a prefix of s_candidate.\n\n   if exactly one is a prefix, assign P to that one and S to the other.\n\n   else (both are or none are):\n\n      if both are:\n\n         assign P to first, S to second.\n\n      else (none are):\n\n         assign S to first, P to second.\n\nBut how can none be a prefix? Because the input is valid, and the s_candidate is correct. So for each length l, exactly one of the two strings must be a prefix or a suffix. But if none are prefixes, then they must be suffixes. But how to check that?\n\nBut for the correct s_candidate, for each length l, one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix (or suffix). However, the code can't know which, but can check for prefix and suffix.\n\nBut perhaps the code can check for both prefix and suffix. For example, for each string in the group, check if it is a prefix or a suffix. But for the correct s_candidate, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each string in the group, exactly one of the following is true: it is a prefix or it is a suffix.\n\nBut how to determine which is which?\n\nAlternative idea: for each group (length l), the correct prefix of length l is the one that is the prefix of s_candidate. The correct suffix is the one that is the suffix of s_candidate. Therefore, for the group, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for the code, for each group, check which is the prefix and assign P to it, and S to the other.\n\nBut how to check that? For example, in the case where both are prefixes (same string), then they are both prefixes and suffixes. So how to decide which to assign as P?\n\nBut since the code is allowed to choose any valid assignment, the code can choose arbitrarily. For example, for the group, assign P to the first string and S to the second, regardless of their status.\n\nBut how to ensure that for the group, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the s_candidate is found, for each input string, check whether it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, this may lead to multiple P's for the same length. To handle that, the code must group the input strings by length, and for each group, ensure that exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nMaybe the code can first collect all the input strings, grouped by their length. Then, for each group, check which of the two strings is the prefix (if any) and assign accordingly. For example:\n\nFor group l:\n\nstrings = [s1, s2]\n\nif s1 is a prefix of s_candidate:\n\n   assign P to s1, S to s2\n\nelif s2 is a prefix of s_candidate:\n\n   assign P to s2, S to s1\n\nelse:\n\n   # both are not prefixes. So they must be suffixes. But how to choose?\n\n   assign S to s1 and P to s2? No, because then for the group, both are suffixes, which would imply that both are suffixes, which would mean that the code is assigning both as S or both as P?\n\nWait, no. For the group, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So if neither is a prefix, then both are suffixes? No. Because for the group, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So if neither is a prefix, then both are suffixes, which is impossible. Therefore, the code should never reach that case. Therefore, the code can assume that for each group, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix of s_candidate, and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how to confirm that?\n\nWell, the code is using a valid s_candidate, so for each group, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each group, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix. Therefore, the code can check for each group, which one is the prefix and assign accordingly.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each group (l, [s1, s2]):\n\n   if s1 is a prefix of s_candidate:\n\n       assign P to s1, S to s2\n\n   else:\n\n       assign P to s2, S to s1\n\nThis way, for each group, exactly one is assigned P and the other S.\n\nBut how to check whether s1 is a prefix of s_candidate?\n\nYes. So for example, in the case where both s1 and s2 are prefixes (same string), then the code would check if s1 is a prefix. It is, so assign P to s1 and S to s2. Even though s2 is also a prefix, but the code is forced to assign S to it. This would result in one P and one S for the group.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo the code's steps are:\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found:\n\n   For each input string, determine its group (by length)\n\n   For each group, check which of the two strings is a prefix of s_candidate. Assign P to that string, S to the other.\n\nThen, build the output string by checking for each input string in the original order, whether it was assigned P or S.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- For each input string, keep track of its group (length) and its position in the group (first or second).\n\nBut how to do that? Well, during processing, the code can group the input strings by length. For each length, store the two strings. Then, for each input string, when processing the output, check which of the two strings in its group it is, and determine whether it was assigned P or S.\n\nBut how to map back the original input order to the groups? For example, the input may have the strings in arbitrary order. So the code needs to, for each input string, know which group (length) it belongs to, and whether it's the first or second in the group.\n\nBut perhaps the code can pre-process the input into a dictionary that maps each length to a list of the two strings. Then, for each input string in the original order, look up its group and determine whether it is the first or second in the group. Then, for the group, determine whether it was assigned P or S.\n\nBut how to handle duplicates? For example, if two strings of the same length are the same. For example, in the second sample input, the two strings of length 1 are 'a' and 'a'. So when grouping, the code would store them as a list of two elements. But when checking whether a particular input string is the first or second in the group, it's possible that the same string appears in both positions.\n\nBut for the code, the order in which the two strings are stored in the group is arbitrary, but during processing, the code can assign P to the first and S to the second, or vice versa, depending on which is the prefix.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead all the input strings, and group them by their lengths. For each length, store the two strings in a list. Then, for each input string in the original order, determine which group it belongs to, and whether it is the first or second in the group. Then, for that group, determine which is the prefix and assign P/S accordingly.\n\nBut how to do this? For example, for the original input strings, the code can create a list of tuples (original_order, string, length). Then, for each group, store the two strings in the order they were first encountered. But this may not be reliable. Alternatively, for each group, store the two strings, and for each input string, check if it is the first or second in the group.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for a group with two strings, say, [s1, s2], and an input string s, which may be s1 or s2, the code can check if s == s1, then it is the first in the group, else the second.\n\nBut in the case of duplicates, like s1 and s2 are the same string, then checking for equality will return True for both. So how to differentiate between them?\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because if the two strings in the group are the same, then for each of them, when checking whether they are the first or second in the group, the code can't distinguish between them. However, in this case, the code can assign P to the first and S to the second, regardless of their actual status.\n\nBut how to track which is the first and which is the second in the group?\n\nThe code can process the input strings, and for each length, store the two strings in the order they appeared in the input. For example, when reading the input, for each length, collect the strings in the order they were read. So for a group of length l,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`.
