The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem is about calculating the minimum time she needs to do all tasks. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, the houses are arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. Each task requires her to be at a certain house, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The movement between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. The question is to find the total minimum time required.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the example. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's count the steps. From 1 to 3 is two steps (1→2→3). Then from 3 to 2: since moving clockwise, she has to go through 4 and then 1, then 2. That's three steps (3→4→1→2). Then from 2 to 3 again, which is one step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Oh right, but how does that fit into the problem?\n\nSo, the key here is that for each task, we need to calculate the time taken to get from the previous position to the current task's house, considering that movement is clockwise. Also, since the tasks must be done in order, each task depends on the previous ones.\n\nSo, the idea is to track Xenia's current position and accumulate the total time. For each task ai, we calculate the time needed to move from the current position to ai, moving clockwise. Then add that to the total time and update the current position.\n\nBut how to compute the movement between two positions on a ringroad?\n\nLet's think: suppose current position is pos, and the next target is a_i. Since movement is clockwise, the number of steps needed is (a_i - pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because if pos is 3 and a_i is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - pos + a_i) steps. Let's take n=4. For example, pos=3, target=2. Moving clockwise: 3 →4 →1 →2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) = 3. So the formula is (target - pos) if target >= pos, else (target - pos + n). Which can be written as (target - pos) % n if the mod is handled properly. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results. Let me check:\n\nFor example, (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. So the steps between pos and target is (target - pos) if target >= pos, else (target - pos + n). Which can be calculated as (target - pos + n) % n. But wait, if target is equal to pos, then the steps are zero. So yes, the formula is (target - pos) % n. But wait, in the case where target is less than pos, like pos=3, target=2, (2-3) is -1. Adding n (4) gives 3, which is correct. So the steps between pos and target is (target - pos) if positive, else (target - pos + n). Which can be calculated as (target - pos + n) % n. But wait, if target is equal to pos, then (target - pos) is zero, and mod n is zero. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo for each task, the time added is (current_pos to a_i) steps. But since the tasks must be done in order, we have to process them sequentially, keeping track of the current position.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given as a list a_1 to a_m. But Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then moving from the current position (which is that house) to the same house again would take zero steps. So that's handled automatically by the formula.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1 (since she starts there). Initialize total_time to 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   calculate steps = (a_i - current_pos) % n if that's positive, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Wait, but (a_i - current_pos) mod n would give the correct steps. Because for example, when a_i is 2 and current_pos is 3, (2-3) mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So steps = (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, if a_i is equal to current_pos, then steps is zero. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but for example, if current_pos is 3 and a_i is 3, then steps is zero. So that's correct.\n\nSo for each task, we compute the steps needed to get from current_pos to a_i, add that to the total_time, then set current_pos to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i before doing the i-th task. So the tasks are processed in order. So the order of processing is a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. So for each task in order, we compute the steps from the previous position to the current a_i.\n\nBut why is the first example's total steps 6?\n\nLet me simulate it:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Steps from 1 to 3: (3-1) mod 4 = 2. So total_time += 2. Now current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Steps from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod 4 = ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3. So total_time += 3. Now total is 5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Steps from 2 to 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. Add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the example.\n\nYes. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, and a is [2,3,3]. Output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total is 1. current_pos is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: steps (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps (3-3) mod 4 = 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list:\n\n   steps = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += steps\n\n   current_pos = a_i\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nWait, but wait. What if the list is empty? Well, m is at least 1. Because in the input constraints, m is 1<=m<=1e5.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nBut let's test some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then steps is (1-1) mod 2 = 0. Total is 0. Correct.\n\nCase 2: n=2, m=1, a=[2]. Steps (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Total is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, current_pos is 5. Next a_i is 1. Steps (1-5) mod 5 = ( -4 ) mod 5 = 1. Because 1-5 is -4, adding 5 gives 1. Which is correct: moving from 5 to 1 is 1 step (clockwise).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current = 1, time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in a:\n\n   delta = (ai - current) % n\n\n   time += delta\n\n   current = ai\n\nPrint time.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if the list is [3,3], then the steps between them is zero. So that's handled correctly.\n\nSo that's the solution.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and m. The second line is m integers.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be read as n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3].\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nRead the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen process as above.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead from stdin. So in Python, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's check the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\nLoop steps:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: delta (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3. total becomes 5. current is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, a is [2,3,3]. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: (2-1) mod 4 is 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond num is 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-3) mod 4 is 0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nWhat about when the list is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so no problem.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 1: delta is 0. total is 0. current is 1.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-1) mod 2 is 1. total is 1. So output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. Then:\n\ncurrent is 1. First step: (5-1) mod 5 is 4. total is 4. current is 5. Next step: (1-5) mod 5 is ( -4 ) mod 5 = 1. total is 5. Which is correct: 1→5 is 4 steps (clockwise), then 5→1 is 1 step. Total 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input given in the problem.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nWhich matches the examples.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator for negative numbers returns a positive result. For example, (-1) % 4 is 3. So yes, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Read the input, loop through the list, compute delta, add to total, and so on.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        delta = (num - current) % n\n        total += delta\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a=[2]. Output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=3, a=[5,1,5]. The steps:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst step: (5-1) mod 5 = 4. total 4. current is 5.\n\nSecond step: (1-5) mod 5 = 1. total 5. current is 1.\n\nThird step: (5-1) mod 5 =4. total 9. So output is 9.\n\nWhich is correct. The path is 1→5 (4 steps), 5→1 (1 step), 1→5 (4 steps). Total 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. Each task must be completed in sequence, and moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the houses are arranged in a ring, moving from one house to another clockwise can be calculated using modular arithmetic. If Xenia is at house `current` and needs to move to house `target`, the number of steps required is `(target - current) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses. This formula handles both cases where the target is ahead or behind the current position in a clockwise direction.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, we iterate through each task in the given order. For each task, we compute the steps required to move from the current house to the target house, accumulate these steps, and update the current position to the target house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        delta = (num - current) % n\n        total += delta\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The second line contains `m` integers representing the house numbers where each task must be completed.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the steps needed to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic. Add these steps to the total time and update the current position to the target house.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
