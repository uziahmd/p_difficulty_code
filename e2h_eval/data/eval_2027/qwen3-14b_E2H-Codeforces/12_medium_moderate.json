The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task must be done in a specific house, and she can only do the i-th task after completing all previous ones. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to do all tasks.\n\nHmm, the input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks), followed by a list of a_i's. The initial position is house 1. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, so from house n, moving to 1 is one step.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. For each task, she needs to move from her current position to the required house for that task. But since the tasks have to be done in order, each subsequent task depends on the previous.\n\nSo, for example, if the first task is at house 3, she starts at 1. How many steps? Well, moving clockwise from 1 to 3: 2 steps (1→2→3). But if the next task is at 2, then she has to go from 3 to 2. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, she can't go backward. So from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2? That's 3 steps. Or maybe there's a shorter way. Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, the distance between two houses x and y is (y - x) mod n if y >=x? Or wait, no. Let me think again. The distance between current position and target is calculated as follows: if current is at pos, and target is at a_i, then the number of steps needed is (a_i - pos) if a_i >= pos. But if a_i < pos, then it's (n - pos + a_i). Because she has to go all the way around.\n\nWait, but for example, if pos is 3 and target is 2, then moving clockwise would require 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. Which is (n - pos + a_i) = 4-3 + 2? No, that would be 3 steps. Wait, n is 4. So 4 - 3 + 2 = 3. Yes. So yes, the formula would be (a_i - pos) if a_i >= pos, else (a_i + n - pos). Alternatively, (a_i - pos) % n? Wait, no. Because if a_i is less than pos, then (a_i - pos) is negative. For example, if pos is 3, a_i is 2. Then (2 - 3) is -1. But modulo n would be 3. Which is correct. So the distance between pos and a_i is (a_i - pos) if a_i >= pos, else (a_i - pos + n). Which can be written as (a_i - pos + n) % n. But since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\nBut wait, for example, if pos is 3 and a_i is 2, the distance is 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) = 3. So yes. So the formula would be (a_i - pos) if a_i >= pos, else (a_i - pos + n). But since we can compute this as (a_i - pos + n) % n, but since the result is the same as (a_i - pos) when a_i >= pos. Because adding n and then mod n would give the same as the original difference. Wait, no. Let's see: if a_i is 3, pos is 2, then (3-2) is 1. If a_i is 2, pos is 3, then (2-3 +4) is 3, which is correct. So the general formula for the distance between pos and a_i is (a_i - pos) if a_i >= pos, else (a_i - pos + n). Which can be written as (a_i - pos) % n if we take the positive modulo. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results. For example, (2-3) %4 is 3. So yes, (a_i - pos) % n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, what if a_i is equal to pos? Then the difference is zero, which is correct. So for each task, the time taken is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, no. Because the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So if the current position is already at a_i, then she doesn't need to move. So for each task, the time added is the distance between current position and a_i.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1.\n\nFor each task in the list, compute the distance from current position to a_i, add that to total time, then update current position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in order. So for example, the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So for each task in order, we need to calculate the steps from current position to a_i, and accumulate that.\n\nYes.\n\nSo let's take the first example:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the tasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps. Total time is 2. Current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance from 3 to 2 is (2 -3 +4) = 3 steps. Total time is 2+3=5. Current position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total time is 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is 4 3, tasks 2,3,3. Let's see:\n\nInitial position 1.\n\nFirst task is 2. Distance is 1 step. Total 1. Position is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3. Distance 1 step. Total 2. Position is 3.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance 0. Total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to process the list of a_i's, and for each, compute the distance between current position and a_i, add to total, then set current position to a_i.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each a in the list:\n\n   distance = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test with the first example. For the first task, a is 3. current_pos is 1. (3-1) mod 4 is 2. Correct. Then current_pos becomes 3. Next a is 2. (2-3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3. Correct. Then current_pos is 2. Next a is 3. (3-2) mod 4 is 1. Correct. So total is 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input. The list is 2,3,3. Initial position is 1.\n\nFirst a is 2: (2-1) mod 4 is 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond a is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-3) mod4 is 0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, considering the constraints. n and m can be up to 1e5. So O(m) time is acceptable.\n\nBut what about the modulo operation? Well, in Python, (a - current_pos) can be negative. So (a - current_pos) % n gives the correct steps. But let's make sure that the calculation is correct.\n\nFor example, if current_pos is 4, and a is 1. Then (1-4) is -3. mod 4 is 1. Which is correct. Because moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step (since it's a ringroad). So yes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read m integers as a list.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nLoop through each ai in the list:\n\n   total_time += (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n   current_pos = ai\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nWait, but what if the list is empty? Well, according to input constraints, m is at least 1. Because in the input, m is given as 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nLet me check another example. Suppose n=2, m=2, and the list is [1, 2]. Then:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 1: (1-1) mod 2 is 0. total is 0. current is 1.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-1) mod 2 is 1. total is 1. So output is 1. Which is correct: move from 1 to 2, one step.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2, list [2,1]. Then:\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod 2 is 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 1: (1-2) mod 2 is ( -1 ) mod 2 = 1. total is 2. Which is correct: from 2 to 1 is one step. So total 1+1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nRead input: first line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list like ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']? Wait, no. Wait, the user provided an example where the input is given as two separate inputs. But in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So for each test case, the code should read two lines. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as a single input. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and m, the second line contains m integers.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as two different cases. But the code is supposed to read from stdin. So the code should read the first line as n and m, then the second line as the list of a_i's.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and m.\n\nRead the second line, split into m integers.\n\nThen process as per the logic.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n\n    diff = (a - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = a\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the first example, the input is 4 3, and the list is 3 2 3. So the code would process that as:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst a is 3: (3-1) mod4 is 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond a is 2: (2-3) mod4 is ( -1 ) mod4 is 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. total is 6. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example, the second sample input is 4 3, list 2 3 3. The code gives 1 +1 +0 = 2. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? Well, according to the constraints, m is at least 1, so no.\n\nWhat about when a_i is 1, and current is 1? Then (1-1) mod n is 0. So no steps added. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses numbered clockwise from 1 to n. Each task must be completed in a specific house, and Xenia can only move clockwise between adjacent houses, taking one unit of time per move.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house for the task.\n3. **Calculate Movement Time**: Use modular arithmetic to determine the shortest path clockwise from the current position to the target house. This is done using the formula `(target - current) % n`, which correctly handles both direct and wrap-around movements around the ringroad.\n4. **Update Position and Total Time**: After calculating the movement time for each task, update the total time and the current position to the target house for the next task.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n    diff = (a - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of target houses for each task.\n- **Current Position and Total Time**: We start at house 1 with zero total time.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the ringroad's circular nature.\n- **Update Values**: Add the computed distance to the total time and update the current position to the target house for the next iteration.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by considering each task in sequence and leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement constraints. The overall complexity is O(m), which is optimal given the problem constraints.",
