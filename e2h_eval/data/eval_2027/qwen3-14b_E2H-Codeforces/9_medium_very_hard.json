Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (which is 1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are pretty tight: n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So we need an efficient algorithm here.\n\nHmm. The classic knapsack problem, but with weights limited to 1, 2, 3. That must be a clue for optimization. Because if all items had arbitrary weights, the standard DP approach would be O(nm), which for 1e5 * 3e5 would be way too slow. But since the weights are small, maybe we can find a way to process each weight group separately.\n\nLet me think. For each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight group, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, the problem becomes how to combine these groups optimally.\n\nFor example, suppose we have some number of weight 1 items, weight 2 items, and weight 3 items. We need to choose how many of each to take such that the total weight is <= m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nBut how do we efficiently compute this combination?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's say we process each weight group:\n\n- For weight 1: Sort all items in descending order of cost. Then, for any number k of items taken, the total cost is the sum of the first k items. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, we can try all possible combinations of taking x items from weight 1, y items from weight 2, z items from weight 3, such that x*1 + y*2 + z*3 <= m. But even then, trying all possible x, y, z would be O(m^2) in the worst case, which might not be feasible for m=3e5.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Since the weights are small, perhaps we can iterate through the possible number of weight 3 items, then for each, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each possible number of weight 3 items (say, up to m//3), we can compute how much weight is left, and then solve the problem for weight 1 and 2 items with the remaining weight. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's precompute prefix sums for each weight:\n\nFor weight 1, let's have a list s1 where s1[k] is the maximum cost when taking k items of weight 1. Similarly for s2 (for weight 2, each item takes 2 units of weight) and s3 (for weight 3, each item takes 3 units).\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), which can be up to min( (m)//3, len(s3)), we can compute the remaining weight as rem = m - z*3. Then, we need to find the optimal way to take items from weight 1 and 2 with total weight rem.\n\nBut how to compute that optimal combination for weight 1 and 2?\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 case, the problem is similar to the knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2. However, since we have sorted lists, perhaps we can find for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), how many weight 1 items can be taken (x) such that 2y + x <= rem. But again, for each z, this could be O(rem) time, which for m=3e5 could be O( (3e5) * (3e5) ) in worst case, which is 9e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a better approach for combining weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each possible total weight w, we can compute the maximum value achievable with weight 1 and 2 items. Let's say we have the prefix sums for weight 1 (s1) and for weight 2 (s2). For a given total weight W, we can iterate over the number of weight 2 items taken (y), and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (x = W - 2y). However, since the maximum possible y is min( len(s2), W//2 ), this would be O(W) per W. But again, for large W, this is expensive.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to precompute for all possible weights up to m, the maximum value for combining weight 1 and 2 items. How?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), the maximum number of weight 1 items is (W - 2y) (but not exceeding the available items). So for each possible y, we can take up to min( (W - 2y), len(s1) ) items of weight 1. The total cost is s2[y] + s1[ min( (W - 2y), len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut to find the maximum over all possible y, how can we compute this quickly?\n\nBut for each W, this would take O( (W//2) ) steps. Which again, for large W is O(m) steps. So if we have to do this for each possible W, it's O(m^2), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm. So maybe we need a way to compute for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items for any given remaining weight W, in O(1) or O( log n ) time.\n\nAnother thought: since the items are sorted by cost, the optimal selection for weight 1 and 2 items is to take as many high-value items as possible. So for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, for a given total weight W, what's the best way to select?\n\nLet me think of this as a two-dimensional problem. Suppose I have a certain amount of weight capacity left. How to pick items of weight 1 and 2 to maximize the cost. Since the items are sorted, for weight 1, taking the top k items, and for weight 2, taking the top l items, such that k + 2l ≤ W. How can we find the optimal k and l?\n\nBut even here, for each W, trying all possible l (number of weight 2 items) and then taking max k is O(W) time. However, considering that W can be up to m (3e5), and for each z (number of weight 3 items), which can be up to m/3 (1e5), the total time would be O(m^2 / 3) which is 1e10, which is way too slow.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible. Need to find a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weight 1 and 2 items can be considered as a combined problem, perhaps we can precompute for each possible total weight up to m, the maximum value possible using only weight 1 and 2 items. How?\n\nLet me think. For the weight 1 and 2 items, the standard knapsack approach would be O(W * n), but here n is up to 1e5, so that's again not feasible.\n\nWait, but the items are sorted. So perhaps we can use a greedy approach? No, because the knapsack problem isn't solvable greedily unless there's some specific condition. However, since the weight is small (1 and 2), maybe there's a way to optimize.\n\nLet me think again. Let's say we have for weight 1 items, sorted in descending order, and same for weight 2. For any given weight capacity W, the optimal selection is to take as many weight 2 items as possible (since they have higher value per unit weight?), but that's not necessarily true. Wait, no, the value per unit weight depends on the individual items. For example, a weight 2 item with cost 3 (value per unit is 1.5) is better than a weight 1 item with cost 1 (value per unit is 1). But if there's a weight 2 item with cost 2 (value 1 per unit), then taking two weight 1 items with cost 1 each (total 2) would be same as one weight 2 item. But if the weight 1 items are higher value, like cost 1.5 each, then taking two of them would give 3, which is better than the weight 2 item.\n\nSo, the optimal selection between weight 1 and 2 items can't be determined greedily based on per-unit value. Therefore, a greedy approach may not work here.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps there's a way to find for each possible number of weight 2 items, the best number of weight 1 items.\n\nWait, here's another idea. For the combined weight 1 and 2 items, for each possible total weight W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- taking x weight 1 items and y weight 2 items where x + 2y ≤ W.\n\nBut since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, for a given W, the optimal number of weight 2 items is up to min( len(s2), W // 2 ). For each possible y (number of weight 2 items), the maximum x is min( W - 2y, len(s1) ). So the total value is s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut to find the maximum over all possible y, we can iterate y from 0 to min( len(s2), W//2 ), and compute that value. However, for each W, this is O( W//2 ) steps, which is O(3e5) steps for each W, which is way too slow.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible. Hence, we need a better way to compute the best combination for weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me think again. What if we precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be added given some total weight? But how to combine this.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, perhaps for a given total weight W, the optimal choice is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, but then also check some nearby possibilities. Like, for example, take y_max = min( len(s2), W // 2 ), then check y_max, y_max -1, etc. up to some small number of steps. Because the optimal y could be near y_max, but maybe not exactly y_max. However, how to determine how many steps to check?\n\nThis is similar to the approach used in some knapsack optimizations when the number of items is large. For example, if we can find that for a given W, the optimal y is in the vicinity of some value, then we can limit the number of checks.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, the maximum number of weight 1 items for a given W is W (if all items are weight 1). But since the weight 2 items are also sorted, perhaps for each possible y (number of weight 2 items), the corresponding x is (W - 2y), but clamped to the number of available weight 1 items.\n\nBut again, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2. Then, for the combined problem of weight 1 and 2, for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y where 0 ≤ y ≤ min( len(s2), floor(W / 2) ), and x = min( W - 2y, len(s1) ). So the value is s2[y] + s1[x].\n\nNow, the question is, for each W, how to find the maximum of this function over y. But how?\n\nIf we can find that for each W, the optimal y is either floor( (W - k) / 2 ), or something like that, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since for a fixed W, the function is s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, len(s1) ) ], and since s2 is non-decreasing (because we take the best items first), and s1 is non-decreasing, then perhaps for a given W, the optimal y is somewhere around the point where the marginal gain of adding a weight 2 item is higher than the loss of not being able to take some weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, since the number of weight 2 items is limited (since each has weight 2), perhaps for each W, the optimal y is in the range [max(0, y_opt - K), min( y_max, y_opt + K )], where K is a small constant (like 300). But this is just a heuristic and may not work for all cases.\n\nBut given that the time constraints are tight, maybe this is the way to go. Let's think: for each W, we can try all possible y in the range [max(0, y_opt - K), min(y_max, y_opt + K)], where y_opt is the value that would be chosen if we could take as many weight 2 items as possible and then fill with weight 1 items. But how to compute y_opt?\n\nAlternatively, since for each W, the maximum possible y is up to W//2, but if we can find that for each possible y, the value of s2[y] + s1[ ... ] can be computed quickly, but even that seems difficult.\n\nAnother angle: For the combined weight 1 and 2 items, the problem can be transformed into a knapsack problem where the items are grouped by their weight. Since the weights are 1 and 2, and we have sorted lists, perhaps we can use a two-pointer approach.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's another idea. Let's consider that for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), we can compute the maximum possible number of weight 1 items (x) that can be taken, which is (W - 2y). Then, the total cost is s2[y] + s1[x], where x is min(W - 2y, len(s1)). Now, since s2 is non-decreasing and s1 is non-decreasing, the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, len(s1) ) ] is not necessarily unimodal. However, perhaps for each W, the optimal y is in the range where 2y is close to W minus some value. But without knowing the exact shape of the function, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each W, the maximum value of f(y) is achieved when the sum of the two prefix sums is maximized. Since the s1 and s2 are sorted, perhaps the optimal y is around the value that balances the trade-off between taking more weight 2 items and less weight 1 items.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck here.\n\nLet me think back to the original problem. The weight of the items is limited to 1, 2, 3. So for each weight group, we can process them separately. Let me think about the following approach:\n\n- Preprocess the items for each weight (1, 2, 3) by sorting them in descending order of cost, and compute their prefix sums.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), from 0 to max_z (where max_z is min( len(s3), m // 3 )), we calculate the remaining weight rem = m - 3*z. Then, for this rem, we need to find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items. Let's call this value V(rem). The total value would be s3[z] + V(rem).\n\nThe maximum over all z of this is our answer.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to efficiently computing V(w) for any given w (the remaining weight after choosing z items of weight 3). How can we compute V(w) quickly?\n\nIf we can precompute for all possible w (up to m) the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items, then for each z, we can look up V(rem) in O(1) time.\n\nBut how to precompute this?\n\nLet's think of it as a dynamic programming problem. Let's create an array dp where dp[i] represents the maximum value achievable with weight i using only weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nThen, the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = max( dp[i - 1] + cost of a weight 1 item, dp[i - 2] + cost of a weight 2 item )\n\nBut since we have multiple items of weight 1 and 2, this approach is not straightforward. Also, the standard knapsack DP approach would be O(m * n), which is not feasible here.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find a way to compute this dp array efficiently.\n\nWait, for weight 1 and 2 items, we can think of the problem as follows:\n\nWe have a list of weight 1 items sorted in descending order (so the first item is the most valuable), and similarly for weight 2 items. Then, for each possible weight capacity up to m, we want to select some number of items from each group.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible weight capacity w, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many weight 1 items as possible (up to w items), and then nothing from weight 2.\n\nOR\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible (up to w//2 items), and then filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut this is not necessarily the optimal solution. However, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, considering that the items are sorted, the optimal solution can be found by considering for each possible number of weight 2 items up to a certain limit.\n\nAlternatively, since the items are sorted, for a given w, the best way to take some weight 2 items and then fill the remaining weight with weight 1 items. Let me think: for example, for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), which can be from 0 to min( len(s2), floor(w / 2) ), then the remaining weight after taking y weight 2 items is w - 2*y. Then, take as many weight 1 items as possible (up to min( len(s1), w - 2*y )).\n\nSo for each w, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y of (s2[y] + s1[ min( len(s1), w - 2*y ) ]).\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible w up to m.\n\nIf we can precompute for all possible w, then for each w, we can compute the maximum in O(1) time, but how to compute it.\n\nBut for each w, the number of possible y is up to O(w/2), which for m=3e5 is O(1.5e5) operations per w. And since there are m possible w's, this would be O(m^2) operations, which is not feasible.\n\nSo this approach is not going to work for large m.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince the weight of the items is small (1, 2, 3), maybe we can use a different approach. For example, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items, and then for each possible weight, find the best combination.\n\nLet me think: For the weight 1 items, the prefix sum is s1, and for weight 2 items, it's s2. For any given weight capacity W, the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items is the maximum over all possible y (number of weight 2 items) where 2y ≤ W, and then x = min(W - 2y, len(s1)).\n\nBut since W can be up to m (3e5), and for each W, we have to check up to W//2 possibilities, which is O(3e5 * 3e5) operations, which is 9e10 — way too slow.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nLet me think again. The problem allows for the weight of items to be 1, 2, or 3. But given that the weights are small, perhaps we can use a modified knapsack approach that takes advantage of the small weight values.\n\nLet me think about the standard knapsack problem. For each item, we can decide to take it or not. But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, a standard O(nm) approach is impossible.\n\nBut with the weights being 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can find an optimized way.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows:\n\nFor each weight group (1, 2, 3), sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, compute the prefix sums.\n\nThen, for the entire problem, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible combinations of x, y, z (number of items taken from each group) such that x*1 + y*2 + z*3 ≤ m. The value is s1[x] + s2[y] + s3[z].\n\nBut how to find x, y, z efficiently.\n\nThe problem is to find x, y, z with x + 2y + 3z ≤ m, and maximize the sum.\n\nBut how to iterate over x, y, z efficiently.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: for each possible z (number of weight 3 items), we can compute the maximum x and y for the remaining weight. So for each z, the remaining weight is rem = m - 3*z. Then, we need to find the best x and y such that x + 2y ≤ rem. And then take the maximum of s1[x] + s2[y].\n\nSo the problem now reduces to, for each possible z, find the best x and y for rem = m - 3*z.\n\nNow, the key is to find, for a given rem, the best x and y such that x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly.\n\nLet me think about this sub-problem. For a given rem, what is the maximum value of s1[x] + s2[y], where x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nAgain, the same issue arises: how to compute this for any rem efficiently.\n\nBut perhaps for this sub-problem, we can precompute for all possible rem up to m, the maximum value of s1[x] + s2[y], where x + 2y ≤ rem. Let's call this function f(rem).\n\nIf we can precompute this f(rem) for all rem from 0 to m, then for each z, we can get f(rem) in O(1) time.\n\nSo how to compute f(rem)?\n\nLet me think of it as a dynamic programming problem. For each possible rem, we can find the maximum value by considering adding one more item of weight 1 or 2.\n\nBut again, with rem up to 3e5, and the items being sorted, perhaps we can find a way to compute f(rem) efficiently.\n\nWait, for the sub-problem of combining weight 1 and 2 items, here's another idea. For each possible y (number of weight 2 items), the maximum x is min(rem - 2y, len(s1)). So the value is s2[y] + s1[min(rem - 2y, len(s1))]. To find the maximum of this expression over all possible y.\n\nNow, since for each rem, this is a function of y, and y ranges from 0 to min( len(s2), rem // 2 ), perhaps we can find for each rem the optimal y quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of it as follows: for a given rem, the optimal y is such that 2y is as large as possible, but not exceeding rem. However, this may not be the case. For example, if taking one less weight 2 item allows us to take more weight 1 items, which may have higher total value.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, the s2[y] is the sum of the top y weight 2 items, and s1[x] is the sum of the top x weight 1 items. So for a given y, the x is determined as rem - 2y, but clamped to the number of available weight 1 items.\n\nBut since s1 is non-decreasing, and s2 is non-decreasing, the function s2[y] + s1[...] is not necessarily monotonic. However, for a fixed rem, the function is likely to have a single peak, making it possible to find the optimal y with a binary search or other method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given rem, the optimal y is in the range [max(0, y_opt - K), min( y_max, y_opt + K )], where K is a small number like 300. This is a common optimization technique when you can't afford to check all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about the following: for each rem, the maximum possible y is y_max = min( len(s2), rem // 2 ). We can try y in the range [max(0, y_max - 300), y_max]. For each of these y values, we compute the corresponding x and the total value. Take the maximum among them. This would be O(300) operations per rem, which is acceptable for m up to 3e5.\n\nWhy would this work? Well, the idea is that the optimal y is close to the maximum possible y. Because taking more weight 2 items (higher y) gives more value from those items, and the remaining weight is filled with weight 1 items. However, sometimes, taking fewer weight 2 items allows more weight 1 items, which may have higher value. But if the weight 2 items are the most valuable, then the optimal y is near y_max.\n\nBut how to choose K? Well, given that the items are sorted, the difference between taking y and y-1 may not be too large. For example, if the next weight 2 item has a higher value than the weight 1 items that could be added, then it's better to take it. Otherwise, not. So the optimal y is likely to be within a small range around y_max.\n\nBut this is just a heuristic, and I'm not sure if it will work for all cases. However, given the time constraints, this may be the only feasible approach.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this plan:\n\n1. Preprocess the weight 1, 2, 3 items by sorting them in descending order of cost and compute their prefix sums.\n\n2. For each possible z (number of weight 3 items), compute rem = m - 3*z. If rem < 0, skip this z. Else, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for this rem.\n\n3. To compute the best combination for rem, iterate y from max(0, y_max - 300) to y_max, where y_max is min( len(s2), rem//2 ). For each y in this range, compute x = min( rem - 2*y, len(s1) ), and calculate the value s2[y] + s1[x]. Take the maximum among these.\n\n4. The overall answer is the maximum of all (s3[z] + best_value_for_rem) across all valid z.\n\nNow, what is the value of K (like 300)? Well, we need to choose it such that for all possible cases, the optimal y is within this range. How to determine it?\n\nWell, considering that the maximum possible value of rem is m (3e5), and that for each rem, the y_max is up to 1.5e5. Trying K=300 would mean 300 iterations per rem, which for m=3e5 would be 9e7 operations. Which is acceptable for Python, assuming that the code is optimized.\n\nBut how to choose K? Well, in practice, we can set K to something like 300, and see if it passes the test cases. But what if there's a case where the optimal y is further away from y_max?\n\nFor example, suppose that the weight 2 items are very cheap, and the weight 1 items are very expensive. Then, the optimal y could be 0, while y_max is large. In this case, our approach would miss it unless K is larger than y_max.\n\nBut that's a problem. So this approach may not work for all cases.\n\nAlternative Idea: For the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, for a given rem, the optimal y is the one that maximizes s2[y] + s1[ min( rem - 2y, len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut since s1 and s2 are prefix sums of sorted arrays, the value s1[x] increases as x increases, and s2[y] increases as y increases. However, increasing y decreases x (since rem - 2y decreases), so there's a trade-off.\n\nThe function is a combination of two increasing functions with opposite dependencies on y. This suggests that the function may have a single peak, which can be found using ternary search.\n\nWait! If the function is unimodal, then we can perform ternary search on y to find the maximum. But is it unimodal?\n\nLet me think. For a given rem, the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min( rem - 2y, len(s1) ) ].\n\nAs y increases, s2[y] increases. But the term rem - 2y decreases, so s1[ ... ] decreases (assuming that rem - 2y is >= 0 and that we have enough items in s1). So initially, as y increases, the function may increase up to a certain point, then decrease. Or it may have other behavior.\n\nBut if the function is unimodal, then ternary search can be applied. However, I'm not sure if it is always unimodal. For example, imagine a scenario where taking one more y gives a small increase in s2[y], but a large decrease in s1[...], and then taking another y gives a larger increase in s2[y], but even smaller decrease in s1[...]. This could create a non-unimodal function.\n\nBut perhaps for practical purposes, it's unimodal enough to apply ternary search. Let's assume that for now.\n\nSo, for a given rem, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max], where y_max is min( len(s2), rem//2 ). For each mid value, we calculate f(mid) and compare to determine which half to search next.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the function is not strictly unimodal. Well, ternary search may not work perfectly, but it might still find the maximum value in practice.\n\nHowever, implementing ternary search for each rem could be feasible. Let's think about the complexity. For each rem, the ternary search would take O(log y_max) steps, and each step involves calculating f(y). For m=3e5 and log steps (say 20), this would be 3e5 * 20 = 6e6 operations, which is manageable.\n\nSo this seems promising.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps again:\n\n- Preprocess weight 1, 2, 3 items, sort them in descending order, compute prefix sums.\n\n- For each possible z (number of weight 3 items):\n\n   - rem = m - 3*z.\n\n   - if rem < 0: continue.\n\n   - compute the best value for rem using the weight 1 and 2 items.\n\n   - add this to s3[z], and keep track of the global maximum.\n\nThe key part is computing the best value for rem.\n\nSo, how to compute that best value:\n\nImplement a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max], where y_max = min( len(s2), rem // 2 ). For each y, compute x = min( rem - 2*y, len(s1) ), then value = s2[y] + s1[x].\n\nBut wait, what if rem - 2*y is negative? Well, since y is up to rem//2, rem - 2*y is >= 0. So x is at least zero.\n\nSo during the ternary search, we can safely compute x.\n\nBut how to implement the ternary search correctly?\n\nAnother thing to note is that the function may have multiple peaks, but ternary search may not find the global maximum. However, given that the items are sorted, perhaps the function is indeed unimodal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform a linear search for y in the range [max(0, y_max - 300), y_max], which is O(300) per rem.\n\nBut which approach is better?\n\nWell, for the ternary search approach, it's O(log y_max) per rem, which is better than O(300) if log y_max is smaller than 300. For y_max up to 1.5e5, log2(1.5e5) is about 18, so it's better.\n\nBut I'm not sure whether the function is unimodal. Let's think of an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\ns1 = [10, 9, 8, 7, ... ] (many items)\n\ns2 = [5, 4, 3, ... ]\n\nrem = 5.\n\nPossible y values:\n\ny=0 → x=5 → value s2[0] + s1[5]\n\ny=1 → x=5-2=3 → value s2[1] + s1[3]\n\ny=2 → x=5-4=1 → value s2[2] + s1[1]\n\nWhich of these is larger? It depends on the actual values.\n\nSuppose s1 is [10,9,8,7,6], s2 is [5,4,3].\n\nFor rem=5:\n\ny=0 → 0 + 10+9+8+7+6 = 40\n\ny=1 → 5 + 10+9+8 = 5+27=32\n\ny=2 → 5+4=9 + 10 → 19.\n\nSo maximum is at y=0.\n\nBut in this case, the function decreases as y increases. So it's unimodal (monotonically decreasing).\n\nAnother example:\n\ns1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\ns2 = [3, 3, 3]\n\nrem = 4.\n\ny can be 0, 1, or 2 (since 2*2=4).\n\ny=0 → x=4 → sum is 4.\n\ny=1 → 3 + (4-2=2) → 3+2=5.\n\ny=2 → 3+3=6 + (4-4=0) → 6.\n\nSo maximum is at y=2. Function increases as y increases.\n\nAnother example where the function has a peak:\n\ns1 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]\n\ns2 = [15, 15, 15]\n\nrem=6.\n\nPossible y:\n\ny=0 → x=6 → 60.\n\ny=1 → 15 + (6-2=4) → 15 + 40 = 55.\n\ny=2 → 30 + (6-4=2) → 30+20=50.\n\ny=3 → 45 + (6-6=0) → 45.\n\nSo the function is decreasing with y. Maximum at y=0.\n\nAnother example where there's a peak:\n\ns1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\ns2 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nrem=5.\n\nPossible y:\n\ny=0 → x=5 → 5.\n\ny=1 → 2 + 3 → 5.\n\ny=2 → 4 + 1 → 5.\n\nSo the function is flat. Any y in 0,1,2 gives same value.\n\nBut in this case, the function is flat, not unimodal.\n\nBut ternary search would find any of them.\n\nAnother example where the function increases then decreases:\n\ns1 = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\ns2 = [10, 10, 10]\n\nrem=5.\n\ny can be 0, 1, 2.\n\ny=0 → x=5 → 25.\n\ny=1 → 10 + (5-2=3) → 10 + 15 = 25.\n\ny=2 → 20 + (5-4=1) → 20 +5 = 25.\n\nSame value again.\n\nAnother example:\n\ns1 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]\n\ns2 = [15, 15, 15, 15]\n\nrem=6.\n\ny can be 0, 1, 2, 3 (since 2*3=6).\n\ny=0 → x=6 → 60.\n\ny=1 → 15 + (6-2=4) → 15 + 40 = 55.\n\ny=2 → 30 + (6-4=2) → 3",

Prefix sums are computed to quickly determine the maximum cost for any number of items taken from each category.\n2. **Iterating Over Weight 3 Items**: For each possible number of weight 3 items (z), the remaining weight capacity is calculated.\n3. **Ternary Search for Optimal Combination**: For the remaining weight capacity, a ternary search is used to find the optimal number of weight 2 items (y), and the corresponding number of weight 1 items (x) is derived from the remaining weight after accounting for y items.
