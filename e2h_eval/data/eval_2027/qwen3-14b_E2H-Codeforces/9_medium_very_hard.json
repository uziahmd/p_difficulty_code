Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to select souvenirs with maximum total cost without exceeding a weight limit m. The constraints are that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Also, each souvenir's weight is between 1 and 3. Hmm, so the weights are small. That probably suggests some kind of dynamic programming approach optimized for these small weights.\n\nLet me think about the standard knapsack problem. Normally, for 0-1 knapsack, the time complexity is O(nm), which would be 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach here.\n\nBut since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can group items by their weight and find an optimal way to take them. Let's consider each weight category separately.\n\nFor example, for all items of weight 1, we can take as many as possible (sorted by value descending). Similarly for weight 2 and 3. But the problem is when combining different weights. For example, taking some items of weight 2 and some of weight 1, how do we balance them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a dynamic programming approach that handles the small weights efficiently. Let's think: the maximum weight is 3e5. Let's say we create a DP array where dp[w] represents the maximum value achievable with total weight exactly w. Then, for each item, we can update the DP accordingly. However, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, even O(nm) is too slow. So this approach might not work unless we find a way to optimize it based on the small weights.\n\nWait, but if the items have weights only 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can process each group of items with the same weight in a way that allows us to compute the optimal selection for each weight group efficiently.\n\nLet me think again. For each weight type (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight group, we can precompute the prefix sums of the values. Then, for each possible number of items taken from that group, we can know the total value and total weight.\n\nSo, for example, for weight 1 items, sorted in descending order, the prefix sum array would tell us that taking k items gives total value of sum_k and total weight of k*1. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nNow, the problem becomes combining these three groups optimally. Let's think of it as selecting a certain number of items from each group (x from weight 1, y from weight 2, z from weight 3) such that x + 2y + 3z ≤ m, and the sum of their values is maximized.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAnother idea: since the weights are small, maybe we can iterate through the possible number of items from weight 3, then for each possible number of weight 3 items, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fit into the remaining weight. But even this approach might be feasible.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have sorted the weight 3 items in descending order of cost. Then for each possible number of weight 3 items taken (say, up to min(k, m//3)), we can calculate the total weight used and the total value. Then, for the remaining weight, we need to compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items. But how to compute that quickly?\n\nSimilarly for the weight 2 items. Wait, but the combination of weight 1 and 2 items can be handled with a dynamic programming approach. For example, for a given capacity W, what's the maximum value when using items of weight 1 and 2. Since the capacity could be up to m (3e5), but with weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can compute this in O(W) time.\n\nBut if we precompute for all possible capacities up to m, that would be O(m) per case, but multiplied by the number of possible weight 3 selections. That might not be efficient enough.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible number of weight 3 items taken, say z, then the remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*z. Then, for that rem, we need to compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items. How to compute that quickly?\n\nLet me think about how to handle weight 1 and 2 items. Let's say we have sorted all weight 1 items in descending order, and weight 2 items in descending order. For each possible number of weight 2 items taken, we can compute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be added. But again, how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for the combined weight 1 and 2 items, we can model this as follows: for a given capacity W, what's the maximum value? Let's consider that for any W, the maximum value is the maximum between taking some number of weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have two arrays:\n\n- For weight 1 items, sorted in descending order. The prefix sum array s1, where s1[k] is the sum of the first k items. The maximum number of items we can take is len1 = number of weight 1 items. So, for any number of weight 1 items taken, say a, the total weight is a*1, and value is s1[a].\n\n- For weight 2 items, similarly, sorted in descending order. Prefix sum s2, and len2 is the number of items.\n\nNow, given a capacity W, how to choose a and b such that a + 2b ≤ W, and maximize s1[a] + s2[b].\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved in O(W) time, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, for a given W, we can iterate over the possible number of weight 2 items (b), and for each b, compute the maximum a as min( (W - 2*b), len1 ), and take the corresponding s1[a]. Then take the maximum over all possible b.\n\nBut for each W, this would take O(len2) time, which could be O(n) in the worst case. But if we have to do this for multiple Ws (for each possible z), this might be too slow.\n\nWait, but for the problem, the maximum W would be m (up to 3e5). So, for each possible W, the maximum number of weight 2 items is up to W//2. However, if len2 is up to n (1e5), then for each W, the loop would be O(W/2) steps, which for W=3e5 is 1.5e5 steps. Multiply by the number of possible z (which could be up to m/3 = 1e5), that's 1e5 * 1.5e5 = 1.5e10 steps. Which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible. So we need a better way.\n\nAlternative idea: precompute for weight 1 and 2 items, for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value. How?\n\nLet me think. For weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for capacity W can be computed with a dynamic programming approach. Let's create a dp array where dp[w] represents the maximum value for capacity w. Then, for each weight 1 item, we can iterate through the dp array and update it. Similarly for weight 2 items. But with W up to 3e5, and n up to 1e5, this would be O(nm), which again is too slow.\n\nBut wait, the weight of items is either 1 or 2. So perhaps there's a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nLet me think again. For the weight 1 items, since they are all of weight 1, the best way to take them is to take as many as possible (sorted in descending order). Similarly for weight 2 items. So for any capacity W, the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items is the maximum over all possible combinations of taking some number of weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let’s say we have sorted weight 1 items in descending order, and weight 2 items in descending order. For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (b), we can take up to (W - 2*b) weight 1 items. The maximum value is then s2[b] + s1[ min( (W - 2*b), len1 ) ].\n\nSo, for a given W, the maximum value is max over b of (s2[b] + s1[ min( (W - 2*b), len1 ) ]).\n\nBut how can we compute this maximum efficiently?\n\nThe key observation here is that for each W, the optimal b is in a certain range, and perhaps we can find it quickly. Let's think: for each possible b, the maximum possible is up to floor(W / 2). But since we have sorted the weight 2 items, taking the first b items gives the maximum value for that count.\n\nBut how to find the optimal b for a given W?\n\nIf we can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2, then for each W, we can iterate through all possible b in the range [0, min( len2, floor(W/2) )], and compute the corresponding value. However, this is O(W) per W, which again is too slow.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find the optimal b for each W quickly.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible W, the optimal number of weight 2 items is up to min( len2, W//2 ). Let's denote this as B_max. For each possible b, the number of weight 1 items that can be taken is (W - 2*b), but can't exceed len1. So the value is s2[b] + s1[ min( W - 2*b, len1 ) ].\n\nBut since s1 is non-decreasing (as we add more items, the sum increases), for each b, the term W - 2*b decreases as b increases. So for each W, the optimal b could be found by trying all possible b in a certain range. However, how to find the best b quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, the maximum value can be found by considering that for each possible number of weight 2 items, we can take up to floor((W - 2*b)/1) weight 1 items. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking as many as possible gives the maximum value.\n\nSo, for each W, the optimal solution is to choose some number of weight 2 items (b), and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (a = min( W - 2*b, len1 )).\n\nBut how to find the best b for this?\n\nSince the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, adding more of them gives higher values, but reduces the space available for weight 1 items. So there's a trade-off here.\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(b) = s2[b] + s1[ min( W - 2*b, len1 ) ].\n\nWe need to find the maximum of f(b) for b in [0, B_max], where B_max is min( len2, floor(W/2) )].\n\nThis function may have a single peak, so we can use ternary search on b. However, since the function is not necessarily unimodal, ternary search may not work. Alternatively, perhaps we can find that for each W, the optimal b is around (W - a)/2, where a is the number of weight 1 items taken. But this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of weight 2 items can't be more than B_max, which is up to 1.5e5 (since W can be up to 3e5), and for each W, this is O(B_max) steps. But if we have to do this for each possible z (number of weight 3 items), this could be expensive.\n\nBut perhaps the number of possible z is manageable. For example, if we process all possible z (from 0 to max_z, where max_z is min( len3, m//3 )), and for each z, compute the remaining weight rem = m - 3*z, then compute the best value for rem using the weight 1 and 2 items. Then, the total time would be O( max_z * B_max ), which could be O( (m/3) * (m/2) ) = O(m^2) which is 9e10 for m=3e5. That's way too big.\n\nThis approach is not feasible. So I need another idea.\n\nAlternative plan: Since the weights are small (only 1, 2, 3), maybe we can use a dynamic programming approach with optimized transitions. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider the standard knapsack DP approach. The DP array is of size m+1, and for each item, we update the DP array. However, for large n and m, this is O(nm) time, which is 3e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nBut since the weights are only 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can find a way to process each group of items with the same weight in O(m) time. For example, for all items of weight 1, we can process them in a way that for each possible capacity, we take the best possible number of items.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the unbounded knapsack problem. For items of weight w, if they are sorted in descending order of value, then for each possible capacity, we can take as many of the highest-value items as possible.\n\nBut since it's 0-1 knapsack (each item can be taken once), we can't just take as many as possible. However, for the same weight, perhaps we can process them in a way that for each possible capacity, we can take the best combination.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem as follows: for each weight group (1, 2, 3), process them in a way that for each possible capacity, the DP is updated optimally.\n\nFor example, for the weight 1 items, sorted in descending order. For each capacity w, the maximum value is the maximum between the current value and the value of taking the next weight 1 item (if possible). But since the items are sorted, taking the first k items gives the maximum possible value for k items of weight 1. So perhaps for the weight 1 items, we can precompute the prefix sums, and then for each capacity, we can take min(w, len1) items. But this is only if all items are of weight 1. However, in the presence of other items, this approach may not work.\n\nBut perhaps we can combine the three groups in a way that uses the fact that the weights are small.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weight (w=1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Precompute prefix sums for each group.\n\nThen, for each possible number of items taken from the weight 3 group (z), and for each possible number of items taken from the weight 2 group (y), compute the maximum number of items from the weight 1 group (x) that can fit into the remaining capacity. But again, this seems too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 3 group, we can iterate through all possible numbers of items taken (z), and for each z, compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*z. Then, for this rem, compute the maximum value from the weight 1 and 2 groups. How to compute that quickly?\n\nAs earlier, the problem is how to compute the maximum value for weight 1 and 2 items given a capacity rem. Let's think of this as a separate problem.\n\nLet me focus on solving the problem for weight 1 and 2 items. Let's say we have a capacity W. How to compute the maximum value?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (y), the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken is (W - 2*y). But since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking the first min( (W - 2*y), len1 ) items gives the maximum value. So the total value is s2[y] + s1[ min( (W - 2*y), len1 ) ].\n\nBut how to find the best y for this W?\n\nLet me note that for each W, the maximum possible y is min( len2, W // 2 ). Let's call this Y_max.\n\nNow, for each y in 0 to Y_max, we can calculate the value. However, doing this for every W is O(Y_max) per W. But if we can precompute for all possible W, then perhaps we can find a way.\n\nBut again, with W up to 3e5 and Y_max up to 1.5e5, this seems computationally heavy.\n\nWait, but for the overall problem, the W is determined by the weight 3 items. Let's assume that for each possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), we compute rem = m - 3*z. Then, for this rem, we need to find the maximum value for weight 1 and 2 items. So, the number of times we need to compute this maximum is O(m/3), which is up to 1e5.\n\nIf for each of those 1e5 cases, we can compute the maximum in O(1) or O(log n) time, that would be acceptable.\n\nSo, the question is, how to compute this maximum for a given W quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the weight 1 and 2 items:\n\nFor a given W, the optimal y (number of weight 2 items) is somewhere between 0 and Y_max. Let me think of the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min(W - 2y, len1) ].\n\nWe can precompute the prefix sums s1 and s2. Now, for each W, the function f(y) is the sum of two terms. The first term increases with y (since the items are sorted), but the second term decreases as y increases (since W-2y decreases). So the function f(y) may have a single peak, making it possible to use ternary search to find the maximum.\n\nBut is this function unimodal? Let's think. Initially, when y is small, increasing y increases the s2[y] term, and decreases the s1 term. At some point, the increase in s2 may dominate the decrease in s1. But after that, further increasing y would decrease the s1 term more than the increase in s2. So the function could be unimodal. If that's the case, ternary search can be used.\n\nAssuming this is true, for each W, we can perform a ternary search on y in [0, Y_max], and find the maximum value of f(y). This would take O(log Y_max) time per W.\n\nBut how to verify that the function is indeed unimodal?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose W is 5. Suppose s2[y] is [0, 5, 8, 10], and s1 is [0, 3, 6, 7, 8]. len1 is 4.\n\nFor y=0: 0 + s1[5] = 0 + 8 (since 5-0=5, but len1 is 4, so min(5,4)=4) → 8.\n\ny=1: 5 + s1[5-2=3] = 5+6=11.\n\ny=2: 8 + s1[5-4=1] = 8+3=11.\n\ny=3: 10 + s1[5-6= -1 → 0] → 10 + 0 = 10.\n\nSo the function peaks at y=1 and y=2. So the function is not strictly unimodal. It has a plateau. However, ternary search may still find the maximum value.\n\nIn this case, the maximum is 11. Ternary search would find that.\n\nSo, even if there are plateaus, ternary search can find the maximum.\n\nThus, using ternary search for each W may be feasible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, given a capacity W, compute the maximum value using ternary search on the number of weight 2 items taken (y). For each possible y, compute the value as s2[y] + s1[ min(W - 2*y, len1) ].\n\nSo, for each W, this would take O(log Y_max) time.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe overall steps would be:\n\n1. Split the items into three groups based on their weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n   For example, for group 1 (weight 1):\n\n   s1[0] = 0\n\n   s1[1] = cost of first item\n\n   s1[2] = cost of first two items, etc.\n\n   Similarly for s2 and s3.\n\n4. Iterate over all possible z (number of weight 3 items taken) from 0 to min(len3, m//3). For each z:\n\n   a. Compute the weight used by these items: 3*z.\n\n   b. If 3*z > m, skip (but since z is up to m//3, this won't happen).\n\n   c. rem = m - 3*z.\n\n   d. Compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items for capacity rem. Let's call this val.\n\n   e. The total value for this z is s3[z] + val.\n\n   f. Keep track of the maximum total value across all z.\n\nSo, the main challenge is step 4d: computing val quickly for each rem.\n\nNow, how to implement the ternary search for each rem.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the number of weight 2 items is up to len2. Let me think of the code for that part.\n\nImplementing the ternary search:\n\ndef get_max_value_for_W(W):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = min(len2, W // 2)\n\n    best = 0\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        val1 = compute_value(mid1, W)\n\n        val2 = compute_value(mid2, W)\n\n        if val1 < val2:\n\n            best = max(best, val2)\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            best = max(best, val1)\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n    # Also check the boundaries, since sometimes the loop may exit before checking all possibilities\n\n    # Also, maybe iterate a few more steps to ensure we find the max\n\n    # Alternatively, after the loop, check all possible y in the vicinity.\n\n    # But for the sake of time, perhaps after the loop, we can check all y in [low, high] ?\n\n    # But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can run the loop for a fixed number of steps (like 100), which is sufficient for convergence.\n\n    # However, in practice, for programming competition purposes, perhaps using a binary search approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible y is up to 1.5e5, and for each W, the ternary search would take about 30 steps (log base 3 of 1.5e5 is around 10), this would be manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAnother idea: for a given W, the optimal y is either floor((W - a)/2), where a is the number of weight 1 items taken. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, for a given W, the optimal number of weight 2 items is the one that maximizes s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, len1 ) ].\n\nLet me think of it this way: for each possible y, the value is s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, len1 ) ].\n\nLet me precompute the prefix sums for s1 and s2.\n\nOnce that is done, for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum of all possible y in 0 to Y_max.\n\nBut how to find that maximum quickly?\n\nAnother observation: For a fixed W, the term W - 2y can be rewritten as a = W - 2y. Since a must be >=0, y can be from 0 to floor(W/2).\n\nThe value is s2[y] + s1[ min(a, len1) ] where a = W - 2y.\n\nBut since a = W - 2y, and we want to maximize this, perhaps we can think of it as choosing y such that the sum of the two prefix sums is maximized.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute for each possible y, the value of 2y, and then for the remaining capacity, take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nBut again, this brings us back to the same problem.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible W, the maximum value can be found by iterating over all possible y in the range [max(0, (W - len1) // 2 ), min(len2, W//2) ].\n\nBecause, suppose that after taking y weight 2 items, we have a = W - 2y weight left for weight 1 items. To take all len1 items, we need a >= len1 → W - 2y >= len1 → y <= (W - len1)/2.\n\nSo, if y is larger than (W - len1)/2, then we can't take all len1 items. So for these y, the contribution from weight 1 is s1[len1], and the contribution from weight 2 is s2[y].\n\nBut for y less than or equal to (W - len1)/2, the contribution from weight 1 is s1[W - 2y].\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe we can split the problem into two parts:\n\nCase 1: y is such that W - 2y >= len1 → a = len1. Then the value is s2[y] + s1[len1].\n\nThe maximum for this case is achieved when y is as large as possible, i.e., y_max_case1 = floor( (W - len1)/2 ). So for this case, the maximum is s2[y_max_case1] + s1[len1].\n\nCase 2: y is such that W - 2y < len1 → a = W - 2y. The value is s2[y] + s1[W - 2y].\n\nThe maximum for this case can be found by iterating over y where 2y ranges from (W - (len1 -1)) to W. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for case 2, we can think of it as maximizing s2[y] + s1[W - 2y] for y in [0, y_max_case2], where y_max_case2 is min( len2, floor(W/2) ), and W - 2y < len1.\n\nBut how to find this maximum.\n\nLet me think of it as a function of y: f(y) = s2[y] + s1[W - 2y].\n\nSince W is fixed, and s1 is a non-decreasing function, and s2 is also non-decreasing.\n\nBut when y increases by 1, 2y increases by 2, so W-2y decreases by 2. So the term s1[W-2y] decreases, while s2[y] increases.\n\nSo this function may have a single peak, which can be found via ternary search.\n\nSo combining both cases, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- the maximum of case 1 (if applicable), and \n\n- the maximum of case 2 (found via ternary search).\n\nBut how to determine whether case 1 is applicable.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps splitting into these cases can reduce the number of possibilities for the ternary search.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the ternary search approach, and hope that it works for all cases.\n\nSo, proceeding with the ternary search approach.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines of wi and ci.\n\nSeparate into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of ci.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each list.\n\nFor example:\n\ns1 = [0]\n\nfor i in range(len(w1)):\n\n    s1.append(s1[-1] + w1[i][1])\n\nSimilarly for s2 and s3.\n\nThen, for each possible z in 0 to min(len(w3), m//3):\n\n    total_weight_3 = 3*z\n\n    if total_weight_3 > m:\n\n        continue\n\n    rem = m - total_weight_3\n\n    val = compute_max_value_1_2(rem)\n\n    current_total = s3[z] + val\n\n    keep track of the maximum.\n\nNow, the compute_max_value_1_2 function is the one that uses ternary search on y.\n\nImplementing compute_max_value_1_2(W):\n\ndef compute_max_value_1_2(W):\n\n    len1 = len(s1) - 1\n\n    len2 = len(s2) - 1\n\n    Y_max = min(len2, W // 2)\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = Y_max\n\n    best = 0\n\n    for _ in range(100):  # enough iterations for convergence\n\n        if low > high:\n\n            break\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        val1 = s2[mid1] + s1[ min(W - 2*mid1, len1) ]\n\n        val2 = s2[mid2] + s1[ min(W - 2*mid2, len1) ]\n\n        if val1 < val2:\n\n            best = max(best, val2)\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            best = max(best, val1)\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n    # After the loop, check all possible y in [low, high] ?\n\n    # Or check some points around the final low and high.\n\n    # Also check the boundaries.\n\n    for y in [0, Y_max, low, high, (low + high) // 2 ]:\n\n        if 0 <= y <= Y_max:\n\n            current_val = s2[y] + s1[ min(W - 2*y, len1) ]\n\n            best = max(best, current_val)\n\n    return best\n\nBut perhaps this is overkill. Another way is to perform the ternary search for a fixed number of steps (like 100), which should be sufficient to converge to the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, use binary search for the optimal point. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when W is very small, like 0, then the function returns 0.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\nSo n=1, m=1. The item has weight 2 and cost 1. Since the total weight is 1, it's not possible to take the item. So output is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo items are:\n\nitem 1: weight 1, cost 3.\n\nitem 2: weight 2, cost 2.\n\nPossible options: take item 1 (total cost 3, weight 1), or item 2 (cost 2, weight 2). The maximum is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4 3\n\n3 10\n\n2 7\n\n2 8\n\n1 1\n\nSo items are:\n\nitem 1: weight 3, cost 10.\n\nitem 2: weight 2, cost 7.\n\nitem 3: weight 2, cost 8.\n\nitem 4: weight 1, cost 1.\n\nSorted by weight:\n\ngroup 1 (w=1): [ (1,1) ]\n\ngroup 2 (w=2): sorted descending by cost: [(2,8), (2,7)]\n\ngroup 3 (w=3): [(3,10)]\n\nprefix sums:\n\ns1: [0, 1]\n\ns2: [0, 8, 15]\n\ns3: [0, 10]\n\nNow, for each z in 0 to 1 (since m=3, 3*z <=3 → z can be 0 or 1).\n\nCase z=0: rem=3.\n\ncompute_max_value_1_2(3).\n\nY_max is min(2, 3//2=1) → 1.\n\nSo possible y is 0 or 1.\n\nFor y=0: W - 0 =3 → take min(3, len1=1) → 1 → value is 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nFor y=1: W - 2*1=1 → take 1 → value is 8 + 1 =9.\n\nSo maximum is 9. So total is 0 +9=9.\n\nCase z=1: rem = 3-3*1=0. So compute_max_value_1_2(0) → 0. Total is 10 + 0 =10. Which is better.\n\nSo overall maximum is 10, which matches the sample.\n\nThus, this approach seems to work.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut what about the time complexity? Let's see.\n\nFor the weight 3 group, the maximum number of z is up to m//3, which is 1e5 for m=3e5.\n\nFor each z, compute_max_value_1_2(W) takes O(100) steps (the ternary search) plus checking a few points. So total steps are O(1e5 * 100) = 1e7, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut for the code:\n\nFirst, read the input. However, the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first line shows that the input is a list of test cases. For example, the first sample input is ['1 1\\n2 1', ...], but in reality, the input is read as a single input. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, but the actual problem is a single test case. Wait, no. The sample input is given as three separate examples. But the user provided the input as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user provides three examples. But the actual code should read from stdin, not from a list of examples. The code needs to process the input as per the problem statement.\n\nSo, the code will read n and m from stdin, then read n lines of wi and ci.\n\nNow, coding:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each with wi and ci.\n\nGroup the items into w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each group in descending order of ci.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group.\n\nThen, for each possible z (number of items taken from w3 group):\n\n   compute rem = m - 3*z.\n\n   if rem <0: skip.\n\n   compute the max value from w1 and w2 for rem.\n\n   add to s3[z], and track the maximum.\n\nNow, implement the compute_max_value_1_2 function as discussed.\n\nBut in Python, for large n (up to 1e5), the code must be efficient. Sorting the groups is O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the code, the groups can be handled as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n\n    ptr +=1\n\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n\n    ptr +=1\n\n    w1 = []\n\n    w2 = []\n\n    w3 = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        wi = int(input[ptr])\n\n        ptr +=1\n\n        ci = int(input[ptr])\n\n        ptr +=1\n\n        if wi ==1:\n\n            w1.append(ci)\n\n        elif wi ==2:\n\n            w2.append(ci)\n\n        else:\n\n            w3.append(ci)\n\n    # sort each group in descending order\n\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # compute prefix sums\n\n    s1 = [0]\n\n    for c in w1:\n\n        s1.append(s1[-1] + c)\n\n    s2 = [0]\n\n    for c in w2:\n\n        s2.append(s2[-1] + c)\n\n    s3 = [0]\n\n    for c in w3:\n\n        s3.append(s3[-1] + c)\n\n    max_total = 0\n\n    len3 = len(w3)\n\n    max_z = min(len3, m//3)\n\n    for z in range(0, max_z +1):\n\n",
