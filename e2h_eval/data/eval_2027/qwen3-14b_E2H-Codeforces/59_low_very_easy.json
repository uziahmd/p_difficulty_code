    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to count the number of arrays of N sets that satisfy certain conditions related to being children of each other. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem statement again. A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1, 2}, then B must have 2 and 3. Wait, no: for each x in A, B must have x+1. So for A's elements, their x+1 must be present in B. So, for example, if A is {1}, then B must contain 2. If A is {2}, then B must contain 3. But if K is 2, then B can't have 3. So in that case, such a child relationship can't exist.\n\nThe problem requires that there exists a rearrangement of the array of sets such that each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. So the array can be reordered in some way where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of such arrays. Each set in the array can have elements from 1 to K, and they are different if any element differs. Also, the arrays are considered different if any set in the array is different.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since the order can be rearranged, perhaps we need to find a way to structure the sets so that there's a chain of dependencies where each set can be a child of the next. But since the order can be rearranged, maybe we can think of the sets as being arranged in a certain hierarchy.\n\nWait, but the key is that there exists some permutation of the array where each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. So the entire array must form a chain where each set can be ordered in such a way that each is a child of the next. How can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sets can be ordered in a way that their elements are \"compatible\" with each other. For example, if we think of each set as a collection of elements, then for the chain S_1' → S_2' → ... → S_N', each S_i' must be a child of S_{i+1}'.\n\nBut since the order can be rearranged, perhaps the problem reduces to the sets forming a DAG where there's a topological order. However, since the chain must be linear (each element is connected to the next), maybe the sets must be such that they can be ordered in a sequence where each one is a child of the next. \n\nBut how do we count all possible arrays of N sets that can be ordered in such a way?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the sets. For a set to be a child of another, it's necessary that for every element x in the first set, x+1 is present in the second. So, if we imagine the elements of the sets, each set's elements can be thought of as being \"lower\" than those of the next set in the chain. For example, if a set has elements {x}, then the next set must have x+1. So, the elements of the first set are all less than the elements of the next set? Not exactly, because the next set could have x+1 and other elements. But perhaps, for the entire chain, the elements of the sets must form a sequence where each set's elements are all less than or equal to some value that allows the next set to have their elements plus one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each set can be represented by a subset of {1, 2, ..., K}, and for the chain S_1' → S_2' → ... → S_N', we need that for each i, S_i' is a child of S_{i+1}'. Which implies that for every x in S_i', x+1 is in S_{i+1}'.\n\nThis seems like a chain where each set's elements are \"covered\" by the next set's elements shifted by one. So, for example, if we have a chain of sets, the elements of the first set must be such that their x+1s are present in the second set, which in turn must have their x+1s in the third, etc. \n\nBut since the order can be rearranged, the problem allows us to arrange the sets in any order that forms such a chain. So the question becomes: what is the total number of arrays of N sets where the sets can be ordered into a chain where each is a child of the next.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the constraints on the sets. For the entire array to be reorderable into a chain, the sets must form a structure where there exists a sequence S_1', S_2', ...,",
    "response": "To solve the problem of counting the number of arrays of sets that can be reordered into a chain where each set is a child of the next, we need to model the structure and dependencies between the sets.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n1. **Child Relationship**:\n   - A set `A` is a child of `B` if for every element `x` in `A`, there exists an element `x + 1` in `B`.\n   - This implies that if `x` is present in `A`, then `x + 1` must be in `B`. Therefore, the elements of `A` must be strictly less than those of `B`.\n\n2. **Chain of Sets**:\n   - We need to count the number of arrays of `N` sets such that they can be ordered in some sequence `S_1', S_2', ..., S_N'` where each `S_i'` is a child of `S_{i+1}'`.\n\n3. **Implication on Elements**:\n   - For a valid chain, each subsequent set must have elements that are \"higher\" in value than the previous one.\n   - Thus, the sets in the array must be able to be ordered such that their maximum elements form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\n4. **Counting Valid Sets**:\n   - Each set can be any subset of `{1, 2, ..., K}`.\n   - The number of possible subsets of `{1, 2, ..., K}` is `2^K`.\n\n5. **Permutations of Sets**:\n   - Since we can rearrange the sets, the order doesn't matter, as long as we can find a permutation that satisfies the child condition.\n   - This means the problem reduces to selecting `N` sets (possibly with repetition), such that they can be ordered into a chain based on their max values.\n\n6. **Dynamic Programming Insight**:\n   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of ways to choose `i` sets such that the maximum element in the last set is `j`.\n   - Transitions: For `dp[i][j]`, it can be formed by adding a set whose max element is `j` to any sequence of `i-1` sets whose last set had a max element ≤ `j-1`.\n\n7. **Efficient Computation**:\n   - We can use prefix sums to compute transitions efficiently.\n   - The total number of valid arrays is the sum over all `dp[N][j]` for `j = 0` to `K`.\n\n---\n\n### Final Algorithm\n\nWe precompute the number of subsets with max value exactly `j` for all `j` from `0` to `K`. Then we use dynamic programming to compute the number of sequences of length `N` that can be ordered into a chain.\n\n```python\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    K = int(data[1])\n    \n    # Step 1: Precompute the number of subsets with max element exactly j\n    cnt = [0] * (K + 2)\n    for j in range(1, K + 1):\n        # Number of subsets with max element j: 2^{j-1}\n        cnt[j] = pow(2, j - 1, MOD)\n    \n    # Step 2: DP\n    dp = [0] * (K + 2)\n    for j in range(1, K + 1):\n        dp[j] = cnt[j]\n    \n    for _ in range(N - 1):\n        new_dp = [0] * (K + 2)\n        prefix = [0] * (K + 2)\n        prefix[0] = dp[0]\n        for j in range(1, K + 1):\n            prefix[j] = (prefix[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD\n        for j in range(1, K + 1):\n            new_dp[j] = (prefix[j - 1] * cnt[j]) % MOD\n        dp = new_dp\n    \n    result = sum(dp[1:]) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- `cnt[j]` stores the number of subsets of `{1, 2, ..., K}` whose maximum element is exactly `j`. This is `2^(j-1)` because such subsets must include `j` and any subset of `{1, 2, ..., j-1}`.\n- `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sequences of `i` sets where the last set has maximum element `j`.\n- Using prefix sums, we compute the number of sequences of `i` sets ending with a set of maximum `j` by combining sequences of `i-1` sets with maximum ≤ `j-1` and appending a set with max `j`.\n\nThis approach ensures the solution runs efficiently in `O(N*K)` time, which is feasible given the constraints.",
