Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take 'b' of them to make a new one. And this new candle can be used again, burning for another hour, and so on. The question is to find the total number of hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles. That's 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burned-out candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So he lights those, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 candles are burned out. So he has 2, which again can be made into 1 new candle. That adds 1 hour. Now, that candle is burned out. But 1 is less than 2, so no more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's check:\n\nStart with 6 candles. 6 hours. Then 6 burned, divided by 3 gives 2 new. So 2 hours. Now 2 burned. Not enough for 3, so total 6+2=8. Wait, but wait, what if there's a way to get more? Like maybe after making the 2 new ones, you have 2 burned ones. But 2 is less than 3. So no. So total is 6 + 2 = 8. Correct.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new candles. But how do we model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitially, the total hours is 'a' (since each candle is used once). Then, the number of burned candles is 'a'. Then, while the number of burned candles is >= b, we can make new candles. Each time, we take (burned // b) new candles. The number of new candles is added to the total hours. Then, the burned candles are updated to (burned % b) + (number of new candles). Because the new candles will be burned, adding to the count.\n\nWait, let me think. For example, in the first case:\n\nAfter initial 4 hours, burned is 4. Then, 4//2 = 2 new. So add 2 hours. Now, the burned candles are 4%2=0 + 2 (the new ones that are now burned). So 2. Then, 2//2=1, add 1 hour. Burned becomes 0 + 1 = 1. Then, 1 < 2, so done. Total is 4+2+1=7.\n\nYes. So the algorithm would be:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles\n\nSo this loop continues until burned is less than b.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a\n\nburned = a\n\nloop:\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new = burned // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burned = burned % b + new\n\nreturn total.\n\nYes. Let's test this logic with the examples.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal starts at 4. burned is 4.\n\nLoop:\n\n4 >= 2. new = 4//2 = 2. total becomes 6. burned is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nAgain, 2 >= 2. new=1. total is 7. burned is 0 +1 =1. Now, loop ends. So total is 7. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, burned=6.\n\n6//3=2. total is 8. burned is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So done. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. So initial total is 5. burned is 5. 5//5=1. total is 6. burned is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see.\n\nInitial total=5. burned=5.\n\n5//2=2. total becomes 5+2=7",
