Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$).

The value of $$$d(1,4)$$$ is:   $$$-2$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees;  $$$-1$$$ for $$$8$$$ trees;  $$$0$$$ for $$$4$$$ trees;  $$$1$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nSo, a good tree has edges with weights 1 or -1. And for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Oh right, because each edge is connected to two vertices. So for every vertex, the product of the edges connected to it is -1. That seems like a crucial condition.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to model these constraints. Let's think about the conditions for a tree to be good. For each vertex, the product of its adjacent edges' weights is -1. Let me consider that for each vertex, the number of edges incident to it must be such that the product can be -1. Wait, since each edge contributes a factor of either 1 or -1. The product being -1 implies that there must be an odd number of -1s in the edges adjacent to that vertex. Because multiplying an even number of -1s would give 1, and odd gives -1. So for each vertex, the number of edges incident to it with weight -1 must be odd.\n\nBut wait, the tree is a connected graph with n-1 edges. Each vertex has degree at least 1. But the product of the edges for each vertex must be -1. Let's think about the implications of this.\n\nLet me think about the degrees of the vertices. For each vertex, the number of edges adjacent to it (its degree) must be such that there's an odd number of -1s. Let's denote that for each vertex i, the product of the edges around it is -1. Let me think of the product of all edges around a vertex as (-1)^k, where k is the number of -1 edges adjacent to it. So (-1)^k = -1 implies that k is odd. Therefore, for each vertex, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it must be odd.\n\nNow, considering the entire tree. Let me think about the sum over all vertices of the number of -1 edges adjacent to them. Each edge is counted twice in this sum: once for each endpoint. Let me denote the total number of -1 edges as m. Then, each such edge contributes 2 to the total sum (since each edge has two endpoints). But each vertex contributes an odd number. So the total sum over all vertices of their count of -1 edges is equal to 2m. However, each vertex contributes an odd number. So the sum of all these counts is equal to the sum over vertices of (some odd number). Let me denote that sum as S. Since each vertex's count is odd, S is equal to the sum of n odd numbers. \n\nBut the sum of n odd numbers is congruent to n mod 2. Because each odd number is 1 mod 2. So S mod 2 is n mod 2. But S is also equal to 2m, which is 0 mod 2. Therefore, we have that n mod 2 must be 0. Which implies that n must be even. Otherwise, there are no good trees. Wait, that's a key point!\n\nSo if n is odd, then there are zero good trees. Hence, the answer is zero. Let me check the example given. For example, in the second test case where n=1, the output is zero. Wait, but n=1. Let me think: when n=1, there are no edges. Then, the condition for each vertex (only one vertex) is that the product of all edges adjacent to it is -1. But since there are no edges, the product is 1 (the empty product). But 1 is not equal to -1. Hence, for n=1, there are zero good trees. Which matches the sample input where n=1 outputs 0.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2. The tree is just one edge. The two vertices each have one edge. The product of the edges adjacent to each vertex is the weight of that edge. So for both vertices, the product must be -1. Hence, the edge's weight must be -1. So there's exactly one good tree. Which matches the first sample input.\n\nSo this suggests that for n odd, the answer is zero. Because the sum S is 2m (even) and the sum of n odd numbers is n mod 2. Hence, when n is odd, it's impossible. Therefore, for n odd, the answer is zero. So for the problem, we can immediately return zero if n is odd. \n\nSo the first step is to check if n is even. If not, return 0. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, assuming n is even. How do we compute the sum of d(1",
