After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column in the gradebook), find the maximum value.\n2. For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many students meet this condition.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, input handling. The input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line is a string of digits. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the first student's marks for 3 subjects.\n\nSo, I'll need to read the input, parse it into a 2D array. Let's think: for each student, their marks are a list of integers. Then, for each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n\nOnce I have the maximums for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in a subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, then the student is successful.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of m digits. Convert each line into a list of integers. So, for example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have the data as a list of lists, then for each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n\nFor example, for the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nThe data would be:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nFor each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (students 0 and 1 have 2, student 2 has 1).\n\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 1 has 3).\n\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 0 has 3).\n\nSo, the successful students are those who have at least one of these max values in their marks.\n\nStudent 0 has 2 in subject 0 (which is max), 2 in subject 1 (not max), 3 in subject 2 (max). So he is successful.\n\nStudent 1 has 2 in subject 0 (max), 3 in subject 1 (max), 2 in subject 2 (not max). So he is successful.\n\nStudent 2 has 1 in all subjects. None are max. So not successful. Hence total is 2.\n\nSo the output is 2.\n\nSo how to compute this?\n\nFirst, for each column, find the maximum. Let's create a list called max_per_subject. For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum of all students' marks in column j.\n\nOnce we have that, for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max_per_subject for that subject.\n\nIf yes, then count them.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the data into a 2D list.\n\nCompute max_per_subject for each column.\n\nThen for each student, iterate through their marks, check if any mark equals the max for that subject.\n\nIf at least one such exists, increment the count.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the input section, the first line is two integers n and m. Then next n lines each contain m characters. So, for example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nWhich would be read as n=3, m=3, then three lines.\n\nSo in code:\n\nWe can read the first line as n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen read the next n lines as strings, and convert each into a list of integers.\n\nSo, for example, for each line in the next n lines:\n\nmarks = [list(map(int, list(input().strip()))) for _ in range(n)]\n\nWait, input().strip() would get the line, then list() converts it into individual characters, then map(int, ...) converts each to integer. So for '223', it becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have this 2D list, then for each column j, compute the max.\n\nSo for j in 0 to m-1:\n\nmax_per_subject[j] = max( marks[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nOnce we have that, then for each student i, check if any of their marks in j is equal to max_per_subject[j].\n\nSo for each student i, loop through each j, check if marks[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]. If any of them is true, then the student is successful.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nLet me think about code steps.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute max_per_subject as a list of m elements.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in a subject is equal to the max for that subject.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nmarks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    marks.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if marks[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = marks[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    successful = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if marks[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            successful = True\n            break\n    if successful:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that should work.\n\nLet's test the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nmarks is:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2 (from student 0 and 1)\n\ncolumn 1: 3 (student 1)\n\ncolumn 2: 3 (student 0)\n\nSo max_per_subject = [2,3,3]\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: check each j:\n\nj=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So successful.\n\nstudent 1: j=0 (2 == 2 → yes). So successful.\n\nstudent 2: check j=0 (1 < 2), j=1 (1 < 3), j=2 (2 < 3). No. So not successful. So total is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo the marks are:\n\nStudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nStudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9 (student 0)\n\ncolumn 1: 1 (all students have 1?)\n\nWait, student 0's column 1 is 1, student 1's column 1 is 1, student 2's column 1 is 1. So max is 1.\n\ncolumn 2: 8 (student 1 has 8, student 0 has 7, student 2 has 1.)\n\ncolumn 3: 2 (all students have 2? Student 0:2, student1:2, student2:1. So max is 2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8 (student 0 and 1 have 8, student2 has 1.)\n\nSo max_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8].\n\nNow check each student:\n\nstudent 0:\n\nhas 9 in column 0 (max), so yes.\n\nstudent 1:\n\nhas 8 in column 2 (max), and 8 in column 4 (max). So yes.\n\nstudent 2:\n\ncheck each column. column 0: 1 <9. column 1: 1 ==1 (max). So yes. So student 2 is successful.\n\nHence total is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo code works here.\n\nEdge cases: what if all students have same marks in all subjects? Then all are successful. For example, n=2, m=1. All students have 5. Then each student is best in the subject. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is best, so count is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 9], student 2 has [9, 9]. Then for each subject, max is 9. Both students have 9 in both. So both are successful. Count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 8], student 2 has [9, 9]. For subject 0, max is 9. Both students have it. For subject 1, max is 9 (student 2). So student 1 has 8, not max. Student 2 has 9. So student 1 is successful (because of subject 0), student 2 is successful (subject 0 and 1). So count is 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, when reading the input, sometimes there may be leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says that each line is m characters. So input().strip() is safe, but perhaps better to use input().strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says that each line has exactly m characters. So, for example, if the input line is '223', then input().strip() is '223', which is correct.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nThen lines '223', '232', '112'.\n\nThe code will process that correctly.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one, which is 3 5, with the lines as given.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m, then read n lines.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the code.\n\nNow, I need to write this in Python.\n\nNow, the code should be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is converted into a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_per_subject for each column.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in a column is equal to the max for that column.\n\nCount the number of such students.\n\nYes.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nmarks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    marks.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if marks[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = marks[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if marks[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's the code.\n\nWait, in the code, for each student i, we check for each j. If any j is found where the mark is equal to the max, then we increment count by 1 and break. So that's correct.\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting the first sample input, returns 2, second returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then read the gradebook entries for each student.\n2. **Determine Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest grade achieved by any student.\n3. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum grade in any subject. If they have, mark them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nmarks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    marks.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if marks[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = marks[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if marks[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is split into integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line is converted into a list of integers representing the grades of a student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Grades**: For each subject (column in the gradebook), we iterate through all students to find the highest grade. These maximum values are stored in a list called `max_per_subject`.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, we check if their grade in any subject matches the maximum grade for that subject. If it does, the student is counted as successful and we move to the next student.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum grades per subject and checking each student against these maxima. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of students and subjects, making it efficient for the given constraints.",
