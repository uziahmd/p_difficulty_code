    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds. So for any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe I can find a way to simplify this.\n\nWait, the problem says that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z. Because x is up to B, and y starts from B. Wait, the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be as small as A, up to B. Then y starts from B (since x ≤ B ≤ y) up to C. And z starts from C up to D. So the three sides are ordered such that x ≤ y ≤ z. So for the triangle to be non-degenerate, we need x + y > z. Because in a triangle with sides ordered a ≤ b ≤ c, the necessary and sufficient condition is a + b > c. Because if that holds, then the other inequalities (a + c > b and b + c > a) are automatically satisfied since c is the largest.\n\nSo the main condition here is x + y > z. But given that x ≤ B, y ≥ B, and z ≥ C. Wait, but y can be up to C, and z up to D. So how do I count all possible triples (x, y, z) where x is between A and B, y is between B and C, z between C and D, and x ≤ y ≤ z, and x + y > z?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the constraints. For each possible x and y, what is the range of z that satisfies C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y? Because since z is at least C, and for each x and y, the minimal z is C. But z also has to be less than x + y. So for a given x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. But also, since z must be ≥ y (since y ≤ C ≤ z). Wait no. Wait the problem says that y is between B and C, and z is between C and D. So y can be up to C, and z starts at C. So for y ≤ C and z ≥ C, then z is ≥ y. So the ordering x ≤ y ≤ z is maintained. So for each x and y, z can be from C to D, but also must be less than x + y. But since z is at least C, the valid z's for a given x and y are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)] provided that C ≤ x + y - 1. Otherwise, there are no such z.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], for each y in [B, C], compute the lower bound of z (which is C) and upper bound (which is min(D, x + y - 1)). If the lower bound is <= upper bound, then the number of z's is (upper - lower + 1). Sum all these counts over x and y.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that y must be ≥ B and ≤ C. Also, x is between A and B. So x can be from A to B, and y from B to C. However, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, then x ≤ y. Because for example, if x is B and y is B, then x = y. So the x and y are such that x ≤ y.\n\nBut then, for each x and y, the z has to be ≥ y (since y ≤ C ≤ z). Wait, no. Because z is ≥ C, and y can be up to C. So for example, if y is C, then z is ≥ C, so z ≥ y. If y is less than C, then z is ≥ C ≥ y. So yes, z is always ≥ y. So the ordering x ≤ y ≤ z is satisfied.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], z ∈ [C, D], and x + y > z. And since z is ≥ C, and for each x and y, the z's that are allowed are those between C and min(D, x + y - 1). So the count for each x and y is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? Because if we do it naively for each x and y, that would be O((B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow for Python. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the challenge is to find an efficient way to compute the total number of valid z's for all x and y.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Let me denote for a fixed x and y, the maximum z is min(D, x + y - 1). The minimum z is C. So the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C. Else zero.\n\nSo the count for each x and y is:\n\nif x + y - 1 < C: 0\n\nelse:\n\nif D < C: 0 (but since C <= D, this can't happen)\n\nelse:\n\nif x + y - 1 >= D: then the count is D - C + 1\n\nelse: x + y - 1 - C + 1 = x + y - C\n\nSo for each x and y, the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) = max(0, (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)).\n\nBut since x + y - 1 can be written as (x + y) - 1, and C is fixed.\n\nSo the problem is to compute sum_{x, y} [ max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) ].\n\nLet me rephrase this as:\n\nsum_{x, y} [ max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) ] \n\n= sum_{x, y} [ max(0, min(D - C + 1, x + y - C)) ) ]\n\nBecause min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1 is equal to min(D - C + 1, x + y - C). Because:\n\nLet me think: min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1 = min(D - C + 1, (x + y -1) - C + 1) = min(D - C + 1, x + y - C).\n\nYes. So the term becomes min(D - C + 1, x + y - C), but only if x + y - C is positive. Otherwise zero.\n\nWait, because the original term is max(0, ...). So the entire expression is max(0, min(D - C + 1, x + y - C)).\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the sum over x and y of max(0, min(K, x + y - S)), where K is D - C + 1, and S is C. Wait, S is C. So x + y must be > S, which is equivalent to x + y - S > 0. So the term inside is min(K, x + y - S) if x + y - S > 0, else zero.\n\nSo the problem is to calculate for all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], the sum of min(K, x + y - S) if x + y > S, else 0.\n\nLet me denote S = C. And K = D - C + 1. Because if x + y - S is larger than K, then the min is K, else it's x + y - S.\n\nSo the sum can be split into two parts:\n\nFor each x and y:\n\nif x + y <= S → contribution is 0\n\nelse:\n\nif x + y - S <= K → contribution is x + y - S\n\nelse → contribution is K.\n\nSo the total sum is sum_{x, y} [max(0, min(K, x + y - S))].\n\nNow, how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about variables. Let me define variables:\n\nLet’s consider that x ranges from X_low = A to X_high = B.\n\ny ranges from Y_low = B to Y_high = C.\n\nSo for each x and y in their ranges, compute the contribution.\n\nBut how to find the sum over x and y of the above function.\n\nLet me think of x and y as variables, and for each x, find the range of y such that x + y > S, and then compute the sum accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, for each x, find the minimal y that makes x + y > S. Let me denote that minimal y as y_min(x) = max(Y_low, S - x + 1). Because x + y > S → y > S - x → y ≥ S - x + 1.\n\nBut since y has to be ≥ Y_low (which is B) and ≤ Y_high (C), then for each x, the valid y's are those in [y_start, Y_high], where y_start = max(Y_low, S - x + 1).\n\nIf y_start > Y_high, then there are no such y for this x. Otherwise, for each such y, we can calculate the contribution.\n\nBut again, for each x, looping through all possible y is O(B - A + 1) * O(C - B + 1), which is not feasible for large ranges.\n\nSo we need to find a way to compute for each x, the sum over y in [y_start, Y_high] of min(K, x + y - S).\n\nLet me think about the term x + y - S. Let me denote T = x + y - S. Then, for each y, T can be rewritten as (x - S) + y. Since x is fixed for a particular x.\n\nLet me define for a fixed x, the variable y varies between y_start and Y_high. So for each x, the term is min(K, (x - S) + y).\n\nLet me denote that (x - S) as a constant for a given x. Let's call it delta_x = x - S.\n\nThen, the term is min(K, delta_x + y).\n\nSo for each x, we have delta_x, and we need to compute the sum over y in [y_start, Y_high] of min(K, delta_x + y).\n\nSo for a given delta_x, and a range of y values, what is the sum of min(K, delta_x + y)?\n\nLet me think of this as follows. For each y in [y_start, Y_high], we can compute delta_x + y. Let's call this value T.\n\nIf T <= K: then min is T. Else, it's K.\n\nSo for each x, we can find the range of y where delta_x + y <= K, and the rest contribute K.\n\nLet me find the threshold y0 for which delta_x + y0 = K → y0 = K - delta_x.\n\nSo for y ≤ y0, the term is delta_x + y. For y > y0, the term is K.\n\nBut since y is in [y_start, Y_high], we can split the sum into two parts:\n\n- y in [y_start, y0'] where y0' is min(Y_high, y0)\n\n- y in [y0'+1, Y_high]\n\nSo the sum is sum_{y = y_start to y0'} (delta_x + y) + (Y_high - y0') * K.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for each x?\n\nFirst, for a given x, compute delta_x = x - S.\n\nThen, y0 = K - delta_x = K - (x - S) = K + S - x.\n\nBut S is C, and K is D - C + 1. So K + S = D - C + 1 + C = D + 1. So y0 = D + 1 - x.\n\nSo for each x, y0 = D + 1 - x.\n\nSo for each x, the threshold is y0 = D + 1 - x.\n\nNow, for each x, the y's are in [y_start, Y_high], which is [max(B, S - x + 1), C]. Let me call this interval [y_low, y_high], where y_low = max(B, S - x + 1), and y_high = C.\n\nThen, the threshold y0 is D + 1 - x.\n\nWe need to find the intersection of [y_low, y_high] with the interval (-infty, y0] and [y0+1, +infty).\n\nSo for the current x, the sum can be calculated as follows:\n\nCompute the lower and upper bounds of y for which delta_x + y <= K. Which is y <= y0.\n\nSo within the [y_low, y_high] interval, the y's that are <= y0 contribute delta_x + y. The rest contribute K.\n\nLet me find the overlap between [y_low, y_high] and [ -infty, y0 ].\n\nThe overlapping interval is [y_low, y_upper], where y_upper is min(y_high, y0).\n\nIf y_upper < y_low, then there is no such y, and the entire sum is (number of y) * K.\n\nElse, the sum is:\n\nsum_{y = y_low to y_upper} (delta_x + y) + (y_high - y_upper) * K.\n\nSo the question is, for each x, how to compute this.\n\nBut how to compute this for all x efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], do the following:\n\nCompute y_low = max(B, S - x + 1) = max(B, C - x + 1) since S is C.\n\nWait S is C. So y_low = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\ny_high = C.\n\nThen, compute y0 = D + 1 - x.\n\nCompute y_upper = min(y_high, y0).\n\nIf y_upper < y_low → then no y in the interval contributes to the first part. So the sum is (y_high - y_low + 1) * K, but only if y_low <= y_high. Otherwise, zero.\n\nElse, the sum is:\n\nsum_{y = y_low to y_upper} (delta_x + y) + (y_high - y_upper) * K.\n\nBut delta_x is x - S = x - C.\n\nSo sum_{y = y_low to y_upper} (x - C + y) = sum_{y} (x - C) + sum y.\n\nWhich is (x - C) * (number of terms) + sum(y from y_low to y_upper).\n\nThe number of terms is (y_upper - y_low + 1).\n\nSum(y from a to b) is (b - a + 1) * (a + b) / 2.\n\nSo putting it all together, for each x, we can compute the contribution.\n\nBut even this approach requires O(B - A + 1) operations, which for B up to 5e5, would be 5e5 operations. Which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute S = C, K = D - C + 1.\n\n- For each x in [A, B], compute:\n\n   y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   y_high = C\n\n   if y_low > y_high → no contribution from this x.\n\n   else:\n\n      compute y0 = D + 1 - x.\n\n      y_upper = min(y_high, y0)\n\n      if y_upper < y_low → contribution is (y_high - y_low + 1) * K\n\n      else:\n\n         count1 = y_upper - y_low + 1\n\n         sum1 = (x - C) * count1 + (y_upper + y_low) * count1 // 2\n\n         count2 = y_high - y_upper\n\n         sum2 = count2 * K\n\n         total_contribution += sum1 + sum2\n\nSo the overall time complexity is O(B - A + 1), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → Output is 4.\n\nLet me compute S = C = 3, K = D - C + 1 = 4 -3 +1 = 2.\n\nFor x in [1, 2], and y in [2, 3].\n\nLet me process each x.\n\nCase x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 -1 +1) = max(2, 3) → 3.\n\ny_high = 3.\n\nSo y_low is 3, y_high is 3. So y is 3.\n\ny0 = D +1 -x = 4 +1 -1 = 4.\n\ny_upper = min(3,4) = 3.\n\nso y_upper >= y_low.\n\ncount1 = 3 -3 +1 = 1.\n\nsum1 = (1 -3)*1 + (3 + 3)*1 / 2 → (-2) + 3 → 1?\n\nWait (x - C) is (1 - 3) = -2. Multiply by count1 (1) → -2.\n\nsum(y from 3 to 3) is 3. So sum1 is -2 + 3 = 1.\n\ncount2 = 3 - 3 = 0 → sum2 = 0.\n\nTotal contribution for x=1 is 1.\n\nNow, for x=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 -2 +1) = max(2, 2) → 2.\n\ny_high = 3.\n\ny0 = 4+1 -2 = 3.\n\ny_upper = min(3,3) =3.\n\nSo y_upper is 3.\n\ncount1 = 3-2 +1 = 2.\n\nsum1: (2-3) * 2 + (2+3)*2/2 → (-1)*2 + (5 * 2)/2 → -2 +5 = 3.\n\ncount2 is 3 -3 = 0. sum2 is 0. So total contribution is 3.\n\nSo total sum is 1 +3=4 → which matches the sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: 1 2 2 5 → Output is 3.\n\nS = C = 2. K = 5 -2 +1 =4.\n\nx ranges from 1 to 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2 -1 +1) → max(2, 2) →2.\n\ny_high = 2.\n\ny0 = 5 +1 -1 =5.\n\ny_upper = min(2,5) =2.\n\ncount1 = 1.\n\nsum1: (1-2)*1 + (2 + 2)*1/2 → -1 + 2 → 1.\n\ncount2 = 0. So contribution is 1.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2 -2 +1) → max(2, 1) →2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ny0 =5+1-2=4.\n\ny_upper = min(2,4) =2.\n\ncount1=1.\n\nsum1: (2-2)*1 + (2+2)*1/2 → 0 + 2 → 2.\n\ncount2=0. So contribution is 2.\n\nTotal sum is 1 +2 =3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output is 1.\n\nS = C = 500000, K = D - C +1 = 500000 -500000 +1 =1.\n\nx ranges from 500000 to 500000. So x=500000.\n\ny_low is max(B=500000, C -x +1 = 500000 -500000 +1 =1) → 500000.\n\ny_high = C =500000.\n\ny0 = D +1 -x = 500000 +1 -500000 =1.\n\ny_upper = min(500000, 1) →1. Which is less than y_low (500000). So contribution is (y_high - y_low +1) * K → (500000 -500000 +1) *1 =1*1=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the logic seems to work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, handle the case when K is zero? No, since K is D - C +1. Since C ≤ D, D - C +1 ≥ 1. So K ≥1.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute S = C.\n\nK = D - C + 1.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B inclusive:\n\n   compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   y_high = C\n\n   if y_low > y_high: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      y0 = D + 1 - x\n\n      y_upper = min(y_high, y0)\n\n      if y_upper < y_low:\n\n          count = y_high - y_low + 1\n\n          total += count * K\n\n      else:\n\n          count1 = y_upper - y_low + 1\n\n          sum1_part = (x - C) * count1\n\n          sum_y = (y_low + y_upper) * count1 // 2\n\n          sum1 = sum1_part + sum_y\n\n          count2 = y_high - y_upper\n\n          sum2 = count2 * K\n\n          total += sum1 + sum2\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the case when y_upper is between y_low and y_high, then the sum is sum1 + sum2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut what about when y_upper is larger than y_high? Well, since y_upper is min(y_high, y0), so no.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for x in range(A, B+1):\n\nBut when A and B are up to 5e5, this loop would run up to 5e5 times, which is acceptable.\n\nTesting this code with the samples.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input lines. Wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the sample input is multiple test cases, but the actual code needs to read one line of input. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nSo the code should read one line of input. But the sample input shows multiple lines. Oh, perhaps the sample input is multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as three lines, but the output is three lines. But according to the problem statement, the input is four integers on the first line. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the sample input is showing three separate test cases, each with their own input line. So the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the original problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple lines for the purpose of the example, but in reality, the code should read one line of input. Or perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on their own line.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. So the code should read one line. However, the sample input shows three lines, which suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. But the problem's note says that the sample input is given as three lines, but the actual input is one line. So perhaps the sample input is presented as multiple lines for the purpose of the example, but the actual code should read a single line.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000'], but that's probably a mistake in formatting. Probably, the sample input is three separate test cases, each on their own line. But the problem says that the input is four integers. Therefore, the code should read a single line of input. But the sample shows three lines, so perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input and output show that the code should process multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nLooking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is multiple lines, each being a test case. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. This is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps it's a mistake in the problem statement's formatting. For example, in programming contests, sometimes the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual input is one line per test case. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is four integers. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the first sample input line is '1 2 3 4' which gives output 4. The second input line is '1 2 2 5' which gives output 3. Third input line is '500000 ...' which gives output 1.\n\nTherefore, the code must read multiple lines of input, each line being a test case. So in the code, we need to read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is four integers. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement. But given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code will read all lines from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    ... compute answer ...\n\n    print(answer)\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, it says that the first line contains four integers. But perhaps that's a mistake, and the actual code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to resolve this? Well, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nSo now, the code:\n\nImplement the logic discussed earlier.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead each line, split into A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute S = C, K = D - C + 1.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n   y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   y_high = C\n\n   if y_low > y_high:\n\n       continue\n\n   y0 = D + 1 - x\n\n   y_upper = min(y_high, y0)\n\n   if y_upper < y_low:\n\n       count = y_high - y_low + 1\n\n       total += count * K\n\n   else:\n\n       count1 = y_upper - y_low + 1\n\n       sum1_part = (x - C) * count1\n\n       sum_y = (y_low + y_upper) * count1 // 2\n\n       sum1 = sum1_part + sum_y\n\n       count2 = y_high - y_upper\n\n       sum2 = count2 * K\n\n       total += sum1 + sum2\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut let me check for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: A = B = C = D = 1.\n\nSo x can be 1, y can be 1, z can be 1.\n\nCheck if x + y > z → 1 + 1 > 1 → 2>1 → yes. So count is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=2.\n\nSo x=1, y ranges from 1 to 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(1, 2 -1 +1) = max(1, 2) → 2. y_high is 2.\n\nSo y is 2.\n\ny0 = D +1 -x = 2 +1 -1 =2.\n\ny_upper = min(2, 2) =2.\n\ncount1 = 1.\n\nsum1_part = (1 - 2) *1 = -1.\n\nsum_y = (2 + 2)*1//2 = 2.\n\nsum1 = -1 + 2 =1.\n\ncount2 = 2 -2 =0. sum2=0. total +=1.\n\nSo total is 1.\n\nWhat is the actual count?\n\nPossible triangles: x=1, y=2, z can be 2.\n\nCheck 1 + 2 > 2 → 3>2 → yes. So one triangle. Correct.\n\nAnother case: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3.\n\nS =3, K=3-3+1=1.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 -1 +1)= max(2,3) =3. y_high=3.\n\ny0=3+1 -1=3. y_upper=3.\n\ncount1 =1.\n\nsum1_part: (1-3)*1 =-2. sum_y: (3+3)*1//2 =3. sum1 =-2 +3=1. count2=0. total +=1.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-2 +1) = max(2, 2) =2. y_high=3.\n\ny0=3+1 -2 =2.\n\ny_upper = min(3, 2) =2.\n\nso y_upper >= y_low (2 >=2).\n\ncount1=2-2 +1=1.\n\nsum1_part: (2-3)*1 =-1. sum_y: (2+2)*1//2 =2. sum1 =-1 +2=1.\n\ncount2=3-2=1. sum2=1*1=1. total += 1+1=2. So total is 1+2=3.\n\nWhat are the valid triangles?\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1, y=3, z can be 3. 1+3>3 → yes. So 1.\n\nFor x=2, y can be 2 or 3.\n\nFor y=2:\n\nz must be between 3 and 3. Check 2+2>3 → 4>3 → yes. So z=3 → count 1.\n\nFor y=3: z=3. 2+3>3 → yes. So count 1.\n\nSo total 1 (from x=1) + 2 (from x=2) =3. Which matches the code's result.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut for very large ranges, like 5e5, the code may take O(5e5) time. Which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut let's think about possible optimizations. For example, if A and B are large, but in Python, loops are manageable as long as they are not nested.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead each line from stdin, process each line.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        S = C\n        K = D - C + 1\n        total = 0\n        for x in range(A, B + 1):\n            y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n            y_high = C\n            if y_low > y_high:\n                continue\n            y0 = D + 1 - x\n            y_upper = min(y_high, y0)\n            if y_upper < y_low:\n                count = y_high - y_low + 1\n                total += count * K\n            else:\n                count1 = y_upper - y_low + 1\n                sum1_part = (x - C) * count1\n                sum_y = (y_low + y_upper) * count1 // 2\n                sum1 = sum1_part + sum_y\n                count2 = y_high - y_upper\n                sum2 = count2 * K\n                total += sum1 + sum2\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, for the case where y_upper is greater than y_high? No, since y_upper is min(y_high, ...), so it can't be.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 1 2 3 4 → output 4. Which is correct.\n\nSample input 2: 1 2 2 5 → output 3. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1 → output 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=2 → output 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=2, B=2, C=2, D=2 → output 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=1, B=3, C=3, D=3. Let's see:\n\nx ranges from 1-3.\n\nFor each x:\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(3, 3 -1 +1) = max(3, 3) =3. y_high=3.\n\ny0 = 3 +1 -1 =3.\n\ny_upper = min(3,3) =3.\n\ncount1=1.\n\nsum1_part: (1-3)*1 = -2. sum_y = (3+3)*1//2 =3 → sum1 =-2 +3 =1. count2=0. total +=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(3, 3-2+1)= max(3, 2) →3. y_high=3.\n\ny0=3+1 -2 =2. y_upper = min(3, 2) =2 < y_low=3 → count = 3-3 +1 =1. multiply by K = D - C +1 = 3-3 +1=1. So total +=1*1=1 → total is 1+1=2.\n\nx=3:\n\ny_low = max(3, 3-3+1) = max(3, 1) →3. y_high=3.\n\ny0 =3+1 -3 =1. y_upper = min(3,1) =1 <3 → count =1 → total +=1*1 → total is 2+1=3.\n\nSo total is 3. What is the actual count?\n\nPossible x, y, z:\n\nx can be 1, 2, 3. y is 3. z is 3.\n\nCheck for each x:\n\nx=1, y=3, z=3 → 1+3>3 → yes.\n\nx=2, y=3, z=3 → 2+3>3 → yes.\n\nx=3, y=3,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key insight is that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the constraints $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the critical condition simplifies to $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$, we can iterate over all valid values of $x$ and $y$ and determine the valid range of $z$ values that satisfy the triangle inequality.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: For each valid pair $(x, y)$, compute the range of $z$ values that satisfy $x + y > z$. This range is determined by the minimum of $D$ and $x + y - 1$ starting from $C$.\n3. **Summation**: Use arithmetic progression to efficiently calculate the sum of valid $z$ values for each pair $(x, y)$, avoiding nested loops which would be computationally expensive.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        S = C\n        K = D - C + 1\n        total = 0\n        for x in range(A, B + 1):\n            y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n            y_high = C\n            if y_low > y_high:\n                continue\n            y0 = D + 1 - x\n            y_upper = min(y_high, y0)\n            if y_upper < y_low:\n                count = y_high - y_low + 1\n                total += count * K\n            else:\n                count1 = y_upper - y_low + 1\n                sum1_part = (x - C) * count1\n                sum_y = (y_low + y_upper) * count1 // 2\n                sum1 = sum1_part + sum_y\n                count2 = y_high - y_upper\n                sum2 = count2 * K\n                total += sum1 + sum2\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines of input, each representing a test case with four integers $A, B, C, D$.\n2. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize variables $S$ (which is $C$) and $K$ (which is $D - C + 1$).\n3. **Iterating Over $x$**: For each value of $x$ from $A$ to $B$, compute the valid range of $y$ values starting from $B$ to $C$.\n4. **Valid Range for $z$**: For each valid pair $(x, y)$, compute the threshold $y0$ and determine the valid range of $z$ values that satisfy the triangle inequality.\n5. **Summing Valid Triangles**: Use arithmetic progression to efficiently compute the sum of valid $z$ values for each $(x, y)$ pair, ensuring the solution is efficient even for large input sizes.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid triangles without resorting to brute-force methods, making it feasible for large input ranges up to $5 \\times 10^5$.",
