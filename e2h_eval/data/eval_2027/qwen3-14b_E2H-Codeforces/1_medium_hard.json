    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. \n\nHmm. Let me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For the i-th ring, it's based on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we calculate the number of cells in that ring?\n\nWait, the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. So for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, no, maybe a better way: the perimeter cells are (W * 2) + (H - 2)*2? No, wait. Let me think again. For a rectangle with width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (H-2) each. So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Yes, that formula.\n\nSo for each ring i, we compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i, h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, wait. Wait the i-th ring is the border of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1))? Or is it the border of the rectangle that's (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1))? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: the i-th ring should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) × (h - 4(i-1)). So for example, the first ring (i=1) is the border of the original rectangle. The second ring (i=2) is the border of the rectangle that's 4*(i-1) = 4*1 = 4 units smaller in each dimension. So for the second ring, the rectangle is (w-4) × (h-4), and the ring is its border. \n\nSo for each i from 1 to k, we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i, h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each ring, the rectangle must be valid. For example, if the dimensions after subtracting 4*(i-1) from both w and h are less than or equal to zero, then that ring can't exist. However, the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ), which ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are at least 3? Let me see. Let's think for i-th ring. The minimum between w and h must be at least 4*(i-1) + 3? Because for the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), the minimum of these two must be at least 3? Because otherwise, the rectangle can't have a border. Wait, but the problem says that the input k is such that it's allowed. So the input ensures that for each i up to k, the rectangle for the i-th ring is valid. So we don't have to worry about that. \n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute 2*(w_i + h_i - 2), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1). Sum all those values.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, w_i = 3, h_i=3. The perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. So i=1, w=7, h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output of 28. \n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So for i=1: 7,9 → perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 28. For i=2, w_i =7 -4*(1) =3, h_i=9-4*(1)=5. Then perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total sum is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. \n\nYes, so this seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize total = 0\n\n- For each i from 1 to k:\n\n   - compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   - add 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) to total\n\n- Return total.\n\nBut wait, let me check another case. Suppose i=2, and the current_w and current_h are 3 and 5. The perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 12. Which is correct. For example, a 3x5 rectangle's border is 3*2 + (5-2)*2 = 6 + 6 = 12. Yes.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe input is three integers w, h, k. Read them from stdin. Then compute the sum as described.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the line as input, split into w, h, k.\n\nThen loop from 1 to k inclusive, compute for each i:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nsum all perimeters.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. Because the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me think. Let me take min(w, h) as m. Then the maximum k is floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's see for i-th ring, the current_w and current_h are w -4*(i-1) and h -4*(i-1). Since m is the minimum of w and h, then for i up to k_max, m -4*(i-1) >= 3? Let me check for i=k_max.\n\nFor example, if m is 3, then k_max is floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So for i=1, 3-4*(0) =3. Which is okay.\n\nIf m is 7, then (7+1)/4 = 2. So floor is 2. For i=2, 7 -4*(1) =3. Which is okay. For i=3, it would be 7 -4*(2) = -1, but k is limited to 2. So the input ensures that for each i in 1..k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Because for the i-th ring, the rectangle must be at least 3x3? Because otherwise, the ring can't be formed. But according to the problem statement, the input is valid. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for example when i=1, the first ring. For example, in the first sample input, 3x3. current_w=3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: if w=7, h=9, k=2. As in the third sample. The first ring is 7,9 → 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring is 7-4=3, 9-4=5. 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead input line as three integers. For example, input could be read via input().split().\n\nSo:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's the code. Let's test it against the samples.\n\nSample 1: input 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 =40. Correct.\n\nYes, looks good.\n\nWhat about when k is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2)= 2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3 → perimeter 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Total 24+8=32. Which would be the answer.\n\nYes. So code works.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
