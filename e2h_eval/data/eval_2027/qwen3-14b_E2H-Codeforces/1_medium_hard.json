    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, right. So for each ring, we take that rectangle and then take its perimeter. But how do I calculate the perimeter for each of these rectangles?\n\nWait, the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes (W or H) cells, but subtracting 4 because the corners are counted twice. Wait, no. Let me think again. For a rectangle of size m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the perimeter would be 2*m + 2*(n-2). Because the top and bottom rows have n cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the top and bottom) have (m-2) cells each. So total is 2*n + 2*(m-2) = 2*(n + m - 2). Alternatively, 2*(m + n) - 4. Which simplifies to 2*(m + n - 2). So yes.\n\nSo for each ring i, the perimeter is 2*( (current_width + current_height - 2) ), where current_width is w - 4*(i-1), current_height is h - 4*(i-1). Wait, but wait, the i-th ring is based on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1))? Let me check the example.\n\nTake the first example input: 3 3 1. So the first ring is the perimeter of 3x3. The perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input 7 9 2. Let's see. The first ring is for i=1: width is 7, height 9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Then for the second ring (i=2), the width is 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. Height is 9 - 4*(2-1) = 5. So perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the third example's output. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. What if the rectangle becomes too small? For example, when i increases, the width and height decrease by 4 each time. But the problem says that k is given such that it's valid. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense, because for i=1, the rectangle is 3x... Well, let's see. For example, if w and h are 3, then for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3. Then for i=2, it would be 3-4*(1) = -1, which is invalid. But since k is constrained, the input will ensure that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the plan is: loop from i=1 to k, compute for each i the current width and height, compute the perimeter, add to the total.\n\nSo the formula for each step is:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\nsum += perimeter\n\nSo the code would read w, h, k, then loop for each i from 1 to k, compute the above.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. i=1: current_w=3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. i=1: current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird example input: 7 9 2. i=1: 28, i=2: current_w =7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)= 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. For i=1, perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. For i=2, current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 2*0=0? Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the input is constrained such that k is valid. So for w=5, h=5, min(w,h) is 5. So floor( (5+1)/4 ) = floor(6/4) = 1. So k can be at most 1. So in this case, the input would not allow k=2. So the code doesn't need to handle that case.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\ntotal += perimeter\n\nReturn total.\n\nYes. So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as three integers. For example, input().split().\n\nThen, compute the sum.\n\nSo:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me test for another case. Let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct. For a 5x5 square, the perimeter is 16 cells. Yes.\n\nAnother example: if w=4, h=4, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(4+4-2) = 12. Which is correct. Because 4x4 square's perimeter is 4*4 - (4-2)*(4-2) = 16 - 4 = 12? Or maybe not. Wait, the perimeter is the outer layer. For a 4x4 square, the perimeter is 4*4 - (4-2)*(4-2) = 16-4=12. Which is correct. So the formula works.\n\nYes, so the code should be correct.\n\nNow, check the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Which matches.\n\nSample input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code this in Python. Read the input, process, etc.\n\nEdge cases: when k is 0? No, the constraints say k is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when the rectangle becomes 1x1. For example, if i is such that current_w and current_h are 1. Then perimeter is 2*(1 + 1 -2) = 0. Which is correct, since a 1x1 rectangle has no perimeter. But according to the problem statement, the input is such that k is valid. So for example, if w and h are 5, then for i=2, the current_w and current_h would be 5-4*(1) = 1. But the input constraints would have allowed k=1, but for k=2, it's invalid. So the code would not be called with such a case.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate with specified dimensions and a given number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle, and we need to sum the cells for all such rings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that gets progressively smaller. The first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle, the second ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that is 2 cells inward from the first ring, and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter of the rectangle can be calculated using the formula: `2 * (width + height - 2)`. This formula accounts for the top and bottom rows and the left and right columns, excluding the corners which are counted twice.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle, calculate its perimeter, and sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width, height, and number of rings.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, adjust the width and height by subtracting 4 times the ring index minus one (to account for the inward shift of each subsequent ring).\n- **Calculate Perimeter**: Use the formula `2 * (current_width + current_height - 2)` to compute the perimeter of the current rectangle.\n- **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the given constraints.",
