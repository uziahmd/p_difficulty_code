The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly is impossible. We need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Nikephoros uses sequence A, which repeats cyclically. Similarly for Polycarpus with B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find what move each makes, determine the winner, and count the losses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't loop through all rounds. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can compute the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, then add the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the key idea here is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of A and B. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, and the pattern of moves will repeat. So the total number of rounds can be divided into full cycles of LCM(m, k) and a remainder.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote m as the length of A, k as the length of B. The LCM of m and k is L. So each L rounds, the combination of moves from A and B will repeat. So for each of these L rounds, we can precompute how many times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Then, the total number of full cycles is total = n // L, and the remaining rounds are rem = n % L. Then, total * (losses in one cycle) plus the losses in the first rem rounds of the next cycle.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the losses for each round in the LCM period?\n\nYes. So first, compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period. Then, for each round from 0 to period-1, we can compute the moves of A and B. Then, for each such round, determine who wins, and accumulate the counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round? For round i (starting from 0?), the move of A is A[i % m], and B's move is B[i % k]. So for each i in 0..period-1, we can compute the moves.\n\nOnce we have the counts for one period, we can multiply by the number of full periods (total_cycles = n // period), and then add the counts from the remaining rounds (n % period).\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, and m and k up to 1000, the period can be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1,000,000. So for each period, we can precompute the number of losses for each player. Then, the total would be:\n\nfull_cycles = n // period\n\nremaining_rounds = n % period\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * nik_in_period + nik_in_remaining\n\nsame for polycarpus.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k.\n\n2. Precompute for each of the LCM rounds, the moves and calculate the number of losses for each player in that period.\n\n3. Multiply by the number of full cycles.\n\n4. Add the losses from the first 'remaining_rounds' rounds of the next cycle.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute the LCM. How to compute LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, it's fine. So for m and k, compute their GCD, then LCM is m*k // gcd.\n\nBut what if m or k is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, m and k are at least 1, so no problem.\n\nNow, the next part: for each round in 0 to period-1, find the moves of A and B.\n\nFor example, for round i, A's move is A[i % m], B's move is B[i % k].\n\nThen, for each pair of moves, determine who wins. For each such round, increment the counts for the loser.\n\nSo for each of the period rounds, we can compute the outcome.\n\nOnce we have that, the rest is straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible period? For m and k up to 1000, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1000*1000 = 1,000,000. So for each test case, we need to process up to 1e6 rounds. Which is acceptable, since 1e6 is manageable even for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the period rounds, the moves, and count the number of losses for each player in that period.\n\nThen, total_cycles = n // period\n\nremaining = n % period\n\ntotal_nik = total_cycles * nik_in_period + count_remaining_nik\n\nSimilarly for polycarpus.\n\nNow, how to compute the outcome for each pair of moves?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b (the moves) and returns who wins. For example:\n\nif a == b: no one loses.\n\nElse:\n\nif a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss (so Nikephoros's loss count is 0 for this round, and Polycarpus's count increases by 1).\n\nWait, no: the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if there is a winner, the loser gets a spot. So for each round, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot (so his count increases by 1). If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check if there's a winner, and if so, which one.\n\nSo the helper function:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)  # no loss for either\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss is 0, Polycarpus's is 1)\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss is 1, Polycarpus's is 0)\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nSo for each round, we can compute the (nik_loss, poly_loss) for that round.\n\nOnce we have that, for each of the period rounds, we can accumulate the total for the period.\n\nOnce we have that, multiply by total_cycles, and then compute the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, read the input. Wait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is sequence A.\n\nThird line is sequence B.\n\nWait, looking at the example input:\n\nIn the first sample input, the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo n is 7, A is \"RPS\", B is \"RSPP\".\n\nSo in code, read n as integer, then read A and B as strings.\n\nNow, compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute the LCM of m and k.\n\nNow, for the period rounds, which is LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to period-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen compute the result for this round, and accumulate the total for the period.\n\nOnce we have the total for the period, then multiply by the number of full cycles.\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds (rem = n % period), we need to process the first rem rounds of the period.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nCompute the total_nik and total_poly for the period.\n\nThen, full_cycles = n // period\n\nrem = n % period\n\nThen, compute the same for the first rem rounds, and add to the totals.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCompute the period.\n\nCompute the per_period_nik and per_period_poly.\n\nCompute full_cycles = n // period\n\nrem = n % period\n\nThen, compute the per_rem_nik and per_rem_poly by checking the first rem rounds.\n\nTotal_nik = full_cycles * per_period_nik + per_rem_nik\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nSo the problem is to compute per_period_nik, per_period_poly, and per_rem_nik, per_rem_poly.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut how to compute the per_period counts?\n\nWe can loop over i from 0 to period-1, compute a and b moves, then add the results.\n\nBut for period up to 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing the LCM.\n\nImplementing the GCD.\n\nIn Python, math.gcd exists, but note that it returns the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of the two numbers. So for m and k positive, it's okay.\n\nSo:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to handle a=0 or b=0? Well, according to the problem statement, m and k are at least 1, so no problem.\n\nSo, code steps.\n\nNow, for the example input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is length 3, B is length 4.\n\nLCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo for 12 rounds, the pattern repeats.\n\nBut n is 7, which is less than 12. So full_cycles is 0, rem is 7.\n\nSo we need to compute the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut let's check the example's explanation.\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros's move is P, which beats S (B's move). So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So Nikephoros's loss is 0, Poly's is 1.\n\nWait, but according to the example explanation, the first round is R-R, draw. Then in the second round, P vs S. Wait, how does that fit into the sequences?\n\nLet me check:\n\nA is RPS, so the sequence is R, P, S, R, P, S, R, P, S, etc.\n\nB is RSPP, so sequence is R, S, P, P, R, S, P, P, etc.\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds:\n\nRound 0 (assuming 0-based index):\n\ni=0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw.\n\ni=1: A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S → P vs S. P is beaten by S? Wait no: according to the rules, scissors beats paper. So if B's move is S (scissors), then A's move is P (paper). Scissors beats paper. So B wins. So Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros's count increases by 1. So in this round, Nikephoros's loss is 1, Poly's is 0.\n\nWait, but in the example explanation, the second round (probably round 2 in the example) is P vs S. According to the sample explanation, Nikephoros loses. Which would be the case here.\n\nBut according to the example explanation, in the first sample, Nikephoros has 3 losses and Poly has 2. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe example's note says:\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses. (Because S beats P?)\n\nWait, the problem says that the rules are: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock.\n\nSo, if Nikephoros plays P (paper) and Polycarpus plays S (scissors), then scissors beats paper. So Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo in the helper function, when a is P and b is S, the function returns (1, 0) because Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros gets a spot (his count increases by 1).\n\nSo in the sample's second round (i=1?), that's the case.\n\nSo in the example's note, the first round is R-R, then the second round is P vs S, which Nikephoros loses. Then third round is S vs P. So Nikephoros plays S, Polycarpus plays P. S beats P. So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So that's a (0, 1) for that round.\n\nSo the code's helper function is correct.\n\nSo in the code, the helper function returns (1, 0) when Nikephoros loses (i.e., when Polycarpus wins).\n\nSo, in code, the helper function is as described.\n\nNow, let's proceed to code.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string.\n\nRead B string.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute per_period_nik and per_period_poly.\n\nThen compute full_cycles = n // period.\n\nrem = n % period.\n\nCompute per_rem_nik and per_rem_poly.\n\nTotal_nik = full_cycles * per_period_nik + per_rem_nik.\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nNow, code for per_period_nik and per_period_poly:\n\nInitialize per_period_nik = 0, per_period_poly = 0.\n\nfor i in 0 to period-1:\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    res = get_result(a, b)\n\n    per_period_nik += res[0]\n\n    per_period_poly += res[1]\n\nSimilarly for the rem rounds.\n\nBut for rem rounds, we need to loop from 0 to rem-1.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Poly loses. So Nikephoros's loss is 0, Poly's is 1.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Poly wins, Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros's loss is 1, Poly's is 0.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nNow, code for the per_period and per_rem.\n\nBut for large period (up to 1e6), this is manageable.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=7\n\nA=RPS (m=3)\n\nB=RSPP (k=4)\n\nperiod is LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nCompute per_period_nik and per_period_poly.\n\nWe need to simulate 12 rounds.\n\nBut perhaps for the first 7 rounds, the code would generate the sample's result.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is 3 and 2.\n\nBut according to the code, for n=7, full_cycles is 0, rem is 7. So we need to compute the first 7 rounds.\n\nLet's simulate that.\n\nRound 0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → (0,0). So nik=0, poly=0.\n\nRound 1: A[1%3=1] = P, B[1%4=1] = S → P vs S. S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. (1, 0). So nik +=1, poly +=0.\n\nRound 2: i=2: A[2%3=2] = S, B[2%4=2] = P. S vs P. S beats P. Nikephoros wins. So (0,1). So nik +=0, poly +=1.\n\nRound 3: i=3. A[3%3=0] = R, B[3%4=3] = P. R vs P. P beats R. So Polycarpus wins. Nikephoros loses. (1,0). So nik +=1, poly +=0.\n\nRound 4: i=4. A[4%3=1] = P, B[4%4=0] = R. P vs R. P beats R. Nikephoros wins. (0,1). So poly +=1.\n\nRound 5: i=5. A[5%3=2] = S, B[5%4=1] = S. S vs S → draw. (0,0).\n\nRound 6: i=6. A[6%3=0] = R, B[6%4=2] = P. R vs P. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. (1,0).\n\nSo after 7 rounds (i=0 to 6), the counts are:\n\nnik: 1 (round 1) + 1 (round 3) + 1 (round 6) = 3?\n\nWait let's track:\n\nAfter round 0: nik=0, poly=0.\n\nRound 1: nik=1, poly=0.\n\nRound 2: nik=1, poly=1.\n\nRound 3: nik=2, poly=1.\n\nRound4: nik=2, poly=2.\n\nRound5: same.\n\nRound6: nik=3, poly=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 3 and 2. So yes, the code would return that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput is 0 0.\n\nSo for n=5, A is RRRRRRRR (length 8), B is R (length 1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nFor each round in 0..7:\n\nA's move is R, B's move is R. All draws. So per_period_nik and per_period_poly are 0. So for n=5, full_cycles = 5//8=0, rem=5. So the first 5 rounds are all draws. So output 0 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for the code, in Python, the input is read as follows. Wait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a way to represent the input. So for example, the first input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nBut in the code, the input is read from stdin. So in Python, the code should read n as int(input()), then A as input().strip(), then B as input().strip().\n\nSo code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    period = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # compute per_period counts\n\n    per_period_nik = 0\n\n    per_period_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(period):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # Nikephoros wins, so poly gets a spot\n\n            per_period_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # Poly wins, nik gets a spot\n\n            per_period_nik += 1\n\n    # Now compute full_cycles and rem\n\n    full_cycles = n // period\n\n    rem = n % period\n\n    # compute per_rem counts\n\n    rem_nik = 0\n\n    rem_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            rem_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            rem_nik += 1\n\n    total_nik = full_cycles * per_period_nik + rem_nik\n\n    total_poly = full_cycles * per_period_poly + rem_poly\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, in the code above, for the per_period counts, the code checks for a_move and b_move, and adds 1 to the appropriate variable. But the code is not using the helper function, but directly checking.\n\nBut that's equivalent.\n\nBut perhaps there is a mistake here. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, for the per_period counts, when a_move beats b_move, Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. So per_period_poly increases by 1. Else, when Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot, so per_period_nik increases by 1.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nNow, in the first sample, the per_period_nik and per_period_poly would be calculated for 12 rounds. But since the sample n is 7, which is less than 12, the full_cycles is 0, and rem is 7. So the code computes rem_nik and rem_poly for 7 rounds, which gives 3 and 2 as in the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut what about when the period is larger than n? Like the sample, which works.\n\nAnother test case: when n is equal to the period. Then rem is 0, and the code would take full_cycles = 1, rem=0, and the total is per_period counts.\n\nNow, what about when n is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code may have some optimizations. For example, precomputing the per_period counts and rem counts.\n\nBut for the given constraints, this code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThe code would compute period = LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nThen, per_period_nik and per_period_poly are computed for 12 rounds.\n\nBut for the first 7 rounds, the code computes rem_nik=3 and rem_poly=2, which is correct.\n\nBut what about the full cycles? For example, if n was 12, then full_cycles=1, rem=0, so the total is per_period_nik and per_period_poly.\n\nBut what's the per_period counts?\n\nWell, let's imagine for the first 12 rounds. But perhaps that's tedious to compute. However, the code should handle it.\n\nNow, considering that for large n, the code would process the period once, and then multiply by full_cycles.\n\nNow, the code is written, but in Python, for very large period (like 1e6), the loops for period and rem could take time. However, given that 1e6 is manageable in Python for a problem with time constraints.\n\nBut for the given constraints, m and k are up to 1000, so LCM is up to 1e6, and the code would run in O(1e6) time, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut note that in Python, math.gcd returns the GCD of the absolute values of the two numbers. Since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nSo the code should be as written above.\n\nNow, testing the second sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is length 8, B is length 1.\n\nperiod is LCM(8,1) = 8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds, A's move is R, B's move is R. All draws. So per_period_nik and per_period_poly are 0. Then for n=5, full_cycles=0, rem=5. So rem_nik and rem_poly are 0. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when A is 'R' and B is 'S'. So for each round, A plays R, B plays S. R beats S, so Nikephoros wins. So for n=1, output is 0 1. For n=2, output is 0 2.\n\nAnother case: A is 'R', B is 'P'. Then, B's move is P. P beats R, so Nikephoros loses. So for each round, Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, reading from stdin and writing to stdout.\n\nBut the code above is written as a function. So in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    period = lcm(m, k)\n\n    per_period_nik = 0\n\n    per_period_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(period):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            per_period_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            per_period_nik += 1\n\n    full_cycles = n // period\n\n    rem = n % period\n\n    rem_nik = 0\n\n    rem_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            rem_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            rem_nik += 1\n\n    total_nik = full_cycles * per_period_nik + rem_nik\n\n    total_poly = full_cycles * per_period_poly + rem_poly\n\n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, the first line reads n as int(input()), but in the code above, it's using sys.stdin.readline(). That's okay.\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is read via input(), but sometimes there are leading/trailing spaces. However, the problem says that the input is given correctly. So using sys.stdin.readline() is okay.\n\nBut in the code, for the first line, it's possible that after reading n, the next lines are read as A and B. But sometimes, after reading n with sys.stdin.readline(), there may be a newline, but the next readline() will read the next line. So it's correct.\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is provided with multiple lines, like in the sample input, where the first line is 7, then the next line is RPS, then the next line is RSPP.\n\nSo the code should read them correctly.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's test the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThe code would process:\n\nn=7, A='RPS', B='RSPP'.\n\nm=3, k=4.\n\nperiod = lcm(3,4)=12.\n\nper_period_nik and per_period_poly are calculated for 12 rounds.\n\nBut for the rem=7 rounds, the code calculates rem_nik=3, rem_poly=2. Which gives the correct output.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences of moves.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. We need to determine the number of losses for each player over `n` rounds efficiently, considering that `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The key insight is that the sequence of moves for both players will repeat after the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their move sequences. This allows us to compute the results for one full cycle and then use this to determine results for the entire number of rounds.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By calculating the results for one full cycle (determined by the LCM of the sequence lengths), we can then use this result to compute the total losses for the entire number of rounds by considering how many full cycles fit into `n` and the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_period_nik = 0\n    per_period_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(period):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            per_period_poly += 1\n        else:\n            per_period_nik += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // period\n    rem = n % period\n    \n    rem_nik = 0\n    rem_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            rem_poly += 1\n        else:\n            rem_nik += 1\n    \n    total_nik = full_cycles * per_period_nik + rem_nik\n    total_poly = full_cycles * per_period_poly + rem_poly\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values for the number of rounds, and the move sequences for both players are read.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is calculated to determine the cycle length after which both sequences repeat.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round within one cycle (determined by the LCM), the moves of both players are compared to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw). The number of losses for each player in one full cycle is recorded.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles within the given number of rounds is calculated, along with the remaining rounds. The results from these full cycles and remaining rounds are combined to get the total number of losses for each player.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large values of `n` by leveraging cycle detection and precomputation, avoiding the need to simulate each round individually.",
