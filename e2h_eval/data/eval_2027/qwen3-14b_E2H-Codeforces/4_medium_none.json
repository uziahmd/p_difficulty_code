The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, Nikephoros and Polycarpus are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each round, the loser gets a pinch (so their red spot count increases). I need to find out how many times each of them lost.\n\nThe input is n, then the sequences A and B. The sequences are strings of R, S, P. The problem is to compute the number of losses for each player after n rounds.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 2e9, which is a huge number. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need an efficient approach here.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since the sequences are cyclic, the moves for each player repeat every m and k rounds respectively. So, the combined pattern of their moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so the same moves will be repeated again.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the number of rounds in the LCM period, compute the number of losses in that period, then multiply by the number of full periods in n rounds, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nFirst, compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length. Then, for each round in 0 to period_length-1, we can determine what move each player makes, compare them, and count the losses for each.\n\nBut since m and k can be up to 1000, their LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000=1e6). Wait, but for m and k up to 1000, the LCM could be up to 1e6? Well, yes. For example, if m=1000 and k=1000, and they are co-prime, then LCM would be 1e6. But for m and k up to 1000, the LCM can't be larger than 1e6. So for each period of LCM(m, k) rounds, we can precompute the number of losses for each player. Then, the total number of full periods is n // period_length, and the remainder is n % period_length. So the total losses would be (full_periods * losses_in_period) + losses_in_remainder_rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the losses in each period?\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to period-1:\n\n   a. Find which move Nikephoros makes in this round. Since his sequence is A, which repeats every m steps. So for round i, his move is A[i % m].\n\n   Similarly for Polycarpus: B[i % k].\n\n   b. Compare the two moves and determine who loses (if any).\n\n   c. Count the number of losses for each player in this round.\n\n3. Sum all the losses in the period. Let's say total_a is the number of times Nikephoros lost in one period, total_b is the number of times Polycarpus lost in one period.\n\nThen, the total number of full periods is full = n // period. The remainder is rem = n % period.\n\nSo the total losses would be:\n\ntotal_a_full = full * total_a\n\ntotal_b_full = full * total_b\n\nThen, compute the losses in the first 'rem' rounds of the period, and add them.\n\nSo, the overall approach is manageable.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute LCM. To compute LCM(a, b), we can use the formula LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So, first compute GCD of m and k.\n\nBut how to compute GCD? Well, in Python, there's math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, that's fine. However, we need to handle cases where one of them is zero? No, the constraints state that m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n, then read A and B. Then compute m = len(A), k = len(B). Compute the LCM of m and k.\n\nOnce we have the period, we can compute the number of losses in each period. For that, we need to loop through each of the period rounds, compute the moves, compare, and count.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, and period up to 1e6, this is feasible. Because 1e6 iterations are acceptable even for Python.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\nCompute for each round in 0..period-1:\n\na_i = A[i % m]\n\nb_i = B[i % k]\n\nThen compare a_i and b_i.\n\nFor each comparison, determine who wins, and increment the counts accordingly.\n\nOnce we have the total for a full period, multiply by the number of full periods, then add the counts for the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, how to compare the moves.\n\nThe rules are:\n\n- Rock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\n- Scissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\n- Paper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nElse, if same, no loss.\n\nSo, for a pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a beats b) → then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss (so Nikephoros's loss count is not increased, but Polycarpus's count is increased by 1).\n\nWait, the problem says that the loser gets a pinch. So, for each round, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a red spot. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a red spot. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo, for each round, we need to check who wins, and increment the corresponding count.\n\nSo, for a given a and b:\n\nif a == b: no change.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a beats b):\n\n   Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nelse:\n\n   Polycarpus wins → Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo, how to code this?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b, and returns which player (if any) loses.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair, check the conditions.\n\nLet me think:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Polycarpus's is 1.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo for each round, we can calculate the (a_loss, b_loss) and accumulate them.\n\nSo, for the period, we can calculate total_a (sum of a_loss over all rounds in the period), total_b (sum of b_loss over all rounds in the period).\n\nOnce that is done, the total for n rounds is:\n\nfull_periods = n // period_length\n\nremainder = n % period_length\n\ntotal_a = full_periods * total_a_per_period + sum of a_loss for first remainder rounds in the period.\n\nSame for total_b.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n from input. Then read A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute the period_length.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to period_length - 1:\n\n   a_move = A[i % m]\n\n   b_move = B[i % k]\n\n   compute (a_loss, b_loss) for this round.\n\n   accumulate total_a_per_period and total_b_per_period.\n\nOnce that is done, compute full_periods = n // period_length\n\nremainder = n % period_length.\n\nThen, compute the total_a and total_b as:\n\ntotal_a = full_periods * total_a_per_period + sum of a_loss for first remainder rounds.\n\nSame for total_b.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for the first remainder rounds?\n\nWe can precompute for each possible i in 0 to period_length - 1, the a_loss and b_loss. Then, for the remainder, we can take the first 'remainder' elements and sum them.\n\nBut for that, perhaps during the initial loop, we can create two arrays: per_round_a and per_round_b. For each i in 0 to period_length -1, per_round_a[i] is the a_loss for that round, and similarly for per_round_b.\n\nThen, for the remainder, we can sum the first 'remainder' elements of per_round_a and per_round_b.\n\nBut for large period_length (up to 1e6), storing these arrays is acceptable.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nCompute period_length = LCM(m, k)\n\nprecompute per_round_a and per_round_b as lists of length period_length.\n\nThen, sum_total_a_per_period = sum(per_round_a)\n\nsum_total_b_per_period = sum(per_round_b)\n\nThen, for the remainder, sum_remainder_a = sum(per_round_a[0:remainder])\n\nsum_remainder_b = sum(per_round_b[0:remainder])\n\nThus, the total is:\n\ntotal_a = full_periods * sum_total_a_per_period + sum_remainder_a\n\ntotal_b = full_periods * sum_total_b_per_period + sum_remainder_b\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute LCM(m, k). Let's code that.\n\nIn Python, math.gcd is available. So, for m and k, compute their GCD, then LCM is m*k // gcd.\n\nBut need to handle m and k being zero? No, because the constraints say that m and k are >=1.\n\nSo, code for LCM:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut wait, for Python versions, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor of the absolute values. But since a and b are positive, no problem.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, and period_length up to 1e6, the code will run in O(1e6) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4).\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo the period_length is 12.\n\nFor each of 12 rounds, compute the moves and the losses.\n\nLet me simulate that.\n\nRound 0:\n\ni=0.\n\nA[0%3] = A[0] = R.\n\nB[0%4] = B[0] = R. Draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1:\n\ni=1.\n\nA[1%3] = A[1] = P.\n\nB[1%4] = B[1] = S.\n\nCompare P vs S. S beats P? Wait, S is scissors. P is paper. Scissors beats paper. So B's move is S, which beats A's P. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So (1,0).\n\nSo per_round_a[1] = 1, per_round_b[1] = 0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the function returns (a_loss, b_loss). So when A loses, a_loss is 1, and b_loss is 0.\n\nIn this case, A's move is P, B's move is S. B's move beats A's. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So a_loss is 1, b_loss is 0.\n\nSo for this round, (1,0).\n\nRound 2:\n\ni=2.\n\nA[2%3] = A[2] = S.\n\nB[2%4] = B[2] = P.\n\nS vs P. S beats P. So A wins. So B loses. So (0,1).\n\nRound 3:\n\ni=3.\n\nA[3%3=0] = R.\n\nB[3%4=3] = B[3] = P.\n\nR vs P. P beats R. So B wins. So A loses. (1,0).\n\nRound 4:\n\ni=4.\n\nA[4%3=1] = P.\n\nB[4%4=0] = R.\n\nP vs R. P beats R. A wins. So B loses. (0,1).\n\nRound 5:\n\ni=5.\n\nA[5%3=2] = S.\n\nB[5%4=1] = S.\n\nS vs S. Draw. (0,0).\n\nRound 6:\n\ni=6.\n\nA[6%3=0] = R.\n\nB[6%4=2] = P.\n\nR vs P. B wins. A loses. (1,0).\n\nRound 7:\n\ni=7.\n\nA[7%3=1] = P.\n\nB[7%4=3] = P.\n\nP vs P. Draw. (0,0).\n\nRound 8:\n\ni=8.\n\nA[8%3=2] = S.\n\nB[8%4=0] = R.\n\nS vs R. R beats S. B wins. A loses. (1,0).\n\nRound 9:\n\ni=9.\n\nA[9%3=0] = R.\n\nB[9%4=1] = S.\n\nR vs S. A wins. B loses. (0,1).\n\nRound 10:\n\ni=10.\n\nA[10%3=1] = P.\n\nB[10%4=2] = P.\n\nP vs P. Draw. (0,0).\n\nRound 11:\n\ni=11.\n\nA[11%3=2] = S.\n\nB[11%4=3] = P.\n\nS vs P. A wins. B loses. (0,1).\n\nSo now, let's collect all the per_round_a and per_round_b for the 12 rounds:\n\nLet me list for each round:\n\nRound 0: (0, 0)\n\nRound 1: (1, 0)\n\nRound 2: (0, 1)\n\nRound 3: (1, 0)\n\nRound 4: (0, 1)\n\nRound 5: (0, 0)\n\nRound 6: (1, 0)\n\nRound 7: (0, 0)\n\nRound 8: (1, 0)\n\nRound 9: (0, 1)\n\nRound 10: (0, 0)\n\nRound 11: (0, 1)\n\nNow, sum_total_a_per_period is sum of all per_round_a:\n\nLooking at per_round_a:\n\n0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 → sum is 0+1+0+1+0+0+1+0+1+0+0+0 = 4?\n\nWait:\n\nLet me count:\n\nRound 0: 0\n\nRound 1: 1 → total 1\n\nRound 2: 0 → 1\n\nRound 3: 1 → 2\n\nRound 4: 0 → 2\n\nRound 5: 0 → 2\n\nRound 6: 1 → 3\n\nRound 7: 0 → 3\n\nRound 8: 1 → 4\n\nRound 9: 0 → 4\n\nRound 10: 0 → 4\n\nRound 11: 0 → 4. So sum_total_a_per_period is 4.\n\nSimilarly sum_total_b_per_period is sum of per_round_b:\n\nper_round_b for each round:\n\n0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1 → sum is 0+0+1+0+1+0+0+0+0+1+0+1 = 4?\n\nLet me count:\n\nRound 0: 0\n\nRound 1: 0 → 0\n\nRound 2: 1 → 1\n\nRound 3: 0 → 1\n\nRound 4: 1 → 2\n\nRound 5: 0 → 2\n\nRound 6: 0 → 2\n\nRound 7: 0 → 2\n\nRound 8: 0 → 2\n\nRound 9: 1 → 3\n\nRound 10: 0 → 3\n\nRound 11: 1 → 4. Yes, sum is 4.\n\nSo for the period of 12 rounds, each player has 4 losses.\n\nBut in the sample input, n is 7. So the full_periods is 7 // 12 = 0. remainder is 7.\n\nSo the sum_remainder_a is sum of first 7 rounds' per_round_a.\n\nLooking at the first 7 rounds:\n\nper_round_a for rounds 0-6: 0,1,0,1,0,0,1 → sum is 0+1+0+1+0+0+1 = 3.\n\nSimilarly per_round_b for first 7 rounds: 0,0,1,0,1,0,0 → sum is 0+0+1+0+1+0+0=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 3 and 2. So the code would return 3 and 2.\n\nYes, which matches the first sample.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nEach round in the period of 8 rounds:\n\nFor each i from 0 to 7:\n\nA[i%8] is R, B[i%1] is R. So all rounds are draws. So per_round_a and per_round_b are 0 for all. So sum_total_a_per_period is 0, same for sum_total_b. So for n=5 rounds, the total is 0 and 0. Which matches the second sample.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string.\n\nRead B string.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute per_round_a and per_round_b for each of period_length rounds.\n\nThen compute sum_total_a and sum_total_b for the period.\n\nCompute full_periods = n // period_length.\n\nremainder = n % period_length.\n\nsum_remainder_a = sum of per_round_a[0...remainder-1]\n\nsum_remainder_b = sum of per_round_b[0...remainder-1]\n\nTotal_a = full_periods * sum_total_a + sum_remainder_a\n\nSame for total_b.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for very large period_length (like 1e6), creating two lists of size 1e6 is acceptable in Python.\n\nNow, code.\n\nImplementing the helper function for comparing a and b.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    n = int(input[0])\n\n    A = input[1]\n\n    B = input[2]\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    period_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n    # Now compute per_round_a and per_round_b for each of period_length rounds\n\n    per_round_a = []\n\n    per_round_b = []\n\n    for i in range(period_length):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        # determine the result\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            per_round_a.append(0)\n\n            per_round_b.append(0)\n\n        else:\n\n            # check who wins\n\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n                # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss (so per_round_a is 0, per_round_b is 1?)\n\n                per_round_a.append(0)\n\n                per_round_b.append(1)\n\n            else:\n\n                # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a loss (per_round_a is 1, per_round_b is 0)\n\n                per_round_a.append(1)\n\n                per_round_b.append(0)\n\n    sum_total_a = sum(per_round_a)\n\n    sum_total_b = sum(per_round_b)\n\n    full_periods = n // period_length\n\n    remainder = n % period_length\n\n    sum_remainder_a = sum(per_round_a[:remainder])\n\n    sum_remainder_b = sum(per_round_b[:remainder])\n\n    total_a = full_periods * sum_total_a + sum_remainder_a\n\n    total_b = full_periods * sum_total_b + sum_remainder_b\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, the input reading part may be problematic. Because the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut when using input = sys.stdin.read().split(), this splits on whitespace. However, the input lines may have leading/trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nBut for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo when read as split(), input becomes ['7', 'RPS', 'RSPP'].\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem statement, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'] ?\n\nWait, the original problem's example input is written as:\n\nInput\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting mistake. The actual input would be three lines: first line is 7, second line is RPS, third line is RSPP.\n\nSo in code, when using sys.stdin.read().split(), the input would be split into three elements. However, the code above uses input[0], input[1], input[2]. But if the input is read as a single line, perhaps that's not correct. Wait, no. For example, if the user enters:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen sys.stdin.read() would read all the input as a single string, including newlines. Then split() would split on any whitespace (including newlines and spaces). So the input would be split into ['7', 'RPS', 'RSPP'].\n\nBut for the code, the way to read the input is:\n\nRead the first line as n.\n\nRead the second line as A.\n\nRead the third line as B.\n\nBut when using sys.stdin.read().split(), the code may not work correctly if the input is given with multiple lines, because the split() method will split on any whitespace, including newlines. So for example, if the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen sys.stdin.read().split() would give ['7', 'RPS', 'RSPP'].\n\nBut if the input is given with multiple lines, but with leading or trailing spaces, perhaps the code would still work. So the code above is correct.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to read the lines properly. For example, using:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nB = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut sometimes, after reading the first line, the next lines may have leading or trailing whitespaces. However, the problem says that the input is correct. So the code can be written as:\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input is correct. So the code should read the first line as n, then the next line as A, then the next line as B.\n\nSo perhaps the code should read via:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut then, for cases where the input is given with multiple lines, but the code reads correctly.\n\nBut in some cases, for example, when the input is pasted with leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input is correct, so the code can assume that the second line is the string A, and third is B.\n\nSo in code, perhaps the original code is wrong, because if the input is read via sys.stdin.read().split(), then for example, if the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen the split() would give ['7', 'RPS', 'RSPP'].\n\nBut if the input is given with more than three elements, but that's not possible. So the code would be okay.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to read via the readline approach.\n\nBut in the code submission, the user needs to read from stdin. So, for example, in the sample input, the first input is 7, then the next line is RPS, then the next line is RSPP.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    period_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n    per_round_a = []\n\n    per_round_b = []\n\n    for i in range(period_length):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            per_round_a.append(0)\n\n            per_round_b.append(0)\n\n        else:\n\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n                per_round_a.append(0)\n\n                per_round_b.append(1)\n\n            else:\n\n                per_round_a.append(1)\n\n                per_round_b.append(0)\n\n    sum_total_a = sum(per_round_a)\n\n    sum_total_b = sum(per_round_b)\n\n    full_periods = n // period_length\n\n    remainder = n % period_length\n\n    sum_remainder_a = sum(per_round_a[:remainder])\n\n    sum_remainder_b = sum(per_round_b[:remainder])\n\n    total_a = full_periods * sum_total_a + sum_remainder_a\n\n    total_b = full_periods * sum_total_b + sum_remainder_b\n\n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nBut what about the case when period_length is 0? No, since m and k are >=1, so period_length is >=1.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nThe code computes period_length = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nsum_total_a is 4, sum_total_b is 4.\n\nfull_periods = 7//12=0.\n\nremainder=7.\n\nsum_remainder_a is sum of first 7 elements of per_round_a, which is 3. sum_remainder_b is 2. So output is 3 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=5, A=RRRRRRRR (len 8), B=R (len 1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nfor each i in 0..7:\n\nA[i%8] is R, B[i%1] is R. All draws. So per_round_a and per_round_b are 0. sum_total_a is 0, sum_total_b is 0. full_periods =5//8=0. remainder=5. sum_remainder_a is 0. So output 0 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=12, the same A and B as sample 1. Then full_periods is 1, remainder 0. So total_a is 4*1 + 0 =4. total_b is 4*1 +0=4.\n\nBut for 12 rounds, each player has 4 losses.\n\nAnother test case: n=1. A is R, B is S. Then, a_move is R, b_move is S. R beats S. So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a loss. So output is 0 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is S, B is R. Then S vs R. R beats S. So Nikephoros loses. Output is 1 0.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case when n is 0? According to the problem statement, n is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, for performance. For m and k up to 1000, LCM(m,k) can be up to 1e6. For each of 1e6 rounds, the code does O(1) operations. So for 1e6, it's acceptable. Then for n up to 2e9, the code is O(1e6) which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves. The solution must efficiently handle up to 2 billion rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. This means their move patterns repeat every `m` and `k` rounds respectively, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **Finding the LCM**: The combined move pattern of both players repeats every Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k` rounds. This LCM period allows us to compute the number of losses for each player within one period and then extrapolate this over the total number of rounds.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within the LCM period, determine the moves of both players and count the losses for each player.\n4. **Extrapolating Results**: Calculate the number of full periods in the total rounds and the remaining rounds. Use the precomputed losses per period to determine the total losses for the entire game.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_round_a = []\n    per_round_b = []\n    \n    for i in range(period_length):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            per_round_a.append(0)\n            per_round_b.append(0)\n        else:\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n               (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n               (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n                per_round_a.append(0)\n                per_round_b.append(1)\n            else:\n                per_round_a.append(1)\n                per_round_b.append(0)\n    \n    sum_total_a = sum(per_round_a)\n    sum_total_b = sum(per_round_b)\n    \n    full_periods = n // period_length\n    remainder = n % period_length\n    \n    sum_remainder_a = sum(per_round_a[:remainder])\n    sum_remainder_b = sum(per_round_b[:remainder])\n    \n    total_a = full_periods * sum_total_a + sum_remainder_a\n    total_b = full_periods * sum_total_b + sum_remainder_b\n    \n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two move sequences determines the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulating Period**: For each round within the LCM period, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome (losses) is recorded.\n4. **Calculating Total Losses**: By determining the number of full periods and the remaining rounds, the total losses are computed by combining results from full periods and the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging periodicity, ensuring the solution runs in linear time relative to the LCM period length, which is feasible given the constraints.",
