    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. The instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to consider each element, remove it, and compute the instability of the remaining array. But with n up to 1e5, that approach would be O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, the instability after removing an element depends on the max and min of the remaining elements. So, for each element, if I remove it, what's the new max and min?\n\nBut how can I compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. The original array's max and min are known. But when I remove an element, the new max could be the previous max if the removed element wasn't the max, or the second max if it was. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo maybe I need to precompute the max and min for all possible cases where one element is removed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the instability is max - min, perhaps the optimal choice is to remove either the maximum element or the minimum element. Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if there are multiple elements with the same value as the max or min. Or maybe in some cases, removing a middle element could help reduce the instability more.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 4, 7]. The original instability is 6. If I remove 7, the instability becomes 3 (4-1). If I remove 1, the instability is 7-3=4. If I remove 3, the instability is 4-1=3. If I remove 4, the instability is 7-1=6. So here, removing the max (7) gives the best result. But what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. The original instability is 99. If I remove 100, the instability is 3. If I remove 1, the instability is 99-2=97. So again, removing the max is better. But what if the array is [1, 1, 100, 100]. Then, removing one of the 1s would leave [1, 100, 100], instability 99. Removing one of the 100s leaves [1, 1, 100], instability 99. But if you remove a 1 and a 100, but wait, you can only remove one element. So in this case, the best is to remove either a 1 or a 100, but the instability is still 99. So maybe in this case, the instability can't be reduced. But maybe there's a scenario where removing a non-max or non-min element helps?\n\nWait, let's think of another example. Suppose the array is [1, 5, 5, 5, 7]. The original instability is 6. If I remove the 7, the instability is 5-1=4. If I remove the 1, the instability is 7-5=2. Which is better. So here, removing the min gives better result. So in this case, the optimal is to remove either the max or the min. But what about a case where removing a middle element gives a better result?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. The original instability is 8. If I remove 5, the instability is 9-1=8. Which is same as before. Not helpful. So no improvement. What if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]. Original instability is 8. If I remove 9, instability is 4-1=3. If I remove 1, instability is 9-3=6. But if I remove 3, the array becomes [1,4,5,9], instability is 8. So no. So again, removing the max or min is better.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If I remove 4, the array is [1,2,5] instability is 4. If I remove 5, instability is 3 (max is 4, min is 1). If I remove 1, instability is 5-2=3. If I remove 2, the array is [1,4,5], instability",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is determined by the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. Removing one element can potentially reduce this instability if that element was contributing significantly to the range.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal element to remove is either the minimum or the maximum element of the array. This is because removing these elements can potentially reduce the range (max - min) of the remaining elements.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: We can compute the minimum and maximum values of the array once. Then, we consider two scenarios:\n   - Removing the minimum element, which would result in a new instability based on the next smallest element.\n   - Removing the maximum element, which would result in a new instability based on the next largest element.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute the sorted array\n    sorted_a = sorted(a)\n    min_val = sorted_a[0]\n    max_val = sorted_a[-1]\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence of min and max\n    first_min = a.index(min_val)\n    last_max = len(a) - 1 - a[::-1].index(max_val)\n    \n    # Calculate instability if we remove the first min\n    # The new min is the next min in the array (if there are multiple min)\n    # So the new min is the same as min_val if there are multiple min\n    # Similarly for max\n    # However, if we remove the only min, then the new min is the second smallest\n    # So we need to check the min and max after removal\n    \n    # To handle cases where multiple min or max exist\n    # We can find the second min and second max\n    # But for efficiency, since the array is sorted, we can use the sorted array\n    \n    # If we remove the first occurrence of min_val\n    # The new min is the next min in the array\n    # Which is sorted_a[1] if there's more than one min\n    # But if all elements are the same, then removing any will give 0\n    # So we need to check the possible options\n    \n    # The minimum instability can be found by considering:\n    # 1.
