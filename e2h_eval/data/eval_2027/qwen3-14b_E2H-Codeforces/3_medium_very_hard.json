Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance d from their position. So the problem is to determine the smallest d that ensures the entire street is illuminated.\n\nFirst, I should think about how the lanterns' coverage areas overlap. The key idea here is probably to sort the lantern positions and then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. The maximum gap between two adjacent lanterns would determine the required d, because that's the area that's furthest from any lantern. But wait, there's also the ends of the street to consider. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions. This way, I can check consecutive pairs in order.\n2. Check the distance between the start of the street (0) and the first lantern. The required d must be at least half of that distance? Wait, no. Let's think: if the first lantern is at position a1, then the leftmost part of the street (from 0 to a1) needs to be covered. The lantern's coverage extends d units from a1. So the leftmost point covered by this lantern is a1 - d. To cover 0, we need a1 - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. But wait, that's not right. Because if the lantern is at a1, then the coverage extends from a1 - d to a1 + d. So to cover 0, 0 must be within [a1 -d, a1 +d]. So the maximum distance from the lantern to 0 is a1. So d must be at least a1. But wait, if the lantern is at position a1, then the distance from the lantern to 0 is a1. So the radius d must be at least a1, otherwise 0 would not be covered. Similarly, for the end of the street, the distance between the last lantern and l is l - a_last. So d must be at least that.\n\nBut then, between two consecutive lanterns, say a_i and a_{i+1}, the maximum distance between them is a_{i+1} - a_i. But since each lantern covers a radius d, the middle point between them would require that the distance from each lantern to that middle point is at most d. So the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns is (a_{i+1} - a_i). The worst case is when the gap is split between the two lanterns. For example, if the gap is G, then the maximum distance from the midpoint of the gap to either lantern is G/2. Therefore, d must be at least G/2. But wait, if the two lanterns are spaced G apart, then the maximum distance between the two lanterns' coverage areas is G. So to cover the entire gap between them, the radius d must be at least G/2. Because if you have two lanterns at positions x and y (x < y), then the point in the middle (x + (y -x)/2) is at distance (y -x)/2 from x. So the radius must be at least (y -x)/2. Otherwise, that point would not be covered. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2. Then take the maximum of all these values, as well as the initial and final distances.\n\nSo the overall approach would be:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the maximum of:\n   - the first lantern's position (since the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0], so d needs to be at least a[0])\n   - the distance from the last lantern to l (l - a[-1])\n   - for each consecutive pair, (a[i+1] - a[i])/2\n- The answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's take the example given.\n\nIn the second sample input: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. So sorted, they are [2,5]. The first lantern is at 2. So the distance from 0 to 2 is 2. So d must be at least 2. The last lantern is at 5, which is the end of the street (since l is 5). So l - a[-1] is 0. Then the gap between the two lanterns is 5-2 =3. Divided by 2, it's 1.5. So the maximum of 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output. That seems correct.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input. Let's look at the first input case:\n\nn=7, l=15. The lantern positions are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. When sorted, they become [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then:\n\nCheck the first lantern's position: 0. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 0. So no problem. The last lantern is at 15, so l - a[-1] is 0. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 =3 → 1.5\n\n5-3=2 →1.0\n\n7-5=2 →1.0\n\n9-7=2 →1.0\n\n14-9=5 →2.5\n\n15-14=1 →0.5\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5, which matches the sample. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array of a_i.\n\nCompute the initial distance (a[0] - 0) → but wait, no. Wait, the first lantern is at a[0]. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. So the required d must be at least a[0], because otherwise 0 would not be covered. Wait, no. Because the lantern at a[0] can cover from a[0] -d to a[0]+d. So for 0 to be covered, 0 must be >= a[0] -d → d >= a[0] -0 → d >= a[0]. Because if the lantern is at a[0], then the leftmost point covered is a[0] -d. So for 0 to be covered, a[0] -d <= 0 → d >= a[0]. So yes, the first part is max_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nSimilarly, for the last lantern, the distance from the end of the street (l) to the last lantern is l - a[-1]. So d must be at least that. So for example, if the last lantern is at position a[-1], then l is covered if a[-1] +d >= l → d >= l -a[-1].\n\nThen, for each consecutive pair, the gap between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]). The maximum distance between them is (gap)/2. So for each consecutive pair, compute (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 and compare with the current max.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSort the array.\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position: max_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nCheck the last lantern's position: max_d = max( max_d, l - a[-1] )\n\nThen loop through i from 0 to n-2:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif current_required > max_d, update max_d.\n\nFinally, return max_d.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. For example, if n=1, l=5, and the lantern is at 0. Then the first check is a[0] =0, so max_d is 0. Then the last check is l - a[-1] =5-0=5. So max_d is 5. Then between consecutive lanterns, there's nothing. So the answer is 5. Which is correct, because the lantern is at 0, and the street is 5 units long. The radius must be 5 to cover the end of the street.\n\nAnother example: n=1, l=10, lantern at 5. Then the first check is 5 (distance from 0 to lantern), the last check is 10-5=5. The max between them is 5. The gap between consecutive lanterns is none. So answer is 5. Which is correct, since the lantern covers from 0 to 10 (radius 5).\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, lanterns at 2 and 3. Then sorted as [2,3]. First check is 2 (distance from 0 to first lantern). Last check is 5-3=2. The gap between 2 and 3 is 1, so 0.5. So max_d is 2. Which is correct. Because the first lantern covers up to 2 +d. To cover 0, d must be at least 2. The second lantern covers from 3-d to 3+d. For the end of the street (5) to be covered, 3+d >=5 →d >=2. So the required d is 2.\n\nSo the algorithm works in that case.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n\n- Handle the edge cases of the beginning and end of the street.\n\n- Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nThen compute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n ==0? Well, according to input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_d = max( sorted_a[0], l - sorted_a[-1] )\n\nthen for i in 0 to len(sorted_a)-2:\n\ncurrent_gap = sorted_a[i+1] - sorted_a[i]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif current_required > max_d:\n\n   max_d = current_required\n\nreturn max_d.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, the first lantern is at 0, so the first part is 0. The last lantern is at 15, so l - a[-1] is 0. Then the gaps between the consecutive lanterns are as discussed, leading to 2.5.\n\nSo the code would return 2.5, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input, the sorted array is [2,5]. The first check is 2, the last check is 5-5=0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems solid.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut need to read the input. The input is given as, for example, the first example's input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo the first line is n and l. The second line is n integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i.\n\nThen sort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max( sorted_a[0], l - sorted_a[-1] )\n\nThen loop through the consecutive elements.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for the list sorted_a, for i in range(len(sorted_a) - 1):\n\n   gap = sorted_a[i+1] - sorted_a[i]\n\n   current_required = gap / 2.0\n\n   if current_required > max_d:\n\n       max_d = current_required\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nThen, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut what about cases where the lanterns are at 0 and l? For example, n=2, l=5, lanterns at 0 and 5. Then sorted_a is [0,5]. The first check is 0, the last check is 5-5=0. The gap between them is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the max is 2.5. Which is correct. Because the middle of the street is 2.5 away from each lantern. So d must be 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, lanterns at 0 and 3. Then sorted_a is [0,3]. The first check is 0, last check is 5-3=2. The gap between 0 and 3 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So max is 2. Which is correct. Because the end of the street is 5, which is 2 units away from the lantern at 3. So d must be 2.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nSo now, code:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort.\n\nThen compute the initial max_d as the maximum between the first element and (l - last element).\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute the gap and check.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# Check first and last\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the first lantern is 0, so a[0] is 0. The l - a[-1] is 15 -15 =0. So the initial max_d is 0. Then the gaps are checked. The maximum of those is 2.5. So the code returns 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the second sample input, the first lantern is 2, and l - a[-1] is 5-5=0. So initial max_d is 2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max remains 2. So code returns 2.0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[0]. Then max_d is max(0, 5-0=5) →5. Then no gaps. So output is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then max_d is max(3, 5-3=2) →3. So output is 3.0. Which is correct because the lantern at 3 must cover 0 (distance 3) and 5 (distance 2). So d must be 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[1, 5, 9]. Then sorted a is [1,5,9]. First check is 1. Last check is 10-9=1. Then the gaps between 1 and 5 is 4 → 2.0. Between 5 and 9 is 4 →2.0. So the max_d is 2.0. Which is correct. The middle of the street is covered by the middle lantern. But the first part is 1, which is covered by the first lantern. The end is 1, covered by the last lantern. The gaps between lanterns are 4, so 2.0. So the answer is 2.0.\n\nBut wait, what about the point 0? The first lantern is at 1. So the distance from 0 to the lantern is 1. So d must be at least 1. Which is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the lanterns are not in order? For example, the input is 2 5, and the lanterns are at 5 and 0. Then after sorting, they are [0,5]. Which is handled correctly.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple lanterns at the same position? For example, n=3, l=10, a=[2,2,2]. Then sorted a is [2,2,2]. The first check is 2, the last check is 10-2=8. So max_d is 8. Then between consecutive lanterns, the gaps are zero, so no change. So the answer is 8. Which is correct, because the lanterns are all at 2. The end of the street is 10, which is 8 units away from the lanterns. So d must be 8.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then the first check is 0, last check is 0. The gap between them is 10, so 5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to print the answer with 10 decimal digits, even if it's an integer. For example, in the second sample input, the output is 2.0000000000.\n\nIn Python, formatting with .10f will do that.\n\nBut what about when the maximum is something like 2.5, which is exactly representable as a float? Well, Python's floating point numbers can handle that, but when printing, we need to make sure that it's printed with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in code, the variables are stored as floats, so when we print, using the format string with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d is max(0, 15-15=0) →0.\n\nThen for each consecutive pair:\n\n3-0=3 →1.5 →max is 1.5.\n\n5-3=2 →1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 →1.0 → no change.\n\n9-7=2 →1.0 → no change.\n\n14-9=5 →2.5 → new max.\n\n15-14=1 →0.5 → no change.\n\nSo the final max_d is 2.5, which is printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) →2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3 →1.5. So max remains 2. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple lines. For example, in the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nBut the code reads two lines. So for each test case, the code reads two lines. However, the problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l...\n\nThe next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But looking at the sample input, the user provided two test cases. But in reality, the problem says that the input is a single test case. Wait, the sample input shows two examples, but in the actual programming competition problem, each test case is processed separately. However, the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the user's code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual code should process one test case.\n\nWait, the original problem's input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. The sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's just for the example. So the code should read one test case. However, the sample input given in the problem is written as two lines, but perhaps the user's code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then the next line. So the code should process one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input given by the user, the first input is ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5'], which seems to be two test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake. But the actual problem says that the code should read one test case. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, then the next line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code written earlier is correct for that.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n\nBut in the code, the first line is read as n and l. Then the next line is read as the list of a_i.\n\nBut in Python, when reading from stdin, if there are multiple test cases, the code would need to process them. However, according to the problem statement, the code should process one test case. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what if n is 0? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d is max(0, 15-15=0) →0.\n\nThen for the gaps:\n\n3-0 =3 →1.5 →max is 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 →1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 →1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 →1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 →2.5 → max is 2.5.\n\nThen 15-14=1 →0.5 → no change.\n\nSo output is 2.5 → printed with 10 decimals.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) →2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3 →1.5. So max remains 2. Output 2.0.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[0]. Then the code returns max(0, 10-0=10) →10.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the max is max(5, 10-5=5) →5.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the first check is 0, last check is 0. The gaps between 0 and 5 is 5 →2.5. Between 5 and 10 is 5 →2.5. So max is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given their positions. The key is to ensure that every point on the street is within the coverage radius of at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: By sorting the positions of the lanterns, we can easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Edge Cases**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are critical as they determine the minimum radius needed to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap divided by 2 gives the minimum radius required to ensure coverage between these two lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = 0.0\n    # Check the first and last positions\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The initial radius is determined by the maximum of the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The radius required to cover this gap is half the size of the gap. The maximum of these values is tracked to ensure all parts of the street are covered.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, O(n log n), where n is the number of lanterns. This is efficient given the constraints of the problem.",
