Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the minimum radius d that the lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment around it with radius d. We need to find the minimal d such that all points on the street are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the radius needs to cover that gap. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have two adjacent lanterns at positions a and b. The distance between them is (b - a). The worst case for coverage is the middle of this gap. Because each lantern can cover up to d distance. So for the middle point of the gap, the distance from each lantern is (b - a)/2. So the required d for this gap would be (b - a)/2. But wait, that's only if the gap is between two lanterns. However, there's also the edge cases where the first lantern isn't at 0, or the last isn't at l.\n\nSo, for example, the first lantern might be at position a1. Then the area from 0 to a1 needs to be covered. The radius must be at least a1 - 0. Similarly, if the last lantern is at position an, then the area from an to l must be covered. So the radius must be at least l - an.\n\nSo the overall approach would be:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in order.\n2. Check the initial gap between 0 and the first lantern.\n3. Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n4. Check the gap between the last lantern and l.\n5. For each of these gaps, compute the required d (which is half of the gap, except for the first and last gaps which are the full distance from 0 to first lantern, and from last lantern to l).\n6. The maximum of all these values is the minimal required d.\n\nWait, let me think again. For the first gap, between 0 and the first lantern. The maximum distance from the first lantern to 0 is a1 - 0. So the radius must be at least a1, because the lantern's coverage must reach 0. Similarly for the end: the last lantern is at an. The distance from an to l is l - an. So the radius must be at least that. \n\nBut for the gaps between two lanterns, say between a_i and a_{i+1}, the maximum distance that needs to be covered is (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2. Because the middle of the gap is (a_{i} + a_{i+1}) / 2. The distance from this point to either lantern is (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2. So the radius needs to be at least that value. \n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum between all these values: the first gap (a1), the last gap (l - an), and all the middle gaps' half distances.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as the maximum between (a[0] - 0) and (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute (a[i+1] - a[i])/2, and compare to max_d. Take the maximum.\n\nThe final max_d is the answer.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the first gap is a[0], the last gap is l - a[0]. The maximum of these two. Which makes sense.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Read n and l.\n\n- Read the list of a_i.\n\n- Sort them.\n\n- Initialize max_d as 0.\n\n- Check the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. So the required d for that is a[0]. Because the lantern's coverage must reach 0. Similarly for the last lantern.\n\n- Then for each consecutive pair, compute (a[i+1] - a[i])/2.0, and compare to max_d.\n\n- The maximum of all these is the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the first gap is zero, so no problem. Similarly for the last lantern being at l.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through the sorted array, for i from 0 to n-2:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif current_required > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nAt the end, return max_d.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2 is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo sorted a is [2,5].\n\nFirst check a[0] is 2, which is the distance from 0. So required d is 2. Then l - a[-1] is 5-5=0. So initial max_d is 2.\n\nThen check the gap between 2 and 5: 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. Which is less than 2. So the max remains 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the first one:\n\nInput is 7 15, with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nCheck first lantern is 0, so the initial distance is 0. The last lantern is 15, so l - a[-1] is 0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. Which is the sample output. So yes, correct.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nBut wait, the input for the first sample is given as '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which when split gives the list [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. So after sorting, it becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nBut need to make sure that the list is sorted. Then compute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nBut wait, if n is 0? No, the constraints say n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i. Then sort.\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n == 0: impossible, but n >=1.\n\nSo:\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nthen for i in 0 to n-2:\n\ngap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent = gap / 2.0\n\nif current > max_d:\n\n   max_d = current\n\nThen print max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if the street is already fully covered by the lanterns? For example, if the lanterns are placed at 0 and l, and the gap between them is l. Then the required d is max(0, l - l, (l)/2) → l/2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=5, a=[0]. Then the required d is max(0, 5-0) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=5, a=[5]. Then the required d is max(5, 0) →5.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=5, a=[2]. Then the required d is max(2, 5-2=3) →3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input. But note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input examples show that there are two test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, looking at the input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. For example, in the sample input given, it's:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich seems like two separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is read from standard input. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as follows. The first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers. So the code should process one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for two separate runs. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code should process one test case. But in the sample input given, the user has provided two test cases. But perhaps the actual code is supposed to read one test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. So perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual code should process one test case.\n\nWait, the original problem's input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of ai.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. For example, in the first sample input, the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. Because the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. So perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. So the code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as two separate inputs, but the output is two outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the ai. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai. So the code should read two lines per test case. But how many test cases are there?\n\nThe problem says that the code should read input from standard input. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases until EOF. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. However, the problem's input description doesn't mention that. So perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the sample input, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given, the first line is for the first test case, and then the second line is for the second test case. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention that. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input and output examples, the sample input is given as two separate test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l, and the next line contains the ai. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original statement may have been in Russian, and perhaps the sample input is given as two test cases. But the actual code should process a single test case. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking at the problem's original statement:\n\nIn the problem statement's input description, the first line contains n and l. Then the next line contains n integers. So the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's just for demonstration. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut the user's code needs to read from stdin, and output to stdout. So for example, the sample input for the first case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nand the output is 2.5000000000.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the user has written two test cases. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention that. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the sample input, and the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut how can we know?\n\nLooking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as two lines, but the output is two lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. For example, in the first sample input, the first line is the first test case, then the second line is the second test case. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the code should process one test case. But that would not make sense. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written with two test cases, but the actual code should read one test case. But that's unclear.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original input and output, the first line of input is n and l, then the next line is the list of ai. So for each test case, the code reads two lines. So the code should process multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, in Python, reading from stdin, the code can read all lines, split them into pairs of lines, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user's sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the problem's original input description says that the first line is n and l, then the next line is the list of ai. So the code should read two lines for each test case.\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description does not mention this. However, the problem's sample input and output shows that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a critical point. If the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, then the code should read all lines until EOF. But if it's only one test case, then read two lines.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original statement, the sample input is given as two test cases, but the output is two lines. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in the sample input, the first line is \"7 15\", then the next line is the list of numbers, then another line \"2 5\" and then the next line \"2 5\".\n\nSo the code must read pairs of lines. So for each test case, read two lines: first line is n and l, then next line is the list of ai.\n\nTherefore, the code must read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs. For example, read all lines, then process them two at a time.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, and the code must process them all. However, the problem's input description may not mention that. However, looking at the sample input and output, it's clear that there are multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the ai. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written with two test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case. However, that would not match the sample input. So perhaps the problem is that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to confirm?\n\nLooking at the problem's original sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSample Output:\n\n2.5000000000\n\n2.0000000000\n\nSo there are two test cases. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nSo the code must read until EOF, processing pairs of lines.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? Well, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs. For example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n    n, l = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    # process this test case\n\n    i += 2\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is lines[0] and lines[1], the second is lines[2] and lines[3].\n\nSo this approach would work.\n\nBut the problem's original input description may not mention that there are multiple test cases. However, the sample input shows that. Therefore, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut why in the problem statement's input description, the first line is n and l? Because that's for each test case.\n\nSo the code needs to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original statement says that the input is given as per the first line. So perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the sample input, and the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to know? Well, the problem's sample input shows two test cases. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nSo, the code will read all lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nNow, for each test case:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute max_d as the maximum between a[0], l - a[-1], and the maximum (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nThen, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut need to handle possible floating points.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and l\n\n        n, l = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        a.sort()\n\n        max_d = 0.0\n\n        # first check\n\n        first = a[0]\n\n        last = a[-1]\n\n        max_d = max(first, l - last)\n\n        # check consecutive pairs\n\n        for i in range(n-1):\n\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n            current = gap / 2.0\n\n            if current > max_d:\n\n                max_d = current\n\n        # print with 10 decimals\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, the first test case's a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The first is 0, so the initial max_d is max(0, 15-15=0) →0. Then the consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0=3 →1.5, which is larger than 0. So max_d becomes 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 →1.0, no change. Then 7-5=2 →1.0. Then 9-7=2 →1.0. Then 14-9=5 →2.5. Which is larger than 1.5. So max_d becomes 2.5. Then 15-14=1 →0.5. So the final max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input: second test case is n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. After sorting, [2,5]. first is 2, l - last is 5-5=0. So initial max_d is 2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. Which is less than 2. So the answer is 2.0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the first is 5, l - last is 5. So max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then first is 0, l - last is 0. Then the gap between 0 and 10 is 10. Divided by 2 is 5. So max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 5]. Then first is 0, l - last is 5. So initial max_d is 5. Then the gap between 0 and 5 is 5. Divided by 2 is 2.5. So max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then initial max_d is max(0, 0) →0. Then gaps between 0 and 5: 2.5, between 5 and 10: 2.5. So max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, what about when the lanterns are not sorted? For example, in the first sample input, the initial list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, it's [0,3,5,7,9,14,15], which is correct.\n\nSo the code sorts the list.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle very large l, but since we are dealing with floating points, it's okay.\n\nNow, the code uses the format string with 10 decimal digits. For example, in the first sample, 2.5 is printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut the code needs to be written as a script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout. Also, the code must not have any extra output.\n\nSo the code should be as follows:\n\nRead all lines, process each pair as test case.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and l\n\n        if idx +1 >= len(lines):\n\n            break  # invalid input?\n\n        n, l = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a.sort()\n\n        max_d = 0.0\n\n        # first check\n\n        first = a[0]\n\n        last = a[-1]\n\n        max_d = max(first, l - last)\n\n        # check consecutive pairs\n\n        for i in range(n-1):\n\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n            current = gap / 2.0\n\n            if current > max_d:\n\n                max_d = current\n\n        # print with 10 decimals\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, what if the input has an odd number of lines? Like, if there's a line for n and l but no next line for the a_i? But according to the problem statement, the input is correct. So the code can assume that for each test case, there are two lines.\n\nBut during programming contests, sometimes the code needs to handle such cases, but perhaps the problem ensures that the input is valid.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nFor the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=7, l=15, a=[15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nmax_d starts as max(0, 15-15=0) →0.\n\nThen check gaps:\n\n3-0=3 →1.5 →max_d=1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 →1.0 →no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 →1.0 →no change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 →1.0 →no change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 →2.5 →max_d=2.5.\n\nThen 15-14=1 →0.5 →no change.\n\nSo output 2.5 →printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. sorted [2,5]. max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) →2. Then gap between 2 and 5 is 3 →1.5. So max_d remains 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Output is max(5, 10-5=5) →5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. max_d is max(0, 0) →0. Then gaps between 0 and 5 →2.5, between 5 and 10 →2.5. So max_d is 2.5.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nNow, code must be written with proper formatting. Also, the code must not have any print statements other than the required output.\n\nSo the code is as above.\n\nBut the code needs to be written as a Python script, which reads from stdin and outputs to stdout. Also, the code must not include any extra print statements.\n\nSo the code is enclosed in the main function, and called.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # process each test case\n\n        # read n and l\n\n        if idx +1 >= len(lines):\n\n            break\n\n        n, l = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a.sort()\n\n        max_d = 0.0\n\n        first = a[0]\n\n        last = a[-1]\n\n        max_d = max(first, l - last)\n\n        for i in range(n-1):\n\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n            current = gap / 2.0\n\n            if current > max_d:\n\n                max_d = current\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut need to make sure that the code handles the case when n is 1.\n\nYes, for n=1, the for loop runs for range(0) → no iterations.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the code.\n\nNow, the code uses the format string with .10f, which ensures that the output has 10 decimal digits. For example, in the first sample, 2.5 becomes 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given their positions. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the edges of the street to find the maximum gap that needs to be covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read multiple test cases from standard input.\n2. **Sorting Lantern Positions**: For each test case, sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate gap analysis.\n3. **Edge Gaps Calculation**: Calculate the initial gaps from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`).\n4. **Consecutive Gaps Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the midpoint gap which determines the required radius to cover the area between them.\n5. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius is the maximum value among all calculated gaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        if idx + 1 >= len(lines):\n            break\n        n, l = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        a.sort()\n        max_d = 0.0\n        first = a[0]\n        last = a[-1]\n        max_d = max(first, l - last)\n        for i in range(n - 1):\n            gap = a[i + 1] - a[i]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing each test case.\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to sequentially check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Edge Cases Handling**: The initial gaps from the start and end of the street are checked separately as they might require larger radii than the gaps between lanterns.\n- **Gap Analysis**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the midpoint gap is calculated. This is because the furthest point from either lantern in the gap is halfway between them, requiring the largest radius for coverage.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required for full illumination by considering all critical gaps in the street's layout.",
