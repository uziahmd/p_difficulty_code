Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to select souvenirs with maximum total cost without exceeding a weight limit. The constraints are that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Each souvenir has a weight of 1, 2, or 3. Oh right, the weights are limited to 1, 2, 3. That's probably a key point here.\n\nSo the usual knapsack problem, but with the twist that the weights are small. Since the standard knapsack approach (DP) would be O(nm), which for n=1e5 and m=3e5 would be way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are only 1, 2, 3, maybe we can group the items by their weight. For each weight category, we can sort them in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight group, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, we can try different combinations of how many items from each group to take, considering the total weight.\n\nBut how to combine them optimally?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have:\n\n- For weight 1: sorted list, and prefix sums.\n- For weight 2: same.\n- For weight 3: same.\n\nThen, the problem becomes choosing how many items from each group to take, such that total weight is <= m, and total cost is maximized.\n\nBut since the weight is small, maybe we can iterate over the number of weight 3 items, then for each possible number, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nWait, but even that might be expensive. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, group all items by their weight. For each group, sort in descending order of cost, then compute prefix sums.\n\nFor example, for weight 1, we have a list of items sorted by cost. The prefix sum array will tell us the maximum cost if we take k items from this group.\n\nSame for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem becomes selecting x items from weight 1, y from weight 2, z from weight 3, such that x*1 + y*2 + z*3 ≤ m, and the sum of the prefix sums is maximized.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nHmm. Let's think of it as follows: for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), we can compute the remaining weight capacity, and then find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut since the maximum possible z is min( (m//3), len(weight3)), which could be up to 1e5, but perhaps even more. Wait, m can be 3e5, so z can be up to 1e5 (if each item is weight 3). But for each z, how do we compute the optimal x and y?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible number of weight 3 items, we can take as many as possible, then for the remaining weight, decide between taking weight 1 or 2 items.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items. Let's think: once we have the remaining capacity after choosing z items of weight 3, say rem = m - 3*z, then we can use the weight 1 and 2 items to fill up to rem.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x and y such that x + 2y ≤ rem. How to maximize the sum of prefix1[x] + prefix2[y].\n\nThis seems like another knapsack problem, but with two variables. However, since rem can be up to m (3e5), but for each rem, perhaps we can compute the optimal x and y.\n\nWait, but for each possible rem, what's the best way to combine weight 1 and 2 items? Let's think. Suppose we have a certain amount of capacity left. Let's say the capacity is s.\n\nWe can take some number of weight 1 items (say a) and some number of weight 2 items (say b), such that a + 2b ≤ s. How to maximize the sum of the first a items of weight 1 and first b items of weight 2?\n\nBut how to compute that quickly for any s.\n\nAn idea: for each possible capacity s, we can iterate through all possible numbers of weight 2 items (b), and compute the maximum a as s - 2b, then take the max of prefix1[a] + prefix2[b]. However, this would take O(s) time for each s, which could be expensive.\n\nBut given that for each possible z (number of weight 3 items), the rem could be up to m, and z can be up to m/3, this approach may not be feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible total capacity s, the maximum value possible. How?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have sorted lists for weight 1 and 2.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- For weight 1, we have a prefix sum array A, where A[k] is the sum of the first k items (sorted in descending order of cost).\n\n- For weight 2, prefix sum array B, where B[k] is sum of first k items.\n\nNow, for a given s, we can consider all possible numbers of weight 2 items (let's say up to min(k2, s//2)), and for each possible b, the maximum number of weight 1 items is a = s - 2*b. But since a can't exceed the number of weight 1 items available (k1), we take min(s - 2*b, k1). Then, the total value is B[b] + A[min(s - 2*b, k1)].\n\nBut for each s, trying all possible b is O(s) time. However, if s can be up to 3e5, and z can be up to 1e5, then this would be O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not going to work. We need a better way.\n\nAnother approach: for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can find the optimal combination for any s by considering that for each possible number of weight 2 items, we can compute the best possible number of weight 1 items.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute for all possible s, the best combination.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, note that for each possible s, the optimal choice between weight 1 and 2 items can be found by considering that for each possible number of weight 2 items, the maximum number of weight 1 items is s - 2*b. But since the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, taking as many as possible of the highest value items is optimal.\n\nBut how can we find the best b for a given s?\n\nLet me think: For a given s, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible b (from 0 to min(len(B), s//2)) of B[b] + A[min(s - 2*b, len(A))].\n\nBut how can we compute this quickly?\n\nLet me think about the possible values of b. For a fixed s, the possible b ranges from 0 to floor(s / 2). For each b, we can calculate the corresponding a = s - 2*b, but a can't exceed the total number of weight 1 items. So for each b, the maximum a is min(a_candidate, len(A)).\n\nBut for each s, this seems like O(k) operations, where k is the number of weight 2 items. However, if we can precompute for all possible s, perhaps there's a way to find the optimal b quickly.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible s, the best combination by considering that for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, the best possible weight 1 items is the maximum possible.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible number of weight 2 items (let's say up to the maximum possible), we can precompute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be added given a certain total capacity. But how?\n\nWait, here's a thought. Let's say that for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible total weight, the maximum value. But how?\n\nBut the problem is that the total weight can be up to m (3e5). So for each possible total weight up to m, we can compute the maximum value using weight 1 and 2 items. But how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can do this with a dynamic programming approach. But for the case where the items are sorted, there might be a way to compute this in O(m) time.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach. Let's imagine that we have all the weight 1 and 2 items sorted. For each weight 1 item, we can take as many as possible. Similarly for weight 2. But how to combine them optimally.\n\nLet me think about the following: For each possible capacity s, the optimal value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible, then filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nOR\n\n- Taking one less weight 2 item, and filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible capacity s, we can compute the maximum value by considering that for the weight 2 items, we can take up to b = min(len(B), s//2) items. But for each possible b, the remaining capacity is s - 2*b, and we can take as many weight 1 items as possible. However, since the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, taking the first min(remaining, len(A)) items gives the maximum value.\n\nBut for each s, we can compute the best b in O(1) time if we can find the optimal b for that s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, the value of taking a certain number of them is non-decreasing. Similarly for weight 2 items. So for each possible s, the optimal b is such that 2*b is as large as possible without exceeding s, but also considering that the sum of B[b] + A[s-2b] is maximized.\n\nBut how to find this optimal b?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose s is 5. Then possible b values are 0, 1, 2. For each:\n\n- b=0: a=5 → take 5 weight 1 items (if available)\n- b=1: a=5-2=3 → take 3 weight 1 items\n- b=2: a=5-4=1 → take 1 weight 1 item\n\nSo for each possible b, we can calculate the total value. But how to find the best b quickly.\n\nIf we can precompute for all possible s, the best b, but how?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted, B is non-decreasing. Similarly, A is non-decreasing. So for a given s, the function f(b) = B[b] + A[s - 2*b] may have some properties that allow us to find the maximum quickly.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of how this function behaves as b increases. As b increases, B[b] increases, but s - 2*b decreases, so A[s - 2*b] may decrease. So the function could have a maximum at some point. So for each s, we can perform a binary search on b to find the optimal value.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each s, we can iterate through possible b values in the range [max(0, (s - len_A)/2), min(len_B, s//2)], where len_A is the number of weight 1 items. Because if we take more than (s - len_A)/2 weight 2 items, then s - 2*b would be less than len_A, so we can take all weight 1 items. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible number of weight 2 items is min(len_B, s//2), and the minimum is 0, perhaps for each s, we can try all possible b in this range. However, for large s, this is O(s) time again.\n\nBut given that the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps there's a way to compute for each s the best combination in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible number of weight 2 items, we can compute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be added. For example, for a given s, the optimal number of weight 2 items is the one that balances between the value of adding a weight 2 item and the loss of weight 1 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since weight 1 items are cheaper per unit weight (if they are sorted), perhaps the optimal approach is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, but sometimes replacing a weight 2 item with two weight 1 items if the sum of two weight 1 items is higher than one weight 2 item.\n\nWait, but that's similar to the greedy approach. However, the greedy approach doesn't always work for the 0-1 knapsack problem. However, since the items are sorted in descending order of value, perhaps there's a way to greedily choose between taking a weight 2 item or two weight 1 items.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think of this as a separate problem. Suppose we have to choose between weight 1 and 2 items, and we want to maximize the value given a capacity s.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can take all the weight 1 items and weight 2 items, but for each possible s, we can find the best combination.\n\nLet me consider the following: for each possible number of weight 2 items taken (b), the maximum possible is min(b_max, s//2), where b_max is the number of weight 2 items available. For each such b, the remaining capacity is s - 2*b. Then, the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is min( (s - 2*b), len_A ), and the value is B[b] + A[ min( (s - 2*b), len_A ) ].\n\nThe question is, how to find the maximum of this expression over all possible b in 0 ≤ b ≤ b_max.\n\nBut for each s, this is O(b_max) time. If we can find a way to compute this for all possible s efficiently, that would be helpful.\n\nBut given that the weight 3 items are handled separately, perhaps we can find a way to compute for each possible s (the remaining capacity after handling weight 3 items) the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, and for each possible z (number of weight 3 items) up to m//3, perhaps the overall approach would be feasible.\n\nLet me think of the steps again:\n\n1. Group all items into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\n2. Sort each list in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each list.\n\n   For example, prefix1[i] = sum of first i items in w1.\n\n   Similarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n\n4. Now, for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), from 0 to min( len(w3), m//3 ), compute:\n\n   a. The total weight used by z items is 3*z.\n\n   b. The remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*z.\n\n   c. For this rem, compute the maximum value from combining weight 1 and 2 items.\n\n   d. The total value is prefix3[z] + value from step c.\n\n   e. Keep track of the maximum total value over all z.\n\nBut the problem is step c. How to compute that quickly.\n\nSo the key is to find an efficient way to compute step c for all possible rem values.\n\nNow, considering that for each possible rem (which can be up to m), we need to find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: For each possible rem, the maximum value is the maximum of all possible combinations of x and y such that x + 2y ≤ rem, where x is the number of weight 1 items taken, and y is the number of weight 2 items taken.\n\nBut since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, for any given rem, the optimal choice would be to take as many of the higher-value items as possible.\n\nBut how to find that quickly.\n\nAlternative idea: Precompute for all possible possible total capacity s (up to m) the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items. Let's call this dp[s].\n\nBut how to compute dp[s]?\n\nThis seems like a classic unbounded knapsack problem, but since each item can be taken at most once (because each item is unique), it's the 0-1 knapsack problem. However, the items are grouped into weight 1 and 2. But given the size of m (3e5), and the fact that n is up to 1e5, the standard DP approach would be O(m * n), which is not feasible.\n\nBut since the items are grouped by their weight, perhaps there's a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nLet me think. For the weight 1 items, since they are sorted in descending order, the best way to take them is to take the first k items for some k. Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\nSo for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, the problem reduces to finding for each possible capacity s, the maximum sum of some number of weight 1 items and some number of weight 2 items, such that their total weight is ≤ s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of this as follows: for each possible number of weight 2 items y, we can take up to y items, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (x = min( s - 2*y, len(w1) )).\n\nThen, for each s, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y of (prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( s - 2*y, len(w1) ) ] )\n\nSo, for each s, we can iterate y from 0 to min( len(w2), s//2 ), and compute the value for each y. But this is O(s) per s, which is not feasible.\n\nBut what if we can find for each s, the optimal y quickly?\n\nLet me think of the following: for each possible s, the optimal y is around (s - x)/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the prefix arrays are non-decreasing, for a given s, the function f(y) = prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( s - 2*y, len1 ) ] is first increasing and then decreasing, or vice versa. So perhaps we can find the maximum using ternary search.\n\nBut how to verify that the function is unimodal.\n\nFor example, suppose y increases. At first, adding more weight 2 items increases the value, but after a certain point, the reduction in the number of weight 1 items taken may cause the total value to decrease. So the function may have a single peak, making it unimodal. If that's the case, then ternary search can be used to find the maximum.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's take an example:\n\nSuppose prefix2 is [0, 5, 9, 12], and prefix1 is [0, 3, 7, 10, 12]. For s=5.\n\nFor y=0: x=5 → prefix1[5] (but len1 is 4, so 12) → total 0+12=12.\n\ny=1: 2*1=2 → x=3 → prefix1[3]=7 → total 5+7=12.\n\ny=2: 2*2=4 → x=1 → prefix1[1]=3 → total 9+3=12.\n\nSo in this case, the function is flat. But if the values are different, perhaps there's a peak.\n\nAnother example: suppose s=6, prefix2 is [0, 5, 8], prefix1 is [0, 3, 6, 8].\n\ny=0: x=6 → take 3 items (since len1 is 3?), value 8 → total 0+8=8.\n\ny=1: 2*1=2 → x=4 → but len1 is 3, so 8 → total 5+8=13.\n\ny=2: 2*2=4 → x=2 → value 6 → total 8+6=14.\n\nSo here, the function increases with y. So the maximum is at y=2.\n\nAnother example: s=5, prefix2 is [0, 5, 10], prefix1 is [0, 3, 6, 7].\n\ny=0: x=5 → take 3 items (sum 7) → total 7.\n\ny=1: 2 → x=3 → sum 7 → total 5+7=12.\n\ny=2: 4 → x=1 → sum 3 → total 10+3=13.\n\nSo here, the function increases with y. So maximum is at y=2.\n\nAnother example where the function first increases then decreases. Let's imagine:\n\nprefix2: [0, 5, 9, 10]\n\nprefix1: [0, 3, 6, 7, 8]\n\ns=7.\n\nFor y=0: x=7 → take 4 items (sum 8) → total 8.\n\ny=1: 2*1=2 → x=5 → take 4 items (sum 8) → total 5+8=13.\n\ny=2: 4 → x=3 → sum 7 → total 9+7=16.\n\ny=3: 6 → x=1 → sum 3 → total 10+3=13.\n\nSo here, the function increases up to y=2, then decreases. Hence, it is unimodal. Thus, ternary search can be applied.\n\nIf the function is unimodal, then for each s, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, min( len(w2), s//2 ) ] to find the maximum value.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo for each s, we can perform a ternary search on the possible y values, and for each y, compute the value. The ternary search would take O(log n) steps, and each step is O(1).\n\nSo for each s, this would be O(log n) time. Then, for the entire problem, considering that we have to process up to m//3 possibilities for z, and for each z, compute s = m - 3*z, and then perform a ternary search on y for that s.\n\nBut what is the total time complexity?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor grouping and sorting: O(n log n) time.\n\nFor the prefix sums: O(n) time.\n\nThen, for the main part:\n\nThe number of possible z is up to min( len(w3), m//3 ). Let's assume m is up to 3e5, so this is up to 1e5.\n\nFor each such z, we compute s = m - 3*z. Then, for this s, perform a ternary search on y. Each ternary search takes O(log k) steps, where k is the number of weight 2 items. For each step, we need to compute the value for a given y.\n\nSo for each z, O(log k) steps. Let's say k is up to 1e5. So log k is around 20. So total steps would be O(1e5 * 20) = 2e6, which is acceptable.\n\nSo this seems feasible.\n\nBut how to handle the cases where s is negative. Well, when z exceeds m//3, then 3*z > m, so rem would be negative. So we should ignore those z.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Preprocess the weight groups, sort them, compute prefix sums.\n\n- Iterate over possible z from 0 to min( len(w3), m//3 ), inclusive.\n\n   For each z:\n\n   - Compute rem = m - 3*z.\n\n   - If rem < 0, skip.\n\n   - Compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items for capacity rem.\n\n   - Add that value to prefix3[z], and keep track of the maximum.\n\nSo the problem now is to implement the function that, given a capacity s, returns the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nImplementing that function with ternary search.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, group the items by weight. For example, for each wi in the input, add to w1, w2, or w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each list. For example, prefix1[0] = 0, prefix1[1] = cost of first item, etc.\n\nNow, for the function that computes the maximum value for a given s:\n\ndef get_max_value(s):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = min( len(w2), s // 2 )\n\n    best = 0\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        # compute value for y = mid\n\n        current_weight = 2 * mid\n\n        remaining = s - current_weight\n\n        a = min(remaining, len(w1))\n\n        val = prefix2[mid] + prefix1[a]\n\n        # compare with other possibilities\n\n        # but how to know whether to go left or right?\n\n        # since we are doing ternary search, perhaps we need to compare mid and mid+1?\n\n        # Alternatively, since the function is unimodal, we can check mid and mid+1 and move accordingly.\n\n        # But perhaps it's easier to use a loop that iterates until low <= high, and for each step, check mid and mid+1.\n\n        # However, implementing ternary search correctly can be tricky.\n\n        # Alternatively, since the possible y is up to 1e5, for each s, we can iterate y in the range [max(0, (s - len1) // 2), ... ] ?\n\n        # Maybe for the purposes of time, it's better to use a binary search approach.\n\n        # Alternatively, since the number of possible y is small, perhaps for each s, we can iterate y in the range [max(0, (s - len1) // 2), min(len(w2), s//2)] ?\n\n        # Wait, but for len1 being the number of weight 1 items, the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is len1. So for a given y, the remaining capacity is s - 2*y. So the maximum x is min( s - 2*y, len1 ). So the value is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( s - 2*y, len1 ) ].\n\n        # For each s, the optimal y is somewhere in the range 0 to min( len(w2), s//2 )\n\n        # So, for the ternary search approach, perhaps we can try to find the maximum in this range.\n\n        # But I'm not sure about the exact implementation. Maybe it's easier to precompute for all possible s, but that's not feasible.\n\n        # Alternatively, for each s, we can iterate y from 0 to min( len(w2), s//2 ), but that would be O(k) per s, which could be expensive.\n\n        # However, considering that for each z, the rem can be up to m, which is 3e5, and for each rem, the number of possible y is up to min( len(w2), rem//2 ), which could be up to 1.5e5. So for 1e5 z's, this would be 1.5e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\n        # Therefore, the ternary search approach is necessary.\n\n        # So back to the ternary search.

However, this approach may not capture all possibilities and could miss the maximum.\n\n        # Alternatively, perhaps for each s, we can try all possible y in the range [max(0, (s - len1) // 2), min( len(w2), s//2 ) ].\n\n        # For example, since the maximum number of weight 1 items is len1, then for a given y, the remaining capacity is s - 2*y. If s - 2*y >= len1, then we can take all len1 items. Otherwise, take s - 2*y items.\n\n        # So, for a given y, the value is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( s - 2*y, len1 ) ]\n\n        # Now, the idea is that for the optimal y, the value of s - 2*y is around len1. So perhaps the optimal y is in the range where s - 2*y is between 0 and len1.\n\n        # So, solving for y:\n\n        # 0 ≤ s - 2*y ≤ len1\n\n        # => s - len1 ≤ 2*y ≤ s\n\n        # => (s - len1)/2 ≤ y ≤ s/2\n\n        # So the optimal y is in this range. So for each s, we can iterate y from max(0, (s - len1)//2 ) to min( len(w2), s//2 )\n\n        # This range could be small, especially if len1 is large.\n\n        # For example, if len1 is 1e5, and s is 3e5, then the range is from (3e5 - 1e5)/2 = 1e5 to 1.5e5. Which is 5e4 steps.\n\n        # But for each z, this could be O(5e4) steps, leading to 5e9 operations for 1e5 z's. Which is way too slow.\n\n        # So this approach is not feasible.\n\n        # Back to the ternary search idea. Let's think of it as follows: the function is unimodal. So we can perform a ternary search to find the maximum.\n\n        # Here's a code snippet for ternary search:\n\n        def find_max(s):\n\n            low = 0\n\n            high = max_y\n\n            best = 0\n\n            while low <= high:\n\n                mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n                mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n                val1 = compute(mid1)\n\n                val2 = compute(mid2)\n\n                if val1 < val2:\n\n                    best = max(best, val2)\n\n                    low = mid1 + 1\n\n                else:\n\n                    best = max(best, val1)\n\n                    high = mid2 - 1\n\n            # After the loop, check the remaining points\n\n            for y in range(low, high + 1):\n\n                best = max(best, compute(y))\n\n            return best\n\n        # But this is just an example. The actual implementation would need to handle this carefully.\n\n        # However, given time constraints, perhaps the best way to proceed is to write a loop for all possible y in the range [0, max_y], but with optimizations.\n\n        # But given that for the worst case, this is O(1e5 * 1e5) = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\n        # So perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\n        Another idea: For the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, since the weight is small, we can precompute for all possible numbers of weight 2 items, and for each possible remainder mod 2.\n\n        Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\n        Let me think of the following: for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, y, we can compute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken for a given capacity.\n\n        But for each capacity s, the maximum number of weight 2 items is up to s//2.\n\n        However, considering that for the weight 1 items, the prefix sum is non-decreasing, and for weight 2 items, the prefix sum is also non-decreasing.\n\n        So, for a given s, the optimal y is the one that maximizes prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(s - 2y, len1) ].\n\n        Now, let's imagine that for each possible y, we can compute the value. But how to find the maximum.\n\n        Let me think of this as follows: for each y, the value is prefix2[y] plus the prefix1 of the maximum possible x for the remaining capacity.\n\n        Now, since prefix1 is non-decreasing, the more x you can take, the better. So for a given y, the value depends on how much capacity is left after taking 2y weight.\n\n        Now, for each s, the optimal y is the one that balances between taking more weight 2 items (which have higher value per item?) and leaving enough capacity for weight 1 items.\n\n        But since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, each additional weight 2 item adds more value than the previous ones. Similarly for weight 1 items.\n\n        So, perhaps the optimal y is either the maximum possible y (take as many weight 2 items as possible), or the maximum y such that s - 2y is sufficient to take some weight 1 items.\n\n        But I'm not sure.\n\n        Another idea: For a given s, the maximum value is the maximum of:\n\n        - Take as many weight 2 items as possible, and fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n\n        - Take one less weight 2 item, and fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n\n        - And so on, but this is again O(k) steps.\n\n        Alternatively, for each possible s, the optimal y is either floor(s/2), or floor(s/2) - 1, or some nearby values.\n\n        Let's think: if I take the maximum possible y (y_max = min( len(w2), s//2 )), then the remaining capacity is s - 2*y_max. Take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\n        Or, if I take y_max - 1, then the remaining capacity is s - 2*(y_max - 1) = s - 2*y_max + 2. Which is 2 more, allowing for more weight 1 items.\n\n        So comparing these two options might give the maximum value.\n\n        But what if there's a better option further away?\n\n        For example, taking y_max - 2 might allow for more weight 1 items which collectively have higher value than the sum of two weight 2 items and fewer weight 1 items.\n\n        However, given the time constraints, perhaps it's worth trying to compute for a few possible y values around y_max and choose the best.\n\n        For example, for each s, compute the value for y_max, y_max-1, y_max-2, ..., down to max(0, y_max - k), where k is a small number like 100. Then take the maximum among these.\n\n        This would reduce the number of computations per s to O(100), which is acceptable.\n\n        But why would this work? Well, since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking more of them may compensate for not taking some weight 2 items. But",
