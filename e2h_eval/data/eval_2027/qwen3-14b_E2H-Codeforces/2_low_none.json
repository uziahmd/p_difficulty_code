Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, the non-diagonal elements must all be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on either diagonal are the same. Let's call this 'o_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char is not equal to o_char.\n\nBut how do I check these?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to iterate through the diagonals.\n\nFor the main diagonal: positions (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal: positions (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut since n is odd, the center cell (middle row and column) is part of both diagonals. So when checking, we need to make sure that all elements in both diagonals are the same. However, since the center is part of both, it's covered once.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters in the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal characters?\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid, if it's not on either diagonal, then check if it's the same as the non-diagonal character.\n\nBut how to check if a cell is on a diagonal?\n\nA cell (i,j) is on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So any cell that is not on either of these is a non-diagonal cell.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid:\n\nif (i == j) or (i + j == n-1): it's part of the diagonals. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal.\n\nBut for the diagonals, all their elements must be same. So first, collect all the elements in the diagonals. Let's collect them into a set. If the length of the set is 1, then they are all same. But also, for the non-diagonal elements, collect them into another set. If that set's length is 1, and the two sets are different.\n\nWait, but there's a possibility that the non-diagonal elements are same as the diagonal's. But according to the problem statement, they need to be different. So:\n\nSo steps:\n\nCheck that all elements on the diagonals are same (d_char).\n\nCheck that all elements not on diagonals are same (o_char).\n\nCheck that d_char != o_char.\n\nIf all three conditions are met, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is n followed by n lines of strings. Each line is a string of length n.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nNow, the diagonals are:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) = x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=x, (3,3)=x, (4,4)=x. So all x. Anti-diagonal: (0,4)=x, (1,3)=x, (2,2)=x, (3,1)=x, (4,0)=x. So all x. So diagonals are same. Now non-diagonal elements: for example, (0,1) is o, (0,2) is o, etc. But looking at row 2, (2,0) is s. Which is not on any diagonal. So the non-diagonal elements have s, which is different from x. But in this case",
