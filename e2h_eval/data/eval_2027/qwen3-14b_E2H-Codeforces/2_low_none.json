Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific conditions. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (where n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right. The other diagonal is top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other elements must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check if all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check if all elements not on the diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'o'.\n3. Ensure that 'd' is not equal to 'o'.\n\nBut how do I check the diagonals?\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n- It's on the main diagonal if i == j.\n- It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo for all cells, check if they are on either of these diagonals.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the other characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping cells? Since n is odd, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when collecting the diagonal characters, we need to make sure that we don't have duplicates. But for checking if all are same, it's okay. Because even if we check the same cell twice, it's still the same character.\n\nBut maybe for efficiency, we can process each cell once. However, since n is up to 300, even O(n^2) is acceptable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on either diagonal.\n- Collect all the characters on the diagonals into a set. If the size of this set is not 1, then return NO.\n- Then collect all the non-diagonal characters into another set. If the size of this set is not 1, return NO.\n- Also, check that the two sets (diagonal and non-diagonal) are different. If they are the same, return NO.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the non-diagonal letters must be the same as each other, but different from the diagonal letters. So the two sets must be of size 1 each, and their elements must differ.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCheck:\n\n1. All diagonal characters are same (d).\n2. All non-diagonal characters are same (o).\n3. d != o.\n\nIf all three conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == n-1. If yes, it's part of the diagonal.\n\nElse, it's part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo, for all cells, we can check which group they belong to.\n\nSo, let's collect the diagonal characters and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut perhaps, for the diagonals, we can collect all the characters and check if they are all the same. Similarly for the non-diagonal.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize two variables: diag_char and non_diag_char.\n\nBut perhaps, for the diagonals, we can take the first diagonal character (say, (0,0)), and check that all other diagonal characters are equal to it. Similarly for the non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal characters? Well, since n is at least 3, for example, n=3. The diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the center. So total diagonal cells is 2n-1. For n=3, that's 5 cells. The total cells is 9, so non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo for the non-diagonal cells, there are some cells. So in code:\n\nFirst, check for all diagonal cells. Let's get the first diagonal cell's character. Then check that all other diagonal cells have the same character.\n\nThen, get the first non-diagonal cell's character. Check that all other non-diagonal cells have the same character.\n\nThen check",
