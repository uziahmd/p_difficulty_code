In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimal number of draws required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. The output for each case is the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each of the three given tiles, I need to check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. If not, then figure out what's the minimal number of tiles needed to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut since the initial hand has three tiles, maybe adding some tiles can help form a triplet or sequence. Let's break down the possibilities.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then consider all possibilities of adding tiles. But how to find the minimal steps?\n\nLet me think about possible cases.\n\nCase 1: Check if there's a possible triplet. For example, if all three tiles are the same. Then it's already a triplet. Otherwise, maybe adding two more tiles of the same type. Wait, but the initial three tiles may have two of the same. Like two 1m and one 1p. Then to make a triplet, you need to add one more 1m. So for triplet, the count of each tile type in the hand must be considered.\n\nBut for the current three tiles, perhaps we can check if there's a way to form a triplet by adding some tiles. For example, if there are two tiles of the same type, then adding one more would make a triplet. So for that case, the number of tiles needed is 1. Or if there's only one of a certain tile, then adding two more would make a triplet. But maybe there's a better way via sequences.\n\nBut the problem is that the minimal number could be either via forming a triplet or via forming a sequence. So I need to check both possibilities and take the minimum between them.\n\nSo for each possible scenario, I need to evaluate the minimal steps required.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFor the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal steps needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nNow, how to check if the three tiles can form a mentsu. Let's first check for triplet. All three must be same. For example, 9m, 9m, 9m. If that's the case, then yes.\n\nFor a sequence, the three tiles must be in the same suit, and their numbers must be consecutive. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But the order doesn't matter. So we can sort them and check if they form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo for the initial three tiles, first check if they form a triplet or a sequence. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that after adding, there exists a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios.\n\nLet's first think about forming a triplet. How can we do that?\n\nThe triplet requires three identical tiles. So, for example, if the current hand has two of a certain tile, then adding one more will make a triplet. If the current hand has one of a tile, then adding two more. If the current hand has zero of a tile, then adding three.\n\nBut since the current hand has three tiles, maybe there are multiple possibilities. For example, if the current hand has two different tiles, but maybe adding two tiles of the same type to form a triplet.\n\nWait, but the triplet can be formed by any three tiles of the same type. So for example, if the current hand has two 1m and one 2m, then to form a triplet, you can add one more 1m (so total three 1m), or add two 2m (to have three 2m), or add three 3m (but that would require three tiles, which is worse than adding one 1m). So the minimal steps here would be 1.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, the minimal steps required is the minimal steps needed to get three of the same tile. For example, for each tile type present in the hand, calculate how many more are needed to reach three. Then take the minimal among those.\n\nWait, but the current hand may have multiple types. Let's take an example. Suppose the hand has 1m, 1m, 2p. Then, for the 1m, we have two. Need one more. For the 2p, we have one. Need two more. So the minimal steps for triplet is 1.\n\nSo for the triplet case, the minimal steps is min( (3 - count) for each tile type in the hand ), but also considering that maybe adding new tile types. For example, if the current hand has no tiles of a certain type, then adding three of that type would require 3 steps. However, maybe there's a better way. But the minimal steps would be the minimal between all possibilities.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, the minimal steps needed is the minimal number of tiles to add to get three of the same tile. For example, for the current hand, check for each tile type (including those not present?), but wait, the current hand has three tiles, which may be of different types. So for example, if the hand has 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, for each of these, we need to add 2 more of the same type to form a triplet. So the minimal steps would be 2. But maybe there's a better way. But in this case, no. So for triplet, the minimal steps is 2.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, the minimal steps is the minimal (3 - count) for each tile type in the hand. Because, if you have a count of 1, then 3-1=2 steps. If you have count of 2, 3-2=1 step. If you have count of 3, then 0 steps.\n\nBut in the case where the hand has three different tile types, like 1m, 2p, 3s, then the minimal steps for triplet is 2 (add two of the same tile, say, 1m, to make three 1m).\n\nBut what if the current hand has two different tile types, e.g., 1m, 1m, 2p. Then, for the 1m, need 1 more. For the 2p, need 2 more. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the triplet steps can be calculated as follows: for each tile type in the current hand, compute how many more tiles are needed to reach 3. Take the minimum of these values.\n\nBut wait, what if there are two tile types with counts of 1 and 1? For example, 1m, 1p, 2p. Then, for the 1m, need 2 more. For 1p, need 2 more. For 2p, need 1 more. So the minimal is 1 (adding another 2p). So the minimal steps for triplet is 1.\n\nSo, the triplet steps would be the minimal (3 - count) across all tile types present in the current hand. So that's one part.\n\nNow for the sequence possibility. How to compute the minimal steps needed to form a sequence.\n\nA sequence requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But the current hand may have three tiles that can be part of a sequence, but not necessarily forming one. For example, if the hand has 1s, 2s, 4s. Then, adding 3s would form a sequence. So steps needed is 1.\n\nSo, the idea is to check for all possible sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles, and find the minimal steps required.\n\nBut how to approach this? Let's think.\n\nFirst, the three tiles may already be part of a sequence. For example, if the current tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s. Then steps is 0. If they are 1s, 2s, 4s, then adding 3s (1 step) would make a sequence. Or if they are 1s, 3s, 4s, then adding 2s (1 step). Or if they are 1s, 2s, 5s. Then adding 3s and 4s (two steps) would form a sequence, but maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current hand has two tiles that can be part of a sequence, and adding one more. For example, 1s, 2s, 5s. So adding 3s would allow a sequence of 1,2,3. But then, the 5s is not part of that. So the three tiles would be 1,2,3, and the 5s is extra. But the problem says that after drawing tiles, the hand must contain a sequence. So, for example, if the hand has four tiles, the three that form the sequence are present.\n\nSo, the approach is: for the current three tiles, find the minimal number of tiles to add so that there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. For sequences, the tiles must be in the same suit. So, first, group the current tiles by their suit. Then, for each suit, check if the current tiles in that suit can form part of a sequence, and compute the minimal steps needed.\n\nFor example, suppose the current hand has two tiles in the same suit. Let's say, 1s, 2s, and 3p. Then, for the s suit, the tiles are 1s and 2s. To form a sequence, you need a third tile (either 3s, or 0s (but 0 is invalid), or 1s again? No. Wait, the sequence must be three consecutive numbers. So for the current 1s and 2s, adding 3s gives a sequence. Alternatively, adding 0s is not allowed. So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nAnother example: if the current tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s. Then, in the s suit, the numbers are 1,3,5. To form a sequence, you can add 2 and 4 (steps 2) to form 1,2,3 or 3,4,5, or add 2 and 3 (steps 2) to form 1,2,3. Or maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps adding 2 and 4 and 5? No, that's more steps. So the minimal steps is 2.\n\nBut how to find for each suit, the minimal steps required to form a sequence, and then take the minimal over all suits.\n\nSo, for each suit that has at least one tile in the current hand, we can consider that suit and try to find the minimal steps to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each suit (m, p, s):\n\n- collect the numbers of the current tiles in that suit.\n\n- then, determine what is the minimal number of tiles needed to add to form a sequence of three consecutive numbers in that suit.\n\nThen, take the minimal value across all suits.\n\nBut how to compute that for a given suit's numbers?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose in the suit, the current numbers are [1, 2]. Then, the possible sequences are:\n\n[1,2,3] → need to add 3 → 1 step.\n\nOr [0,1,2] → invalid because 0 is not allowed. So only option is to add 3. So steps is 1.\n\nAnother example: current numbers are [1,3]. Then, possible sequences could be [1,2,3] (add 2 → 1 step), or [3,4,5] (add 4 and 5 → 2 steps). So the minimal is 1.\n\nAnother example: current numbers are [2, 5]. Then, possible sequences could be [2,3,4] (need to add 3,4 → 2 steps), [3,4,5] (add 3,4 → 2 steps), [5,6,7] (add 6,7 → 2 steps). Or [2,5, ...] but not sure. So the minimal steps here is 2.\n\nAnother example: current numbers are [2, 3, 5]. For this suit, the numbers are 2,3,5. How to form a sequence? Well, the existing 2,3 can be part of a sequence with 1, 2,3 (needs to add 1), or 2,3,4 (add 4), or 3,4,5 (add 4). So the minimal steps would be 1 (adding 1) or 1 (adding 4) → minimal is 1.\n\nBut wait, the existing tiles are 2,3,5. So when adding one tile, the hand will have 4 tiles. We need to have three consecutive numbers. So, for example, adding 1 would allow 1,2,3. Adding 4 would allow 2,3,4. Adding 6 would allow 5,6,7 (but need to add 6 and 7, which is two steps). So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo for the suit's numbers, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers in that suit.\n\nHow can I model this?\n\nFor the current numbers in a suit, say, sorted as a list. For example, let's say the list is sorted as [a, b, c], but maybe there are duplicates. Wait, but the original three tiles may have multiple in the same suit. For example, [1s, 1s, 2s]. So, for the suit s, the numbers are [1,1,2].\n\nBut when considering sequences, each tile can be used once. So for example, if there are two 1s and one 2, then the possible sequences could be 1,1,2? No, because a sequence requires three consecutive numbers. So, the numbers must be consecutive. So even if you have two 1s and one 2, you can't form a sequence. Because the numbers are 1,1,2. The sequence must be three consecutive numbers, like 1,2,3. So for this case, the existing numbers are 1,1,2. So the possible sequences could be 1,2,3 (need to add 3 → 1 step), or 0,1,2 (invalid). So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo, the approach for a given suit's numbers is:\n\nWe need to find a triplet of consecutive numbers (x, x+1, x+2) such that, in the current hand plus the added tiles, there are at least one of each of x, x+1, x+2. The minimal number of tiles needed to add is the sum of (the number of tiles needed for each of x, x+1, x+2 that are missing in the current hand).\n\nBut how to find all possible x and compute the required steps.\n\nFor example, for the current suit's numbers, which are [1,1,2], possible x can be 1 (sequence 1,2,3). For that, we need to check how many of each of 1,2,3 are present.\n\nIn the current hand, there are two 1s, one 2, and zero 3s. So to have at least one of each, we need to add one 3. So steps is 1.\n\nAnother possible x is 0 (sequence 0,1,2) but invalid. So not considered.\n\nAnother possible x is 2 (sequence 2,3,4). For that, current hand has one 2, zero 3, zero 4. Need to add two tiles (3 and 4). Steps is 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor the current suit's numbers, generate all possible x (from 1 to 7) since the sequence x, x+1, x+2 must be within 1-9. So x can be from 1 to 7 (since x+2 <=9).\n\nFor each x in 1..7:\n\nCheck if the current hand has at least one of x, x+1, x+2. But no, because the current hand may not have all three. So, for each x, we need to compute how many tiles we need to add to cover the missing numbers in x, x+1, x+2.\n\nFor example, if the current hand has some of the numbers, then the steps is the number of missing numbers. For instance, if the current hand has x and x+1, but not x+2, then steps is 1. If it has x and x+2, but not x+1, steps is 1. If it has only x, steps is 2 (add x+1 and x+2). Etc.\n\nBut how to compute this for the current numbers?\n\nLet me think. For a given x, we need to check for each of the three numbers (x, x+1, x+2) whether they are present in the current suit's numbers. But since the current hand may have multiple copies of a number, but we just need at least one of each.\n\nSo, for example, if the current numbers in the suit are [1, 1, 2], then for x=1, the numbers x, x+1, x+2 are 1,2,3. We have at least one 1 and 2, but none of 3. So steps is 1.\n\nSo, for each x, the steps needed is the count of numbers in {x, x+1, x+2} that are not present in the current suit's numbers. Then, the minimal steps for that suit is the minimal of all these steps for all possible x.\n\nBut how do I check if a number is present in the current suit's numbers?\n\nFor example, for the current suit's numbers, let's create a set of the numbers. So, for example, if the current numbers are [1,1,2], the set is {1,2}.\n\nSo for a given x, the three numbers are x, x+1, x+2. For each of these three numbers, check if they are in the set. The number of missing ones is the steps needed for that x.\n\nSo for each x in 1..7, compute the number of missing numbers in the triplet. The minimal steps for this suit is the minimal of these values across all x.\n\nBut what if the current suit has no numbers? For example, if the three tiles are in different suits. Then, for that suit, there are no numbers, so we can't form a sequence. So, we can ignore that suit.\n\nSo the overall approach for the sequence part is:\n\nFor each suit present in the current hand:\n\n   collect the numbers in that suit (e.g., if the current hand has 1s, 2s, 3p, then for suit 's', the numbers are [1,2]; for suit 'p', [3])\n\n   create a set of these numbers.\n\n   for each possible x (from 1 to 7):\n\n      check the three numbers x, x+1, x+2.\n\n      count how many of these are missing in the current set.\n\n      the steps for this x is the count.\n\n   find the minimal steps for this suit.\n\nThen, the minimal steps for the sequence is the minimal steps across all suits.\n\nSo, the minimal steps for the entire problem is the minimum between the minimal steps for triplet and the minimal steps for sequence.\n\nOnce I have both values (triplet_steps and sequence_steps), the answer is the minimum of those two.\n\nBut what if the current hand has three tiles in different suits? For example, 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, for the triplet, the steps is 2 (add two of same tile). For the sequence, for each suit, the numbers are [1], [2], [3]. For each suit, the possible x's:\n\nFor suit m, numbers are [1]. Check x=1: requires 1,2,3. Missing 2 and 3 → steps 2. x=0 invalid. x=2: requires 2,3,4. Missing 2,3,4 → steps 3. etc. So the minimal for suit m is 2. Similarly for p and s. So the minimal steps for sequence is 2. So overall answer is min(2, 2) = 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to add two tiles to form a sequence. For example, add 2m and 3m. Then, the hand would have 1m, 2m, 3m. Which is a sequence. So steps is 2. So the answer is correct.\n\nSo, the approach seems valid.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nLet me outline the steps for solving the problem:\n\nGiven three tiles:\n\nCheck if they already form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the minimal steps for triplet and for sequence, then return the minimum between the two.\n\nSo, first, how to check if the current three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nCheck for triplet: all three tiles are same.\n\nCheck for sequence: all three are same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo, for example, the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s → yes. Or 3s, 1s, 2s → yes.\n\nTo check for sequence:\n\n- all three tiles must be same suit.\n\n- when sorted, their numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, first check if they are same suit. If not, no sequence. Else, collect the numbers, sort them, and check if the sorted list is [x, x+1, x+2].\n\nSo, for example, sorted numbers [1,2,3] → yes. [1,3,4] → no. [2,3,4] → yes.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nCompute the minimal steps between triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nNow, let's think about how to compute triplet_steps.\n\nFor the three tiles, count the frequency of each tile type.\n\nFor example, if the tiles are 1s, 1s, 2p → the frequencies are:\n\ntile '1s' → 2, '2p' → 1.\n\nSo, for each tile type in the current hand, compute how many more are needed to reach 3. The minimal of these is the triplet_steps.\n\nBut how to get all tile types in the current hand. For example, for the three tiles, we can create a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each tile.\n\nFor example, tiles = ['1s', '1s', '2p'] → counts is {'1s':2, '2p':1}.\n\nThen, for each key in counts, compute (3 - counts[key]).\n\nThe minimal of these values is the triplet_steps.\n\nBut what if there are multiple tile types? For example, if the three tiles are all different. Then, for each of the three, the count is 1. So (3 - 1) = 2. So triplet_steps is 2.\n\nSo, triplet_steps is min(3 - count for each tile in the counts).\n\nNow, for sequence_steps:\n\nFor each suit present in the current hand:\n\n   collect the numbers in that suit.\n\n   create a set of those numbers.\n\n   for each x in 1..7:\n\n      check the three numbers x, x+1, x+2.\n\n      count how many of them are not in the set.\n\n      steps for this x is that count.\n\n   find the minimal steps for this suit.\n\nThen, the sequence_steps is the minimal among all the suits' minimal steps.\n\nIf there are no suits (which can't happen since the input has three tiles), then sequence_steps is infinity.\n\nSo, for example, if the three tiles are in three different suits, then for each suit, the numbers in that suit are one number. For each suit, the minimal steps for that suit is the minimal steps to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nSo, for each suit, the minimal steps is computed as above.\n\nOnce we have the minimal steps for all suits, the sequence_steps is the minimal among them.\n\nNow, the overall answer is min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps).\n\nBut what if the sequence_steps is not possible? Like, for example, if the current hand is 1m, 1m, 1m. Then, triplet_steps is 0, and sequence_steps is something else. But since the triplet is already present, the answer is 0.\n\nBut in the code, the initial check for mentsu would have already handled that.\n\nNow, let's think about some examples.\n\nExample 1: Input is ['1s', '2s', '3s']. Already a sequence → output 0.\n\nExample 2: Input is ['9m', '9m', '9m'] → triplet → output 0.\n\nThird example: ['3p', '9m', '2p'] → the current hand is 3p, 2p, 9m.\n\nCheck for mentsu: the three tiles are different suits (two p and one m). So no sequence. For triplet, the counts are 3p:1, 9m:1, 2p:1. So triplet_steps is min(3-1, 3-1, 3-1) → 2. For the sequence_steps:\n\nCheck each suit.\n\nSuit 'p' has numbers [3, 2]. So sorted [2,3]. For this suit, possible x's:\n\nx=1: requires 1,2,3. Current set {2,3} → missing 1. steps 1.\n\nx=2: requires 2,3,4 → missing 4 → steps 1.\n\nx=3: requires 3,4,5 → missing 4 and 5 → steps 2.\n\nSo the minimal steps for suit p is 1.\n\nSuit 'm' has [9]. For possible x's:\n\nx can be up to 7. For x=7: requires 7,8,9. Current set {9} → missing 7 and 8 → steps 2. For x=8: requires 8,9,10 (invalid). So x can be up to 7. So for suit m, the minimal steps is 2.\n\nSo overall sequence_steps is 1. So the answer is min(2, 1) → 1. Which matches the sample input's third case.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother example: input is ['1s', '2s', '4s']. Check for mentsu: not a triplet (all are same suit, but numbers 1,2,4. Not consecutive). So not a sequence. So triplet_steps: for each tile (count 1 for each), so triplet steps is 2. For sequence steps:\n\nsuit 's' has numbers [1,2,4]. So set {1,2,4}.\n\nCheck for x:\n\nx=1: needs 1,2,3. Missing 3 → steps 1.\n\nx=2: needs 2,3,4. Missing 3 → steps 1.\n\nx=3: needs 3,4,5. Missing 3 and 5 → steps 2.\n\nx=4: needs 4,5,6 → missing 5,6 → steps 2.\n\nSo the minimal steps for suit 's' is 1. So overall sequence_steps is 1. So answer is min(2,1) → 1. So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nThus, the code would output 1.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, parse the input. The input is three strings, like ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'].\n\nWait, the input is given as a single line with three strings. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit from 1 to 9 and the second is m, p, or s.\n\nSo, for example, the sample input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut the actual input is a single line, like \"1s 2s 3s 9m 9m 9m 3p 9m 2p\" ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is three strings. For example, the first example input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's a list of three elements. However, the actual input is a single line. So perhaps the input is given as three space-separated strings. For example, the first example input would be:\n\n\"1s 2s 3s 9m 9m 9m 3p 9m 2p\"\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is three strings. So the input line is three strings, each being a tile. For example, for the first example, the input is \"1s 2s 3s\", but that's three tiles. Wait, no. Wait the input is three strings, each representing a tile. So the input line is three strings separated by spaces. For example, the first example input is three tiles: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\". So the input line is \"1s 2s 3s\".\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is a list of three elements, but in reality, the input is a single line with three strings. So for example, the input is read as a list of three elements, each being a tile.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nSo, the input is a single line with three strings, each representing a tile. So for example, the first sample input is:\n\n\"1s 2s 3s\" (but that's three tiles, each separated by space). Wait, no. Wait, the input is three strings. So the input is a single line with three strings, each of which is a tile. For example, the first example input would be:\n\n\"1s 2s 3s\" → three tiles. The second example input is \"9m 9m 9m\", etc.\n\nSo the code should read the input as a list of three strings. For example, in Python, input().split() would split the line into three elements.\n\nSo, for the code, the input is read as:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nWhich gives a list of three elements.\n\nOnce the tiles are read, we can proceed.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFirst, check if the current tiles form a mentsu.\n\nCheck for triplet: all three tiles are same.\n\nCheck for sequence: all same suit, and numbers are consecutive.\n\nIf either is true, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nNow, code for checking mentsu:\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    # check same suit\n\n    suit = tiles[0][1]\n\n    if all(t[1] == suit for t in tiles):\n\n        # extract numbers\n\n        nums = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n\n        nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n\n        if nums_sorted[1] == nums_sorted[0] +1 and nums_sorted[2] == nums_sorted[0] +2:\n\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nBut need to handle the case where the three tiles are same suit and sorted numbers are consecutive.\n\nOnce that is checked, if returns True, then output is 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, compute triplet_steps:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounts = Counter(tiles)\n\ntriplet_steps = min(3 - count for count in counts.values())\n\nBut wait, counts.values() is the counts for each tile. For example, if the tiles are ['1s', '1s', '2p'], counts.values() is [2, 1]. So 3 - 2 = 1, 3 -1=2 → min is 1. So triplet_steps is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, compute sequence_steps:\n\nInitialize sequence_steps to a large value (like infinity).\n\nFor each suit in the current tiles:\n\n   collect the numbers in that suit.\n\n   create a set of numbers.\n\n   for x in 1 to 7:\n\n      check the three numbers x, x+1, x+2.\n\n      count how many are missing in the set.\n\n      steps = count.\n\n      if steps is less than current minimal for this suit, update.\n\n   take the minimal steps for this suit, and compare with the overall sequence_steps.\n\nSo, code:\n\nsuits = {}\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    suit = t[1]\n\n    num = int(t[0])\n\n    if suit not in suits:\n\n        suits[suit] = []\n\n    suits[suit].append(num)\n\nsequence_steps = float('inf')\n\nfor suit in suits:\n\n    nums_in_suit = suits[suit]\n\n    num_set = set(nums_in_suit)\n\n    min_suit_steps = float('inf')\n\n    for x in range(1, 8):  # x can be 1 to 7 inclusive\n\n        required = {x, x+1, x+2}\n\n        missing = 0\n\n        for r in required:\n\n            if r not in num_set:\n\n                missing +=1\n\n        if missing < min_suit_steps:\n\n            min_suit_steps = missing\n\n    if min_suit_steps < sequence_steps:\n\n        sequence_steps = min_suit_steps\n\nSo, after processing all suits, sequence_steps is the minimal steps for sequence.\n\nThen, the answer is min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps).\n\nBut wait, what if there are no suits? Well, since the input has three tiles, there must be at least one suit.\n\nSo, after computing triplet_steps and sequence_steps, the answer is min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps).\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: ['1s', '2s', '3s']\n\nCheck for mentsu: yes, sequence. Output is 0.\n\nSample input 2: ['9m', '9m', '9m'] → triplet. Output 0.\n\nSample input 3: ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nCheck for mentsu: not a triplet (counts are 1, 1, 1). Not a sequence (different suits). So proceed.\n\ntriplet_steps: min(3-1, 3-1, 3-1) → 2.\n\nsequence_steps: process suits.\n\nsuit 'p' has numbers [3, 2]. suit 'm' has [9].\n\nFor suit 'p':\n\npossible x from 1-7.\n\nx=1: required {1,2,3} → missing 1 → steps 1.\n\nx=2: required {2,3,4} → missing 4 → steps 1.\n\nx=3: required {3,4,5} → missing 4,5 → steps 2.\n\netc. So min_suit_steps for suit p is 1.\n\nsuit 'm' has [9]. For x=7: required {7,8,9} → missing 7 and 8 → steps 2. For x=8: required {8,9,10} → 10 is invalid. So x can be up to 7. So the minimal steps for suit m is 2. So overall sequence_steps is 1.\n\nSo answer is min(2, 1) → 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: input is ['1s', '1s', '2s'].\n\nCheck for mentsu: not a triplet (only two 1s and one 2). Not a sequence (numbers are 1,1,2. sorted is [1,1,2]. Not consecutive. So no.\n\ntriplet_steps: for tile '1s' (count 2) and '2s' (count 1). So triplet steps is min(3-2=1, 3-1=2) → 1.\n\nsequence_steps: for suit 's', numbers are [1,1,2]. set {1,2}.\n\nfor x=1: required {1,2,3} → missing 3 → steps 1.\n\nso sequence_steps is 1. answer is min(1, 1) → 1. So the minimal steps is 1. Which makes sense: adding 3s to form 1,2,3.\n\nAnother example: input is ['1s', '2s', '4s'] → sequence_steps for suit",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid meld (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking if the current tiles already form a valid meld and, if not, calculating the minimum number of tiles required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Immediate Meld**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence. If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: If the tiles do not form an immediate meld, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet. This is done by counting the occurrences of each tile type and determining how many more tiles are needed to form a triplet (three identical tiles).\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: For each suit present in the tiles, determine the minimum number of tiles needed to form a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). This involves checking all possible sequences within the range of 1 to 9 and calculating the missing tiles for each potential sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n    # Check for triplet\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return True\n    # Check for sequence\n    suit = tiles[0][1]\n    if all(t[1] == suit for t in tiles):\n        nums = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n        nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n        if nums_sorted[1] == nums_sorted[0] + 1 and nums_sorted[2] == nums_sorted[0] + 2:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    tiles = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if is_mentsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Calculate triplet steps\n    counts = Counter(tiles)\n    triplet_steps = min(3 - count for count in counts.values())\n    \n    # Calculate sequence steps\n    suits = {}\n    for t in tiles:\n        suit = t[1]\n        num = int(t[0])\n        if suit not in suits:\n            suits[suit] = []\n        suits[suit].append(num)\n    \n    sequence_steps = float('inf')\n    for suit in suits:\n        nums_in_suit = suits[suit]\n        num_set = set(nums_in_suit)\n        min_suit_steps = float('inf')\n        for x in range(1, 8):  # x from 1 to 7 inclusive\n            required = {x, x+1, x+2}\n            missing = 0\n            for r in required:\n                if r not in num_set:\n                    missing += 1\n            if missing < min_suit_steps:\n                min_suit_steps = missing\n        if min_suit_steps < sequence_steps:\n            sequence_steps = min_suit_steps\n    \n    result = min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Immediate Meld Check**: The function `is_mentsu` checks if the given tiles form a valid triplet or sequence. This is done by comparing all three tiles for equality (triplet) or checking if they form consecutive numbers in the same suit (sequence).\n2. **Triplet Steps Calculation**: Using a counter, we determine the frequency of each tile type. The minimum number of additional tiles needed to form a triplet is calculated by finding the smallest difference between 3 and the count of any tile type.\n3. **Sequence Steps Calculation**: For each suit present in the tiles, we check all possible sequences (from 1 to 7) and determine the minimum number of tiles needed to complete any valid sequence. This involves checking which numbers in the sequence are missing and summing the required additions.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both possible ways to form a meld and ensures the minimum number of tiles is determined accurately.",
