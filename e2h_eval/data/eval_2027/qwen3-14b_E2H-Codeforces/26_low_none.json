Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Oh right, and the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality must hold: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe we can simplify that.\n\nWait, the problem says that x is between A and B, y is between B and C (but y is at least B, since B ≤ y), and z is between C and D. Also, the order is x ≤ y ≤ z? Wait, no. Wait the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y starts from B (since B ≤ y) and up to C, and z starts from C up to D. But how are x, y, z ordered? Well, since x ≤ B ≤ y, and y ≤ C ≤ z, so x ≤ y ≤ z? Because x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So x ≤ y and y ≤ z. Therefore, the three sides are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z. So for a triangle, the triangle inequality requires that x + y > z. Because in a triangle with sides a ≤ b ≤ c, the condition is a + b > c. Because if that holds, then the other inequalities (a + c > b and b + c > a) are automatically satisfied since c ≥ b ≥ a.\n\nSo the main condition here is x + y > z. So our problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\n\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\n\nand x ≤ y ≤ z (which is already implied by the ranges, since x ≤ B ≤ y and y ≤ C ≤ z, so x ≤ y ≤ z),\n\nand x + y > z.\n\nSo how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe brute-force approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z in their ranges and check if x + y > z. But given that the ranges can be up to 5e5, that's way too slow. For example, if B is 5e5, and C is 5e5, and D is 5e5, then the number of possible x, y, z combinations would be O( (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1) ), which could be up to (5e5)^3, which is 1.25e17 operations. That's impossible to compute directly.\n\nWe need a smarter approach. Let's think about how to compute the number of valid (x, y, z) triplets efficiently.\n\nFirst, note that for each z, we can find the number of (x, y) pairs such that x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y > z. Then sum over all z in [C, D].\n\nBut even that approach might be computationally heavy if we don't optimize it. Let's see: for each z, the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy x + y > z. How can we compute this?\n\nAlternatively, since z is fixed, and x and y are in their respective ranges, perhaps we can precompute for each possible z the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > z. Let's think about that.\n\nLet me consider that for a fixed z, the valid (x, y) pairs are those where x is between A and B, y between B and C, and x + y > z. But since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, and x ≤ y (since x ≤ B ≤ y), so x ranges from A to B, y from B to C, but x ≤ y. However, since x can be up to B and y starts at B, x can be less than or equal to y. For example, x can be B and y can be B.\n\nSo for each z, the problem becomes: count the number of pairs (x, y) where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], x ≤ y, and x + y > z.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all z in [C, D]?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for all possible z, the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy x + y > z. Let's think about the possible range of z. Since z is between C and D, and for each z, the minimal x + y is A + B (since x can be as low as A and y as low as B). The maximum x",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$ are satisfied. The key insight is to use the triangle inequality condition $x + y > z$, which must hold for a triangle to be non-degenerate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the ranges for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can iterate over each possible value of $z$ in the range $[C, D]$.\n2. **Efficient Counting**: For each fixed $z$, we need to count the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs such that $x \\in [A, B]$, $y \\in [B, C]$, and $x + y > z$.\n3. **Prefix Sums**: Use prefix sums to quickly calculate the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs for each $z$. This avoids recalculating counts repeatedly and ensures efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    A = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    B = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    C = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    D = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    \n    # Precompute the number of (x,y) pairs for each possible z\n    # We'll compute for all possible z in [C, D]\n    \n    # First, precompute for all possible y in [B, C], and x in [A, B]\n    # For each y, the x can be from max(A, z - y + 1) to B\n    # But since z varies, we need to find for each z, the number of (x,y) where x + y > z\n    \n    # To optimize, precompute for all possible z:\n    # The total number of (x,y) pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n    # Then subtract the number of (x,y) pairs where x + y <= z\n    \n    # For each z, compute how many (x,y) pairs have x + y <= z\n    # Then total_valid = total_pairs - invalid_pairs\n    \n    # Precompute the count of x in [A, B], y in [B, C] such that x + y <= z\n    # We can do this using two pointers approach for each z\n    \n    # Precompute all possible y values in [B, C]\n    y_list = list(range(B, C+1))\n    # Precompute all possible x values in [A, B]\n    x_list = list(range(A, B+1))\n    \n    total_pairs = len(x_list) * len(y_list)\n    \n    result = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all z in [C, D]\n    for z in range(C, D+1):\n        # For current z, find the number of (x,y) pairs where x + y <= z\n        # Using two pointers approach\n        count_invalid = 0\n        j = len(y_list) - 1  # start from the largest y\n        for x in x_list:\n            # For current x, find the maximum y such that x + y <= z\n            # y_max = min(z - x, C)\n            # but since y is in y_list, which is sorted\n            while j >= 0 and x + y_list[j] > z:\n                j -= 1\n            count_invalid += (j + 1)  # number of y's <= current y_list[j]\n        result += (total_pairs - count_invalid)\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Precomputation**: We generate lists of possible values for $x$ and $y$ based on their respective ranges.\n3. **Two Pointers Technique**: For each possible value of $z$ in the range $[C, D]$, we use a two pointers approach to efficiently count the number of invalid $(x, y)$ pairs where $x + y \\leq z$.\n4. **Result Calculation**: For each $z$, the number of valid triangles is calculated by subtracting the count of invalid pairs from the total number of possible $(x, y)$ pairs.
