For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The input is three notes, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. But when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. For example, between C and E, there are 4 semitones. Let me think: C to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, D to D# is 3, D# to E is 4? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that between consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone. So the sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then, each consecutive pair is one semitone apart. So the distance from C to E would be 4 semitones. Because C to C# (1), C# to D (2), D to D# (3), D# to E (4). Oh right. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of steps you take moving forward from X to Y in the list. But since the list is cyclic, if Y is before X in the list, then you wrap around.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes? Let's think of each note as being assigned an index. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, ..., H is 11. Then, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4 semitones. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 -4 + 12) mod 12 = 8 semitones. Because when you go from E to C, you can go forward by 8 steps (E to F (5), F to F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11), C (0) — that's 8 steps). So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y comes after X, otherwise (Y_index - X_index + 12). Or more simply, (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? No, because mod 12 would give a value between 0 and 11. But for example, when X is E (4) and Y is C (0), the distance is 8 semitones. Which is (0 -4 + 12) = 8. So the distance is (Y_index - X_index) if positive, else (Y_index - X_index + 12). So the formula is (Y_index - X_index + 12) % 12. But wait, that would give the same as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. However, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. Otherwise, it's (Y + 12 - X). So the formula is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y - X + 12). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) % 12? Well, no. Because for example, if Y is 0 and X is 4, then (Y - X) is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, that gives the number of semitones when moving from X to Y in the cyclic order. But the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. Otherwise, it's (Y + 12 - X). Which is exactly (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent each note as an index in a list of musical notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using their indices. The distance is computed as the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher note, considering the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Triad Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if they form a major or minor triad based on the defined distances:\n   - A major triad has a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note.\n   - A minor triad has a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation matches the criteria for a major or minor triad, return the corresponding result. If none match, return \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Representation**: The `note_to_index` function maps each note to its corresponding index in the list of musical notes.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The `distance` function computes the number of semitones between two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n- **Triad Check**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` check if a given permutation of notes forms a major or minor triad based on the specified distances.\n- **Permutations Check**: The `classify_chord` function checks all permutations of the three notes to determine if they form a valid major or minor triad. If none match, it returns \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
