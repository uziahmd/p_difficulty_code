For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of major and minor triads. For a major triad, there must be an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3. For minor, it's 3 and then 4. So for each possible permutation of the three notes, I need to check these distances.\n\nBut how do I calculate the distance between two notes? The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. Let me think about the order. The problem lists them as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, H here is the same as B? Because in some notations, B is called H. So the list is 12 notes. So the order is important. So the distance between two notes is calculated by moving forward in the list, considering the cyclic nature.\n\nFor example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check: C to C# is 1, then D (2), D# (3), E (4). Yes. So the distance from X to Y is the number of steps you take moving forward in the list. But if Y is before X, then you wrap around. Wait, no. The problem says that the distance is taken from the lower note to the upper. So if you have two notes, say E and C, then the distance is calculated as E to C? Wait, no. The problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones along the scale. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones? Because if you go from E to F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance is always the minimal number of steps when moving forward? No, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower note to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. But how do you determine which is lower?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So the order is cyclic. So for any two notes, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that the distance is measured as moving forward. Wait, maybe the distance between X and Y is the number of steps you take when moving forward from X to reach Y. For example, if X is C and Y is E, then it's 4 steps. If X is E and Y is C, then moving forward from E would require 8 steps (since E to F is +1, up to C is 8 steps). So the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12. But if the result is negative, then adding 12. Wait, no. Because if Y is after X, then the distance is Y - X. If Y is before X, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y))? Or maybe (Y - X + 12) % 12. Wait, for example, X is C (index 0), Y is E (index 4): distance is 4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), then (0 -4) = -4. Adding 12 gives 8. Which is correct. So the formula for the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper. So perhaps the distance is the minimal number of steps when moving forward. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. So in that case, the distance is not the minimal. Because the minimal would be 4 steps in the other direction. But according to the problem's example, the distance between C and E is 4, and between E and C is 8. So the direction matters. So the distance is calculated as the number of steps moving forward from X to Y, regardless of whether that's the shorter path or not.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, if X is C (index 0) and Y is C again, the distance is zero. But if X is C and",
