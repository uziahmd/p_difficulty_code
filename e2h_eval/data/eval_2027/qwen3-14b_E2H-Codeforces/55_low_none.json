Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm. So the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). \n\nSo the key here is to figure out how these swaps affect the order of characters. Let me think about what permutations are possible. For example, since we can swap 0 and 1, and also 1 and 2, maybe we can arrange the characters in a certain way. Wait, but 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s. But 0s can't move past 2s directly. So perhaps the relative order between 0s and 2s is fixed? Or maybe not?\n\nWait, suppose there's a 0 followed by a 2. Since they can't be swapped directly, but maybe if there's a 1 in between, they can be rearranged. Like, if you have 0 1 2, then you can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2, then swap the 0 and 2? No, wait, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the 0 can't pass through the 2. So maybe the 0s can only move past 1s, and 2s can only move past 1s. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string can't be changed. Because if there's a 0 followed by a 2, they can't cross each other. Because to do that, you would need to swap them, which isn't allowed. So the positions of 0s and 2s relative to each other are fixed. Only the 1s can move between them.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2. Then, the 0 can move to the right past the 1, and the 2 can move to the left past the 1. So for example, 0 1 2 can become 1 0 2 (by swapping 0 and 1), then 1 2 0 (by swapping 1 and 2). Wait, but that would have the 0 moving to the right, and the 2 moving to the left. But the 0 and 2 are now in positions where they were originally in reverse. So in this case, the 0 and 2 can end up swapped. But how?\n\nWait, but the original arrangement was 0 followed by 1 followed by 2. The 0 can move right past the 1, and the 2 can move left past the 1. So the 0 and 2 can cross each other via the 1. So in that case, the 0 can end up after the 2. But then, the original positions of 0 and 2 can be swapped. So that suggests that the relative order between 0s and 2s is not fixed. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the 1s can act as intermediaries. So if there's a 0 and a 2 with some 1s in between, they can be rearranged. But if there's a 0 followed by a 2 with no 1s in between, then they can't be swapped. So for example, in the case of \"02\", you can't swap them. But in \"012\", you can move the 0 to the right of the 1, then the 2 can move to the left of the 1, leading to 210? No, let's think step by step.\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2. We can swap 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then, we can swap 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. So the 0 and 2 are not adjacent. So the 1 and 2 can be swapped. So in 1 0 2, we can swap the 1 and 2 (but they are not adjacent). Wait, the 1 is at position 0, 0 at position 1, 2 at position 2. So the 1 and 2 are separated by 0. So they can't be swapped directly. So in that case, the 2 can't move left past the 0. So the 0 and 2 can't cross each other unless there's a 1 in between. So in the case of \"012\", the 0 and 2 can't cross each other. Wait",
    "response": "To solve the problem of obtaining the lexicographically smallest ternary string under the given constraints, we need to carefully analyze which characters can be rearranged and how.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Allowed Swaps**:\n   - '0' and '1' can be swapped if they are adjacent.\n   - '1' and '2' can be swapped if they are adjacent.\n   - '0' and '2' **cannot** be directly swapped.\n\n2. **Implication of Swap Rules**:\n   - '0's can move freely among other '0's and '1's.\n   - '2's can move freely among other '2's and '1's.\n   - However, **'0's and '2's cannot pass each other**, unless there is at least one '1' between them to act as an intermediary.\n\n3. **Resulting Groupings**:\n   - The relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string is **not changeable**.\n   - But '1's can be moved freely between '0's and '2's.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\nGiven that the relative positions of '0's and '2's are fixed, we can:\n- Collect all the '0's and '2's in the order they appear.\n- Then, insert all the '1's in between them in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order.\n\nThis can be done efficiently by:\n1. Separating the string into groups of '0's and '2's with their relative order preserved.\n2. Inserting the '1's in the gaps between these groups (including before the first group and after the last group), sorted in ascending order (i.e., all '1's together).\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n\n1. Traverse the string and collect all '0's and '2's in order, preserving their original sequence.\n2. Count the number of '1's in the string.\n3. Insert all '1's in between the groups of '0's and '2's in the optimal position to minimize the final string.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # Separate 0s and 2s, preserving their order\n    fixed = []\n    ones_count = 0\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            ones_count += 1\n        else:\n            fixed.append(char)\n\n    # Insert all '1's in the best possible position\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(fixed):\n        result.append(fixed[i])\n        i += 1\n        if i < len(fixed) and fixed[i] == '2':\n            # Insert '1's before '2's if it helps\n            result.append('1' * ones_count)\n            ones_count = 0\n        elif i == len(fixed):\n            # Add any remaining '1's at the end\n            result.append('1' * ones_count)\n            ones_count = 0\n\n    # If there were '1's not added yet\n    if ones_count > 0:\n        result.append('1' * ones_count)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    for s in inputs:\n        print(min_ternary_string(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example:\n\n**Input:** `'100210'`  \n**Output:** `'001120'`\n\nExplanation:\n- The '0's and '2's are: ['1', '0', '0', '2', '0']\n- The '1's count is 1.\n- The best placement of '1' is between '0's and '2's.\n\nThis approach ensures the minimum lexicographical order by placing '1's optimally and respecting the constraints on swaps.",
