The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly is impossible. We need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Nikephoros uses sequence A, which repeats cyclically. Similarly for Polycarpus with B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find what move each makes, determine the winner, and count the losses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't loop through all rounds. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be calculated once and then multiplied.\n\nLet me think: The moves for each player repeat every len(A) and len(B) rounds respectively. So the combined cycle length would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k, where m is the length of A and k the length of B. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = L. So in each L rounds, the sequence of moves between the two players repeats. So if we can compute the number of losses for each player in one L rounds, then we can calculate how many full cycles there are in n rounds and multiply by that, then handle the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find L = LCM(m, k). Since m and k can be up to 1000, L could be up to 1e6 (since LCM(1000, 1000) is 1000). Wait, but 1000 and 1000's LCM is 1000, but for m=1000 and k=999, LCM would be 999000. But even so, 1e6 is manageable.\n\n2. For each of the L rounds, simulate the moves and count the number of times each player loses. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // L. The remaining rounds are rem = n % L.\n\n3. Multiply the counts from one cycle by total_cycles, then add the counts from the first 'rem' rounds of the next cycle.\n\nBut how do I compute the moves for each round?\n\nFor each round i (starting from 0?), the move of Nikephoros is A[i % m], and Polycarpus is B[i % k]. So for each of the L rounds (from 0 to L-1), we can compute their moves and check who wins.\n\nSo first, compute the LCM of m and k. Then, simulate for L rounds, compute for each round the outcome, and accumulate the counts of losses for each player.\n\nOnce we have the counts per L rounds, multiply by the number of full cycles. Then simulate the remaining rem rounds.\n\nBut how to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python's math module has gcd, but for Python 3.5 and above. Also, note that for Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n- Compute L = LCM(m, k).\n\n- Precompute for each of the L rounds, the moves of A and B, and count the number of times each loses in those L rounds. Let's call these total_a (number of times Nikephoros loses in L rounds) and total_b (number of times Polycarpus loses in L rounds).\n\n- Then, full_cycles = n // L.\n\n- The total for full_cycles is full_cycles * total_a and full_cycles * total_b.\n\n- Then, rem = n % L. For the remaining rem rounds, simulate each of them (from 0 to rem-1) and add the counts.\n\nSo the overall time complexity is O(L) for precomputing the per-cycle counts, and then O(rem) for the remainder. Since L can be up to 1e6 (if m and k are 1000 each, LCM is 1e6?), and rem is up to L-1, which is 1e6. So for n up to 2e9, this is manageable.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this.\n\nBut how to compute the per-round outcomes?\n\nFor each round index i (from 0 to L-1):\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen, determine who wins. For each pair (a, b), the outcome is:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nelse:\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a large number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player follows a cyclic strategy. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use an efficient approach leveraging the periodic nature of the strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Each player uses a sequence of moves that repeats cyclically. The key insight is that the combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their individual sequences.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This gives the length of the repeating cycle of move pairs.\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: Simulate one full cycle of moves to count the number of losses for each player within this cycle.\n4. **Full and Remaining Cycles**: Determine how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef count_losses_in_cycle(a_seq, b_seq, m, k, L):\n    a_loss = 0\n    b_loss = 0\n    for i in range(L):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine winner\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            b_loss += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            a_loss += 1\n    return a_loss, b_loss\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a_seq = input[1]\n    b_seq = input[2]\n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    L = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute losses in one L cycle\n    a_loss_cycle, b_loss_cycle = count_losses_in_cycle(a_seq, b_seq, m, k, L)\n    \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    rem = n % L\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * a_loss_cycle\n    total_b = full_cycles * b_loss_cycle\n    \n    # Process remaining rounds\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences of moves for each player.\n2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the length of the repeating cycle.\n3. **Loss Counting in One Cycle**: For each round within one cycle, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome is checked to count losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The number of full cycles and remaining rounds are calculated. The losses from full cycles are multiplied by the number of cycles, and the remaining rounds are processed individually to accumulate any additional losses.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the players' strategies, ensuring the solution is both optimal and correct.",
