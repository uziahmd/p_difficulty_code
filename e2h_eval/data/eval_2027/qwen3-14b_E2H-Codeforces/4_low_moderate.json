The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., loses a round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Nikephoros's moves are cyclic through his sequence A, and Polycarpus's through B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine which move each makes, then see who wins.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round one by one. So simulating each round directly is impossible. Need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, so that we can calculate the number of wins in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think: For each round, the move of Nikephoros is determined by A's sequence. Let's say the length of A is m, and B is k. Then, for round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's is B[i % k].\n\nSo for each round, we can compute the moves, check who wins, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't do this for each round. So we need to find the total number of rounds where Nikephoros loses, and same for Polycarpus.\n\nThe idea is to find the number of rounds in the entire n rounds where Nikephoros loses, and similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the possible cycles. Since the sequences A and B are periodic, the combination of their moves will have a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = T. So every T rounds, the pattern of moves between the two players repeats.\n\nSo if we can compute the number of wins for each player in one full cycle of T rounds, then multiply by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the results from the remaining rounds (n mod T), that would work.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute T = LCM(m, k). But since m and k can be up to 1000, their LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000 is 1e6). Which is manageable.\n\n2. For each of the T rounds, compute the moves of A and B, check who wins, and count how many times each player loses in this T-length cycle.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is q = n // T, and the remainder is r = n % T.\n\n4. The total losses for each player would be q * (number of losses in one cycle) + the number of losses in the first r rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut wait, for each round in the cycle, we need to know whether Nikephoros loses or not. So for each of the T rounds, we can precompute whether Nikephoros loses, and Polycarpus loses. Then, sum over all T rounds, and multiply by q, then add the sum of the first r rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each round in 0..T-1, what's the outcome (who loses, if any).\n\nBut how to compute T? Well, LCM(m, k) can be calculated as (m*k)/GCD(m, k). So I need to compute GCD first.\n\nSo first, compute m and k. Then compute GCD(m, k), then LCM.\n\nOnce T is known, for each of the T rounds, we can compute the moves for A and B.\n\nBut for each round i (from 0 to T-1), the move of A is A[i % m], and B's move is B[i % k].\n\nThen, for each such pair of moves, determine if there's a winner, and which one.\n\nSo for each of the T rounds, we can calculate the number of times Nikephoros loses (count_nik) and Polycarpus loses (count_poly) in that cycle.\n\nOnce we have these counts, the total for n rounds is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // T\n\nremainder_rounds = n % T\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * count_nik + count_nik_remainder (for the first remainder_rounds rounds)\n\nSimilarly for total_poly.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- Compute T.\n\n- For each of the T rounds, compute the outcome.\n\nBut for T up to 1e6, that's acceptable. Because even for m and k being 1000, their LCM is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over `n` rounds, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use a more efficient approach based on cycles and least common multiples (LCM).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cycles**: Each player's move sequence repeats cyclically. The combined cycle of both players' sequences is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: For each round within one full cycle (of length LCM), determine the outcome of each round and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate how many full cycles fit into `n` rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately. Multiply the loss counts from one cycle by the number of full cycles and add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    b_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    lcm = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute for each of the lcm rounds\n    nik_losses = 0\n    poly_losses = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Check who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            poly_losses += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nik_losses += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nik = full_cycles * nik_losses\n    total_poly = full_cycles * poly_losses\n    \n    # Now compute the remainder part\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The GCD function helps compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences, which determines the cycle length after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within one LCM cycle, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome of each round is evaluated to count losses.\n4. **Handling Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles is calculated, and the losses from these cycles are multiplied by the number of full cycles. The remaining rounds after the full cycles are processed separately to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
