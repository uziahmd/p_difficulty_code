            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, which could be Roman numerals. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the next line is the number c in base a. So the steps are: convert c from base a to decimal, then convert that decimal number to base b, which might be Roman.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Parse the input: read a and b (but check if b is 'R'), then read the number c as a string.\n\n2. Convert c from base a to decimal. For example, if c is '10' in base 2, that's 2 in decimal.\n\n3. Then, convert that decimal value to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as usual, using letters for digits above 9 (like A for 10, etc.)\n\nSo the main parts are:\n\n- Conversion from base a to decimal.\n- Conversion from decimal to base b (or Roman).\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFor converting c from base a to decimal: the input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, if c is '001' in base 2, that's 1 in decimal. So, process each character in the string, multiply by a^position and sum.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the digits? For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the input c is given as a string. Wait, the problem says that in the input, c is given as a string in base a, which may contain leading zeros. But the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the number is non-zero. Also, for other cases, the number is up to 1e15.\n\nSo for converting c to decimal, each character in the string represents a digit in base a. So for example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). But the input c is given as a string, so we need to parse each character as a digit in base a. So, for each character in c, we need to convert it to its numerical value. For example, 'A' would be 10, 'B' 11, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the input is not Roman, the number is up to 1e15. So for converting c to decimal, we need to process each digit. So for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, the first step is to process the string c into a decimal value. How to do that?\n\nWe can loop through each character in the string, and for each character, compute its value. For example, '0' is 0, '1' is 1, ..., '9' is 9, 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, up to whatever the base a allows. But since a can be up to 25, the maximum digit is 24, which would be represented as 'Y' (since 0-9 are digits, then A is 10, ..., Y is 24? Because 25 letters: 0-9 (10 digits) and A-P (16 letters?), no. Wait, for base 25, the digits are 0-24. So, for digits beyond 9, they are represented as letters. For example, 10 is A, 11 is B, ..., 35? No, wait. The problem says that for bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So for example, in base 16, digits go up to F (15). So for any base a, the digits are 0-9 followed by letters A, B, ... for values 10, 11, etc., up to a-1.\n\nSo, for converting the input string c to decimal, each character is converted to its corresponding value. So, for example, if the character is 'A', its value is 10. So, the code for converting the string to decimal would be something like:\n\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor char in c:\n    digit_value = int(char) if char.isdigit() else ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n    decimal_value = decimal_value * a + digit_value\n\nWait, but the input c could have letters in lowercase? Probably not.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, with the special case of converting to Roman numerals when the target base is 'R'. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to decimal, and then converting the decimal value to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a`. We need to convert this number to its decimal (base 10) equivalent. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its corresponding numerical value, and accumulating the result by multiplying the current total by the base and adding the new digit's value.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**: Once we have the decimal value, we need to convert it to the target base `b`. If `b` is 'R', we convert the decimal value to Roman numerals. Otherwise, we convert it to the specified base using standard digit representation (digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases greater than 10).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            digit = int(c)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef from_decimal(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, r) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += r\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        parts = line.strip().split('\\n')\n        first_line = parts[0].split()\n        a_str, b_str = first_line[0], first_line[1]\n        a = int(a_str)\n        c_str = parts[1]\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        \n        # Now convert decimal_val to base b or Roman\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            result = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n        else:\n            b = int(b_str)\n            result = from_decimal(decimal_val, b)\n        \n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **to_decimal Function**: Converts the input string from base `a` to a decimal integer. Each character in the string is converted to its numerical value, considering both digits and letters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **from_decimal Function**: Converts a decimal integer to the specified base `b`, using standard digit representation. For bases greater than 10, letters A-Z are used for digits 10 and above.\n3. **decimal_to_roman Function**: Converts a decimal integer to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating through these pairs to construct the Roman numeral string.\n4. **main Function**: Reads input, processes each line to convert the number from the given base to decimal, then converts the decimal value to the target base or Roman numerals as required, and prints the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion between different bases and Roman numerals, ensuring correctness and handling edge cases such as leading zeros and special Roman numeral rules.",
