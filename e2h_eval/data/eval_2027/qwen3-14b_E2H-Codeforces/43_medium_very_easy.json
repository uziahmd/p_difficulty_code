He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is: A has a string of only 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, maybe the count of 'c's equals both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the final string must have all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters must be all a's, followed by all b's, followed by all c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. Like, if there's a 'c' before a 'b', that's not possible.\n\nSo first check: the string should have a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the order must be correct. For example, the second example input is 'bbacc' which would have a 'b', then 'a's, which is invalid. So that's why the output is NO.\n\nSo first step: check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So the characters should be in order. How to check that? Well, we can check that all a's are before any b's, and all b's are before any c's. So for example, once a 'b' is encountered, there should be no 'a's after. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there should be no 'a's or 'b's after.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is in the correct order. If not, return NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then proceed to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts.\n\nLet's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\nAfter A and B's steps, the string has some a's and some b's. Then C adds c's equal to either the count of a's or the count of b's in that string (before adding the c's). So, when C adds the c's, the count of c's is either equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). But the original count_a and count_b are the counts before adding the c's. So, in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. But count_a_initial is the same as count_a in the final string (since no a's were added after the initial step). Similarly for count_b_initial. Wait, because after A and B's steps, the string is a's followed by b's. Then C adds c's. So the count of a's in the final string is same as the original count from A. Similarly for b's. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b in the final string. Because when C appends the c's, the count of a's and b's are already fixed.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nInitial string is all a's. Let's say count_a_initial = x. Then B appends some b's, say count_b_initial = y. Then C appends c's. The number of c's is either x or y. So in the final string, count_c is either x or y. So in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a (which is x) or count_b (which is y). Because count_a is x, count_b is y, and count_c is either x or y.\n\nSo for the final string, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the count of a's must be at least 1, count of b's must be at least 1. Because when B added the b's, he made sure that there is at least one a and one b. So in the final string, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nSo the steps for checking:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So, the order is correct.\n\n2. Check that count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\n3. Check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is all a's and c's? For example, suppose the string is 'aaaccc'. Then, according to the process, B must have added some b's. But in this case, there are no b's. So that's invalid. So the count_b must be at least 1. Similarly for count_a.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The string must be ordered as a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\n- count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\n- count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo, let's take the examples.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. So count_c is 3, which equals count_a (3). So yes. Also, the order is correct. So output YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the order is b, then a, which is invalid. So output NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → order is a's followed by b's followed by c's. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. count_c equals count_b. So yes.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → counts are a:2, b:2, c:1. Then count_c is 1, which is not equal to 2 or 2. So output NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abc' → counts are a:1, b:1, c:1. count_c is 1, which equals count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → but then there are no c's. So count_c is zero. Which is not equal to count_a (1) or count_b (1). So output NO. But according to the problem statement, C appends some number of c's. So the string must have at least one c? Because the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. So the string must have at least one c. Wait, but the problem says that the original string after A and B has at least one a and one b. Then C appends some number of c's. So the number of c's can be zero? No, because the problem says \"some number of letters 'c'\". But wait, the problem says \"some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So \"some number\" implies that it's at least one? Or could it be zero?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. However, the note says that the number of letters 'c' equals the number of 'a' or 'b' in the string. So, for example, if the number of 'a's is 0, but that's not possible because B ensures that there is at least one 'a' and 'b'.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nWhen B appends the 'b's, he makes sure that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the string after B's step has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some number of 'c's. The number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string (before adding the 'c's). So the number of 'c's is at least 1? Because the number of 'a's is at least 1 and the number of 'b's is at least 1. So when C appends, he must add exactly count_a or count_b. So the count_c in the final string must be equal to count_a (which is >=1) or count_b (>=1). Therefore, the count_c must be >=1.\n\nSo the final string must have at least one 'c'.\n\nSo in our code, we also need to check that count_c >=1. Because if the string has no 'c's, then it's invalid. Because C added some number of 'c's. So the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input string may have 'c's. But for example, if the input is 'ab', then the count_c is zero. Which would not satisfy the condition. So in that case, the answer is NO.\n\nSo adding that to the conditions:\n\ncount_c must be >=1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck that:\n\n1. The string is in the form a*b*c* (order is correct).\n\n2. count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n3. count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo, how to check the order?\n\nWe can check that the string is in order. For example, the string must not have any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b's after a 'c'.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be checked by iterating through each character and ensuring that once a 'b' is found, there are no 'a's after, and once a 'c' is found, there are no 'a's or 'b's after.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into three parts. For example, the first part is all 'a's, then the next part is all 'b's, then the next part is all 'c's. So the string can be divided into three sections. So, for example, the string can be checked by checking that the first occurrence of 'b' is after all 'a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' is after all 'b's.\n\nAnother way is to check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, for example, the string can be split into three parts. So, for example, the string can be split into a part with only 'a's, then only 'b's, then only 'c's.\n\nSo, how to implement that in Python?\n\nOne approach is to check that the string does not contain any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c' has been encountered. Similarly for 'b's after 'c's.\n\nLet me think of code for that.\n\nWe can iterate through the string and track the allowed characters. Initially, allowed are 'a's. Once a 'b' is encountered, allowed becomes 'b's and 'c's. Once a 'c' is encountered, allowed becomes 'c's.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nallowed = {'a'}\nfor char in S:\n    if char not in allowed:\n        return False\n    if char == 'b':\n        allowed = {'b', 'c'}\n    elif char == 'c':\n        allowed = {'c'}\n\nBut wait, this would allow 'b's and 'c's after a 'b' is found. But the 'c's can come after 'b's. So this logic seems correct.\n\nYes. So this code would check that the string is in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, the string can be split into three parts, and each part consists of only one character.\n\nAnother way: check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the order 'a' < 'b' < 'c'. Because, for example, 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So, if the string is in order, then each character is not less than the previous one. So, for example, 'aabbc' is okay, but 'abba' is not.\n\nBut this approach would work. So, for example, the string must be non-decreasing in terms of the order of 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to len(S)-1, check that S[i] >= S[i-1]. Because 'a' < 'b' < 'c', so the string must be in non-decreasing order.\n\nYes! That's a much simpler way. Because if the string is in non-decreasing order, then all a's come first, then b's, then c's. So that's a valid order. So, for example, the string 'aaabbbccc' is valid, and 'aabbcc' is valid. But 'abba' would have 'b' followed by 'a', which is invalid.\n\nSo, the code can check that the string is non-decreasing. So, for each character in the string, check that it is not less than the previous one.\n\nSo, for example, in Python:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n        return False\n\nSo that's a simple way to check the order.\n\nSo combining all these steps:\n\nFirst, check that the string is non-decreasing (in terms of 'a', 'b', 'c'). If not, return NO.\n\nThen, check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nThen, check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, return YES, else NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts a=3, b=1, c=3. Order is correct. All counts >=1. c is 3 equals a. So YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → the order is 'b', 'b', 'a', ... which is invalid. So returns NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is a, a, b, c. Correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. c equals b. So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=1. c equals a and b. So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. c is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → order is correct, but count_c is 0. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. c equals a and b. So YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abbccc' → a=1, b=2, c=3. c is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- Count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\n- Check that the string is non-decreasing.\n\n- Check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n- Check count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo, let's code this.\n\nIn Python, the steps are:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck if the string is non-decreasing.\n\nThen compute counts.\n\nCheck the counts.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef check_string(s):\n    # Check order\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    # Now check counts\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        return False\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the string is 'aabbcc'? Then count_c is 2, which equals count_a (2) and count_b (2). So returns True.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'abcc'? The order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=2. count_c is not equal to a or b. So returns false.\n\nSo, the code would return False.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. counts a=3, b=1, c=3. count_c equals a. So returns True. Output YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order is not correct. returns False. Output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. count_c equals count_b. returns True. Output YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → returns True. Output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → count_c is zero. returns False. Output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2, which equals a and b. returns True. YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abbccc' → count_c is 3, which is not equal to a (1) or b (2). returns False. NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → count_a=4, count_b=4, count_c=4. So count_c equals both a and b. returns True. YES.\n\nWhat about a string with only 'a's and 'c's, but no 'b's? Like 'aaaccc'. Then the code checks that count_b is zero → returns False. So output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead the input string from stdin. Then process as per the function above.\n\nBut the input is given as a list? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a string S. Wait, the sample input shows something like ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'] but that's probably for the example. The actual input is a single string. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line consists of a string S. So for example, in the sample input, perhaps the user input is 'aaabccc' and the output is 'YES'.\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of strings, but that's probably for the example of multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line consists of a string S. So the code must read a single string from input.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nOutput:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nBut that's probably for the example of multiple test cases, but the actual problem says that the input is a single string. Wait, but the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). So perhaps the input is a single string, and the output is a single 'YES' or 'NO'.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is a list of strings. But that's probably a formatting error. For example, in programming competition problems, the input is usually a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list for the example, but in reality, the code should read a single line.\n\nSo, for example, the sample input for the first example is 'aaabccc', and the output is 'YES'.\n\nSo, the code should read a single line from input, process it, and output 'YES' or 'NO'.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen perform the checks.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead the string, check the order, then the counts.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n    # Check order\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    # Check counts\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        return False\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nif is_valid(s):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'abba'? The order check would fail, since the third character is 'b' which is less than the previous 'a' (no, wait, the string is 'abba' — the first two characters are 'a' and 'b', then the third is 'b' (same as previous), then fourth is 'a' which is less than 'b'. So in the loop, i=3 (fourth character) would compare 'a' with previous 'b' — which is less. So returns false.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → order is correct. counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → counts c is 1. count_a=2, count_b=2. So c is not equal to either. returns false.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'a'? Then, count_b is zero, count_c is zero. So returns false. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. So returns true.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → the code returns YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order check fails (the third character is 'a', which is less than previous 'b'). So returns NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. c equals b. returns YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in a particular order.
