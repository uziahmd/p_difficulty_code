He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine for each given string whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string. The input gives me 2n-2 strings, which are all the improper prefixes and suffixes of some string s of length n. My job is to assign each of these strings as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there's at least one possible s that fits.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the original string s could be. Because once I know s, I can check each input string to see if it's a prefix or suffix of s, then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do I find s? Well, the original string s must have all the given strings as its prefixes or suffixes. So, the key is to find a candidate s that matches all the given strings as prefixes and suffixes.\n\nLet me think: For example, the longest prefix is of length n-1. Similarly, the longest suffix is of length n-1. But since the input has two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, perhaps the original string s can be determined by looking for the longest possible candidates.\n\nWait, here's an idea. The original string s must have a unique prefix of length n-1 and a unique suffix of length n-1. However, the input includes both of them. So, among the input strings, there are two strings of length n-1. One of them is the prefix of s, and the other is the suffix. But how can I find which one is which?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s is determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the correct s would be such that the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) overlap correctly. For example, if the longest prefix is \"abab\" (for n=5), and the longest suffix is \"baba\", then the original string s would be \"ababa\".\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Find all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them. Let's call them L1 and L2. One of them is the prefix of s, the other is the suffix. So, the original s must be such that it starts with L1 and ends with L2, or starts with L2 and ends with L1. But how do I know which is which?\n\nBut wait, the original s must have both L1 and L2 as either prefixes or suffixes. So, if I take one of them as the prefix (say, L1), then the original s would be L1 plus one character. Similarly, if L2 is the suffix, then the original s would be something plus L2. But since the original s is of length n, then the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n].\n\nSo, for example, if the original s is \"ababa\", then the prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". So, combining those two, the original string is the prefix (length n-1) plus the last character of the suffix (which is the same as the last character of the original string). Wait, but how can I find s from the two strings of length n-1?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have two candidates for the longest prefix and suffix. Let's say I have two strings of length n-1: A and B. Then, the original s must be such that A is a prefix of s, and B is a suffix of s. Or vice versa.\n\nSo, if A is the prefix, then s is A + c, where c is the last character. But B is a suffix of s. So, the suffix of length n-1 of s is B. Which means that s[1:] = B. Since s is A + c, then s[1:] is A[1:] + c. Therefore, A[1:] + c must equal B. So, c must be B[-1], and A[1:] must be B[:-1]. Therefore, the original string s would be A + B[-1], and also B must be equal to A[1:] + B[-1].\n\nSo, for example, if A is \"abab\" (length 4) and B is \"baba\", then A[1:] is \"bab\", and B[:-1] is \"bab\", so yes. Then, the original s is A + B[-1] = \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\".\n\nSimilarly, if we try the other way around, taking B as the prefix and A as the suffix, then B's suffix would be A. Let's see: B is the prefix, so s = B + d. Then, the suffix of length n-1 is A, which is s[1:] = B[1:] + d. So B[1:] + d must equal A. So, d is A[-1], and B[1:] is A[:-1]. For example, if B is \"baba\" and A is \"abab\", then B[1:] is \"aba\", A[:-1] is \"aba\", so yes. Then s is \"baba\" + \"b\" = \"babab\". But then, the original s would be \"babab\", which would have prefixes and suffixes that include \"baba\" (prefix of length 4) and \"abab\" (suffix of length 4). But in that case, the original s would be \"babab\".\n\nBut how do I know which of the two possibilities is correct? Because there might be multiple possibilities, but the problem says that the answer is acceptable as long as there exists at least one possible s.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n- Try both possibilities: candidate1 is the prefix, candidate2 is the suffix. Check if they can form a valid s. Also try candidate2 as prefix and candidate1 as suffix.\n\nFor each possibility, check if the resulting s is consistent with all the given strings being prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nOnce we find a valid s, then we can assign P and S to each input string based on whether they are a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read all input strings.\n\n2. Find the two strings of length n-1.\n\n3. For each of the two possibilities (which is prefix and which is suffix), generate the possible s.\n\n   For example, if the prefix is A (length n-1), and the suffix is B (length n-1), then s must be A + B[-1], because the suffix of s of length n-1 is B. So, s[1:] = B. Since s is A + [last_char], then s[1:] is A[1:] + [last_char] = B. So, A[1:] must be B[:-1], and last_char is B[-1]. Therefore, the s is A + B[-1].\n\n   Similarly, if B is the prefix and A is the suffix, then s would be B + A[-1], and we need to check if B[1:] equals A[:-1].\n\n   If either of these possibilities is valid (i.e., the generated s has the required properties), then proceed.\n\n4. Once we have a valid s, we can check all the input strings to see if they are prefixes or suffixes of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do I check if the generated s is valid? Because the input strings may contain other prefixes and suffixes. For example, if I generate s, then all the input strings must be either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there exists at least one s. So, once I generate a candidate s, I can check whether all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of s. If that's the case, then that's the s we need.\n\nBut how to generate the candidate s? Let's take the two length n-1 strings. Let's call them a and b.\n\nCheck if a[1:] == b[:-1]. If so, then the s is a + b[-1]. Also check if b[1:] == a[:-1], then s is b + a[-1].\n\nIf either of these is possible, then proceed.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings into a list.\n\nCollect all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them. Let's call them l1 and l2.\n\nNow, check for possible s:\n\nCase 1: s_candidate = l1 + l2[-1]. Check if l2 is a suffix of s_candidate. Because the suffix of length n-1 of s_candidate is s_candidate[1:], which should be l2. Let's see:\n\ns_candidate is l1 + l2[-1], which has length (n-1) + 1 = n. The suffix of length n-1 is s_candidate[1:] which is l1[1:] + l2[-1]. But according to the condition, this must be equal to l2. So, l1[1:] + l2[-1] must equal l2. Which implies that l1[1:] is l2[:-1], and l2[-1] is l2[-1], which is true.\n\nSo, if l1[1:] == l2[:-1], then this candidate s_candidate is valid.\n\nSimilarly for case 2: s_candidate = l2 + l1[-1], check if l1 is a suffix of s_candidate. Which would require l2[1:] == l1[:-1].\n\nOnce we find a valid s_candidate, then we can check all input strings to see if they are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate. Then, assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how do I know which of the two cases is correct? For example, there could be two possibilities. However, the problem allows any valid answer. So, once I find a valid s_candidate, I can proceed.\n\nOnce the s_candidate is determined, then for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (then assign P) or a suffix (assign S). However, note that some strings could be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the second sample input, the string is \"aaa\", so all the input strings are prefixes and suffixes. But in that case, the problem says that any assignment is acceptable as long as the count of P and S is correct.\n\nSo, for each input string, we need to determine whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. But how to decide which one to assign? Because the problem says that the answer is acceptable as long as there exists at least one s that is consistent with the assignments. So, for each input string, if it is both a prefix and a suffix, we can choose either P or S. However, the problem requires that the number of P and S is equal. Since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, the total number of P and S in the output must be n-1 each. So, for each input string, we need to assign it to P or S, ensuring that the counts are correct.\n\nBut once we have a valid s_candidate, the correct way is to assign each input string as P if it is a prefix of s_candidate, else S if it is a suffix. However, some strings may be both. But in that case, we can choose either, but need to make sure that the total number of P and S is correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. So, for each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix. However, it's possible that a string is both. For example, in the case where s_candidate is \"aaa\", then all input strings are prefixes and suffixes. But in that case, when assigning, we need to make sure that exactly n-1 are assigned as P and the rest as S.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, suppose that for a given s_candidate, there are some strings that are both prefix and suffix. How do we assign them?\n\nWell, the problem says that the answer is acceptable as long as there exists at least one possible s. So, once we have a correct s_candidate, we can assign each string as P if it is a prefix, else S. But if a string is both, then we can assign it as either. However, the counts must be correct. Because the total number of P must be exactly n-1, and same for S.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Because for example, if there are some strings that are both, then choosing to assign them as P or S could affect the counts.\n\nBut perhaps in the case where the input is generated from a valid s_candidate, the number of strings that are prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) is exactly n-1, and same for suffixes. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the sample input where s is \"aaa\", the input strings are \"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\", \"a\". The prefixes of length 1, 2, 3 (but since n=3, the prefixes are of lengths 1 and 2. The suffixes are same. So for each of the input strings, they are both prefixes and suffixes. So, when assigning, we have to choose exactly n-1 (2) as P and 2 as S. But how?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, for the given input, there exists at least one s. Once we find that s, the input strings are all prefixes or suffixes of s. So, for each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix. But in some cases, it can be both. However, the problem allows us to choose any assignment as long as the counts are correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign it as P. Else, assign as S. However, if it's both, then we can assign it as P or S. But how to make sure that the total counts are correct?\n\nBut wait, the total number of prefixes of s_candidate (of lengths 1 to n-1) is exactly n-1. Similarly for suffixes. However, some strings may be both prefixes and suffixes. So, when you count all the input strings, each of them is either a prefix or a suffix. But the problem says that the input is exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes. So, the input contains exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. However, some of them may be overlapping.\n\nBut when you process the input strings, for each string, it must be a prefix or a suffix. So, for the s_candidate, the input strings are exactly the union of the prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, for each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix. However, if a string is both, then it's counted in both the prefix and suffix lists. But the input has exactly two strings for each length. For example, for length 1, there are two strings. But in the case of \"aaa\", each of the length 1 strings is a prefix and a suffix. So, the input has two strings of length 1, which are both prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how to assign them to P or S? Because in that case, the total number of P must be n-1, and S must be n-1. So, if a string is both, then choosing to assign it as P or S will affect the counts. So, how to handle that?\n\nBut perhaps the way to do it is to first count all the input strings that are strictly prefixes (i.e., not suffixes), and then assign them as P, and the rest as S. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach: For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, then assign it as P. If not, assign as S. However, this may not work if a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of \"aaa\", the string \"a\" is a prefix and a suffix. Assigning it as P would count towards the prefix count, but the same string could be assigned as S. However, the problem requires that the number of P and S is exactly n-1 each.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so for the correct s_candidate, the input strings are exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes. So, the number of input strings that are prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) is exactly n-1. Similarly for suffixes. However, some of them may be counted in both.\n\nTherefore, the approach of assigning each string as P if it is a prefix, else S, will result in exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. Because for each input string, it is either a prefix or a suffix. But if a string is both, then it's counted in both. However, the input has exactly 2n-2 strings, which is the sum of the number of prefixes (n-1) and suffixes (n-1), but with overlaps. So, the total number of unique strings is less than 2n-2. But the problem says that the input contains exactly 2n-2 strings. So, for example, in the case where all the prefixes and suffixes are the same, but there are duplicates. But the input is given as exactly 2n-2 strings, which includes duplicates.\n\nBut regardless, for the correct s_candidate, the input strings are exactly the union of all prefixes and suffixes. So, for each input string, it is a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. Therefore, if we assign all input strings that are prefixes as P, and others as S, then the count of P's would be exactly the number of prefixes in the input. But since the input includes all prefixes and suffixes, the count of P's would be exactly n-1, and the same for S's. But how?\n\nWait, the input has exactly 2n-2 strings. Each of these is a prefix or a suffix. The total number of prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) is n-1. The same for suffixes. So, the total number of input strings that are prefixes is n-1, and the same for suffixes. However, some strings are counted in both. So, the number of input strings that are prefixes is n-1, and the same for suffixes. So, when we assign each input string as P if it is a prefix, else S, then the number of P's would be exactly n-1. Because the input strings are exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, the count of P's would be exactly n-1.\n\nBut how can that be? Because for example, in the case of \"aaa\", the input strings for n=3 are \"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\", \"a\". So, the prefixes are \"a\" (length 1), \"aa\" (length 2). The suffixes are \"a\" (length 1), \"aa\" (length 2). So, the input strings are the four strings. So, when processing, each of the input strings is a prefix or a suffix. So, for each input string, if we assign P if it is a prefix, then the count of P's would be 2 (since there are two prefixes). However, the input has four strings, so the count of P's would be 2 (each of the prefixes), and the rest (two) would be assigned as S. Which gives 2 P and 2 S, which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. This will give exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\nBut how to check if a string is a prefix of s_candidate? Well, for a given input string, check if s_candidate starts with that string. Similarly for suffix.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign 'P'; else, assign 'S'.\n\nBut how to find s_candidate?\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 strings into a list.\n\nCollect the two strings of length n-1.\n\nTry the two possibilities for generating s_candidate:\n\nOption 1: Take the first string (l1) as the prefix of length n-1, and the second (l2) as the suffix of length n-1. Check if l1[1:] == l2[:-1]. If yes, then s_candidate is l1 + l2[-1].\n\nOption 2: Take l2 as the prefix, l1 as the suffix. Check if l2[1:] == l1[:-1]. If yes, then s_candidate is l2 + l1[-1].\n\nOnce we find a valid s_candidate (either option 1 or 2), proceed to assign P/S.\n\nBut how to find which of the two options is correct? Because there could be cases where both options are valid, leading to different s_candidate. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so at least one of the options will be valid.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can check both possibilities and choose the first valid one.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nstrings = list of input strings.\n\nn_minus_1_strings = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\nl1, l2 = n_minus_1_strings[0], n_minus_1_strings[1]\n\nThen check:\n\nif l1[1:] == l2[:-1]:\n\n    s_candidate = l1 + l2[-1]\n\nelse:\n\n    check if l2[1:] == l1[:-1]\n\n    if yes, then s_candidate = l2 + l1[-1]\n\nBut wait, what if both options are valid? For example, if l1 and l2 are such that both options produce valid s_candidates. For example, if l1 is \"ab\" and l2 is \"ba\", then l1[1:] is \"b\", l2[:-1] is \"b\", so s_candidate would be \"ab\" + \"a\" = \"aba\". Also, l2[1:] is \"a\", l1[:-1] is \"a\", so s_candidate is \"ba\" + \"b\" = \"bab\". Both are possible. Which one to choose?\n\nIn this case, the problem says that any valid answer is acceptable. So, we can choose either.\n\nBut in code, we can check both possibilities. However, perhaps in practice, only one of them will lead to a valid s_candidate. But how to check which one is correct?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there must be at least one s_candidate that works. So, in code, perhaps we can try the first possibility, and if it fails, try the second.\n\nWait, but how to check if the generated s_candidate is valid? Because even if the two length n-1 strings are compatible (like l1[1:] == l2[:-1]), the other input strings may not be prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so once we generate s_candidate, it must be valid.\n\nBut why? Because the input is given as the set of all prefixes and suffixes of some s. So, the two length n-1 strings must be the prefix and suffix of that s. Therefore, generating s_candidate as per the above method would produce that s. Thus, all the input strings must be prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\nSo, in code, once we generate the s_candidate, we can proceed to assign P and S as described.\n\nBut what if the two length n-1 strings are not compatible? For example, if neither l1[1:] == l2[:-1] nor l2[1:] == l1[:-1]? But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so that can't happen. Because for the original s, the two length n-1 strings are the prefix and the suffix. So, for example, if the original s is of length n, then the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1], and the suffix is s[1:n]. So, the prefix[1:] is s[1:n-1], and the suffix[:-1] is s[1:n-1]. Therefore, prefix[1:] == suffix[:-1]. Therefore, the two length n-1 strings must be compatible. Hence, in the input, the two length n-1 strings must satisfy either l1[1:] == l2[:-1] or l2[1:] == l1[:-1].\n\nTherefore, in code, one of the two possibilities must be valid.\n\nOnce we have the s_candidate, then for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign 'P', else 'S'.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings.\n\nFind the two strings of length n-1.\n\nCheck if the first is compatible with the second as prefix and suffix. If yes, generate s_candidate.\n\nElse, generate using the other way.\n\nOnce s_candidate is generated, loop through all the input strings and for each, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign 'P', else 'S'.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input? The first line is n. Then, the next 2n-2 lines are the strings.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nWhich is 5 followed by 8 strings (since 2*5-2=8).\n\nBut the code needs to read n, then read 2n-2 lines.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read 2n-2 lines.\n\nThen collect the two strings of length n-1.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, in code:\n\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2*n - 2)]\n\nn_minus_1 = n-1\n\ncandidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n_minus_1]\n\nl1, l2 = candidates[0], candidates[1]\n\nWait, but what if the two candidates are in different order? For example, in the first sample input, the two length 4 strings are 'abab' and 'baba'. But in the input, they may appear in any order. However, in code, the code would take the first two as l1 and l2, but perhaps the correct way is to check both possibilities.\n\nWait, but in code, the code may have l1 and l2 in any order. For example, in the first sample input, the two length 4 strings are 'abab' and 'baba'. Let's see:\n\nl1 is 'abab', l2 is 'baba'.\n\nCheck if l1[1:] == l2[:-1]. l1[1:] is 'bab', l2[:-1] is 'bab' (since l2 is 'baba', length 4, so l2[:-1] is 'bab'). So yes. So s_candidate is l1 + l2[-1] = 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut if the code had l1 as 'baba' and l2 as 'abab', then checking l1[1:] is 'aba', and l2[:-1] is 'aba' (since l2 is 'abab', length 4, so l2[:-1] is 'aba'). So, in that case, the code would generate s_candidate as 'baba' + 'b' = 'babab'.\n\nBut which one is correct? Well, the original string in the first sample is 'ababa'. So, the code would generate the correct s_candidate if the first two candidates are ordered correctly. But if they are in reverse order, the code may generate a different s_candidate. However, the problem says that any valid answer is acceptable. So, if the code generates 'babab' as s_candidate, then the input strings must be compatible with that. But in the first sample input, the input strings are:\n\n['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n\nSo, for s_candidate 'babab', let's check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes.\n\nThe prefixes of 'babab' are:\n\nlength 1: 'b'\n\nlength 2: 'ba'\n\nlength 3: 'bab'\n\nlength 4: 'baba'\n\nThe suffixes are:\n\nlength 1: 'b'\n\nlength 2: 'ab'\n\nlength 3: 'bab'\n\nlength 4: 'abab'\n\nSo, the input strings are:\n\n'ba' (prefix of length 2)\n\n'a' (not a prefix or suffix of 'babab'? Wait, the prefixes are 'b', 'ba', 'bab', 'baba'. The suffixes are 'b', 'ab', 'bab', 'abab'. So, the input strings include 'a' which is not present. But according to the first sample input, the input is supposed to be the prefixes and suffixes of 'ababa', which is the correct s_candidate. But in this case, if the code generated 'babab', then the input strings would not be compatible. Which suggests that the code's logic is wrong.\n\nWait, this indicates a problem. Because if the code chooses the wrong order for l1 and l2, then the generated s_candidate may not be compatible with the input strings.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, the code must find the correct s_candidate. But how?\n\nAh, here's the mistake. The code's current approach of taking the first two candidates as l1 and l2 may not be correct. Because the two candidates may be in any order. For example, in the first sample input, the two length 4 strings are 'abab' and 'baba'. The code may pick them in any order, but only one of the possibilities will lead to a valid s_candidate. So, how can the code ensure that it picks the correct one?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, for the correct s_candidate, the two length n-1 strings must be the prefix and suffix of s_candidate. Therefore, in the code, when trying to generate the s_candidate, the code must check if the generated s_candidate is compatible with all input strings. But how?\n\nBecause, if the code generates a s_candidate based on the two length n-1 strings, but that s_candidate is not compatible with other input strings, then that would be a problem. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there exists at least one correct s_candidate. But the code's current approach may generate an incorrect s_candidate if the two length n-1 strings are taken in the wrong order.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should try both possibilities and check which one is valid. For example, generate both possible s_candidate (based on the two possible combinations of the two length n-1 strings), and for each, check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of it. Once a valid s_candidate is found, proceed.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFor example, generate s_candidate1 = l1 + l2[-1], and check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate1.\n\nIf yes, then proceed.\n\nElse, try s_candidate2 = l2 + l1[-1], and check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate2.\n\nBut how to check this?\n\nIn code, for a given s_candidate, iterate over all input strings, and for each, check if it is a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, at least one of the two possibilities must be valid.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\nGenerate both possible s_candidate (based on the two possibilities for the two length n-1 strings), and for each, check whether all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of it. Once a valid one is found, proceed.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nIn code:\n\ndef is_valid(s_candidate, input_strings):\n\n    for s in input_strings:\n\n        if not (s == s_candidate[:len(s)] or s == s_candidate[-len(s):]):\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nThen, for the two possible s_candidate, check if they are valid.\n\nOnce found, proceed.\n\nBut in the first sample input, if the code tries the wrong s_candidate, it would fail the check.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead all input strings into a list.\n\nCollect the two length n-1 strings.\n\nGenerate possible s_candidate1 and s_candidate2.\n\nCheck which one is valid.\n\nOnce found, proceed.\n\nBut how to generate s_candidate1 and s_candidate2?\n\nFor example, for the two length n-1 strings, l1 and l2:\n\ns_candidate1 = l1 + l2[-1] if l1[1:] == l2[:-1]\n\ns_candidate2 = l2 + l1[-1] if l2[1:] == l1[:-1]\n\nBut how to generate both possibilities?\n\nActually, the code can try both possibilities, even if the conditions are not met, and check if the generated s_candidate is valid.\n\nWait, no. Because the code can generate s_candidate1 as l1 + l2[-1], regardless of whether l1[1:] == l2[:-1]. Then, check if it is valid.\n\nBut in reality, the generated s_candidate1 may not be valid. However, the problem says that the input is valid, so at least one of the two possibilities will be valid.\n\nSo, the code can generate both possibilities and check which one is valid.\n\nBut how to generate both possibilities?\n\nFor example:\n\ncandidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\nl1, l2 = candidates[0], candidates[1]\n\npossible_s = []\n\n# try l1 as prefix, l2 as suffix\n\ns_candidate = l1 + l2[-1]\n\npossible_s.append(s_candidate)\n\n# try l2 as prefix, l1 as suffix\n\ns_candidate = l2 + l1[-1]\n\npossible_s.append(s_candidate)\n\nThen, for each s_candidate in possible_s:\n\ncheck if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of it.\n\nOnce found, use that s_candidate.\n\nBut how to check if the generated s_candidate is valid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor s_candidate in possible_s:\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for s in strings:\n\n        if not (s == s_candidate[:len(s)] or s == s_candidate[-len(s):]):\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if valid:\n\n        break\n\nOnce found, proceed.\n\nBut this is O(2*(2n-2)*n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 100.\n\nOnce the correct s_candidate is found, then proceed to assign P and S.\n\nSo, this approach ensures that the correct s_candidate is found.\n\nThus, the code can be structured as follows.\n\nNow, let's test this approach on the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=5\n\nstrings: ['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n\nThe two length 4 strings are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\npossible_s is:\n\ns_candidate1 = 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'\n\ns_candidate2 = 'baba' + 'b' = 'babab'\n\nCheck for s_candidate1:\n\nCheck all input strings:\n\nFor example, 'ba' is a prefix of 'ababa'? Let's see:\n\ns_candidate1 is 'ababa'.\n\nCheck 'ba' is a prefix? No, the first two characters are 'ab'.\n\nBut 'ba' is a suffix of 'ababa'? The last two characters are 'ba' (positions 3-4: 'ba'). Yes. So 'ba' is a suffix.\n\nSimilarly, check 'a' is a prefix (yes, first character is 'a') or suffix (last character is 'a').\n\nSo, all input strings would be prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate1. Hence, it is valid.\n\nFor s_candidate2 'babab':\n\nCheck 'ba' is a prefix? Yes, first two characters are 'ba'.\n\nCheck 'a' is a prefix? No. Is it a suffix? The last character is 'b', so no. So, 'a' is neither prefix nor suffix. Hence, the check would fail, so s_candidate2 is invalid. Hence, the code selects s_candidate1.\n\nThus, the code would proceed with s_candidate1.\n\nOnce that is done, assign P/S based on whether the input string is a prefix of s_candidate.\n\nFor example, for each input string:\n\nFor 'ba' (length 2): is it a prefix of 'ababa'? No. Is it a suffix? Yes. So assign 'S'.\n\nFor 'a' (length 1): prefix (yes) → 'P'.\n\nFor 'abab' (length 4): prefix of 'ababa'? Yes (first 4 chars are 'abab') → 'P'.\n\nFor 'a' again: same as before → 'P'.\n\nFor 'aba' (length 3): prefix of 'ababa'? Yes → 'P'.\n\nFor 'baba' (length 4): is it a prefix? No. Is it a suffix? 'ababa' has suffix of length 4 as 'baba' → yes → 'S'.\n\nFor 'ab' (length 2): prefix of 'ababa' → 'ab' → yes → 'P'.\n\nFor 'aba' (length 3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to classify each input string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S').\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix Candidates**: The longest improper prefixes and suffixes of `s` are of length `n-1`. There are exactly two such strings in the input.\n2. **Generate Candidate Strings**: Using these two longest candidates, generate two possible strings for `s` by combining the prefix and suffix appropriately.\n3. **Validate Candidate String**: Check which of the generated candidate strings is valid by ensuring all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n4. **Classify Input Strings**: Once a valid candidate string is found, classify each input string as a prefix or suffix based on the valid candidate string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\n# Find the two strings of length n-1\nn_minus_1 = n - 1\ncandidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n_minus_1]\nl1, l2 = candidates[0], candidates[1]\n\npossible_s = []\n# Try l1 as prefix and l2 as suffix\ns_candidate1 = l1 + l2[-1]\npossible_s.append(s_candidate1)\n# Try l2 as prefix and l1 as suffix\ns_candidate2 = l2 + l1[-1]\npossible_s.append(s_candidate2)\n\nvalid_s = None\nfor s_candidate in possible_s:\n    valid = True\n    for s in strings:\n        len_s = len(s)\n        if s != s_candidate[:len_s] and s != s_candidate[-len_s:]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if valid:\n        valid_s = s_candidate\n        break\n\n# Now assign P/S based on valid_s\nresult = []\nfor s in strings:\n    len_s = len(s)\n    if s == valid_s[:len_s]:\n        result.append('P')\n    else:\n        result.append('S')\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list. The first value is the length `n` of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Finding Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential longest prefixes and suffixes.\n3. **Generating Candidates for `s`**: Two potential strings for `s` are generated by combining the two longest candidates in both possible ways.\n4. **Validation**: Each candidate string is checked against all input strings to ensure they are valid (i.e., all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of the candidate).\n5. **Classification**: Once a valid candidate string is found, each input string is classified as a prefix ('P') or suffix ('S') based on whether it matches the corresponding part of the valid candidate string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct classification of each input string while adhering to the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.",
