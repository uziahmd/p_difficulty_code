He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's corresponding to each input string.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the original string s must have all these given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. But since we don't know s, we need to figure out which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes such that there exists at least one possible s that fits.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For example, the original string s has exactly n characters. All the given strings are improper prefixes or suffixes, meaning their lengths are from 1 to n-1.\n\nFirst, the longest prefix and the longest suffix. Wait, the original string's prefix of length n-1 is a string of length n-1. Similarly for the suffix. So among the given strings, there are two of length n-1. One of them must be the prefix of length n-1, and the other must be the suffix of length n-1. Wait, no. Because the original string's prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So these two are different. So for the given input, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the prefix of length n-1, and the other must be the suffix of length n-1. But how do I know which is which?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to find the original string. Because the original string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and suffix. For example, if we take the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1), then the original string s must be such that the prefix is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first character of the prefix is s[0], and the last character of the suffix is s[n-1]. But also, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must overlap in the middle. So the original string s can be found by taking the prefix of length n-1 and appending the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Or alternatively, taking the suffix of length n-1 and prepending the first character of the prefix of length n-1. Wait, but how do I know which one is the correct combination?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the original string is 'ababa' (as in the first example). The prefix of length 4 is 'abab', and the suffix of length 4 is 'baba'. Then the original string is the prefix plus the last character of the suffix. 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'. Alternatively, the suffix is 'baba' and the first character of the prefix is 'a' (from 'abab'), so adding that to the front of the suffix gives 'a' + 'baba' = 'ababa' as well. So, the original string can be determined by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix.\n\nBut how do I know which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix? Well, perhaps the correct way is to check for each pair of the two length n-1 strings, whether combining them as described gives a string that is consistent with all the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSo here's an idea: For the given list of strings, find all the ones of length n-1. There are exactly two of them. Let's call them A and B. Then, for each possible assignment (A is prefix, B is suffix; or B is prefix, A is suffix), try to reconstruct the original string s. For example, if A is the prefix of length n-1, then s would be A + (last character of B). Because B is the suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1], so the last character of B is s[n-1]. So the original string s would be A (which is s[0..n-2]) concatenated with the last character of B (s[n-1]).\n\nOnce we have s, we can check if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. If that's the case, then we can proceed to assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we check which of the two possibilities (A as prefix and B as suffix, or vice versa) is valid?\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each possible pair (A, B), where A and B are the two strings of length n-1:\n\n   a. Assume that A is the prefix of length n-1, and B is the suffix of length n-1. Then construct s_candidate = A + (B[-1]).\n\n   b. Check if B is indeed a suffix of s_candidate. Because B is supposed to be the suffix of length n-1, which is s_candidate[1:].\n\n   c. Also, check that the other strings in the input are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n   d. If this holds, then proceed to assign the P/S labels accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, for the other possibility, where B is the prefix and A is the suffix. Then s_candidate would be B + (A[-1]).\n\nBut how do we know which of these possibilities is valid?\n\nOnce we find a valid s_candidate, we can then check all the given strings to see which are prefixes and which are suffixes of s_candidate. Then assign P/S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we handle cases where there are multiple possible candidates? Well, the problem says that any valid assignment is acceptable as long as there exists at least one possible s. So once we find one valid s_candidate, we can proceed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the two strings of length n-1.\n\n- Try both possibilities (A as prefix, B as suffix and vice versa) to generate candidate s_candidate.\n\n- For each candidate, check if all the given strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\n- Once a valid s_candidate is found, then for each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate, and assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to check if a given string is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate? For example, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with that string) or a suffix (ends with it). But note that the input strings may be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the second example, the input is for n=3, and the strings are a, aa, aa, a. The original string is aaa. The string 'a' is both a prefix and suffix. However, in the problem statement, the input has exactly two strings of each length. So for each input string, it's possible that it's both a prefix and suffix. But according to the problem, we have to assign it as either P or S. But since the problem allows any valid assignment as long as there exists at least one s that satisfies it, we can choose either.\n\nBut when generating the answer, for each input string, we need to decide whether it's a prefix or suffix of the candidate s_candidate. However, some input strings may be both. How to handle that?\n\nIn that case, the answer can choose either P or S. But how to make sure that the counts of P and S are equal? Because there are exactly n-1 prefixes (each length 1 to n-1) and same for suffixes. So total of 2n-2 strings. The output must have exactly n-1 P's and S's each.\n\nBut when building the answer, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix (and not a suffix) or vice versa, but if it's both, we can choose either. However, the problem says that the answer is acceptable if there exists at least one s that matches. So, for example, if the input string is both a prefix and suffix, but in the actual s, it's a prefix and suffix, then we can assign it as either P or S. However, we have to make sure that the total number of P and S is equal. But since the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution, perhaps the way to assign is to first assign all the prefixes, then the suffixes, but that's not straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps once we have the candidate s_candidate, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, then assign P, else assign S. However, that might not work if a string is both a prefix and a suffix. But in that case, we can choose either. However, how to ensure that the count of P and S is correct?\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution. So, for the candidate s_candidate, the given input strings are exactly the set of all proper prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate. So for each input string, it is either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. So, for each input string, it's possible that it is a prefix or suffix. But for the purpose of generating the answer, we need to assign each input string as P or S, such that the total number of P's is n-1 and S's is n-1.\n\nBut how to do that? Well, the candidate s_candidate will have exactly n-1 prefixes (for each length 1..n-1) and n-1 suffixes (same). But the input has exactly two strings for each length. So for each length, one of the two strings is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, but for each length l (1 ≤ l ≤ n-1), there are exactly two strings. One is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Because for the original string, there's exactly one prefix of length l and exactly one suffix of length l. But the input has two strings of each length. So for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nTherefore, for the candidate s_candidate, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings of that length is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Therefore, when processing each input string, for each length, we can check which of the two is a prefix and which is a suffix.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, this may not work if a string is both a prefix and a suffix. But in that case, the problem allows us to assign either. However, since the input is guaranteed to have a solution, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix. But if a string is both, then we can choose either. However, the code needs to assign exactly one of P or S for each input string.\n\nBut how to ensure that for each length, exactly one of the two strings is assigned as P and the other as S. Because for each length l, there's exactly one prefix and one suffix. So for the two strings of length l, one must be a prefix, the other a suffix.\n\nSo, for example, if for a certain length l, both strings are prefixes (but that's impossible because the original string has only one prefix of length l). But according to the input, the given strings are all prefixes and suffixes of some string. So for the candidate s_candidate, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix. So for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nThus, when checking for each input string, if it's a prefix, assign P, else assign S. However, for the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, how to decide? For example, the string \"a\" for the string \"aaa\" (n=3). The string \"a\" is a prefix of length 1 and a suffix of length 1. But in the input, there are two strings of length 1 (like \"a\" and \"a\"). So for those two, one must be assigned as P and the other as S. But since they are the same string, how to decide?\n\nBut in the input, the two strings of the same length may be same. For example, in the second sample input, the input is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nWhich corresponds to n=3. The two strings of length 1 are 'a' and 'a'. The two strings of length 2 are 'aa' and 'aa'.\n\nSo for the candidate s_candidate = 'aaa', for each of the two 'a's, they are both prefixes and suffixes. So in this case, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do that?\n\nBut the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment. So perhaps, for each length, we can check which of the two strings is a prefix and which is a suffix. For example, for the two strings of length l, check which one is a prefix. If one is a prefix, assign P to that one, and S to the other. If both are prefixes (but that's not possible?), but according to the problem, the input is guaranteed to be valid, so for the candidate s_candidate, each of the two strings of a given length must be either a prefix or a suffix. But since for each length l, there's exactly one prefix and one suffix, then for each length, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, for example, in the case where two strings of length l are same, but they are both a prefix and a suffix, but for the candidate s_candidate, the actual prefix of length l is that string, and the suffix of length l is that same string. So for the two identical strings, one must be assigned as P and the other as S. How to choose?\n\nIn this case, perhaps the code can process the input strings, and for each length l, collect the two strings. Then for each of the two, check if it is a prefix. If one is, assign P to that one, and S to the other. If both are prefixes (which is not possible?), but the problem says that the input is valid, so this can't happen.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nOnce we have the correct s_candidate, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S. However, for cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, but for the given length l, the other string is not. But how to ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how can that be? Because for a given length l, the original string s_candidate has exactly one prefix of length l, and exactly one suffix of length l. So the two input strings of length l must be exactly those two. So one of them is the prefix, the other is the suffix. Therefore, for each input string, exactly one of the two is a prefix of s_candidate. Therefore, for each input string, if it is a prefix, assign P, else S. But how to handle when a string is both a prefix and a suffix?\n\nWell, for example, take the string 'aaa' (n=3). The prefix of length 1 is 'a', the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So the two input strings of length 1 are both 'a'. So for the two 'a's, one must be P, the other S. But how to distinguish between them? Well, the code can't, but the problem allows any assignment as long as there exists a valid s. So in this case, the code can assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second, or vice versa.\n\nBut how to implement that? Because in the input, the two strings of the same length may be same, and we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s_candidate, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, then assign P. Else, assign S. However, in cases where two strings are same and both are prefix and suffix, this approach may assign P to both, leading to an invalid count. But that's not possible, because the input is guaranteed to have a valid assignment. So for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. So even if the two strings are same, one must be a prefix, and the other a suffix. But how can that be? Because the prefix and suffix are same. So for example, in the case of 'aaa', the prefix and suffix of length 1 are both 'a'. So the two input strings of length 1 are 'a' and 'a'. So for each of them, they are both a prefix and suffix. But how to assign P and S?\n\nAh, but in reality, the original string's prefix of length l is one of them, and the suffix is the other. But since they are same, both are prefix and suffix. So for the purpose of the answer, we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose?\n\nIn this case, the code can process the input strings, and for each length l, check which of the two strings is the prefix. Since both are same, but the problem requires that exactly one is a prefix and the other a suffix, the code can choose arbitrarily. However, when checking if the input string is a prefix, for the two same strings, both will be considered as prefixes, leading to assigning P to both, which is wrong.\n\nThis suggests that the approach of checking if the input string is a prefix may not be sufficient. Because in such cases, both are prefixes, but only one should be assigned as P.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to find for each length l, which of the two input strings is the prefix of s_candidate, and which is the suffix. Then assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor each length l, there are two strings. Let's collect them. For example, for each l, create a list of the two strings of that length. Then, for each such list, check which of them is the prefix of s_candidate. Since the original string's prefix of length l is unique, exactly one of the two strings will match. So for example, for the two strings of length l, compare each with the prefix of s_candidate of length l. The one that matches is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nBut wait, the prefix of s_candidate of length l is a unique string. So for each l, the two input strings must include that prefix and the suffix. So for the two input strings of length l, one is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nSo for each l, the code can check which of the two input strings matches the prefix of s_candidate of length l. That one is assigned as P, the other as S.\n\nThis seems like a better approach. So the steps would be:\n\nOnce s_candidate is determined, for each input string, group them by their lengths. For each length l (from 1 to n-1), we have two strings. For each group, compare the two strings to the prefix of s_candidate of length l. The one that matches is the prefix (assign P), the other is the suffix (assign S).\n\nBut how to group the input strings by their lengths?\n\nYes, so for example, for the input list, we can create a dictionary where the keys are the lengths, and the values are lists of the strings of that length. Then, for each length l, check the two strings in the list. One of them must be the prefix of length l, the other the suffix.\n\nSo, for each input string, after grouping by length, for each length l, the code can check which of the two strings is the prefix of s_candidate of length l. Then assign P to that string, and S to the other. Then, for each input string in the original order, we can check which group it belongs to and which label it has.\n\nBut how to map the original input order to the labels? Because the original input order is arbitrary. So, for example, the code needs to process the input strings in the order given, and for each, determine if it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nOnce the candidate s_candidate is determined, for each input string, we need to determine if it is the prefix of s_candidate of its length, or the suffix.\n\nSo, for each input string, check if it is equal to the prefix of s_candidate of length len(s). If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut in the case where the string is equal to the suffix of s_candidate of that length, but not the prefix. However, the problem is that for a given string, it could be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of s_candidate = 'aaa', the string 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix. But for the length l=1, the prefix is 'a', and the suffix is 'a'. So in the input, there are two 'a's. So for each of them, we need to assign one as P and one as S. However, if we check whether the input string equals the prefix of length l, then both will return True, leading to assigning P to both, which is invalid.\n\nSo this approach would not work for such cases. Therefore, the better approach is to group the input strings by their length, and for each group, determine which of the two strings is the prefix of s_candidate of that length, and assign P to that one, and S to the other. Then, for the original input strings, we can check which one of the two they are in their group, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for each input string, we can note its length, and then for that length, check if it is the prefix or not.\n\nBut how to handle duplicates? For example, two strings of same length and same value. Then, for that group, the code would have to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to track which one is which in the original input list.\n\nThis seems complicated. But perhaps, for each group (length l), we can collect the two strings. Then, for each of those two, check if it is the prefix of s_candidate of length l. Exactly one of them will be. Assign P to that one, S to the other. Then, for the original input strings, when we process them, for each string, we can check if it's the one that was marked as prefix for its length, and assign P, else S.\n\nBut how to track this. For example, for each input string, we can precompute a map from the string (and its length) to whether it is the prefix or not. However, in the case of duplicates, this would not be possible.\n\nSo perhaps, for each length l, we can find the prefix (which is s_candidate[:l]), then for the group of two strings of length l, we can check which one is equal to this prefix. That one is assigned P, the other S.\n\nOnce that is done, for each input string, we can check if it's equal to the prefix of its length. If yes, then assign P, else S.\n\nBut in the case where the two strings are same as the prefix, but that's impossible because the group has two strings, but the prefix is unique. Wait, no. For example, the group has two strings, both same as the prefix. Then, the code would think that both are the prefix. But that can't happen because the original string's prefix of length l is unique, and the input is guaranteed to have exactly two strings of each length, which are prefixes and suffixes of some string. So for the candidate s_candidate, the two input strings of length l must be the prefix and suffix of s_candidate of that length. Therefore, exactly one of them is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nBut if the two strings are same, then that implies that the prefix and the suffix of length l are same. Which is possible. For example, in the case of s_candidate = 'aaa', the prefix of length 1 is 'a', the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So the two input strings of length 1 are both 'a'. So for that group, the code would find that both are equal to the prefix. But how to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nIn this case, the code can't rely on checking if the string is equal to the prefix. Because both are. So what's the solution here?\n\nWell, the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment. So for the two same strings, one can be assigned as P and the other as S. How to choose which one?\n\nBut how to track that in the code. For example, for the group of two same strings, the code can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S. But how to track which is which in the input list.\n\nThis suggests that for each group of strings of the same length, we need to know which one is the prefix and which is the suffix. But when the two are same, it's impossible to tell. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose arbitrarily. For example, assign the first one as P and the second as S.\n\nBut how to track which is which in the input list.\n\nAn alternative approach: once the candidate s_candidate is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, then assign P. Else, assign S. However, in the case of duplicates, this may assign P to both. But how to avoid that?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix. Therefore, for the group of two strings of length l, exactly one is a prefix. So, even if the two strings are same, exactly one of them is the prefix (since the original string's prefix of length l is unique, and the two input strings are the prefix and suffix of that length. So if the two strings are same, then the prefix and suffix are same. So for the group, the two strings are same. So for the code, when checking if the input string is the prefix, both will be true. But how to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nThis seems like a problem. So perhaps, the code needs to process the input strings and, for each length, assign one of the two as P and the other as S, regardless of their content.\n\nBut how to do that? Maybe the code can, for each length l, find the two strings. Then, for the first string in the group, check if it is the prefix. If yes, assign P to it, else assign S. Then for the second string, assign the opposite. But how to know which is which in the input.\n\nAlternatively, for the group of two strings of length l, the code can compare them to the prefix of length l. If one is equal, assign P to that one, and S to the other. If both are equal, then assign P to the first one and S to the second. But how to track which is which in the original input list.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nOnce the candidate s_candidate is determined, for each input string, we can:\n\n- For each length l, collect all the input strings of that length. For example, for l in 1 to n-1, have a list of the two strings.\n\nThen, for each l, check which of the two strings is the prefix of s_candidate of length l. Let's call that prefix_str. Then, for the two strings in the group, the one equal to prefix_str is assigned as P, the other as S.\n\nNow, for the original input list, for each string, we can check if it is in the group of its length, and whether it is the prefix_str for that group. If yes, assign P, else S.\n\nBut how to handle duplicates in the group. For example, if the two strings are same as prefix_str, then the code can assign P to one and S to the other. But how to choose which one?\n\nIn this case, perhaps the code can compare the strings. For the group of two strings, if they are same, then assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second. But how to track which is which in the input.\n\nBut the problem is that the code doesn't know which of the two input strings in the group is first or second in the original input. Because the input is given in arbitrary order.\n\nSo perhaps, for the group of two strings of length l, the code can check which one is the prefix_str. If there is exactly one, assign P to that one, S to the other. If both are equal to prefix_str, then assign P to the first one in the group, and S to the second.\n\nBut how to track which is which in the original input.\n\nThis seems tricky. But perhaps, for the code, during processing, for each group (length l), we can store the two strings, and for each of them, note whether they are the prefix or suffix. Then, for the original input list, when processing each string, check if it's in the group, and which role it has.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s_candidate, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S. However, this approach may not work when there are two strings of the same length that are both prefixes (but that's not possible, since for the candidate s_candidate, there is only one prefix of each length l). So, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each input string, exactly one of the two will be a prefix. So, for example, in the case of two same strings of length l, which are both the prefix and suffix of s_candidate, then for each of them, checking if it is a prefix would return True. But how to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut in reality, the two strings are the same. So, when the code checks for each of them, they are both prefixes. So the code would assign P to both, which would result in more than n-1 P's. Which is invalid.\n\nThus, this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative idea: For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, assign P. Else, assign S. However, for cases where both strings are prefixes, this would assign P to both, but since the problem says that the input is valid, this can't happen. Because for the candidate s_candidate, there is only one prefix of each length l. So for the two input strings of length l, exactly one is the prefix, and the other is the suffix. Thus, only one of them is a prefix. Hence, the code would assign P to exactly one of them. So why in the previous example with s_candidate 'aaa' and two 'a's, the code would assign P to both? Because both are prefixes. But according to the problem's input constraints, the input is guaranteed to be valid. Which means that for the candidate s_candidate, the two input strings of length l are the prefix and the suffix. But in this case, the prefix and suffix are the same. So for the two input strings, both are the same as the prefix and suffix. Hence, they are both prefixes and suffixes. So how can the code distinguish between them?\n\nThis seems like a contradiction. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for the candidate s_candidate, the two input strings of length l must be the prefix and the suffix. Which may be the same string. In that case, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S. But how?\n\nPerhaps the answer is that in this case, the code can choose either. But how to implement that.\n\nMaybe the code can process the input strings in the order they were given, and for each length l, for the first occurrence of the prefix string, assign P, and for the second occurrence, assign S. But how to do that.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the input strings are:\n\nn=3\n\ninput strings: 'a', 'a', 'aa', 'aa'\n\nSo for length 1, two 'a's. For length 2, two 'aa's.\n\nThe candidate s_candidate is 'aaa'.\n\nFor length 1, the prefix is 'a', the suffix is 'a'. So for the two 'a's, one must be P and the other S. How to decide which one.\n\nIf the code processes the input strings in order, and for each length, for the first occurrence of the prefix, assign P, and for the second, assign S.\n\nBut how to track this.\n\nPerhaps, for each length l, the code can keep track of how many times the prefix has been assigned. For example, for each length l, we have the prefix_str. For the group of two strings of length l, the code can iterate through the input strings, and for each string of length l, if it is equal to prefix_str and hasn't been assigned yet, assign P, else assign S.\n\nBut this would require keeping track of which strings have been assigned for each length.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nHere's a possible plan:\n\nOnce the candidate s_candidate is determined, for each length l, compute the prefix_str (s_candidate[:l]) and the suffix_str (s_candidate[-l:]).\n\nFor each input string, we need to determine whether it is the prefix_str or the suffix_str for its length.\n\nSo for each input string, we can check if it equals prefix_str of its length. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut in the case where the input string equals both prefix_str and suffix_str (which is possible when prefix_str == suffix_str), then it's ambiguous. But how to choose between P and S.\n\nBut in this case, the problem allows any assignment as long as the total number of P and S is correct. So, for example, for the two strings of length l that are same as prefix_str, assign P to one and S to the other. How to do that?\n\nPerhaps, for each length l, the code can check how many times the prefix_str appears in the input strings of that length. For example, if there are two occurrences, then assign P to the first and S to the second.\n\nBut how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, during processing, for each length l, if the string is equal to prefix_str, then assign P if it's the first occurrence, else S. But how to track this.\n\nThis seems like it would require for each length l, a counter of how many times the prefix_str has been assigned.\n\nSo, during the processing of the input strings:\n\nInitialize a dictionary, say, prefix_count, which for each length l, stores the number of times the prefix_str has been assigned.\n\nFor each input string in the original order:\n\n   l = len(string)\n\n   prefix_str = s_candidate[:l]\n\n   if string == prefix_str:\n\n       if prefix_count[l] < 1:\n\n           assign P, increment prefix_count[l]\n\n       else:\n\n           assign S\n\n   else:\n\n       assign S\n\nBut this approach would assign P to the first occurrence of the prefix_str for each length l, and S to the rest.\n\nBut this would ensure that for each length l, exactly one P is assigned (since there are two strings, one is prefix, one is suffix). But in the case where both strings are prefix_str, this would assign P to the first and S to the second.\n\nYes, this would work.\n\nLet me test this logic with the example where the input strings are two 'a's for length 1. For the first 'a', it is equal to prefix_str, and prefix_count[1] is 0. Assign P, increment to 1. For the second 'a', it is equal to prefix_str, but prefix_count[1] is already 1. Assign S. This would give one P and one S for that length.\n\nYes. This would solve the problem.\n\nSimilarly, if the two strings are different, and one is the prefix, the code would assign P to that one, and S to the other.\n\nThus, this approach would work.\n\nSo, the steps for the code are:\n\n1. Read n and the 2n-2 strings.\n\n2. Find the two strings of length n-1. Call them candidates.\n\n3. For each possible combination (A as prefix, B as suffix and vice versa), generate the candidate s_candidate.\n\n   For example:\n\n   For A being the prefix of length n-1, B being the suffix of length n-1:\n\n   s_candidate = A + B[-1]\n\n   Then, check if B is the suffix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate[-(n-1):] == B).\n\n   If this is true, then proceed to check if all other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n   If yes, then this is a valid s_candidate.\n\n   Similarly, check for the other possibility (B as prefix, A as suffix).\n\n   Once a valid s_candidate is found, proceed to generate the P/S sequence.\n\n4. Once the s_candidate is determined, for each input string in the original order, determine whether to assign P or S as follows:\n\n   a. For the current string, compute its length l.\n\n   b. Compute prefix_str = s_candidate[:l].\n\n   c. If the string is equal to prefix_str:\n\n       i. If this is the first time a string of length l has been assigned as prefix, assign P and increment the count.\n\n       ii. Else, assign S.\n\n   d. Else, assign S.\n\nThis approach would ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is assigned as P, and the other as S",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves reconstructing the original string `s` from the given prefixes and suffixes and then classifying each input string as either a prefix or a suffix.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix Candidates**: The longest proper prefixes and suffixes of the original string `s` (of length `n-1`) are critical. There will be exactly two such strings in the input.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: Using the two longest candidates, we can attempt to reconstruct the original string `s` by checking both possible combinations (one as prefix and the other as suffix).\n3. **Validate the Reconstructed String**: Once a candidate string is reconstructed, validate that all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of this candidate.\n4. **Classify Input Strings**: For each input string, determine if it is a prefix or a suffix of the validated candidate string, ensuring the correct count of prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for the two candidates\n    valid_s = None\n    for i in range(2):\n        # First candidate is prefix, second is suffix\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[0]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1]\n        if i == 1:\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[1]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[0]\n        \n        # Construct s_candidate\n        s_candidate = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n        \n        # Check if suffix_candidate is indeed the suffix\n        if s_candidate[-len_n_minus_1:] == suffix_candidate:\n            # Now check all other strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate\n            valid = True\n            for s in strings:\n                l = len(s)\n                if s != s_candidate[:l] and s != s_candidate[-l:]:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                valid_s = s_candidate\n                break\n    \n    # Now generate the answer based on valid_s\n    result = []\n    prefix_count = {}\n    \n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        prefix_str = valid_s[:l]\n        if s == prefix_str:\n            if l not in prefix_count:\n                prefix_count[l] = 0\n            if prefix_count[l] == 0:\n                result.append('P')\n                prefix_count[l] += 1\n            else:\n                result.append('S')\n        else:\n            result.append('S')\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential longest prefixes and suffixes.\n3. **Reconstructing the Original String**: Two possible reconstructions of the original string are tested. Each candidate string is checked to ensure it is consistent with all given strings being either prefixes or suffixes.\n4. **Classifying Strings**: For each input string, the algorithm checks if it matches the prefix of the same length in the reconstructed string.
