Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (which is 1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are pretty tight: n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So we need an efficient algorithm here.\n\nHmm. The classic knapsack problem, but with weights limited to 1, 2, 3. Oh right! Since the weights are small, maybe we can find a way to handle each weight category separately and combine them optimally.\n\nLet me think. For each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each category, we can precompute the prefix sums. That way, for any number of items taken from that category, we can quickly calculate the total cost.\n\nBut how do we combine them? Because the total weight is limited. Let's say we take x items of weight 1, y items of weight 2, z items of weight 3. The total weight is x*1 + y*2 + z*3 ≤ m. We need to maximize the sum of their costs.\n\nBut considering all possible combinations of x, y, z would be computationally expensive. However, since the weights are small, maybe we can find a way to iterate through possible counts of one of the categories and compute the optimal for the others.\n\nLet me think. For example, for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), we can compute the maximum possible sum for weight 1 and 2 items given the remaining weight. But even that might be too slow if done naively.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is up to 3, perhaps we can process the items for each weight group, then use a dynamic programming approach that considers each weight group.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's separate the items into three groups: those with weight 1, 2, 3. For each group, sort them in descending order of cost, and compute prefix sums. Then, for each possible number of weight 3 items (up to max possible), we can calculate the remaining weight, and then solve for weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to solve the weight 1 and 2 items part efficiently?\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, the problem becomes similar to the classic unbounded knapsack but with items of weight 1 and 2. Wait no, it's the 0-1 knapsack problem because each item can be taken once. But given that the items are sorted and we have their prefix sums, maybe there's a way to find the optimal combination for the remaining capacity.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible capacity (up to m) the maximum value. However, since m can be up to 3e5, and with n up to 1e5, this might be feasible. But combining with the weight 3 items?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the following steps:\n\n1. Preprocess each weight group (1, 2, 3) by sorting them in descending order of cost, and compute prefix sums. For example, for weight 1, we have a list of sorted items, and prefix_sum_1[i] is the sum of the first i items. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\n2. For each possible number of weight 3 items (say, k), we can take up to min( (m // 3), len(weight3)) items. For each such k, the total weight used is 3*k. The remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*k. Now, we need to find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fit into rem.\n\nBut how do we compute that best combination for weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nLet me think. For the weight 1 and 2 items, given a capacity rem, what's the maximum value?\n\nThis seems like a classic knapsack problem with items of weights 1 and 2. But since the items are sorted, perhaps there's a way to compute this quickly.\n\nLet me consider that for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can take some number of weight 1 items (say, a) and some number of weight 2 items (say, b), such that a*1 + b*2 ≤ rem. The maximum sum of their prefix sums.\n\nBut how to find the optimal a and b for a given rem?\n\nAnother approach: for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value. But since m is up to 3e5, and for each weight group, this would take O(m",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry given a weight limit. The souvenirs have weights of 1, 2, or 3, and the constraints are large (up to 100,000 items and 300,000 weight capacity). We leverage the fact that the weights are limited to 1, 2, and 3 to optimize our solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group and Sort Items**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, 3). Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: Compute prefix sums for each group to quickly calculate the total cost of taking the top `k` items from any group.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Counts**: For each possible count of weight 3 items, compute the remaining capacity and determine the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fit into the remaining capacity using a dynamic programming approach.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    m = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    \n    w1 = []\n    w2 = []\n    w3 = []\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        wi = int(data[idx])\n        ci = int(data[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        if wi == 1:\n            w1.append(ci)\n        elif wi == 2:\n            w2.append(ci)\n        else:\n            w3.append(ci)\n    \n    # Sort each list in descending order\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix1 = [0]\n    for c in w1:\n        prefix1.append(prefix1[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix2 = [0]\n    for c in w2:\n        prefix2.append(prefix2[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix3 = [0]\n    for c in w3:\n        prefix3.append(prefix3[-1] + c)\n    \n    max_total = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over possible number of weight 3 items\n    max_k3 = min(len(w3), m // 3)\n    for k3 in range(0, max_k3 + 1):\n        weight_used = 3 * k3\n        if weight_used > m:\n            continue\n        rem = m - weight_used\n        \n        # Now solve for w1 and w2 with capacity rem\n        # Let's use a DP approach for w1 and w2\n        # Since rem can be up to 3e5, but we can optimize\n        # For each possible number of w2 items, find best w1 items\n        \n        max_w2 = min(len(w2), rem // 2)\n        best = 0\n        for k2 in range(0, max_w2 + 1):\n            weight2 = 2 * k2\n            if weight2 > rem:\n                continue\n            rem2 = rem - weight2\n            k1 = min(len(w1), rem2)\n            current = prefix2[k2] + prefix1[k1]\n            if current > best:\n                best = current\n        \n        total = prefix3[k3] + best\n        if total > max_total:\n            max_total = total\n    \n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping and Sorting**: The items are grouped by their weights and sorted in descending order of cost to facilitate efficient selection of the most valuable items.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: Prefix sums for each group allow quick calculation of the total cost for taking the top `k` items from any group.\n3. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Capacity**: For each possible number of weight 3 items, the remaining capacity is calculated. We then use a nested loop to determine the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fit into the remaining capacity, leveraging prefix sums for quick cost calculations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible combinations of items while adhering to the weight constraints, leading to an optimal solution.",
