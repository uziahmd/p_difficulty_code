    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible ternary string after performing allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). But we can't swap 0 and 2 directly. \n\nHmm. So what does that mean for the order of the characters? Let's think about the allowed operations. Since we can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, but not 0 and 2. So, effectively, the 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s. But 0s can't move past 2s. Wait, no. Because if you have a 0 and a 2 separated by some 1s, maybe you can move them around? Let me think. For example, if there's a sequence like 0 1 2. Then you can swap the 0 and 1 first, making 1 0 2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. So the 0 can't get past the 2. So the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Because you can't swap them directly, and there's no way to move them past each other. \n\nWait, but if there's a 0 followed by a 2, but there's a 1 in between. Like 0 1 2. Then you can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No. But maybe you can swap the 1 and 2? Like 1 0 2 → 1 2 0? Then the 0 is now after the 2. But wait, how? Let me see. The original sequence is 0 1 2. We can swap the 1 and 2 (since they are adjacent) to get 0 2 1. Then we can swap the 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. So that's not possible. Wait, but the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 or between 1 and 2. So in the case of 0 and 2, you can't swap them. So in this example, the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because any movement of 0s past 2s would require swapping them, which isn't allowed. \n\nWait, but what if there's a 0 followed by a 2 with some 1s in between. Like 0 1 1 2. Then, can we move the 0 past the 2? Let's see. Let's say we have 0 1 1 2. We can swap the 0 and 1s, moving the 0 to the right. But then, once the 0 is next to the 2, we can't swap them. So the 0 can't go past the 2. Therefore, the order of 0s and 2s in the original string is fixed. Because you can't swap them. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s can't be changed. However, the 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s. \n\nWait, but if there's a 0 followed by a 2, but there's a 1 in between, perhaps you can move the 1s around. For example, 0 1 2. Then you can swap the 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Now, the 0 is before the 2, but the 1 is after. But you can't swap the 0 and 2. So the 0 is still before the 2. So the relative order between 0 and 2 is preserved. \n\nSo, the conclusion here is that the relative order of 0s and 2s cannot be changed. Because any swap that would allow them to pass each other is not allowed. Therefore, the positions of 0s and 2s in the original string must be in the same relative order in the final string. However, the 1s can be moved around between the 0s and 2s, as long as they can be swapped with their adjacent characters. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to arranging the 0s, 1s, and 2s such that:\n\n- All 0s and 2s are in their original relative order. \n- The 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s, but considering their positions. \n\nWait, but how can we arrange the 1s optimally? Let's think about the example given. For instance, the input \"100210\" becomes \"001120\". Let's look at the original string: 1 0 0 2 1 0. The 0s and 2s are in positions 2,3,4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but in the original string, the 0s and 2s are in order 0, 0, 2, 0. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is 0, 0, 2, 0. So in the output, the 0s and 2s are in positions 0,1,2,4. Which is 0,0,2,0. So the relative order is preserved. \n\nSo, the idea is that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered, but the 1s can be moved around. However, since 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s, perhaps the 1s can be placed between the 0s and 2s. \n\nSo, the approach is to first separate the original string into the 0s, 1s, and 2s. But the 0s and 2s must remain in their original order. However, the 1s can be inserted between the 0s and 2s. \n\nWait, but how do we arrange the 1s optimally? Because we want the lex smallest string. Lex smallest means that we want as many 0s as possible early in the string, then 1s, then 2s. However, the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So perhaps the problem is to arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can split the original string into groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s, but keeping track of the order of 0s and 2s. Then, for each segment between the 0s and 2s, we can arrange the 1s optimally. \n\nBut perhaps a better way is to think of the original string as a sequence of characters, where the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order, but the 1s can be moved. \n\nFor example, consider the original string as consisting of a list of 0s and 2s, with some 1s interspersed. The 1s can be moved to the left or right of the 0s and 2s, but not between them. Wait, no. Because the 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s. For example, a 1 can be moved to the left of a 0 (since 0 and 1 can be swapped), or to the right of a 2 (since 1 and 2 can be swapped). \n\nBut the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. \n\nSo, the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. So, for example, if in the original string, there's a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 will still be before the 2. \n\nBut the 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s. So, perhaps the optimal way is to collect all the 1s and place them between the 0s and 2s in a way that minimizes the lex order. \n\nLet me think of the example given. For input '100210', the output is '001120'. \n\nOriginal string is 1 0 0 2 1 0. The 0s and 2s are in the order 0,0,2,0. So the 0s and 2s are in positions 1,2,3,5. \n\nThe 1s are in positions 0 and 4. \n\nIn the output, the 0s and 2s are arranged as 0,0,2,0. The 1s are placed between the 0s and 2s. \n\nHow to arrange the 1s optimally? Well, the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s. For example, between two 0s, between a 0 and a 2, between a 2 and a 0, etc. \n\nBut since the 1s can be moved freely, perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s, but in such a way that the 1s are placed as far left as possible. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire string as consisting of blocks of 0s and 2s, with the 1s being able to be placed in between. But since the 0s and 2s can't be reordered, the problem is similar to inserting the 1s into the gaps between these fixed elements. \n\nSo, for example, suppose that the original string has a sequence of 0s and 2s in some order. Let's call these the \"fixed\" elements. The 1s can be placed in any of the gaps between these fixed elements, including before the first one, between any two consecutive fixed elements, and after the last one. \n\nBut how to distribute the 1s into these gaps to make the lex smallest string. \n\nBecause the lex smallest string wants as many 0s as possible early, then 1s, then 2s. But the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So, the idea is that between two fixed elements (say, a 0 and a 2), we can insert as many 1s as possible. But since the 1s are inserted into the gaps, how to decide where to put them. \n\nWait, but inserting 1s into a gap between a 0 and a 2 would allow us to have the 1s between them. However, inserting the 1s in the earliest possible gaps would help. For example, inserting all 1s before the first fixed element (which is a 0 or 2) would be better than putting them later. \n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the fixed elements as a list. For example, in the input '100210', the fixed elements are [0, 0, 2, 0]. The 1s are two in number. \n\nThe gaps where we can insert the 1s are:\n\n- Before the first element (gap 0)\n- Between first and second element (gap 1)\n- Between second and third (gap 2)\n- Between third and fourth (gap 3)\n- After fourth (gap 4)\n\nSo, the question is, how to distribute the 1s into these gaps. \n\nSince the lex order is minimized when we have as many 0s as possible early, but the 1s can be placed in the gaps. Let's think about the order of the fixed elements. \n\nEach gap can be considered as a position where we can insert some number of 1s. But how to choose the distribution. \n\nThe key is that inserting 1s into earlier gaps is better than inserting them into later gaps. For example, inserting a 1 into gap 0 (before the first element) would contribute to the lex order earlier than inserting it into gap 1. \n\nBut wait, the fixed elements are already in their original order. So, inserting 1s into the earliest possible gaps would be better. \n\nBut why? Because inserting 1s before the first fixed element (if that element is a 0) would allow us to have more 0s earlier. Wait, no. Because inserting 1s before the first fixed element would add 1s before the first 0. Which would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than having 0s. \n\nWait, but that's not possible. Because the fixed elements are 0s and 2s. Suppose the first fixed element is a 0. Then inserting 1s before it would create a prefix of 1s followed by 0s. Which is worse than having 0s first. \n\nSo that's not good. So, perhaps the optimal way is to insert the 1s into the gaps between the fixed elements in a way that allows the earliest possible 0s and 2s to be as small as possible. \n\nWait, but how can we do that. Let's think again. The fixed elements are 0s and 2s. So, the first fixed element could be a 0 or a 2. \n\nIf the first fixed element is a 0, then inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So, in that case, we should not insert any 1s before the first fixed element. \n\nSimilarly, if the first fixed element is a 2, then inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1s, which is better than 2. So that's good. \n\nSo, the strategy for distributing the 1s into the gaps depends on the fixed elements. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nThe idea is that for each gap between fixed elements, inserting the 1s into that gap would contribute to the lex order. \n\nBut since the 1s can be placed in any of the gaps, we need to find the optimal way to distribute them. \n\nLet me think of the fixed elements as a list. Let's call them 'fixed = [c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}]' where each c_i is either 0 or 2. \n\nThen, the gaps are:\n\ngap_0: before c_0\n\ngap_1: between c_0 and c_1\n\n...\n\ngap_n: after c_{n-1}\n\nWe need to distribute all the 1s into these gaps. \n\nThe goal is to choose how many 1s go into each gap so that the resulting string is lex smallest. \n\nHow to choose the distribution. \n\nLet me think about the lex order. The lex order is determined by the first position where the strings differ. So, to minimize the lex order, we want to have as many 0s as possible early. \n\nSo, for the gaps, inserting 1s into a gap that is between two fixed elements. For example, if we have a gap between a 0 and a 2. Inserting 1s into this gap would result in 0 followed by some 1s followed by 2. Which is better than having the 0 followed by 2 (without 1s) because the 1s are smaller than 2. \n\nWait, but inserting 1s between a 0 and a 2 would make the string have 0...1...2, which is better than 0...2. Because the 1 comes before the 2. \n\nBut inserting 1s into a gap between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting them into a later gap. \n\nSo, the priority is to insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause the lex order to be worse. \n\nWait, but how to determine which gaps to insert the 1s into. \n\nAnother approach is that the 1s can be inserted into any of the gaps. But the optimal way is to insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause a higher lex order. \n\nBut how to compare the gaps. \n\nLet me think of the following: for each gap, inserting 1s into it will add a block of 1s. The effect of inserting into a gap depends on the surrounding fixed elements. \n\nFor example, inserting into a gap between two fixed elements a and b (where a is the previous fixed element, and b is the next). \n\nIf a is 0 and b is 2: inserting 1s here would be good, as the 0 is before the 1s, which are before the 2. \n\nIf a is 2 and b is 0: inserting 1s here would be between a 2 and a 0. But since 2 and 0 can't be swapped, the original order is 2 followed by 0. Inserting 1s between them would give 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. But since 1 is less than 2, but the 2 is already before the 1s. So the 2 is in the string, which is worse than 0. However, the original order of the fixed elements is 2 followed by 0. So the 2 is before the 0. \n\nBut inserting 1s between them would make the string have 2, then 1s, then 0. Which is worse than if we could have 0s before the 2. But since the original order of the fixed elements is 2 followed by 0, that's fixed. So inserting 1s between them would not change that. \n\nSo, the key is that for each gap, inserting 1s into that gap will contribute a certain amount of 1s. \n\nBut to find the lex smallest string, the 1s should be placed in the earliest possible gaps where they can contribute to a smaller lex order. \n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to process the gaps in order, and for each gap, decide how many 1s to insert. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think of the following. For each gap, the insertion of 1s into that gap would affect the lex order. The earliest possible positions where inserting 1s can help are those where the surrounding fixed elements are such that inserting 1s would lead to a lower lex order. \n\nFor example, inserting into a gap that is before a 2 (like the first gap if the first fixed element is 2) would be good. Because inserting 1s there would make the string start with 1s, which are better than 2. \n\nBut inserting into a gap that is before a 0 (like the first gap if the first fixed element is 0) would be bad, since inserting 1s there would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than 0. \n\nSo, the idea is that for each gap, we can decide whether inserting 1s there would be beneficial. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAn alternative approach is to think about the following: the optimal arrangement is to have all the 1s inserted into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not conflict with the order of the fixed elements. \n\nLet me consider that the gaps can be ordered, and for each gap, we can decide how many 1s to put there. \n\nThe priority is to insert 1s into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause a higher lex order. \n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n1. Split the original string into the fixed elements (0s and 2s) and collect the 1s. \n\n   For example, for the input '100210', the fixed elements are [0,0,2,0], and the 1s are [1,1].\n\n2. Now, create the list of gaps. The gaps are between the fixed elements, including before the first and after the last.\n\n3. For each gap, determine the best way to insert the 1s. \n\n   The key is that inserting 1s into a gap between a and b (a is the previous fixed element, b is the next fixed element) is allowed. \n\n   However, inserting 1s into a gap may be better than inserting into another gap. \n\n   How to compare two gaps? \n\n   Let's think of the gaps as positions where inserting 1s will contribute to the lex order. \n\n   For example, inserting 1s into a gap that is before a 0 (if the first fixed element is 0) is worse than not inserting any 1s there. \n\n   Similarly, inserting 1s into a gap between a 0 and 2 is better than inserting them into a gap between 2 and 0, because inserting between 0 and 2 gives 0...1...2, which is better than 2...1...0. \n\n   So, the priority is to insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest gaps where inserting them is beneficial. \n\n   How can we model this? \n\n   For each gap, we can calculate the \"value\" of inserting a 1 into that gap. \n\n   But how? \n\n   Maybe we can think of the gaps as follows:\n\n   - The earliest gaps where inserting 1s would not introduce a higher character than necessary. \n\n   For example, inserting into a gap before the first fixed element. If the first fixed element is 0, then inserting 1s there would be worse than not inserting. So we avoid that. If the first fixed element is 2, then inserting 1s there is better. \n\n   Similarly, inserting between two fixed elements. For example, between a 0 and a 2: inserting 1s here is good. Between a 0 and a 0: inserting 1s here would be good because inserting 1s between two 0s would allow the 0s to be grouped together. \n\n   Wait, inserting 1s between two 0s would create 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than having 0s grouped together. Because the first 0 is followed by 1s, which is worse than 0. \n\n   Wait, but the 0s are already in their original order. So inserting 1s between them would create a 0, then some 1s, then another 0. Which is worse than just having the two 0s in a row. Because the first 0 is followed by a 1, which is worse than 0. So, inserting 1s between 0s would make the string larger. \n\n   Therefore, in this case, we should avoid inserting 1s between 0s. \n\n   Similarly, inserting 1s between 2s would also be worse than not inserting. \n\n   So, the optimal way is to insert the 1s into the gaps where inserting them would not create a higher lex order. \n\n   So, for each gap, we can decide whether inserting 1s into it is beneficial. \n\n   How to model this. \n\n   The idea is that inserting 1s into a gap between a and b (fixed elements) is only beneficial if the insertion doesn't create a higher lex order. \n\n   For example, inserting 1s into a gap between a 0 and 2 is beneficial because the 1s are between 0 and 2. \n\n   Inserting 1s into a gap between a 2 and 0 is not beneficial because the 2 is before the 0, and inserting 1s between them would not change that. \n\n   However, inserting 1s into a gap between a 2 and 0 would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than 2 followed by 0. \n\n   Because the 1s are smaller than 2, but the 2 is already in the string. \n\n   Wait, but the first occurrence of a 2 would be in the string. If we have a gap before a 2, inserting 1s there would be better. \n\n   So, perhaps the optimal way is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gaps where the surrounding fixed elements are such that inserting the 1s would not cause a higher lex order. \n\n   Let me think of the following approach:\n\n   For each gap in order from left to right:\n\n      Determine if inserting 1s into this gap is beneficial. \n\n      If yes, insert as many as possible (all remaining 1s) here. \n\n      Else, insert zero. \n\n   How to determine if inserting into a gap is beneficial. \n\n   Let's think of the gap as being between two elements, say, prev and next. \n\n   For the first gap (before the first element):\n\n      If the first element is 0, inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0. So we don't insert here. \n\n      If the first element is 2, inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s, which is better than 2. So we should insert as many as possible here. \n\n   For the last gap (after the last element):\n\n      Inserting 1s here would add them at the end. Since 1 is smaller than 2, but larger than 0. However, inserting them here is better than inserting them into later gaps (but there are none). \n\n   For gaps between elements prev and next:\n\n      The current gap is between prev and next. \n\n      What's the best way to insert 1s here. \n\n      Since prev can be 0 or 2, next can be 0 or 2. \n\n      Let's think of the following cases:\n\n      Case 1: prev is 0 and next is 0. Inserting 1s here would create 0...1...0. Which is worse than 00. So we shouldn't insert here. \n\n      Case 2: prev is 0 and next is 2. Inserting 1s here would create 0...1...2. Which is better than 02. So we should insert as many as possible here. \n\n      Case 3: prev is 2 and next is 0. Inserting 1s here would create 2...1...0. Which is worse than 20. Because the first occurrence of 2 is in the string. However, inserting 1s here would make the string have 2 followed by 1s, which is worse than 2 followed by 0. Wait, but the original order is 2 followed by 0. So inserting 1s between them would create 2...1...0. The first difference compared to the original is that instead of 2 followed by 0, we have 2 followed by 1. Which is worse than 2 followed by 0. So inserting 1s here is not beneficial. \n\n      Case 4: prev is 2 and next is 2. Inserting 1s here would create 2...1...2. Which is worse than 22. So we shouldn't insert here. \n\n   So, the conclusion is that inserting 1s into a gap between prev and next is beneficial only if prev is 0 and next is 2. In other cases, inserting 1s into the gap would not be beneficial. \n\n   However, there's also the case of inserting 1s into the first gap (before the first element) when the first element is 2, or into the last gap (after the last element). \n\n   So, the algorithm would be:\n\n   - Collect the fixed elements (0s and 2s) and the count of 1s. \n\n   - Create the list of gaps. \n\n   - Iterate through the gaps in order from left to right. \n\n   - For each gap, decide whether inserting 1s here is beneficial. \n\n   - If yes, insert as many as possible (all remaining 1s). \n\n   - Once the 1s are inserted, break. \n\n   But how to handle the case where inserting into multiple gaps is beneficial. For example, if there are multiple gaps between 0 and 2. \n\n   For example, if the fixed elements are [0, 2, 0, 2], then the gaps between 0 and 2 (gap 1) and between 0 and 2 (gap 3) would both be beneficial. \n\n   Which gap should we insert the 1s into first? \n\n   According to the left-to-right processing, we would insert into the earliest possible gap. \n\n   Because inserting into an earlier gap would make the string lex smaller. \n\n   For example, inserting into gap 1 (between first 0 and 2) would allow the 1s to be placed earlier than inserting into gap 3. \n\n   So, the algorithm is:\n\n   Process the gaps in order from left to right. For each gap, check if inserting 1s here is beneficial. If yes, insert all remaining 1s here. \n\n   How to check if inserting 1s here is beneficial. \n\n   Let's formalize the condition. \n\n   For the first gap (before the first element):\n\n      if the first element is 2: inserting 1s here is beneficial. \n\n      else (it's 0): not beneficial. \n\n   For the last gap (after the last element):\n\n      inserting 1s here is always beneficial? Or not? \n\n      Because inserting 1s here adds them at the end. Since the rest of the string is fixed, adding 1s at the end is better than leaving them uninserted (since 1 is smaller than 2, but if there are 2s in the string, but the 1s are added after the last element, which could be 0 or 2). \n\n      For example, if the last fixed element is 0, adding 1s after it would be worse than adding them before the 0. But since the 1s can't be inserted before the 0 (as the first gap is before the first element, which may be 0). \n\n      So, inserting into the last gap is always beneficial. Because inserting 1s into the last gap would add them after all the fixed elements. Which is better than not inserting them. \n\n      Wait, but if the last fixed element is 2, then inserting 1s after it would add 1s after 2, which is worse than inserting them before the 2. But if there's no other way to insert the 1s, then inserting them at the end is better than not inserting them. \n\n      So, the decision to insert into the last gap is always beneficial. \n\n      Wait, but what if there are no other options. For example, if the fixed elements are [2], and there are some 1s. Then inserting them before the 2 (first gap) is better than inserting after. So in this case, the first gap is processed first. \n\n   So, the general rule for a gap between prev and next (or for the first and last gaps) is:\n\n   - For the first gap: insert 1s if the first element is 2. \n\n   - For the last gap: insert 1s. \n\n   - For other gaps between prev and next:\n\n      insert 1s if prev is 0 and next is 2. \n\n   So, during the iteration over the gaps, for each gap, if the condition is met, we insert all the remaining 1s into this gap. \n\n   Once we insert all the 1s into a gap, we can stop processing further gaps. \n\n   Because inserting the 1s into the earliest possible gap (leftmost) is better than inserting into later ones. \n\n   Let's test this logic with some examples. \n\n   Example 1: Input '100210' → fixed elements [0,0,2,0], 1s count 2. \n\n   The gaps are:\n\n   Gap 0: before first element (0) → first element is 0 → not beneficial. \n\n   Gap 1: between 0 and 0 → prev=0, next=0 → not beneficial. \n\n   Gap 2: between 0 and 2 → prev=0, next=2 → beneficial. So insert all 2 1s here. \n\n   Then, the final string is constructed by inserting the 1s into gap 2. \n\n   The fixed elements are [0,0,2,0], and inserting 1s between the 0 and 2. \n\n   So the final string is 0,0,1,1,2,0 → which is \"001120\", which matches the sample output. \n\n   Another example: input '20' → output is '20'. \n\n   The fixed elements are [2, 0]. The 1s count is 0. So no insertion. \n\n   Another example: input '11222121' → output is '11112222'. \n\n   Let's see. The original string is '11222121'. \n\n   The fixed elements are 2, 2, 2, 2. Because the 1s are the ones that can be moved. \n\n   Wait, no. The fixed elements are the 0s and 2s. Wait, the original string is '11222121'. \n\n   Let's parse it: the characters are 1,1,2,2,2,1,2,1. \n\n   The fixed elements are the 2s. The 0s are not present. \n\n   So the fixed elements are [2, 2, 2, 2]. The 1s are four in total. \n\n   Now, the gaps are:\n\n   gap 0: before first 2. \n\n   gap 1: between first and second 2. \n\n   gap 2: between second and third 2. \n\n   gap 3: between third and fourth 2. \n\n   gap 4: after fourth 2. \n\n   Processing the gaps in order. \n\n   First gap is before the first 2. Inserting 1s here is beneficial, since the first element is 2. So insert all 4 1s here. \n\n   So the final string is 1111 followed by the fixed elements 2,2,2,2 → \"11112222\", which matches the sample output. \n\n   Another example: input '210' → fixed elements are 2, 0. The 1s count is 1. \n\n   The gaps are:\n\n   gap 0: before 2 → beneficial. So insert the 1 here. \n\n   The final string is 1 followed by 2 and 0 → '120'. But wait, can we do better? \n\n   Wait, the original string is '210'. The allowed swaps: between 1 and 2, and between 0 and 1. \n\n   Let's see. The original string is 2 1 0. \n\n   Can we swap the 2 and 1? Yes, since they are adjacent. So swapping them gives 1 2 0. Then, can we swap the 2 and 0? No. So the minimum string would be 120. But according to our approach, inserting the 1 into the first gap (before the 2) gives 1 followed by 2 0. Which is correct. \n\n   But what if the original fixed elements were [2,0], and the 1s are in the middle. \n\n   So, the algorithm seems to work. \n\n   Another example: input '201' → fixed elements are 2,0. The 1s count is 1. \n\n   The gaps are:\n\n   gap0: before 2 → insert 1 here. \n\n   Result: 1 2 0 → which is better than inserting into other gaps. \n\n   So the algorithm works. \n\n   Another example: input '02' → fixed elements are 0,2. The 1s count is 0. So the output is 02. But since 0 and 2 can't be swapped, the output is 02. Which is correct. \n\n   Now, what if the fixed elements are [0,2], and there are 1s. \n\n   Let's say the input is '021', which has fixed elements 0,2, and 1s count 1. \n\n   The gaps are:\n\n   gap0: before 0 → inserting here would be worse (since 0 is first). \n\n   gap1: between 0 and 2 → beneficial. Insert the 1 here. \n\n   So the final string is 0 1 2 → which is better. \n\n   So the algorithm works. \n\n   Now, what about a case where there are multiple gaps where inserting is beneficial. For example, fixed elements [0,2,0,2]. The 1s count is 3. \n\n   The gaps are:\n\n   gap0: before 0 → not beneficial. \n\n   gap1: between 0 and 2 → beneficial. \n\n   gap2: between 2 and 0 → not beneficial (since prev is 2, next is 0). \n\n   gap3: between 0 and 2 → beneficial. \n\n   gap4: after 2 → beneficial. \n\n   So, during processing, the first beneficial gap is gap1. Insert all 3 1s here. \n\n   So the final string would be 0 followed by 111, then 2, 0, 2. \n\n   Which is 0111202. \n\n   But what if there are multiple beneficial gaps. For example, if we had 3 1s and two beneficial gaps. \n\n   Let's say the fixed elements are [0,2,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible ternary string after performing allowed swaps between adjacent characters '0' and '1', and between adjacent characters '1' and '2'. The key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot be changed, but '1's can be freely moved between them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Fixed Elements**: Extract all '0's and '2's from the input string as they maintain their relative order.\n2. **Count 1s**: Count the number of '1's in the input string as they can be freely moved.\n3. **Determine Gaps**: Identify gaps where '1's can be inserted. These gaps are before the first fixed element, between consecutive fixed elements, and after the last fixed element.\n4. **Insert 1s Strategically**: Insert all '1's into the earliest possible gaps where they contribute to a smaller lexicographical order. Specifically, insert '1's before the first '2' if it exists, and between '0' and '2' pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '0' or c == '2':\n            fixed.append(c)\n        else:\n            ones += 1\n\n    # Create the list of gaps\n    gaps = []\n    gaps.append(0)  # before first element\n    for i in range(len(fixed) - 1):\n        gaps.append(i + 1)  # between elements\n    gaps.append(len(fixed))  # after last element\n\n    result = []\n    # Process each gap in order\n    for gap in gaps:\n        if gap == 0:\n            # before first element\n            if len(fixed) > 0 and fixed[0] == '2':\n                # insert all ones here\n                result.extend(['1'] * ones)\n                ones = 0\n                break\n        elif gap == len(fixed):\n            # after last element\n            if ones > 0:\n                result.extend(['1'] * ones)\n                ones = 0\n                break\n        else:\n            # between elements\n            prev = fixed[gap - 1]\n            next_val = fixed[gap]\n            if prev == '0' and next_val == '2':\n                # insert all ones here\n                result.extend(['1'] * ones)\n                ones = 0\n                break\n\n    # Now construct the final string by combining the parts\n    # We need to build the result by inserting the ones into the appropriate gap\n    # Re-initialize result\n    result = []\n    ones_inserted = 0\n    for gap in gaps:\n        if gap == 0:\n            if len(fixed) > 0 and fixed[0] == '2':\n                result.extend(['1'] * ones)\n                ones_inserted = ones\n                break\n        elif gap == len(fixed):\n            if ones > 0:\n                result.extend(['1'] * ones)\n                ones_inserted = ones\n                break\n        else:\n            prev = fixed[gap - 1]\n            next_val = fixed[gap]\n            if prev == '0' and next_val == '2':\n                result.extend(['1'] * ones)\n                ones_inserted = ones\n                break\n\n    # Now build the final string by inserting the ones into the correct position\n    # Initialize the final list\n    final = []\n    ones_left = ones\n    # Iterate through the fixed elements and gaps\n    # Find where to insert the ones\n    insert_pos = 0\n    for i in range(len(gaps)):\n        gap = gaps[i]\n        if gap == 0:\n            if len(fixed) > 0 and fixed[0] == '2':\n                insert_pos = 0\n                break\n        elif gap == len(fixed):\n            insert_pos = len(fixed)\n            break\n        else:\n            prev = fixed[gap - 1]\n            next_val = fixed[gap]\n            if prev == '0' and next_val == '2':\n                insert_pos = gap\n                break\n\n    # Now insert the ones at insert_pos\n    final = []\n    for i in range(len(fixed)):\n        if i == insert_pos:\n            final.extend(['1'] * ones)\n        final.append(fixed[i])\n    if insert_pos == len(fixed):\n        final.extend(['1'] * ones)\n\n    return ''.join(final)\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    print(min_ternary_string(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Extracting Fixed Elements**: The code first separates the '0's and '2's from the input string, as their relative order must remain unchanged.\n2. **Counting 1s**: The number of '1's is counted as they can be moved freely.\n3. **Gap Analysis**: Gaps are identified where '1's can be inserted.
