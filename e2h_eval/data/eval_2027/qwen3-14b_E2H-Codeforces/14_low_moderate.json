He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where this count equals m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Let's think about how the count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. Wait, no. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then adding 1 to n would increase the count by 1. But if n is a multiple of 25, then adding 1 would add two 5s (since 25 contributes two 5s). Wait, no. The count is calculated by summing floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + ... So when n increases by 1, the count increases by the number of times 5 divides into the new n. For example, if n is 25, then adding 1 to get 26, the count increases by 1 (since 25 contributes two 5s, but 26 contributes none. Wait, no. Let me think again. The count for 25 is floor(25/5) + floor(25/25) = 5 + 1 = 6. For 26, it's floor(26/5)=5, floor(26/25)=1, so total 6. So adding 26 doesn't change the count. But when you reach 30, which is divisible by 5 once. So the count increases by 1 when moving from 29 to 30. But for numbers like 25, when you go from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2 (since 25 adds two 5s). So the count can increase by more than one when n crosses a multiple of higher powers of 5.\n\nThis implies that for some m, there might be no n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. For example, if m is 5, then maybe there's a range of numbers where the count jumps from 5 to 7, skipping 6. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Let's see for m=5. Let's compute the count for various n:\n\nn=24: floor(24/5) =4, floor(24/25)=0 → total 4. \n\nn=25: 5 + 1 =6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer would be zero. But wait, the sample input says for m=1, the answer is 5 numbers (5-9). Let me check that.\n\nFor n=5, count is 1. For n=6, same count. Because 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1. So the count is 1. Similarly for 7,8,9. Then for 10, it's 2. So yes, the sample makes sense. So in that case, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9) with exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\nBut for m=5, there's no n. Because when you reach n=25, the count jumps from 4 (for n=24) to 6 (for n=25). So for m=5, there are zero n's. Hence, the output would be 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Now, how to find those n's?\n\nThe approach I need to take is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how? Well, first, we can find the minimal n such that the count is >=m. Then check if that count is exactly m.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are determined and efficiently finding the valid values of `n`.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n- The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is given by the formula:\n  $$\n  \\text{count}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n  $$\n  This counts the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`.\n\n- For any given `m`, there may be multiple values of `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros. However, for some values of `m`, no such `n` exists (e.g., if the count jumps from `m-1` to `m+1` without hitting `m`).\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Binary Search to Find Bounds:**\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `count(n) >= m`. Let's call this `low`.\n   - Similarly, find the smallest `n` such that `count(n) >= m + 1`. Let's call this `high`.\n\n2. **Check Valid Range:**\n   - All values of `n` in the range `[low, high - 1]` will have exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n   - If `count(low) != m`, then there are no such values of `n`.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Details**\n\n- We define a helper function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` that computes the number of trailing zeros in `n!`.\n- We use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds.\n- Finally, we check if the count at the lower bound matches `m` and output the appropriate result.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Find the smallest n where count >= m\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n        return 0, []\n\n    # Find the smallest n where count >= m+1\n    low2 = 0\n    high2 = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low2 < high2:\n        mid = (low2 + high2) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m + 1:\n            low2 = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high2 = mid\n\n    # All numbers from low to low2 - 1 have exactly m trailing zeros\n    result = list(range(low, low2))\n    return len(result), result\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input_line)\n    k, values = find_n_values(m)\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, values)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of the Code**\n\n- `count_trailing_zeros(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` using the sum of floor divisions by powers of 5.\n- `find_n_values(m)` uses binary search to find the smallest `n` with at least `m` trailing zeros (`low`) and the smallest `n` with at least `m+1` trailing zeros (`low2`). The range `[low, low2 - 1]` contains all `n` with exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n- If the count at `low` does not match `m`, then there are no such `n`, and the result is `0`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases, including when no such `n` exists for a given `m`.",
