He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n where the count of 5s in their factorial equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nWait, the key here is that the count of trailing zeros increases as n increases, but not strictly. For example, when n increases by 1, sometimes the count stays the same. Like, when you go from 4! to 5!, the count increases by 1. But when you go from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So, for some m, there might be multiple n's that result in that count.\n\nBut how to find for a given m, the possible n's?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's say I can find the smallest n where the count is exactly m. Then, check if there are consecutive numbers that also give the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, looking at the sample input. For m=1, the answer is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let me check why. The count for 5! is 1, and for 6! it's 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1, plus 6/25 is 0. So total 1). Similarly for 7,8,9. But when you hit 10, the count becomes 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0, total 2). So for m=1, there are 5 numbers. So the possible numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the idea is that for some m, there are multiple n's. But how to find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find for a given m, the possible n's. Let's think about how the count function works. The count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function as n increases. So for each m, there's a range of n's where the count is exactly m. But how long can that range be?\n\nWell, when you have a number that's a multiple of 5, but not of 25, then adding 1 to it would not change the count. But if you have a number that's a multiple of 25, then adding 1 would not change the count. Wait, no. Let's take an example. Let's say n=24: count is 4 (24//5 =4, 24//25=0). n=25: count is 6 (25//5=5, 25//25=1, total 6). So between 24 and 25, the count jumps by 2. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Because between 24 and 25, the count goes from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there are no n's. Hence, the output would be 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists n's such that count_zeros(n) = m. And if so, how many and which ones.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the possible n's that satisfy count_zeros(n) = m. How to find these n's?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, the count_zeros function is non-decreasing. So for a given m, there's a lower bound and upper bound of n's that could produce that count.\n\nBut how to find the possible n's?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose I want to find the first n where count_zeros(n) equals m. Then, check if the next numbers (n+1, etc.) also have",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values for `n` that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeroes is determined by the count of 5s.\n\n2. **Count Function**: Define a helper function to count the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.\n\n3. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to efficiently find the smallest and largest values of `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeroes. This helps in narrowing down the range of possible values for `n`.\n\n4. **Range Check**: Once the range is found, check if there are valid values of `n` within that range. If no such values exist, return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m  # Upper bound for binary search\n\n    # Find the lower bound of n where count is >= m\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    lower = low\n\n    # Check if the count at lower is not equal to m\n    if count_trailing_zeros(lower) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # Find the upper bound of n where count is <= m\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid\n    upper = low\n\n    # Collect all numbers from lower to upper inclusive\n    return list(range(lower, upper + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m_values = list(map(int, input))\n    results = []\n    for m in m_values:\n        ns = find_n_values(m)\n        results.append(str(len(ns)))\n        if len(ns) > 0:\n            results.append(' '.join(map(str, ns)))\n        else:\n            results.append('')\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5 and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_n_values(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest and largest values of `n` such that `count_trailing_zeros(n) == m`. It checks if such values exist and returns them as a list.\n\n3. **main()**: Reads input values, processes each value of `m`, and prints the results. For each `m`, it determines the valid `n` values and formats the output as specified.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the range of valid `n` values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
