The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for this to be possible. \n\nFirst, the key is to find all subsets of towns (from 1 to n) where we can assign signal powers such that:\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n- Each town 1..n is covered exactly once.\n\nSo, how can we model this? Well, the signal power of a tower at position i must be such that it covers some range, but not reach beyond. For example, if a tower is at position i, its power p must be at least 1, and the coverage is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. Wait, the problem says |c - i| < p. So the coverage is all cities c where c is in (i - p + 1, i + p - 1)? Or wait, |c - i| < p implies that c is in [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]?\n\nWait, for example, if p is 2, then |c - i| < 2 → c can be i-1, i, or i+1. Because for c = i-1: |c - i| = 1 < 2. Similarly for i+1. But for p=2, the radius is 2, but the distance is less than p. So the coverage includes cities from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). So the length is 2p-1. \n\nBut the main point here is that when setting the signal powers, each tower's coverage must not reach town 0 or n+1. Also, each town 1..n must be covered exactly once.\n\nSo, for town 0: no tower's coverage should reach it. That means, for any tower at position i, the signal power p must be such that i - p + 1 > 0 → p < i. Wait, because the coverage of a tower at i with power p includes cities up to i + p - 1. Wait, no. The coverage includes all cities c where |c - i| < p. So, for town 0, which is at position 0, we need that there is no tower i such that |0 - i| < p. Which would mean that for any tower i, p must be ≤ i. Because if p is larger than i, then |0 - i| = i < p → town 0 would be covered. So for town 0 to not be covered, all towers must have p_i ≤ i. Similarly, for town n+1, which is at position n+1, the same logic applies. For any tower at position i, the signal power must be ≤ (n+1 - i). Otherwise, if p_i > (n+1 - i), then |(n+1) - i| = n+1 - i < p_i → town n+1 is covered. \n\nSo for each tower, the maximum possible signal power is min(i, n+1 - i). But when choosing the signal powers, we need to make sure that these constraints are met. However, the problem allows us to choose any p_i as long as they are between 1 and n, but with the constraints that for each tower, p_i <= i and p_i <= (n+1 - i). Wait, but the problem says that the signal power can be any integer from 1 to n. However, if the tower is placed at position i, then to avoid covering town 0, the p_i must be <= i. Similarly, to avoid covering town n+1, p_i must be <= (n+1 - i). So for a tower at position i, the maximum allowed p_i is min(i, n+1 - i). \n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the way the coverage works is that each tower's coverage must be such that it doesn't reach the ends. So the tower's p_i must be chosen such that it doesn't cover 0 or n+1. But that's part of the setup. \n\nNow, the main challenge is to find the subsets of towers (those that are built) that can be arranged in a way that their coverage exactly covers each town once. \n\nLet me think about the structure of valid configurations. \n\nSuppose that the towers are placed in positions such that there's a way to partition the towns 1..n into ranges covered by exactly one tower. For example, each tower's coverage must be a contiguous block of towns, and these blocks must not overlap and cover all towns. \n\nWait, but the way the signal works is that a tower's coverage is a symmetric interval around itself. For example, a tower at i with power p covers [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]. So for the entire coverage to be non-overlapping and cover exactly each town once, perhaps the towers must be arranged in a way that they form a partition of the towns 1..n into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. \n\nBut how can this be achieved? Let's think of the classic problem of covering a line with intervals such that each point is covered exactly once. For example, this is similar to tiling. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid tower placements are those that form a set where each tower is responsible for covering a certain range, and these ranges are non-overlapping and cover the entire 1..n. \n\nBut how to model that. Let's think recursively. Let's imagine that the first tower is placed at position i. Then, the coverage of this tower must include some range. Let's say that the tower at i has a power p such that it covers from a to b. Then, the next tower must be placed after b, etc. \n\nAlternatively, considering that for a tower to cover some towns, and not overlap with others. Let's consider that each tower must cover a certain segment, and the segments are non-overlapping and cover the entire 1..n. Also, the tower's coverage must not reach town 0 or n+1. \n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think about the possible positions of towers. For example, if there is a tower at position i, then the coverage of that tower must start at i - p + 1 and end at i + p - 1. To ensure that this doesn't reach town 0, we must have i - p + 1 >= 1, or p <= i. Similarly, to not reach town n+1, i + p -1 <= n. So p <= n - i + 1. \n\nWait, for the tower at i, the maximum possible p is min(i, n - i + 1). For example, if i is 1, then max p is 1 (since n - 1 +1 = n, but i is 1, so min(1, n) is 1). So the tower can only have p=1, which covers [0, 2], but since town 0 is forbidden, the p must be such that the coverage doesn't reach town 0. Wait, earlier analysis said that p must be <= i. Because if p is larger than i, then the coverage would reach town 0. For example, if i=1 and p=2, then |0-1| = 1 < 2, so town 0 is covered. So yes, p must be <= i. Similarly, for the other end, p must be <= n+1 - i. \n\nSo, for a tower at i, the maximum p is min(i, n+1 - i). \n\nBut how does this relate to the coverage of the towns? Let's think of the tower's coverage. Suppose that the tower is placed at i, and we choose p such that the coverage is [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]. But for the coverage to not reach town 0 or n+1, we have that i - p + 1 >= 1 (so p <= i) and i + p - 1 <= n (so p <= n - i + 1). \n\nSo, for the tower at i, the maximum p is min(i, n - i + 1). \n\nBut when choosing p, we can choose any value between 1 and that maximum. However, the choice of p determines the coverage. \n\nBut for the problem, we need to find subsets of towers (S) such that there exists a way to assign p_i's so that each town is covered exactly once. \n\nSo what's the condition on S? Let's think about the possible ways to assign p_i's. \n\nFor example, if the towers are placed in such a way that they form a valid tiling. For example, each tower covers exactly the towns between some left and right, and adjacent towers don't overlap. \n\nOne possible approach is that the towers must be arranged such that for each tower, the coverage is exactly from its position to the next tower minus one. For example, suppose that the towers are placed at positions x_1, x_2, ..., x_k. Then, the first tower x_1 must cover from 1 to x_1 + p_1 -1. Then the next tower x_2 must start covering from x_1 + p_1 + 1, etc. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each tower must be responsible for covering a certain number of towns, and the way they are arranged is such that each tower's coverage ends exactly at the next tower's position minus one. \n\nWait, for example, consider the first example where n=2. The towers are built in 1 and 2. Then, each tower can have p=1. The coverage of tower 1 is [0, 2] but since p=1, the coverage is |c-1| < 1 → only c=1. Similarly, tower 2's coverage is only c=2. So that works. \n\nAnother example: if there's a single tower at position 2, then p can be 2. Then, the coverage is |c-2| < 2 → c can be 1, 2, 3. But since n=2, town 3 is n+1, which is not allowed. Wait, but the tower is at 2, and p=2. Then |2 - 2| < 2 → yes. |1-2| < 2 → yes. |3-2| < 2 → 1 < 2 → yes. But town 3 is n+1 (since n=2), which is not allowed. So that would be invalid. Therefore, the maximum allowed p is min(2, n+1 - 2) = min(2, 2+1-2) = min(2, 1) = 1. So p must be 1. Then the coverage is [1, 2], which is correct. \n\nSo, in this case, the tower at position 2 can only have p=1, which covers exactly town 2. \n\nBut how to model this for general cases. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the towers must be placed in such a way that they form a valid sequence where each tower covers a certain range, and these ranges are non-overlapping and cover all towns. \n\nThis seems similar to the problem of domino tiling, but perhaps more like a dynamic programming problem. \n\nLet me think about the structure of valid tower placements. For a valid configuration, the towers must be placed in such a way that there's a way to assign their signal strengths to cover exactly the towns. \n\nLet me think of the following idea: each tower must be responsible for covering exactly a certain interval, and these intervals are non-overlapping and cover the entire 1..n. \n\nMoreover, for a tower at position i, the interval it covers must be [a, b], where a <= i <= b. And for this to be possible, the tower's signal strength p must be such that b - a + 1 = 2p - 1, since the coverage is symmetric around i. Wait, no. Because the coverage is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. So the length is (i + p -1) - (i - p + 1) + 1 = 2p - 1. \n\nBut for this interval to be exactly [a, b], we need that a = i - p + 1 and b = i + p - 1. \n\nBut for the entire coverage to be exactly [a, b], and for the next tower to start at b+1. \n\nSo, for example, if a tower at i covers up to b, then the next tower must be placed at b+1, and so on. \n\nBut this suggests that the towers must be placed in a way that each tower's coverage ends exactly at the position of the next tower minus 1. \n\nAlternatively, for a tower at position i, the maximum possible coverage is that it covers up to i + p - 1. If we want this to end at some position j, then j = i + p - 1 → p = j - i + 1. \n\nBut since p must also satisfy that the coverage doesn't reach town n+1. So for the tower at i, the maximum j is i + (min(i, n+1 - i)) - 1. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can model this with dynamic programming. Let's think of dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. \n\nBut how to define the recurrence. \n\nLet me think again. For the entire problem, the towns 1..n must be covered exactly once. So the coverage must form a partition of the towns into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. \n\nEach such interval must be covered by a tower located exactly in the middle. Because the coverage is symmetric. For example, if an interval [a, b] is covered by a tower at position m, then m must be the center of the interval. So (a + b) / 2 = m. Which implies that the length of the interval is odd, and m is the midpoint. \n\nWait, because the coverage is symmetric. For example, if the tower is at position m, then the coverage includes m - p + 1 to m + p - 1. The length of this interval is 2p - 1. So the length must be odd. Therefore, the interval [a, b] must have length 2k - 1, and the tower is at the middle position. \n\nSo, for each interval [a, b] of length l (which must be odd), there's a tower at position m = a + (l-1)/2. \n\nTherefore, the valid configurations are those where the towns 1..n are partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, each of which has a tower at their midpoint. \n\nMoreover, the tower at position m must be present. \n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input where n=2, the only valid configuration is when there are towers at 1 and 2. Each of them covers an interval of length 1 (so [1,1] and [2,2]). \n\nAnother example: n=3. Suppose there is a tower at 2. Then, the coverage can be [1,3], which is length 3 (odd). So the tower at 2 can have p=2. This covers all three towns. So this is a valid configuration. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets of towns that can be partitioned into such intervals, each with a tower at the midpoint. \n\nThus, the problem becomes similar to tiling the 1..n with tiles of odd lengths, where each tile has a tower at its center. \n\nSo, the number of valid subsets is equal to the number of ways to partition the 1..n into intervals of odd lengths, and for each such interval, the center is included in the subset. \n\nBecause, for each such partition, the subset must contain all the centers of the intervals. \n\nTherefore, the total number of valid subsets is equal to the number of such tilings. \n\nFor example, for n=2, the valid tilings are:\n\n- two tiles of length 1: [1], [2]. The subset is {1, 2}.\n\n- one tile of length 2: not possible, since length must be odd. So no. \n\nSo the count is 1. \n\nWhich matches the first example where the answer is 1/4. Since there are 2^2=4 possible subsets. \n\nSimilarly, for n=3, the possible tilings are:\n\n- three tiles of length 1: {1, 2, 3}\n\n- one tile of length 3: {2}\n\nSo total 2 valid subsets. \n\nThe total number of subsets is 8. The answer for n=3 would be 2/8 = 1/4, which matches the second example. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition the n towns into intervals of odd lengths, and then multiply by 1/(2^n) (since each tower is present with probability 1/2, and the valid subsets are those that contain exactly the centers of the intervals). \n\nWait, but the number of valid subsets is equal to the number of such tilings. Because for each tiling, the subset must contain exactly the centers. So the number of valid subsets is equal to the number of tilings. \n\nSo the total number of valid subsets is f(n), where f(n) is the number of ways to partition 1..n into intervals of odd lengths. \n\nThen, the answer is f(n) / 2^n. \n\nSo the problem now is to compute f(n), then compute f(n) * inv(2^n) mod 998244353. \n\nNow, the question becomes how to compute f(n). \n\nLet's think about the recurrence for f(n). \n\nFor the first position, we can take a tile of length 1 (so the first interval is [1,1], and then solve for the remaining n-1 positions). Or take a tile of length 3 (so the first interval is [1,3], then solve for n-3), or length 5, etc. \n\nThus, the recurrence is:\n\nf(n) = sum_{k=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} f(n - (2k + 1)) }, \n\nwith base case f(0) = 1 (empty set), and f(n) = 0 for n < 0. \n\nWait, for example, for the first term, when the first interval is of length 1 (k=0), then the remaining is n-1. If the first interval is of length 3 (k=1?), then the remaining is n-3. \n\nWait, the length of the first interval is 2k + 1, where k starts from 0. So for the first interval of length 1, k=0, and for length 3, k=1, etc. \n\nSo the recurrence is f(n) = sum_{k=0}^{m} f(n - (2k+1)), where m is the maximum such that 2k+1 <=n. \n\nBut this looks like f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut this recurrence can be optimized. \n\nLet me think about small values:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = f(0) = 1\n\nf(2) = f(1) = 1 ?\n\nWait, for n=2, the possible partitions are only [1,1], [2,2], which requires that the first interval is length 1, and then the rest is length 1. So for n=2, the number of tilings is f(2) = f(1) = 1. Which matches our previous example. \n\nFor n=3, f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which matches the example. \n\nFor n=4, f(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3. \n\nLet's check this. For n=4, the possible tilings are:\n\n- [1][2][3][4] → centers 1,2,3,4.\n\n- [1][2][3,4] → no, because 3,4 is length 2 which is even. Not allowed. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the intervals must be of odd lengths. So for n=4, possible tilings are:\n\nOption 1: four intervals of 1 → valid.\n\nOption 2: one interval of 1, then one interval of 3 (positions 2-4). So the first interval is [1], then [2,3,4]. So centers are 1 and 3. \n\nOption 3: one interval of 3 (positions 1-3), then one interval of 1 (position 4). Centers are 2 and 4. \n\nOption 4: one interval of 1, then one interval of 1, then one interval of 1, then one interval of 1. No, that's already counted in option 1. \n\nWait, are there any other options? What about a single interval of length 4? No, even length. \n\nWhat about a interval of length 3 and then another of length 1. That's two options. So total 3 possibilities. Which matches f(4)=3. \n\nSo the recurrence seems to hold. \n\nSo, the recurrence is f(n) = sum_{k=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} f(n - (2k+1)) }, which is equivalent to f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for n up to 2e5? \n\nLet's think about the recurrence again. Let's see if there's a pattern here. \n\nLooking at the values:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 1\n\nf(2) = 1\n\nf(3) = 2\n\nf(4) = 3\n\nf(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 ?\n\nWait, for n=5, the possible steps are taking 1, 3, 5. \n\nSo:\n\nf(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. \n\nYes. \n\nLooking at the numbers, this seems familiar. The sequence is similar to the Fibonacci numbers, but with different steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence can be simplified. Let's see:\n\nLet me think about f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) - f(n-3) ? No, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's look for a pattern. \n\nLet me compute more terms:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 1\n\nf(2) = f(1) = 1\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2 \n\nf(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 \n\nf(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \n\nWait, why is there a f(0) here? Because for n=5, the first interval can be 1 (then n-1=4), 3 (n-3=2), or 5 (n-5=0). So yes, the sum is f(4) + f(2) + f(0). \n\nSimilarly, for f(6):\n\nIt's f(5) + f(3) + f(1) = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 \n\nf(6) = 8 \n\nf(7) = f(6) + f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 8 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 13 \n\nHmm, looking at the numbers:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 5\n6 | 8\n7 | 13\n8 | ?\n\nLet me compute f(8) = f(7) + f(5) + f(3) + f(1) = 13 +5 +2 +1 = 21 \n\nSo the sequence is 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... which looks like the Fibonacci sequence shifted. \n\nIndeed, the Fibonacci numbers starting from F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, etc. \n\nLooking at the sequence for f(n):\n\nf(0) = 1 = F(2)\n\nf(1) = 1 = F(2)\n\nf(2) = 1 = F(3) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps f(n) is equal to the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number divided by something. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the values:\n\nf(0) = 1 \n\nf(1) = 1 \n\nf(2) = 1 \n\nf(3) = 2 \n\nf(4) = 3 \n\nf(5) = 5 \n\nf(6) = 8 \n\nf(7) = 13 \n\nf(8) = 21 \n\nWhich is the same as the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, etc. \n\nSo for example, f(n) = F(n) where F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc. \n\nWait, for n=0, f(0)=1. Which is F(2) = 1. \n\nn=1: f(1) = 1 = F(2) \n\nn=2: f(2) = 1 = F(3) ?\n\nNo, F(3) is 2. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe f(n) is the (n)th Fibonacci number with a different offset. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the recurrence relation. Let's think about f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) ?\n\nWait, for n=3, according to the previous recurrence, f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. If the recurrence were f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), then for n=3 it would be f(2)+f(1)=1+1=2, which matches. For n=4, according to the original recurrence, f(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3. If using the new recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), then f(4) would be f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches. For n=5, original recurrence gives f(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. Using the new recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), it would be 3 + 2 = 5, which also matches. For n=6, original recurrence gives f(6) = f(5) + f(3) + f(1) = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Using the new recurrence f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 5 +3=8. Which matches. \n\nSo this suggests that the original recurrence can be simplified to f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nWait, how is that possible? How does the original recurrence reduce to this?\n\nLet me think again. The original recurrence for f(n) is sum_{k} f(n - (2k+1)). But when you look at the values, it seems that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nSo perhaps there's a way to prove that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nLet me try to think of a combinatorial argument. \n\nThe number of tilings for n is equal to the number of tilings where the first tile is of length 1 (and then the rest is a tiling of n-1) plus the number of tilings where the first tile is of length 2 or more. Wait, but the first tile must be of odd length. So, for the first tile, if it's of length 1, then the rest is a tiling of n-1. If it's of length 3, then the rest is a tiling of n-3. But according to the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut how can this be equal to f(n-1) + f(n-2)?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to show that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). Let me try to find a relation between the two. \n\nAssume that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nBase cases: \n\nn=0: f(0) = 1. \n\nn=1: f(1) = 1. \n\nn=2: f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2? But according to our earlier calculation, f(2) was 1. Wait, this is a contradiction. \n\nWait, this suggests that my previous assumption is wrong. \n\nWait, earlier calculations showed that for n=2, f(2) = 1. But according to f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), f(2) would be f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which contradicts. \n\nSo there's a mistake in my previous reasoning. \n\nWait, let me recheck the calculation for f(2). \n\nFor n=2, the possible tilings are:\n\nOnly possible if we split into two intervals of length 1. So the number of tilings is 1. Hence f(2) = 1. \n\nBut according to the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), this would be f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which is incorrect. \n\nSo why did the previous examples for n=3, 4, 5, 6 seem to fit? \n\nLet me recompute for n=3. According to the original recurrence, f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. If the new recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), then f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches. \n\nFor n=4, original recurrence gives f(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3. New recurrence gives f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches. \n\nFor n=5: original recurrence is f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. New recurrence f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5. Correct. \n\nFor n=2, the new recurrence gives f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2, which is wrong. \n\nSo why is there a discrepancy here? \n\nAh! Because the original recurrence for f(n) is not f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), but for n >= 2, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) - something? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me think again. \n\nThe original recurrence is f(n) = sum_{k} f(n - (2k+1)), where 2k+1 <=n. \n\nBut for n=2, the sum is for 2k+1 <=2. So k can be 0 (2*0+1=1), and 2k+1=1. Then n-1=1. So f(2) = f(1) = 1. \n\nBut according to the new recurrence, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), which for n=2 would be f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nSo the discrepancy is here. \n\nSo why does the new recurrence work for n >= 3 but not for n=2? \n\nLet me think of the recurrence again. \n\nMaybe there's a way to find that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n >= 2, but with different initial conditions. \n\nLet me see:\n\nIf for n=0, f(0) = 1.\n\nn=1: f(1) = 1.\n\nn=2: f(2) = f(1) = 1.\n\nn=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nn=4: f(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nn=5: f(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nBut according to f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), for n=3, it would be f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which matches. For n=4: f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3. Which matches. For n=5: f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5. Which matches. For n=2: f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2, but actual value is 1. \n\nSo why is there a discrepancy here? It seems that for n >= 3, the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) holds. But for n=2, it doesn't. \n\nBut why? \n\nLet me think of the original recurrence for f(n). Let's try to find a relation between f(n) and f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nLet me consider that for any n >= 1, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) - something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I derived the recurrence. \n\nLet me think of the original recurrence again. For f(n), the number of ways to tile n towns. \n\nThe first tile can be of length 1, which contributes f(n-1) ways. Or it can be of length 3, contributing f(n-3) ways. Or length 5, etc. \n\nBut how to relate this to f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nAlternatively, think of the following: for any tiling of n towns, either the first tile is of length 1, or it is of length >= 3. \n\nBut how does that help?\n\nIf the first tile is of length 1, then the rest is a tiling of n-1 towns. \n\nIf the first tile is of length >=3, then what? Let's imagine that we have a tiling where the first tile is of length 2k+1 >=3. \n\nBut how can we relate this to f(n-2)? \n\nLet me think of the following transformation: consider the tiling where the first tile is of length 2k+1 >=3. Let's imagine that we replace the first tile with a tile of length 1, and then add a tile of length 2k+1-1 = 2k. But that's not possible since the length must be odd. \n\nAlternatively, think of the first tile being of length 2k+1 >=3. Then, the first tile's length is 2k+1 = 2(k+1) -1. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to find a bijection between tilings of n-2 and tilings where the first tile is of length >=3. \n\nAlternatively, think about the following: for any tiling of n-2 towns, we can add two towns to the beginning. For example, if we have a tiling of n-2 towns, then adding a tile of length 2 (but that's even, which is not allowed). So this doesn't help. \n\nAlternatively, think of the following: consider the first tile of length",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set their signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, while each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Configurations**: The valid configurations of towers can be modeled using dynamic programming. The key insight is that the number of valid configurations corresponds to a sequence similar to the Fibonacci numbers, adjusted for our specific constraints.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: The number of valid ways to partition the towns into intervals of odd lengths (each covered by a tower at the midpoint) follows a recurrence relation similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This allows us to compute the number of valid configurations efficiently.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure efficient computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    # Precompute f(n) where f(n) is the number of valid tilings\n    max_n = n\n    dp = [0] * (max_n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    if max_n >= 1:\n        dp[1] = 1\n    if max_n >= 2:\n        dp[2] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(3, max_n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD\n    \n    # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n    power = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_power = pow(power, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    result = (dp[n] * inv_power) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: We initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid ways to partition the first `i` towns into intervals of odd lengths.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD` is used to compute the number of valid configurations efficiently. This relation is derived from the observation that the number of valid tilings follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The result is computed as the product of the number of valid configurations and the modular inverse of $2^n$ modulo 998244353. This gives the required probability in the form of a fraction modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, making it suitable even for large values of n up to 200,000.",
