Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Vanya has some cards, and the sum of the found ones needs to be zero. The task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero. The cards can have any integer between -x and x, inclusive. \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem properly. Let me rephrase it. The sum of the found cards is S. We need to add some cards (each with values between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes zero. The question is: what's the minimum number of cards needed?\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of elements (each in the range [-x, x]) that sum up to -S. Because adding those elements to the existing sum S would make it zero.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the given numbers. Let's call it current_sum.\n2. The target is to reach a total sum of zero, so the required sum from the new cards is -current_sum. Let's call this target = -current_sum.\n3. Now, find the minimal number of cards needed to sum up to target, where each card's value is between -x and x.\n\nBut how do I find that minimal number?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. For example, if target is zero, then no cards are needed. But that's only if the current_sum was already zero. So in that case, answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, for target not zero. Let's think about the maximum possible value that can be achieved with k cards. Since each card can contribute at most x (if we take positive) or -x (if negative). But since we need to reach target, which could be positive or negative.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the target could be positive or negative. Let's think of the absolute value. Let me consider the absolute value of target, because the minimal number of cards depends on that.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose target is T. Let me assume T is positive. Then, each card can contribute up to x. So, the minimal number of cards needed is ceil(T / x). But wait, because if T is divisible by x, then exactly T/x cards. Otherwise, T/x rounded up. But wait, for example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Then 5/2 is 2.5, so ceil gives 3. Which would be 2+2+1. But since each card can be up to x. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, so ceil is 2. Which would be 2 + 1, but each card can be up to 2. So two cards: 2 and 1. But the problem allows any numbers between -x and x. So yes. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x).\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Well, the same logic applies. Because if T is negative, say -5, then the minimal number of cards is ceil(5/x), since each card can contribute up to -x. So the absolute value of T divided by x, rounded up.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is ceil( |target| / x ). But wait, let's check the examples.\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. The sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So target is -2. The absolute value is 2. Divided by x=2, gives 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2: 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. Target is 4. Absolute value is 4. Divided by x=3 is 4/3 = 1.333..., ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nAnother example: if target is 0, answer is 0. If target is 5 and x is 5, then 1 card. If target is 6 and x is 5, then 2 cards (5 + 1, but 1 is allowed as it's within x=5).\n\nSo this seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, what about when target is 0? Then the answer is 0. So the general approach is:\n\nCalculate the target as -sum of the found cards. If target is zero, return 0. Else, compute the absolute value of target, then divide by x, take the ceiling of that. That's the minimal number of cards.\n\nBut how to compute the ceiling of division in Python?\n\nWell, for integers a and b, ceil",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards becomes zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the current sum to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Handle Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero target sum, compute the minimum number of cards required by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value on a card (x), rounding up to the nearest integer. This is because each card can contribute at most x towards balancing the sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        if len(parts) < 3:\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, parts[:2])\n        numbers = list(map(int, parts[2:]))\n        current_sum = sum(numbers)\n        target = -current_sum\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        abs_target = abs(target)\n        min_cards = math.ceil(abs_target / x)\n        print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into lines for processing.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the given numbers is computed to determine the current sum.\n- **Target Calculation**: The target sum required to balance the current sum to zero is calculated as the negative of the current sum.\n- **Zero Check**: If the target sum is zero, immediately return 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n- **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by x ensures we account for the maximum possible contribution per card, thus determining the minimum number of cards required efficiently.",
