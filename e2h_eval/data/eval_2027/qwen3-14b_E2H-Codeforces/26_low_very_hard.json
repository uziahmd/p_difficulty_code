Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D values. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The problem says that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So, x is between A and B, inclusive. Then y is between B and C, inclusive. And z is between C and D, inclusive. Also, since the triangle is non-degenerate, the triangle inequality must hold: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition here is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order x ≤ y ≤ z, the only condition needed is x + y > z. Because z is the largest side, the other inequalities (x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically hold if x and y are positive.\n\nSo the main condition is x + y > z. Now, the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x + y > z. Also, note that y must be at least B, which is ≥ x (since A ≤ x ≤ B). Also, since y is between B and C, and z is between C and D, so y ≤ C ≤ z. So for each x and y, we need to find the number of z's such that z is between max(C, ... ) and D, but also z < x + y. Wait, no: z has to be ≥ C and ≤ D, but also z < x + y. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in the range [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. But wait, since z must be ≥ C, but also z must be less than x + y. So the count of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor each possible x in [A, B], and for each possible y in [B, C], compute the number of z's in [C, D] such that z < x + y. Then sum all these counts.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that B and C can be up to 5e5, so if we do a double loop over x and y, that would be O(B * C) operations. For example, if B and C are 5e5 each, that's 2.5e11 operations, which is way too slow. That's impossible to compute in time. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the challenge is to find a way to compute the total without iterating through all x and y. Let's think about how to optimize this.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Since x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. But for each x and y, the value of x + y can vary. For each possible x and y, the z's allowed are those between C and min(D, x + y - 1). So for each pair (x, y), the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me rephrase the problem. Let me consider that for each x and y, the minimal value of x + y is when x is A and y is B. The maximum is when x is B and y is C. So x + y ranges from (A + B) to (B + C). \n\nBut for each x and y, the threshold is x + y. Let me denote S = x + y. Then for each S, the z must be < S. But z is at least C and at most D. So the number of z's is max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, S -1) >= C. Which simplifies to:\n\nIf S - 1 < C → then no z's. So the count is 0.\n\nElse, the count is min(D, S - 1) - C + 1 = min(D - C + 1, S - 1 - C + 1) = min(D - C + 1, S - C).\n\nWait, because S-1 - C +1 = S - C. So the count is max(0, min(D - C + 1, S - C)).\n\nBut S is x + y. So for each",
    "response": "To solve the problem of counting non-degenerate triangles with sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ under the constraints $A \\le x \\le B \\le y \\le C \\le z \\le D$, we need to ensure that the triangle inequality holds, specifically $x + y > z$.
