    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the minimum number of nodes required for a p-reachable directed graph and then determine the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs. \n\nFirst, let me understand what a p-reachable graph is. The definition says that it has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So for each such pair, both u can reach v and v can reach u. And we need exactly p of these.\n\nThe first part is to find the minimal number of nodes n such that there exists a graph with exactly p such pairs. Then, among all such minimal n graphs, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the graph that minimizes the number of nodes. Since the problem is about reachability, maybe we can model this with strongly connected components (SCCs). Because if two nodes are in the same SCC, they are mutually reachable. So, perhaps the way to get the required p pairs is by having certain components where each pair contributes to the count.\n\nWait, but the p pairs are ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v. So for each pair of nodes in the same SCC, if u < v, then that contributes 1 to p. So the total number of such pairs is the sum over all SCCs of C(k, 2), where k is the size of the component. Because each component contributes C(k, 2) pairs of nodes (u, v) where u < v and they are in the same component (hence mutually reachable).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of nodes n such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) across all components equals p. And then, given that, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs possible.\n\nBut how do we arrange the components? Because the way the components are arranged (like their order in a DAG) affects the number of unidirectional pairs. For example, if you have two components A and B, where all edges go from A to B, then any pair (a, b) where a is in A and b in B would be unidirectional (since there's a path from a to b, but not vice versa). Similarly, pairs (b, a) would not be unidirectional since there's no path from b to a. So the number of unidirectional pairs depends on how components are connected.\n\nBut the first part is to find the minimal n. Let's focus on that first.\n\nTo minimize n, given that the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all components must be exactly p. We need to choose the sizes of the components such that this sum is p, and the total number of nodes is minimized.\n\nThis seems like a problem of choosing integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m such that sum_{i} C(k_i, 2) = p, and sum k_i is minimized.\n\nBut how do we choose these k_i's?\n\nThe optimal way to minimize the sum of k_i's given that sum C(k_i, 2) is fixed is to make the k_i's as large as possible. Wait, no. Wait, for a fixed sum of C(k_i, 2), the minimal sum of k_i is achieved when the components are as large as possible. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think about the case where we need to reach a certain sum. For example, suppose p=3. Then C(3,2)=3, so one component of size 3 gives sum 3, which uses 3 nodes. Alternatively, if you split into 2 and 2, then sum is C(2,2) + C(2,2) = 1+1=2 < 3. So that's not enough. But if you have a component of 2 and another of 3, sum is 1 + 3=4>3. So for p=3, the minimal n is 3. Which matches the sample input's first case.\n\nAnother example: sample input 4. Output is 5 6. Let's see. For p=4. How to get sum of C(k_i, 2) =4.\n\nPossible options:\n\n- One component of size 4: C(4,2)=6>4. Not good.\n\n- One component of size 3 (C(3,2)=3) plus one component of size 2 (C(2,2)=1). Total sum is 3+1=4. Total nodes is 3+2=5. That's the minimal. So that's why sample input 4 outputs 5 as the minimal number of nodes. Then, the second part is to compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph.\n\nSo the first part seems to be: find",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to form a directed graph with exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and both `u` and `v` are mutually reachable. Additionally, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we need to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Pairs**: For a directed graph, if two nodes `u` and `v` are in the same strongly connected component (SCC), they are mutually reachable. The number of such pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` in an SCC of size `k` is given by the combination formula `C(k, 2) = k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n\n2. **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes for a given `p`, we need to maximize the size of components contributing to the sum of `C(k, 2)`. This involves finding the largest possible values of `k` such that their contributions sum up to `p`.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimal number of nodes is determined, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs can be derived by considering how components are structured. The optimal structure involves arranging components in a way that maximizes the number of one-way paths between nodes from different components.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    # Find minimal number of nodes\n    n = 0\n    remaining = p\n    components = []\n\n    # We want to use as large components as possible to minimize total nodes\n    # Start from the largest possible k such that C(k,2) <= remaining\n    while remaining > 0:\n        k = 1\n        while k * (k - 1) // 2 <= remaining:\n            k += 1\n        k -= 1\n        components.append(k)\n        remaining -= k * (k - 1) // 2\n        n += k\n\n    # Now compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs\n    # The maximum occurs when the components are arranged in a DAG with all edges going from earlier components to later ones\n    # The number of unidirectional pairs is sum_{i < j} (size_i * size_j)\n    # Because for each pair of nodes (u in component i, v in component j), there is a path from u to v but not vice versa\n    # So compute this sum\n\n    total_unidir = 0\n    sum_sizes = 0\n    for size in components:\n        total_unidir += size * sum_sizes\n        sum_sizes += size\n\n    print(f\"{n} {total_unidir}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `p`.\n2. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The algorithm iteratively finds the largest possible component sizes such that the sum of combinations `C(k, 2)` equals `p`, minimizing the total number of nodes.\n3. **Calculating Unidirectional Pairs**: After determining the component sizes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is computed by considering all possible pairs of nodes from different components arranged in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, ensuring maximum one-way paths.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal node count and the maximum unidirectional pairs using combinatorial analysis and properties of directed graphs.",
