A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per person such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input consists of several integers: n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, nl (ml per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl ml?\n\nYes. Because for each toast, all friends are having one. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices per toast is n slices. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the total available drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal available lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal available salt: p grams.\n\nThen, for each resource, compute how many toasts can be made given that resource.\n\nFor example:\n\nDrink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast takes n * nl ml. So max toasts from drink is total_drink // (n * nl).\n\nLime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast needs n slices. So max toasts from limes is total_slices // n.\n\nSalt: total_salt = p. Each toast needs n * np grams. So max toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows that in the first example:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. For 3 friends, total per toast is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nThe limes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Each toast needs 3 slices (n=3). So 80 /3 is 26.666, floor 26. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait in the note, they say that the limes are enough for 10 *8=80 toasts. Oh, but that's perhaps a mistake? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, each toast requires n slices. So for 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 /3 = 26.666, which would be 26 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the min is 6, 80, 100, then divided by 3 (the number of friends) gives 2. Wait, why?\n\nWait no. Wait the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3. Wait why?\n\nAh, because the initial calculation for the drink was 20 /3 =6. So that's the total number of toasts possible from the drink. But why is that divided by 3?\n\nWait no. Let me recheck the note.\n\nIn the note, the sample input is 3 friends. The total drink is 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires each friend to have 3 ml. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. So total toasts possible from drink is 20 // 9 = 2 (since 2*9=18, 3*9=27>20). But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Wait that seems conflicting.\n\nWait wait, what's the correct way here? Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. So for the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. The total drink is 20 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the note says that it's 20/3=6. That's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait that seems to suggest that the drink is being divided by 3 (nl) to get the number of toasts. But why?\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl ml. But the note says that the total drink is 20 ml, and it's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, each friend uses 3 ml. So for 3 friends, per toast, it's 3 * 3 = 9 ml. But 20 / 9 is 2.222. But the note says 20 / 3 = 6. So why is that?\n\nWait perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is considering per toast per friend, but the calculation is done per toast. Let me check the note again.\n\nIn the note, the sample input is 3 friends, and the drink is 20 ml. The note says that it's enough for 20/3=6 toasts. That would imply that each toast requires 3 ml per friend. So for one toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, but the note says 6. So this is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the note is incorrect? Or perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. So for the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. The total drink is 20 ml. So 20//9 = 2. So the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if each toast requires 3 ml total, not per friend. So that suggests that perhaps the problem statement is different. Maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the total per toast is nl ml. That would be a misunderstanding.\n\nBut that can't be. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for a single toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total for that toast is n * nl ml. So the note must have an error. But that's impossible, since the sample output is 2. So according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So that suggests that the initial calculation is 6, which is 20 / 3. So that implies that the total drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. So that suggests that the problem statement is perhaps that each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the total for the toast is nl ml. That would be a contradiction with the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me read the note again. The note says:\n\nthe drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. How?\n\nIf each toast requires 3 ml per friend, then for 3 friends, per toast, it's 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that 20 / 3 is 6 toasts. Which would be if per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be the case if each toast requires nl ml total, not per friend. So perhaps the problem statement is different.\n\nWait maybe the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for one toast, the total amount is n * nl. But the note says that the drink is 20ml, and that's enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would be possible if each toast requires 3 ml total. So that would mean that the problem statement is different. Maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters total, not per friend.\n\nBut that contradicts the problem statement. So what is the correct way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. Let me check the sample input and output again.\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSample output is 2.\n\nAccording to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So the 6 comes from 20 /3 =6. Which would be the case if the total drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. So perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters in total, not per friend. That would explain the note.\n\nBut that contradicts the problem statement. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is 20ml. So 20 / (n * nl) = 20/(3 *3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2 toasts. Which would be the correct value. But the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which suggests that the calculation is 20 / nl = 20/3 = 6. So why is that?\n\nThis discrepancy indicates that I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me look at the sample input and output again. The sample output is 2. According to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So the 6 is the number of toasts possible from the drink. But according to the correct calculation, it should be 20/(3*3) = 2.222 → 2. So why is the note saying 6?\n\nWait perhaps the note is considering the number of toasts per friend. For example, the total number of toasts that can be made is 6, and then divided by the number of friends (3), giving 2 per friend. But that would be incorrect. Because the problem says that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total drink required is t * n * nl. So the total available drink must be >= t * n * nl. So the maximum t is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) ). \n\nBut according to the note, the sample calculation is 20 /3 =6. Which would be t = 6. But then, the total drink required would be 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml. Which is way more than 20. So that's impossible.\n\nSo there's something wrong here. Either the note is wrong, or I have a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total drink required is t * nl * n. Which would be the same as before.\n\nBut according to the note, the sample input's drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be t=6. So 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml. But the available drink is 20. Which is impossible. So the note must be wrong? Or perhaps the problem is different.\n\nWait maybe the problem is that the note is considering the number of toasts per friend. For example, each friend can make t toasts, and the total drink is n * t * nl. So for the sample input, the total drink is 20. So 3 * t * 3 = 9t <= 20 → t ≤ 2.222. So t is 2. Which is the sample output. So the note's explanation is wrong. But why does the sample output match the note's calculation?\n\nThe note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So 6 is the drink's contribution. How can that be?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the note is calculating the total number of toasts that can be made, not per friend. For example, if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is t * n. But that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nNo, the problem says that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is t. Because each toast is made by all friends. For example, if there are 3 friends and they make 2 toasts, then each friend makes 2 toasts. So for each toast, all friends are participating. So the total number of toasts is t, and each toast requires n * nl ml of drink. So the total drink required is t * n * nl.\n\nSo for the first sample, the available drink is 20. So t * 3 *3 <=20 → t <= 2.222 → t=2. Which is the sample output. But the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts, which would be t=6. But that would require 6 *3*3=54 ml, which is more than 20. So that's impossible.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the note. But the sample output is correct. So why does the note say that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 =2? Because 6/3 is 2. So perhaps the note is actually calculating the total number of toasts that can be made (t_total) and then dividing by the number of friends to get per person toasts. But that would be incorrect. For example, if the total number of toasts is t_total, then each friend makes t_total toasts. So the total drink required is t_total * n * nl. So the maximum t_total is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) ). Then the per person toasts is t_total. Because each friend makes t_total toasts. So that would be the case. But that contradicts the note's explanation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the note is wrong, and the correct approach is to calculate the maximum t such that:\n\nt * n * nl <= total_drink\n\nt * n <= total_slices\n\nt * n * np <= total_salt\n\nSo the answer is the minimum of (total_drink // (n * nl), total_slices // n, total_salt // (n * np)).\n\nLet's apply this to the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink = 4 *5 =20\n\ntotal_slices = 10 *8 =80\n\ntotal_salt = 100.\n\nn=3, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo:\n\ndrink: 20 / (3 *3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2.\n\nslices: 80 /3 = 26.666 → 26.\n\nsalt: 100/(3 *1) = 33.333 → 33.\n\nminimum is 2. Which matches the sample output. So the correct answer is 2. But the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So where does the 6 come from?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the note is considering the total number of toasts that can be made, and then dividing by the number of friends. But that would be wrong. For example, the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be the case if the total drink is divided by nl (3) instead of n*nl (9). So for example, 20 /3 =6. So if that is the case, then the total number of toasts is 6, but then each friend would make 6 /n toasts. Which would be 6/3=2. Which is the sample output.\n\nBut that would be incorrect, because the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total drink is t * n * nl. So the correct way is to calculate t as the minimum between the three resources, each computed as:\n\ndrink: (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nslices: (c*d) // n\n\nsalt: p // (n * np)\n\nthen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is calculated as (k*l) / nl = 20 /3 =6. Which is then divided by n (3) to get 2. Which is the same as the correct approach. So why is the note's calculation like that?\n\nBecause the note is explaining it as follows:\n\nthe drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. But that's not the case. It's the total number of toasts that can be made if each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the note is dividing by nl instead of n * nl. So perhaps the note is wrong, but the actual calculation is correct.\n\nBut regardless, the sample output is 2. So according to the correct calculation, the code should compute the three values as:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nanswer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nSo let's test this with the first sample:\n\ndrink_toasts = (4 *5) // (3 *3) = 20//9 =2.\n\nlime_toasts = (10*8) //3 =80//3=26.\n\nsalt_toasts = 100//(3*1)= 33.333 → 33.\n\nmin(2,26,33) is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThe note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. Which suggests that the drink_toasts was 6, which is (k*l)/nl =20/3=6.666 → 6. Then divided by n=3. So 6//3=2.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the note is using a wrong calculation for drink_toasts. So perhaps the note is wrong, but the code should follow the correct calculation.\n\nBut how can we reconcile the sample with the note? Well, the note's explanation is wrong. But the sample output is correct.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate the three values as described.\n\nSo the code should:\n\nRead n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l.\n\ntotal_slices = c * d.\n\ntotal_salt = p.\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nLet's test this against the first sample.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ndrink_toasts = (4*5)/(3*3) =20/9=2.222 → 2.\n\nlime_toasts = (10*8)/3 =80/3=26.666 →26.\n\nsalt_toasts = 100/(3*1) =33.333 →33.\n\nmin is 2. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: ['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink 100*10=1000.\n\nnl=4 → drink_toasts = 1000/(5 *4) = 1000/20 =50.\n\nlime: c=1, d=19 → total slices 19. lime_toasts = 19 //5 =3.8 →3.\n\nsalt: p=90, np=3 → 90/(5*3) = 90/15=6. So min(50,3,6) →3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink 1,000,000.\n\nnl=50 → drink_toasts = 1e6/(10*50) = 1e6/(500) = 2000.\n\nlime: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575 slices. lime_toasts = 575//10 =57.5 →57.\n\nsalt: p=1, np=1 → 1/(10*1) = 0.1 →0. So min(2000,57,0) →0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, read the input line, split into integers.\n\nThen compute the three values.\n\nBut note that the input is given as multiple lines? Or is it one line per test case?\n\nWait the input description says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nWait the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps the actual input is one line per test case. Wait looking back:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nSo each input is one line. The sample shows three lines, but that's probably three separate test cases. So the code should read one line from stdin, split into the eight integers, process them, and output the result.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided three lines, but the code should process each line as a separate test case. However, the problem says that the input is one line. So perhaps the sample input is showing three different test cases, each on their own line. But the code should read one line per test case.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the code should read one line, split into the eight integers, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, split into the eight numbers, compute as per above.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen compute the three values.\n\nFor example:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut let's check for possible division by zero. However, the problem states that all input numbers are positive integers. So n is at least 1, nl is at least 1, etc. So no division by zero.\n\nTesting this code with the first sample input line:\n\nInput line is \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nWhich gives the correct result of 2.\n\nAnother sample input line: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink=100*10=1000.\n\ndrink_toasts = 1000/(5*4) = 1000/20=50.\n\nlime_toasts: c=1, d=19 → 1*19=19 slices. 19//5 =3.\n\nsalt_toasts: p=90, n*np=5*3=15 → 90//15=6. min(50,3,6) →3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input line: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\ntotal_drink =1000 *1000 = 1,000,000.\n\ndrink_toasts = 1e6 / (10 *50) = 1e6 /500 = 2000.\n\nlime_toasts = 25 *23 =575 //10 →57.\n\nsalt_toasts: 1 // (10 *1) = 0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle multiple test cases? Or just one?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the input is a single line. So the code should read one line and output one integer.\n\nBut the sample shows three input lines. However, perhaps the sample is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle one test case per run.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So the code reads one line, processes it, outputs one integer.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nThus, the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into variables, compute the three values, take the min, print.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts))\n\nThat's the code.\n\nLet me check for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: when one of the resources is zero. But according to the input constraints, all numbers are at least 1. So no.\n\nAnother case: when the division is exact.\n\nE.g., n=2, k=1, l=4, nl=2. So total_drink is 4. n * nl = 4. So drink_toasts is 1.\n\nAnother case: when the total slices is exactly divisible by n.\n\nLike c=2, d=3, n=2. total_slices =6. 6//2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The solution involves calculating how many toasts can be made based on each resource and taking the minimum of these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available, the total number of lime slices available, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available, considering the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total number of lime slices available, considering the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available, considering the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is determined by taking the minimum value from the three calculated constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, number of bottles, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Total Resources Calculation**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Calculated as the product of the number of bottles and milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Calculated as the product of the number of limes and slices per lime.\n   - **Total Salt**: Directly taken from the input.\n3. **Toast Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Divides the total drink by the product of the number of friends and milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Divides the total number of lime slices by the number of friends.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Divides the total salt by the product of the number of friends and grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value among the three constraints, ensuring that each friend can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limit.",
