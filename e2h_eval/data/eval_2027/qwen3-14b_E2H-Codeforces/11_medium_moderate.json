A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible value determined by the available resources divided by the number of friends, right?\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt. But since there are n friends, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend makes one toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs their own portion. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl ml. Because each friend uses nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (one per friend), and n * np grams of salt (each friend uses np grams).\n\nSo the total number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute, and then take the minimum of those.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\nDrink: total available is k * l ml. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the maximum possible toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, if it's not divisible, we take the floor division.\n\nLime slices: total slices is c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So maximum toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: total is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml, so for 3 friends, 3 * 3 =9 per toast. Then 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note where they say 20/3=6 toasts. Wait, wait, no. Wait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Oh wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts\". Wait that suggests that per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, each friend uses 3 ml. So total per toast is 3 * 3 =9 ml. But 20 / 3 is 6.666... which would be 6 toasts. Wait why is that? Oh, perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says: \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" So according to the note, each toast requires 3 ml of drink. But how?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for one toast, each friend has one portion. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. But in the example, nl is 3. So for one toast, 3 friends * 3 ml =9 ml. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. That would be 20 /3 =6.666, which would be 6 toasts. But 6 toasts would require 6 * 9 =54 ml. But 20 is less than 54. That doesn't make sense. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs their own portion. So if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. So total for all friends is n * t * nl ml.\n\nBut the total drink available is k * l.\n\nSo the total drink must be >= n * t * nl.\n\nSimilarly for the lime slices: each toast per friend requires a slice. So for t toasts, each friend needs t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. And the total available is c * d.\n\nFor salt: each toast per friend requires np grams. So total salt needed is n * t * np. Available is p grams.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nk*l >= n * t * nl\n\nc*d >= n * t \n\np >= n * t * np \n\nSo t must be such that all three inequalities are satisfied.\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of:\n\nfloor( (k*l) / (n * nl) ), \n\nfloor( (c*d) / n ), \n\nfloor( p / (n * np) )\n\nSo in the first example:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, so k*l =20. n * nl is 3 * 3 =9. 20//9 is 2. \n\nc*d is 10 *8=80. divided by n=3, 80//3 is 26. So 26. \n\np is 100, divided by n * np =3*1=3. 100//3 is 33. So the min of 2, 26, 33 is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. That seems conflicting. Wait why does the note say that? Let me check the note again.\n\nNote says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why is the drink enough for 6 toasts? According to the note, they divide 20 by 3. Where does that 3 come from? Oh, maybe the note is considering per toast per friend. Like, for each toast, each friend uses 3 ml. So for one toast, total drink is 3 * 3 =9 ml. But the note says 20 /3 =6. Which would be 20/(3) =6.666. So that's 6 toasts. But that would be 6 * 3 =18 ml. Which is less than 20. But why is the note dividing by 3?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is thinking that the total number of toasts is t, and each toast requires per friend nl ml. So total drink is t * nl * n. So solving for t: t = (k*l) / (n * nl). So in the first example, (4*5) =20. Divided by (3 * 3) =9. 20/9 is 2.222, so floor is 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that the note is thinking that the total drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. Which would be wrong. But why is that?\n\nWait maybe the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total for all friends is n * t * nl.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is 20 ml, and that it is enough to make 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 6 toasts. Let's compute that: 6 toasts would require 3 friends * 6 toasts * 3 ml per toast per friend = 3*6*3 =54 ml. But 20 is less than that. So that can't be. Therefore, the note must have a mistake? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is considering that for each toast, the total amount of drink per toast is nl. But that would be per friend. So for example, if there are t toasts, each friend makes t toasts, so each friend needs t * nl ml. So total is n * t * nl. So the note's calculation is wrong. But according to the sample input, the correct answer is 2. Which is the minimum of (20/(3*3) = 2.222, 80/3=26.666, 100/(3*1)=33.333). So the minimum is 2. So the note's explanation is wrong? That seems unlikely. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 =6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 =80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 =100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 =2.\"\n\nWait that suggests that the drink can make 6 toasts, but then divided by 3 friends gives 2. But why is the drink able to make 6 toasts? How is that calculated?\n\nAh! Oh! Maybe the note is thinking that each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, the total is nl * n. But the note says that the drink is 20 ml, and that it's enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl = 3, but divided by n=3 friends. So per toast, the total is 3 ml. But that would be nl = 1 per friend. But in the sample input, nl is 3. So this seems conflicting.\n\nWait the sample input is:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', ...]\n\nSo for the first input line, n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the note says that the drink is 4*5=20 ml. For each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, each of the 3 friends needs 3 ml. So total per toast is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which is 20 divided by 3. So that would be 6.666, but why?\n\nUnless the note is considering that each toast requires per friend nl ml, but the total number of toasts per friend is t. So for each friend, they can make t toasts, requiring t * nl ml. So for all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. But the note is calculating the total drink divided by nl, which would be (k*l)/nl = 20 /3 =6.666, which is 6. Then, since there are 3 friends, the number of toasts per friend is 6 /3 = 2. Which is the correct answer. \n\nSo that's the way the note is thinking. So the note is taking the total drink divided by nl, then dividing by the number of friends. So that gives the number of toasts per friend. \n\nBut why is that correct? Let me think again. \n\nTotal drink is k*l. Each toast per friend requires nl ml. So for each friend, if they make t toasts, they need t * nl ml. So for all friends, the total is n * t * nl. So:\n\nk*l >= n * t * nl => t <= (k*l) / (n * nl). \n\nWhich is the same as t <= (k*l / nl) / n. \n\nSo the note's approach is to calculate (k*l / nl) which is 20/3 =6.666, then divide by n=3, giving 2.222, which is floored to 2. So the note's approach is correct. \n\nSo the note is calculating for each resource, how many total toasts can be made across all friends, and then dividing by the number of friends. \n\nSo for drink, the total possible toasts (across all friends) is (k*l) // nl. Then divide by n to get per friend toasts. But that's equivalent to (k*l) // (n * nl). Because (k*l) // nl divided by n is the same as (k*l) // (n * nl) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me take an example. Suppose k*l is 20, nl is 3. Then (20 //3) =6. Divided by n=3, gives 2. Which is same as (20 // (3*3)) = 20//9=2. So in that case, same result. But what if the numbers are different? Let's say k*l is 10, nl is 3. Then 10//3=3. Divided by n=3 gives 1. But (10) // (3 *3) =10//9=1. Same result. Another example: k*l is 9, nl is 3. 9//3=3 divided by 3 is 1. 9//9=1. Same. Another example: k*l is 10, nl is 3, n=2. So (10//3) is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5, which is floored to 1. (10) // (2*3) =10//6=1. Same. \n\nSo in general, (total_drink // nl) // n equals (total_drink) // (n * nl). Because integer division is floor division. So the two approaches are equivalent. \n\nSo the note's approach is correct. So the way to compute the maximum number of toasts per friend is to compute for each resource:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // nl \n\nlime_toasts = (c*d) // 1 (since each toast per friend requires one slice. So total slices is c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So total toasts possible is (c*d) // n. Wait, but according to the note's approach, for limes, it's (c*d) // 1 (since per toast per friend, one slice. So total toasts across all friends is (c*d) // 1. Then divided by n. Which would be (c*d) // n. Which is same as (c*d) // n. So same as before.\n\nWait, for limes, the total number of slices is c*d. Each toast requires n slices (each friend has one slice per toast). So the total number of toasts possible is (c*d) // n. Which is the same as (c*d) // n. So the note's approach is to compute for limes (c*d) // 1 (since per toast, per friend, one slice. So total slices needed for t toasts is n * t. So t can be up to (c*d) // n. Which is same as (c*d) // n. \n\nSo the note's approach is to compute for each resource, the maximum number of total toasts across all friends, then divide by n to get per friend toasts. \n\nSo the three values are:\n\ndrink_total = (k*l) // nl \n\nlime_total = (c*d) // 1 \n\nsalt_total = p // np \n\nthen, the maximum toasts per friend is min(drink_total, lime_total, salt_total) // n \n\nWait, no. Because the drink_total is (k*l)//nl, which is the maximum number of toasts across all friends (since each toast requires nl per friend, and total is k*l). So for example, if drink_total is 6, that's the maximum number of total toasts across all friends. So per friend, it's 6//n. \n\nBut in the first example, drink_total is 20//3=6. lime_total is 10*8=80//1=80. salt_total is 100//1=100. Then min(6, 80, 100) is 6. Then 6//3=2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nCompute for each resource the maximum number of total toasts (across all friends) possible, then take the minimum of those three numbers, then divide by n (the number of friends) and take the floor.\n\nBut wait, why is that equivalent to the previous approach?\n\nBecause:\n\ndrink_total = (k*l) // nl \n\nwhich is the maximum total toasts across all friends. Then, the per friend toasts is drink_total // n. \n\nBut earlier approach was (k*l) // (n * nl) which is same as ( (k*l) // nl ) // n ?\n\nYes. Because (a // b) // c is equal to a // (b * c) when a, b, c are positive integers. \n\nLet me check with numbers. Let a=20, b=3, c=3. \n\na//b is 6, then divided by c is 2. Which is same as 20 // (3*3) =20//9=2. \n\nAnother example: a=10, b=3, c=3. \n\na//b is 3, divided by c is 1. 10//(3*3) is 10//9=1. Same. \n\nAnother example: a=9, b=3, c=3. 9//3=3, divided by 3 is 1. 9//9=1. Same. \n\nAnother example: a=7, b=3, c=3. 7//3=2, divided by 3 is 0. 7//9=0. Same. \n\nSo yes, the two approaches are equivalent. \n\nSo the way to compute the maximum possible t is:\n\nt_drink = (k*l) // nl \n\nt_lime = (c*d) // 1 \n\nt_salt = p // np \n\nmax_total = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt) \n\nthen answer is max_total // n \n\nBut wait, why for lime, it's (c*d) // 1? Because for the lime, each toast per friend requires one slice. So total slices needed for t_total toasts (across all friends) is t_total * 1 * n? No. Wait, for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. For t_total toasts, n * t_total slices. So the maximum t_total is (c*d) // n. \n\nBut according to the note's approach, it's (c*d) // 1, then divided by n. Which is (c*d) // 1 // n. Which is same as (c*d) // n. \n\nSo in that case, the correct approach for lime is (c*d) // n. \n\nSo why did the note say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts? Because in the first example, c*d is 10 * 8 =80. So the lime_total is 80 // n = 80//3 = 26. Which is the same as (c*d) // n. \n\nBut according to the note's explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be the (c*d) // 1 =80. Then divided by n=3 gives 26.666, floored to 26. Which is the same as (c*d) //n. \n\nSo the note's approach is to compute for each resource the maximum total toasts (across all friends) possible, then divide by n to get per friend toasts. Which is equivalent to computing for each resource the maximum per friend toasts, then take the minimum. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the maximum total toasts possible for each resource:\n\n- Drink: total_drink = (k * l) // nl \n\n- Limes: total_lime = (c * d) // 1 \n\n- Salt: total_salt = p // np \n\nThen, the maximum total toasts across all friends is min(total_drink, total_lime, total_salt). Then the answer is this value divided by n (integer division). \n\nBut wait, the limes' total_lime is (c*d) // 1? No, that's not correct. Because the total_lime is the maximum number of total toasts across all friends. For limes, each toast requires n slices. So total_lime is (c*d) // n. \n\nAh, here's the confusion. The note's approach is:\n\nFor limes, the total toasts possible across all friends is (c*d) // 1. But that's not correct. Because each toast requires n slices. So the total toasts possible is (c*d) // n. \n\nBut according to the note, for the first example, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which is (c*d) = 10 *8 =80. Which is (c*d) // 1 =80. But according to the correct approach, the total toasts possible for limes is (c*d) //n = 80//3=26. So the note's approach is wrong? But in the note's calculation, they took min(6, 80, 100) /3 =2. Which is the same as the correct approach. \n\nSo why does the note say that limes are enough for 80 toasts? Because that's the total_lime (c*d) // 1, but that's not the correct way. \n\nBut according to the correct approach, the total_lime should be (c*d) // n. Which for the first example is 80//3=26. Then the min between 6, 26, 100 is 6. Divided by 3 gives 2. Which is correct. \n\nBut the note's explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which is (c*d) // 1. Which would be 80. But then why is that? Because that would be the total number of toasts across all friends if each toast required only 1 slice. But in reality, each toast requires n slices. So the note's explanation is wrong. But the final calculation is correct because they then divided by n. \n\nSo perhaps the note is using the following approach:\n\nFor each resource, compute the maximum number of total toasts across all friends, then take the minimum of those and divide by n. \n\nSo for drink, the maximum total toasts across all friends is (k*l) // nl. \n\nFor limes, it's (c*d) // 1 (but that's not correct, but the note says it's 80). \n\nFor salt, it's p // np. \n\nThen the min of these three is divided by n. \n\nBut why is that correct?\n\nBecause, for limes, the maximum total toasts across all friends is (c*d) // 1, but that's incorrect. Because each toast requires n slices. So the correct maximum total toasts is (c*d) // n. \n\nBut the note's approach is to compute for limes (c*d) // 1. Which would be (c*d) // 1 = c*d. Then, divided by n. Which is same as (c*d) // n. \n\nSo, for example, (c*d) // n is the same as ((c*d) // 1) //n. \n\nSo, in code, the steps are:\n\nCompute for each resource:\n\ndrink_total = (k * l) // nl \n\nlime_total = (c * d) // 1 \n\nsalt_total = p // np \n\nThen, the maximum_total = min(drink_total, lime_total, salt_total)\n\nanswer = maximum_total // n \n\nBut this is equivalent to:\n\ndrink_total = (k*l) // nl \n\nlime_total = (c*d) // n \n\nsalt_total = p // (np) \n\nmax_total = min(drink_total, lime_total, salt_total) \n\nanswer = max_total \n\nWait no. Because in the first approach, the lime_total is (c*d) // 1, which is c*d, then divided by n. Which is same as (c*d) //n. \n\nSo the two approaches are equivalent. So the code can be written as:\n\ndrink_total = (k * l) // nl \n\nlime_total = (c * d) // n \n\nsalt_total = p // (np) \n\nmax_total = min(drink_total, lime_total, salt_total) \n\nanswer = max_total \n\nBut then why in the first sample, the drink_total is 20//3=6, lime_total is 80//3=26, salt_total is 100//1=100. min is 6, answer is 6. But the correct answer is 2. \n\nWait no, that would be wrong. Because the answer is max_total divided by n? Or not? \n\nNo. Because in the first approach, the max_total is min(6, 80, 100) =6. Then divided by n=3, gives 2. \n\nBut according to the second approach, the lime_total is 80//3=26. Then the min is 6, 26, 100 is 6. So answer is 6. Which is wrong. \n\nSo this shows that the two approaches are not equivalent. \n\nAh! So there's a mistake here. \n\nSo the initial approach of calculating for each resource the maximum possible total toasts across all friends is:\n\nDrink: (k*l) // (nl) \n\nLimes: (c*d) // (1) ? No. \n\nWait, the correct way to compute the maximum total toasts across all friends is:\n\nDrink: total_drink = (k*l) // (nl) \n\nBecause each toast across all friends requires nl per friend. So for t_total toasts, total drink needed is t_total * nl * n? No. \n\nWait, no. Let me re-derive this. \n\nEach toast is made by all friends. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t_total toasts, each friend uses t_total * nl ml. Total for all friends is n * t_total * nl. Which must be <= k*l. \n\nSo solving for t_total:\n\nt_total <= (k*l) / (n * nl) \n\nSo the maximum t_total is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) )\n\nSimilarly for limes: each toast requires n slices. So for t_total toasts, total slices needed is t_total * n. Which must be <= c*d. So t_total <= (c*d) /n. So maximum t_total is floor( (c*d)/n )\n\nFor salt: t_total * n * np <= p. So t_total <= p/(n * np). Floor.\n\nThus, the maximum t_total is min( (k*l) // (n * nl), (c*d) //n, p // (n * np) )\n\nWhich is the same as the initial approach. \n\nSo the correct answer is the minimum of the three values, which are computed as (k*l) // (n * nl), etc.\n\nSo why did the note say that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts? Because that's (k*l) // nl =20//3=6. Which is the maximum total toasts across all friends if each toast required nl ml per friend. But that's not the case. Because each toast requires n * nl ml. \n\nSo the note's approach is wrong. But according to the sample input, the correct answer is 2. Which is the minimum of the three values computed correctly. \n\nSo the correct code should compute:\n\ndrink_toast = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toast = (c*d) // n \n\nsalt_toast = p // (n * np)\n\nanswer = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\n\nSo in the first example:\n\ndrink_toast = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20//9=2 \n\nlime_toast = (10 * 8) //3= 80//3=26 \n\nsalt_toast = 100 // (3 * 1) = 100//3=33 \n\nmin is 2. Answer is 2. Correct.\n\nIn the note's explanation, they said that drink is enough for 6 toasts (which is (k*l)//nl =20//3=6), then divided by n=3, gives 2. Which is the same as the correct answer. \n\nSo the two approaches are equivalent. \n\nBecause:\n\ndrink_toast_correct = (k*l) // (n * nl) \n\ndrink_toast_note = ((k*l) // nl) // n \n\nWhich is same as drink_toast_correct. \n\nSo the code can be written either way. \n\nSo the code can compute each of the three values as:\n\ndrink_total = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total = (c*d) // n \n\nsalt_total = p // (n * np)\n\nanswer = min(drink_total, lime_total, salt_total)\n\nWhich is the correct approach. \n\nSo now, the code needs to read the input, compute these three values, and output the minimum.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is a list of lines, each line contains the numbers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nBut looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first sample input is ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', ...]\n\nSo for each line, the numbers are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nSo for each line, we need to process them.\n\nThe code should read from stdin, but the input is given as multiple lines. Wait, looking at the sample input given in the problem:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a single line. But the sample input shows multiple lines, like:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Because the problem says that the input is the first and only line. But the sample input shows multiple lines. Probably, the sample input is a list of test cases, each being a line. So for the code, we need to read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers ...\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three lines. Which suggests that the sample input is a list of test cases, each on separate lines. \n\nBut that contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's sample input formatting. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nOutput\n\n['2', '3', '0']\n\nBut this seems to indicate that the input is multiple lines. However, the problem says that the input is the first and only line. So this is conflicting. \n\nBut perhaps the problem's sample input is a list of test cases, each being a line, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original statement says that the input is a single line. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nOriginal problem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nSo the input is one line. So the sample input must be three separate test cases, each given on their own line. \n\nBut the way the sample is presented is as a list of strings, which may be a formatting error. \n\nAssuming that the code needs to read one line of input, and output one line of output. But the sample shows multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple lines, each as a separate test case. \n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as the first and only line. So perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly. \n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case, and output the corresponding results. \n\nFor example, in the first sample input line, the output is '2'. \n\nSo the code should read each line from stdin, process it, and output the answer for each line. \n\nBut how to handle this in Python? \n\nIn Python, the standard way is to read from stdin. So for example, if the input is multiple lines, the code can read all lines and process each one.\n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? The problem's sample shows three test cases, but the problem statement says that the input is a single line. \n\nThis is very confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as a list of three lines, and the output is a list of three answers. So the code should read each line from input, process them, and output the answer for each line. \n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, for each line, split into the numbers, compute the answer, and print it. \n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is one line. This is conflicting. \n\nHowever, looking at the sample input, perhaps the problem statement's sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the actual input is multiple lines, each being a separate test case. \n\nAssuming that the code needs to read multiple lines, each line being a test case. \n\nSo the code can read all lines from stdin, for each line, process it, and output the answer. \n\nFor example, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    # process line\n\nBut the problem says that the input is one line. But the sample shows multiple lines. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual input is one line. \n\nBut this is not possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but each test case is provided as a single line. \n\nIn any case, the code should process each line as a test case. \n\nSo, given that, let's proceed. \n\nNow, for each line, we need to split into the numbers. \n\nSo for example, for the line '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', the numbers are:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1. \n\nWe compute:\n\ndrink_total",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Constraints**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and salt per friend. Therefore, for `t` toasts, each friend will need `t * nl` milliliters of drink, `t` slices of lime, and `t * np` grams of salt.\n2. **Calculate Maximum Possible Toasts**: For each resource (drink, limes, salt), calculate the maximum number of toasts that can be made considering the total available quantity and the requirements per toast.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is determined by taking the minimum value of the possible toasts calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        # Split the line into integers\n        nums = list(map(int, line.strip().split()))\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = nums\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum possible toasts for each resource\n        total_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        total_lime = (c * d) // n\n        total_salt = p // (n * np)\n        \n        # The answer is the minimum of the three\n        print(min(total_drink, total_lime, total_salt))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each representing a test case with the given parameters.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: The total milliliters of drink available is `k * l`. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters for all friends, so the maximum number of toasts is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Limes**: The total number of lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend), so the maximum number of toasts is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt**: The total grams of salt available is `p`. Each toast requires `n * np` grams for all friends, so the maximum number of toasts is `p // (n * np)`.\n3. **Determine Result**: The result for each test case is the minimum value of the calculated maximum toasts for each resource, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limit.",
