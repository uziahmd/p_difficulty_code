Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The original cards have numbers that are within -x to x. The new cards he finds must also be within that range.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero. So the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let me think: the sum of the new cards needs to be equal to -S. But each new card can contribute between -x and x. So the question becomes, what's the minimum number of cards needed to reach a sum of T = -S, where each card contributes between -x and x.\n\nWait, but since each card can be any value between -x and x, the maximum possible sum we can get with k cards is k*x, and the minimum is -k*x. So for T, we need to find the smallest k such that |T| ≤ k * x. Because if T is positive, then we can add k cards each contributing x, but if T is negative, then we can add k cards each contributing -x. Wait, but the sum of the new cards has to be exactly T. So the absolute value of T must be less than or equal to k * x. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose T is 5, and x is 2. Then, each card can contribute up to +2. So to get 5, you need at least 3 cards (since 2*2=4 <5, so 3 cards can give 6, but we need 5). But how do we get exactly 5? Well, 2+2+1 =5. So yes, possible with 3 cards. So the minimal k is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, because if T is divisible by x, then it's exactly |T|/x. Otherwise, it's floor(|T|/x) + 1.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards required is the ceiling of (|T| / x). But wait, let's check:\n\nIf T is 5, x is 2. |T| /x is 2.5. Ceiling is 3. Which is correct.\n\nIf T is 4, x is 2. Then 4/2=2. So two cards. Which is correct.\n\nIf T is 3, x is 2. 3/2 is 1.5, ceiling is 2. Which is correct. 2 cards: 2 +1 =3.\n\nBut wait, how do we know that it's possible? Because with k cards, the maximum sum is k*x, and the minimum is -k*x. So for T, we need that |T| <= k *x. So the minimal k is ceil( |T| /x ). Because if |T| is exactly divisible by x, then k is |T|/x. Else, it's the integer division plus one.\n\nSo the answer is to compute T as the negative of the sum of the found cards, then compute the minimal k such that k is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, but what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero. Because no cards needed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards. Let's call it sum_found.\n\n2. Compute T = -sum_found. Because the new cards need to sum to T.\n\n3. If T is zero, the answer is 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach sum T, given that each card can contribute between -x and x. Which is ceil( |T| / x )\n\nWait, but why is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nSuppose T is positive. Then, the maximum sum possible with k cards is k *x. So to reach T, we need k *x >= T. So the minimal k is ceil(T /x). Similarly if T is negative, but since we take absolute value, it's the same.\n\nYes. So the formula is: if T is zero, 0. Else, ceil( |T| / x )\n\nBut how to compute that in Python?\n\nWell, for integers, |T| divided by x, rounded up. For example, in Python, we can compute it as (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nYes. Because for example, if abs(T) is 5, x is 2: 5 +2-1=6, divided by 2 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 4 and 2. 4 +2-1=5, divided by 2 is 2.5 floored to 2. Correct.\n\nSo that's the formula.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_found = sum of the list.\n\nT = -sum_found.\n\nif T == 0: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute k = ceil( |T| /x )\n\nBut how to compute that in code.\n\nSo in code, it's (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nBut let's test some examples.\n\nFirst example from input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 2, -1 1 2. The sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2. So |T| is 2. x is 2. So (2 + 2-1) // 2 = (3) //2 = 1. Which is correct. Output is 1.\n\nSample Input 2: 2 3, -2 -2. Sum is -4. T is 4. |T| is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1) //3 = 6//3=2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: if T is 5, x=2. (5 +2-1)/2 =6/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: T=0, output 0.\n\nAnother case: T=3, x=3. (3 +3-1)/3 =5/3=1. So 1 card. Which is correct.\n\nWhat if T=1, x=1? (1 +1-1)/1=1/1=1. Correct.\n\nSo that formula works.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list of numbers.\n\nsum_found = sum(list)\n\nT = -sum_found\n\nif T ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    k = (abs(T) + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but what about when x is zero? No, the problem says x is at least 1. Because input constraints say x is between 1 and 1000. So no division by zero here.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nLet me check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2, numbers are -1,1,2. sum is 2. T=-2. So abs(T)=2. (2 +2-1) //2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=2, x=3, numbers -2,-2. sum is -4. T=4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Then output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=5. Then T is -5. So (5 +5-1)/5 =9//5=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=3. T is -5. |T|=5. (5 +3-1)/3 =7/3=2.333 floored to 2. So 2 cards. Which is correct, since 3+2=5. So two cards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead input: first line is two integers, n and x. Second line is n integers.\n\nIn code:\n\nRead from stdin. So:\n\nProbably, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the first sample input, the first line is '3 2', the second line is '-1 1 2'.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_found = sum(nums)\n\nt = -sum_found\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    k = (abs(t) + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but what if the sum is zero? Then the answer is zero. So that's handled.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2, nums sum to 2. t is -2. So abs(t) is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: sum is -4, t=4. (4 +3-1)/3 =6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x=3. (3 +3-1)/3 =5//3=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 4, x=3. (4 +3-1)/3 =6//3=2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases. Including when the sum is zero.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the newly found ones) equals zero. Each card has a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the sum of the found cards. This is because the total sum of all cards (found and new) must be zero.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is zero, no new cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the maximum absolute value of the target sum divided by the maximum value on a card (x), rounded up. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(nums)\nt = -sum_found\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on a card). The second line contains `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards. The target sum for the new cards is the negative of this sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target Sum**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Determine Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, the minimum number of cards required is calculated using the formula `(abs(t) + x - 1) // x`, which effectively computes the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by `x`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of cards required using integer arithmetic, avoiding unnecessary complexity and ensuring optimal performance.",
