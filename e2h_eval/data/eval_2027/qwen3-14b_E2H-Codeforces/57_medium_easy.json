His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher has the first and second tour points, but they are not linked to names. So we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j, but with the constraint that there's at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >= x. \n\nWait, but the problem says that each participant participated in both tours. So each participant has exactly one a and one b. But the input gives the a's and b's in arbitrary order. So the actual participants are pairs (a_i, b_j) for some i and j? No, no. Wait, no. Each participant has a first tour score and a second tour score. But the input gives the first tour scores as a list (a1...an) and the second tour scores as another list (b1...bn). However, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for example, the first participant's first tour score is a1, but their second tour score could be any of the b's. But the teacher doesn't know which a_i pairs with which b_j. So the actual problem is: we need to consider all possible ways to pair the a's and b's into n pairs (each a and b used exactly once), and then for each such pairing, compute the sum for each participant. Then, Vasya is one of these participants, and his sum is at least x. We need to find the best possible rank (minimum possible) and worst possible rank (maximum possible) that Vasya could have.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because the problem says that Vasya is present in the Olympiad, so there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But when considering all possible pairings of a and b, we need to find for each possible pairing, what is the rank of Vasya's possible sum. But since we can choose any pairing (as long as it's a valid permutation of the b's), how do we find the best and worst possible positions?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have. So the best case is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged in a way that he gets the best rank. The worst case is when his sum is as low as possible (but still meeting the x condition), and others are arranged to make his rank as bad as possible.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think. For the best possible rank:\n\nWe want to maximize Vasya's total sum. Because if his sum is higher, he can be placed better. But since the sum is a_i + b_j, and we can choose which a_i and b_j are paired with each other. However, since the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x, but we can choose the pairing that allows his sum to be as high as possible. But how do we find that?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have. So for the best possible position, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and then arrange others' sums such that he is ranked as high as possible. Similarly for worst.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think about the best possible rank for Vasya. To get the best possible rank, we need to maximize his total sum. Because if his sum is maximum possible, then he can be placed first. However, even if his sum is not maximum, but others have lower sums, he can be first. But the maximum possible sum for Vasya would be when he is paired with the maximum a_i and maximum b_j. Wait, but how? Because in any pairing, each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa. So to maximize Vasya's sum, we can choose the maximum a_i plus maximum b_j. But that's only possible if there's a pairing where those two are paired. However, since the pairing is a bijection between a and b, if we take the maximum a and maximum b, then that's allowed. So for the best case scenario, we can assume that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j. Then, the best possible rank is 1, because he's the highest.\n\nBut wait, what if there are other participants with the same sum? Then the jury can assign the rank as per their choice. So in that case, the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can choose to put him first.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, we can find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (which is max_a + max_b), and then count how many participants have a sum strictly greater than this value. If there are k such participants, then the best possible rank is k+1. Wait, no. Because if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then there can't be anyone with a higher sum. So the best possible rank is 1. Unless there are multiple people with the same maximum sum. But the problem says that in such cases, the jury can assign the ranks. So for the best case, Vasya can be considered first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's look at the first sample input. All a's are 1, all b's are 1. So the maximum possible sum is 2. All participants have sum 2. So the best possible rank is 1 (since the jury can assign him first place), and worst is 5 (since they can assign him last among the 5).\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1, provided that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. But how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. Once we have that, the best possible rank is the number of participants that have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1. But since we can choose the pairing to maximize Vasya's sum, then the best possible rank is determined by how many other participants can have a sum greater than or equal to that maximum sum. Wait, no. Because in the best scenario, we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged to have as low as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is determined by the minimal possible number of people who have a higher sum than Vasya's sum. So to get the best possible rank, we need to maximize Vasya's sum and minimize the number of people with higher sum.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\n- Find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. Let's call this S_max. How to compute this? Well, it's the maximum a_i plus maximum b_j. Because if we pair the maximum a with maximum b, then that's the maximum possible sum. But wait, maybe there are other combinations. For example, if a_i is 5 and b_j is 4, and another a_i is 4 and b_j is 5. Then both sum to 9. So the maximum is 9. So regardless, the maximum possible sum is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j.\n\nSo S_max = max_a + max_b.\n\nOnce we have S_max, we need to find how many participants can have a sum >= S_max. But how?\n\nWait, but in reality, when you pair the a's and b's, the sum of each participant is a_i + b_j, but each a and b is used exactly once. So, when we choose to pair the maximum a with maximum b, that's one participant. But other participants will have their own pairings. However, for the best case scenario, we can arrange the pairings in such a way that as few as possible participants have sum >= S_max. Wait, no. Because when we pair the maximum a with maximum b, that gives S_max. But other participants could have sum equal to S_max. For example, if there are multiple a's with max a and multiple b's with max b. But in that case, the number of participants with sum S_max could be up to (number of max a's) multiplied by (number of max b's). However, since we have to pair each a with exactly one b, the maximum possible number of participants with sum S_max is min(number of max a's, number of max b's) ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, suppose there are two max a's (say, 5 and 5) and three max b's (say, 5,5,5). Then, if we pair each of the two max a's with two of the max b's, then we get two participants with sum 10. The third max b can be paired with some other a. So in this case, the number of participants with sum S_max is 2. But if we pair the two max a's with two of the max b's, then that's two participants. However, if someone else's a and b could sum to S_max. For example, if there is a non-max a and a non-max b that sum to S_max. But that's probably not possible. Because S_max is the maximum of all a_i + b_j. So any other a_i + b_j can't be higher than that. But if we have a_i + b_j equals to S_max, then that's possible.\n\nBut for the best possible rank, the teacher wants to arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and the number of people with sum higher than that is as small as possible. Since S_max is the maximum possible sum, there can't be anyone with a higher sum than that. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1. Because even if others have the same sum, the jury can assign Vasya the first place.\n\nWait, but the problem says that if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can assign places as they choose. So for the best case, the teacher can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and then the jury can assign him the first place. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo regardless of how many people have the same sum as S_max, the best possible rank is 1. Because the jury can choose to give him the first place.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, it's always 1. But wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose there's another participant whose sum is also S_max. But since the jury can assign the ranks, Vasya can be placed first. So yes. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut why in the first sample input, the output is 1 for the best rank. Which matches this logic.\n\nBut what about the second sample input? Let's check. The second sample input is:\n\n6 7\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nThe output is 1 5.\n\nSo the best possible rank is 1. Which aligns with the idea that the best possible is 1.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But how to confirm this? Because the problem says that the teacher must find the best and worst possible positions. So perhaps the best possible is always 1, but how?\n\nBut what if there's no way to have Vasya's sum be the maximum? Wait, no. Because the problem says that there is at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But for the best possible scenario, we can select that pair (i,j) and pair them as Vasya's. Then, arrange the rest of the pairings in a way that their sums are as low as possible. But the maximum sum for Vasya would be the maximum of a_i + b_j for any possible pair. Because the teacher can choose any pairing, and in that pairing, Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is 1. So the first part of the answer is always 1. But wait, what if there are no other participants? Like n=1. Then the answer is 1 1. Which makes sense.\n\nBut why does the first sample input have output 1 5. So that seems to fit. So the best possible rank is 1. So how to compute that? Well, it's always 1. So the first part of the answer is 1.\n\nNow for the worst possible rank. This is trickier. We need to find the maximum possible rank that Vasya can have, given that his sum is at least x. How to model this.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x) and as many other participants as possible have a higher sum than him.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFind the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (which is >=x) and then calculate how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than this value. Then the worst possible rank is that count + 1. However, there's a catch: the minimal sum for Vasya is not fixed. Because depending on how the pairings are done, Vasya's sum can be different. But we need to choose the pairing that allows Vasya's sum to be as low as possible (but still >=x), and then arrange the other pairings such that as many as possible participants have a higher sum than him.\n\nSo the steps for the worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible sum S_min that Vasya can have, such that S_min >=x. How to find this?\n\nWell, S_min is the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j, given that there exists a pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x, and the rest of the pairings are arranged in a way that allows this. But how to find this?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher needs to find the worst possible rank for Vasya. So for that, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but still at least x) and then arrange the other pairings so that as many as possible participants have a higher sum than him.\n\nSo, to find the worst possible rank, the strategy is:\n\n- Find the minimal possible sum S that Vasya can have, such that S >=x. Then, compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than S. Then, the worst rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to find S?\n\nBut how do we find the minimal S that Vasya can have, given that he is part of the pairing. Because, for example, if there are multiple possible pairings where Vasya's sum is >=x, but we want the minimal possible sum.\n\nBut how to model this. For example, the minimal S is the minimal possible a_i + b_j that is >=x. However, we need to find if there's a pairing where Vasya is paired with a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible (but still >=x), and the rest of the pairings are arranged in a way that allows that.\n\nBut how to compute this? Because the rest of the pairings must be valid, i.e., each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j.\n\nThis seems complicated. But perhaps there's a way to model this. Let's think: for the worst case scenario, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible but >=x, and then arrange the rest of the pairings so that as many other pairs as possible have a sum higher than this S.\n\nBut how to find this minimal S. Well, the minimal possible S is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. But how to find this. For example, if x is 2 and all a_i and b_j are 1, then S is 2. So the minimal possible S is 2.\n\nBut how to find the minimal S. Well, the minimal S is the minimal value that is >=x, and is achievable by some a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to find that. Well, perhaps we can generate all possible a_i + b_j pairs, filter those that are >=x, and take the minimum of them. But that would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\nWait, but n is up to 1e5, and O(n^2) is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but for the worst case scenario, the minimal S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. So how to find the minimal S that is >=x. Let's think: we can sort the a array and the b array. Then for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then the minimal S is the minimum over all these possibilities.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently. For example, sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j that when added to a_i is >=x. Then, the minimal S is the minimum of all such a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to find that. Let's think. For example, for each a_i, we can find the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i). Since the b array is sorted, we can use binary search for each a_i. Then, for each a_i, the minimal possible b_j that can be paired with it to get a sum >=x is found. Then, among all these possibilities, the minimal sum is the minimal S.\n\nBut this approach would work. However, the problem is that this approach assumes that there's a pairing where a_i is paired with b_j. But since the pairing is a bijection, we need to make sure that after choosing a_i and b_j, the rest can be paired. However, for the purpose of finding the minimal possible S, perhaps we can ignore that for now. Because, even if there's a conflict (like multiple a_i's needing the same b_j), but the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where Vasya is present. So perhaps, for the purposes of finding the minimal S, we can proceed with this approach, and then assume that there exists a valid pairing where Vasya is paired with that a_i and b_j. Because the problem says that it is guaranteed that such a pair exists.\n\nBut how to ensure that. Well, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So the minimal S is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. However, even if there are multiple a_i and b_j that can be paired to get that minimal S, but the rest of the pairings can be arranged. So perhaps, the minimal S is indeed the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. So the approach is:\n\nSort a and sort b. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i). Then, the minimal S is the minimal among all a_i + b_j for those pairs.\n\nOnce we have S, then for the worst case scenario, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum greater than S. How?\n\nBecause in the worst case, we want as many other participants as possible to have a sum greater than S, which would push Vasya's rank down. So the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum > S plus 1.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum greater than S. Because the pairing is flexible. So for the worst case, we need to pair a and b in a way that maximizes the number of pairs with sum > S.\n\nSo the question is: given a and b arrays, what is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j > S, where each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nBut how to compute that. This is similar to the problem of maximum matching between two arrays where the sum exceeds a certain value.\n\nThe standard approach for this is to sort one array and for each element in the other array, find the minimal element that can be paired with it to get a sum greater than S. Then, using a two-pointer approach.\n\nLet me think. Suppose S is fixed. We want to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j > S. How to compute this?\n\nThe standard approach is to sort a in ascending order, and sort b in descending order. Then, for each a_i in ascending order, pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet. This is similar to the problem of maximizing the number of pairs with sum exceeding S.\n\nAlternatively, sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers approach: start with a[0] and b[n-1]. If a[i] + b[j] > S, then we can pair them, and increment i and decrement j. Else, increment i. This way, we can find the maximum number of pairs.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, for the maximum number of pairs with a_i + b_j > S, the optimal way is to pair the largest possible elements of b with the smallest possible elements of a. Let me explain.\n\nSuppose a is sorted ascending, b is sorted ascending. We can use a two-pointer approach where we start with the largest a (a[n-1]) and largest b (b[n-1]). If a[i] + b[j] > S, then we can pair them, and decrease j. Else, we need to decrease i. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of an example.\n\nLet me think of a sample. Suppose S = 5. a = [1, 2, 3], b = [1, 2, 3]. How to pair to get maximum number of pairs with sum >5.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(3,3) sum 6>5 → count 1. Then remaining elements are [1,2] and [1,2]. Pair (2,2) sum 4 <5. (1,1) sum 2 <5. So total 1.\n\nAlternatively, pair (3,2) sum 5 → not >5. (3,1) sum 4. Not. (2,3) sum 5. Not. (1,3) sum 4. Not. So that's worse.\n\nAnother approach: pair (3,3) → 6>5. Then pair (2,2) → 4. No. But if we pair (2,3) and (3,2). Then sum is 5 and 5. Still not.\n\nWait, so the maximum number of pairs is 1. But what if S=4? Then (3,1) sum 4 is not >4. (3,2) sum 5>4. (2,2) sum 4. (1,3) sum 4. So maximum pairs would be 2: (3,2) and (2,3) → sum 5 and 5. Or (3,2) and (1,3) sum 5 and 4. Only one. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two-pointer approach is to sort a in ascending and b in descending. Then for each a_i, pair with the largest possible b_j not yet used. Let's try that.\n\nFor S=5, a sorted ascending [1,2,3], b sorted descending [3,2,1].\n\nTake a[0]=1. Pair with b[0]=3. Sum 4 <=5. So cannot. So move to next a. a[1]=2. Pair with 3: sum 5, not >5. Move to next a. a[2]=3. Pair with 3: sum 6>5. Count 1. So total 1.\n\nWhich matches the previous result.\n\nAnother example: S=4. a sorted ascending [1,2,3], b sorted descending [3,2,1]. Pair 1 with 3: sum 4 not >4. So move to next a. 2 with 3: sum 5>4 → count 1. Then pair 3 with 2: sum 5>4 → count 2. So total 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then for each a_i in order, try to pair with the first available b_j (starting from the beginning of the sorted b array). If a_i + b_j > S, then pair them and move to the next a_i and next b_j. Else, move to the next a_i. Wait, but the sorted b is in descending order. So the first elements are the largest. So the two-pointer approach would be:\n\nInitialize i = 0 (start of a), j = 0 (start of sorted b in descending order). Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose a is sorted ascending, and b is sorted descending. Then for each a_i, we want to pair with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet. So for a_i, we can check if a_i + b_j > S. If yes, then we can pair them, and move to the next a_i and next b_j. Else, we can't pair this a_i with any b_j (since the rest are smaller), so move to next a_i. Wait, but that's not correct. Because if a_i is small, maybe there's a b_j that is large enough to pair with a_i.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then use two pointers: i starts at 0 (beginning of a), j starts at n-1 (end of b). For each a[i], if a[i] + b[j] > S, then we can pair them. So we increment i and decrement j. Else, we increment i. This way, we are trying to pair the smallest a with the largest possible b. Let me test this approach with the previous example.\n\nExample 1: S=5, a sorted ascending [1,2,3], b sorted ascending [1,2,3]. i=0, j=2. a[0]+b[2] = 1+3=4 <=5 → increment i. i=1, j=2. a[1] +b[2] = 2+3=5 <=5 → increment i. i=2, j=2. 3+3=6>5 → pair. count becomes 1. Now i=3, loop ends. So total 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: S=4, a sorted [1,2,3], b sorted [1,2,3]. i=0, j=2. 1+3=4 not >4. increment i. i=1, j=2. 2+3=5>4 → count 1. i=2, j=1. 3+2=5>4 → count 2. i=3. done. So total 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: S=3. a=[1,2,3], b=[1,2,3]. i=0, j=2. 1+3=4>3 → count 1. i=1, j=1. 2+2=4>3 → count 2. i=2, j=0. 3+1=4>3 → count 3. So total 3 pairs. Which is correct.\n\nSo this two-pointer approach seems to work. So the algorithm is:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Initialize i=0, j=n-1, count=0. While i <n and j >=0:\n\nif a[i] + b[j] > S:\n\n   count +=1\n\n   i +=1\n\n   j -=1\n\nelse:\n\n   i +=1\n\nThus, this gives the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S.\n\nSo for the worst case scenario, once we have S (the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x), then the maximum number of participants that can have a sum greater than S is given by the count computed by this two-pointer approach. Then, the worst possible rank is count + 1.\n\nBut how to find S. As discussed earlier, S is the minimal possible sum of a_i + b_j that is >=x. How to compute this?\n\nSo for that, we can sort a and sort b. Then for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then take the minimal of all such a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to find that efficiently. Let's think:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nFor each a_i in a, we can find the minimal b_j such that b_j >= (x - a_i). Since b is sorted, we can perform a binary search for (x - a_i) in the b array. The minimal b_j is the first element in b that is >= (x - a_i). Then, the sum a_i + b_j is a candidate for S. We can compute this for each a_i, and take the minimum of all these candidates.\n\nBut note that for some a_i, there may be no such b_j (but the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) that satisfies a_i + b_j >=x).\n\nSo the steps for finding S are:\n\nSort a and sort b.\n\nInitialize min_sum to some large value.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   target = x - a_i\n\n   find the smallest index j in b where b[j] >= target. If found, compute sum_candidate = a_i + b[j]. Update min_sum to be the minimum between current min_sum and sum_candidate.\n\nOnce all a_i are processed, S is min_sum.\n\nBut since the problem says that there exists at least one pair, this min_sum will be found.\n\nOnce we have S, then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S using the two-pointer approach. Then, the worst possible rank is that number +1.\n\nBut wait, why is that the case?\n\nBecause in the worst case scenario, we arrange the pairings so that as many as possible other participants have sum > S. So the maximum possible number of such participants is count. Then, Vasya's sum is S. So his rank is count +1. Because all those count participants have higher sum than him, and he is placed after them.\n\nBut what if there are participants with sum equal to S?\n\nIn that case, the jury can assign the rank. For the worst case, we want to maximize the number of participants with sum > S. But for participants with sum equal to S, the jury can assign them lower ranks than Vasya, but that would not affect the worst possible rank. Wait, no. Because if there are participants with sum equal to S, then the worst possible rank for Vasya would be count + (number of participants with sum equal to S) + 1? No, because the jury can arrange the ranks in any way. For the worst case, we want the maximum possible rank. So, if there are other participants with sum equal to S, the jury can place Vasya after them, which would increase his rank. However, in our calculation, we only counted participants with sum > S. So how do we account for those with sum equal to S?\n\nWait, the problem says that the participants are sorted by sum, and if two have the same sum, the jury can assign the ranks as they choose. So, in the worst case, for Vasya's rank, we want to maximize the number of people that are either strictly above him, or have the same sum and are placed before him.\n\nSo, to find the worst possible rank, we need to compute the maximum possible number of participants with sum >= S (where S is Vasya's sum) plus 1. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because if Vasya's sum is S, then all participants with sum > S will be ranked higher than him, and participants with sum equal to S can be ranked higher or lower. To get the worst possible rank, we want the maximum number of participants that are ranked higher than him. That includes all participants with sum > S, and as many as possible participants with sum = S. So, to compute the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of participants that have sum >= S, and then add 1. But how?\n\nBut how can we compute that? Because the number of participants with sum >= S depends on how we pair the a and b arrays. For example, if S is fixed, and we want to maximize the number of participants with sum >= S, then that would be the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >= S.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case, we can assume that the number of participants with sum > S is count, and the number of participants with sum equal to S is k. Then, the worst possible rank is count +k +1. But how to compute this.\n\nBut this complicates the problem. How to find the maximum number of participants with sum >= S, given that S is fixed. However, this seems difficult.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to adjust our previous approach. Let's think again: when we want to maximize the number of participants with sum >= S, then we can use a modified version of the two-pointer approach. For example, we can count the number of pairs where a_i + b_j >= S. How to compute that?\n\nBut for the worst case scenario, we want to maximize the number of participants that have sum >= S. Because that would allow the jury to arrange Vasya's rank as low as possible.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\nBut how to compute that. Let's think again of the two-pointer approach. Let me think of a way to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\nThe standard approach for maximum number of pairs with sum >= S is similar to the previous two-pointer approach. Let's sort a in ascending and b in ascending. Initialize i=0, j =n-1, count=0. While i <n and j >=0:\n\nif a[i] + b[j] >= S:\n\n   count +=1\n\n   i +=1\n\n   j -=1\n\nelse:\n\n   i +=1\n\nThis approach would give the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S. Because for each a[i], we pair it with the largest possible b[j] that can form a sum >=S. If not, we move to the next a[i].\n\nSo for the worst case scenario, once we have S, the maximum number of participants with sum >=S is the count obtained by this approach. Then, the worst possible rank for Vasya is that count +1. Because in the worst case, all those count participants have sum >=S, and Vasya's sum is S. The jury can arrange him to be placed after all of them. Hence, his rank is count +1.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the count includes the number of participants with sum >=S, which includes those with sum >S and those with sum =S. So, the worst possible rank would be count +1? No. Because if there are count participants with sum >=S, then Vasya is one of them. So the total number of participants with sum >=S is count. But since Vasya is one of them, then the worst possible rank is count. Because if all of them are placed before him, then he is the last among them. But how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose S is 2, and there are 5 participants, all with sum 2. Then count is 5. But Vasya is one of them. The worst possible rank is 5, because the jury can arrange him to be last. So in this case, the count is 5, and the worst possible rank is 5. Which is count.\n\nBut according to the formula count +1, that would be 6, which is wrong.\n\nAh, so the previous approach is incorrect. So the problem is that the count includes Vasya's sum. So how to compute the worst possible rank.\n\nLet me re-express the problem. Once S is fixed as Vasya's sum, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of participants that have sum strictly greater than S, plus the maximum number of participants that have sum equal to S (excluding Vasya), plus 1.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nBut this seems complex. However, perhaps the following approach works:\n\nThe worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that have sum > S, plus 1. Because the participants with sum equal to S can be placed after Vasya. So for the worst case, we can arrange that none of them are placed before him. Thus, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum > S plus 1.\n\nBut this would be the case if the jury can arrange the participants with sum equal to S to be placed after Vasya. Hence, the worst possible rank is the count of participants with sum > S plus 1.\n\nBut how to compute that count. Earlier, we had a two-pointer approach that computes the maximum number of pairs with sum > S. So the worst possible rank is count + 1.\n\nBut in the first example, when S is 2 (all participants have sum 2), the maximum number of participants with sum > S is 0. Hence, the worst possible rank is 0 + 1 = 1. Which contrad",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in an Olympiad based on his minimum total score from two tours. The solution involves efficiently finding the optimal pairings of scores from the two tours to maximize and minimize Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: \n   - The best possible rank is always 1 because Vasya can be paired with the highest possible scores from both tours, ensuring he has the maximum total score. The jury can then assign him the first place even if others have the same score.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**:\n   - To find the worst possible rank, we need to determine the minimum possible score Vasya can have while still meeting the minimum threshold `x`. This involves finding the smallest valid sum from all possible pairs of scores.\n   - Once this minimum valid score (S) is determined, we calculate how many participants can have a higher score than S using a two-pointer technique on sorted arrays. The worst rank is then derived from this count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    \n    # Best possible rank is always 1\n    best = 1\n    \n    # Find the minimal S >= x that Vasya can have\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    min_S = float('inf')\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = x - ai\n        # Find the first b_j >= target\n        j = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, target)\n        if j < n:\n            current_sum = ai + b_sorted[j]\n            if current_sum < min_S:\n                min_S = current_sum\n    \n    # Now compute the maximum number of participants with sum > min_S\n    # Sort a in ascending and b in ascending\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_asc = sorted(b)\n    \n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    count_gt = 0\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a_asc[i] + b_asc[j] > min_S:\n            count_gt += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    worst = count_gt + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best} {worst}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: The best possible rank is always 1 because Vasya can be paired with the highest scores from both tours, ensuring he has the maximum possible score.
