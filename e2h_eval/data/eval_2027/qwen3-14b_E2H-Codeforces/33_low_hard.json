You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about replacing digits in a number to make it as large as possible using a given sequence of digits. Each digit in the sequence can be used once. So I need to find the optimal way to replace digits in the original number with the digits from s to maximize the value.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the approach. The key idea here is to replace the digits in the original number with the largest possible digits from s, but in a way that the leftmost digits are as large as possible. Because changing a digit in a more significant position (like the left) has a bigger impact on the overall value.\n\nSo, for example, if the original number is 1024 and s is 010, then the best way is to replace the first 1 with 1 (but wait, the s has 0,1,0. Wait, maybe the example in the input is different. Oh the first example input is '1024' and s is '010', so the output is '1124'. Let me check that. Oh right, because the digits in s are 0,1,0. So the best is to replace the second digit (0) with 1, making it 1124. That's better than replacing other digits.\n\nSo the strategy would be to sort the s digits in descending order. Then, iterate through each digit of the original number from left to right. For each digit, if there's a digit in the sorted s that is larger than the current digit, replace it with the largest possible available digit from s. Otherwise, leave it as is. But we have to use the digits in s optimally.\n\nWait, but since we can choose which digits to use, but each can be used once. So the steps could be:\n\n1. Sort the s digits in descending order. Because we want to use the largest digits first for the most significant positions.\n\n2. Iterate through each digit of the original number from left to right. For each position, if the current digit is less than the next available digit in the sorted s list, replace it and move to the next digit in s. Otherwise, skip.\n\nBut how to manage the sorted s digits? Let's think. Let's say we have s sorted in descending order. For example, if s is '010', sorted descending would be ['1', '0', '0'].\n\nThen, for the original number's digits, we go from left to right. For each digit, we check if the current digit can be replaced by the next available digit in the sorted s list. If yes, replace it and take that digit from s. Otherwise, leave it.\n\nBut how do we track which digits in s have been used? Well, since we sorted s in descending order, we can process them in order, and for each digit in the original number, we check if the current s digit (the next one in the sorted list) is larger than the original digit. If so, replace it and proceed. Otherwise, leave it.\n\nWait, but the sorted s is in descending order. So the first element is the largest. So for the original number's digits, starting from the left, we want to replace the first possible digit with the largest possible available digit. For example, if the original digit is 1, and the sorted s starts with 9, then replace it. But if the original digit is 9, then we don't replace it. So the algorithm would be:\n\nSort s in descending order.\n\nInitialize a pointer j starting at 0.\n\nFor each digit in a (from left to right):\n\n   if j < len(s) and s_sorted[j] > current_digit:\n\n       replace current_digit with s_sorted[j], increment j.\n\n   else:\n\n       leave as is.\n\nThis way, we use the largest possible digits first for the most significant positions. That seems correct.\n\nLet me test this logic with the example given.\n\nFirst example: a is 1024, s is 010. So s sorted descending is 1,0,0.\n\nOriginal digits are 1, 0, 2, 4.\n\nProcess each digit:\n\nFirst digit is 1. Compare with s_sorted[0] = 1. Since it's equal, we don't replace. Because replacing with same digit doesn't help. So we leave it. Then j remains 0.\n\nSecond digit is 0. Compare with s_sorted[0] = 1. 1 is larger. So replace 0 with 1. j increments to 1. Now the number is 1124.\n\nThird digit is 2. Compare with s_sorted[1] = 0. 0 is smaller. So no replacement. Fourth digit is 4, compare with s_sorted[1] = 0. No replacement. So final number is 1124.",
