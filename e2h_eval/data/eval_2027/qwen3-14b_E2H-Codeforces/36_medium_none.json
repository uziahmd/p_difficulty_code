The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for this to be possible. \n\nFirst, the signal coverage needs to be such that each town is covered exactly once. Also, towns 0 and n+1 are not covered. Let's think about how the towers can be arranged.\n\nFor example, if there's a tower in town i, then its signal power p must be chosen such that it covers some range. But since each town must be covered exactly once, the arrangement of towers must form some kind of partitioning of the towns 1..n into ranges where each range is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nWait, but the signal power can vary. For example, a tower at position i can cover up to p-1 distance. So, if a tower is placed at i with power p, it covers (i - p + 1) to (i + p -1). But since the towns are on a line, maybe there's a way to model this as intervals.\n\nBut how can we ensure that each town is covered exactly once? Let's think of the problem as needing to select a set of towers such that they can be arranged in a way that their coverage areas are non-overlapping and exactly cover all towns from 1 to n. Also, the coverage of each tower must not reach town 0 or town n+1.\n\nWait, but the signal power can be adjusted. So for a given set of towers, how can we determine whether it's possible to assign power levels?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have towers at positions x_1, x_2, ..., x_k. How can we assign their power so that:\n\n- Each town 1..n is covered exactly once.\n- Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n\nFor a tower at position x, the maximum power it can have is such that it doesn't reach town 0 or n+1. For example, if x is the first tower (position 1), then the maximum power it can have is 1, because if it's 2, then it would reach town 0 (since |0 - 1| = 1 < 2). Similarly, for a tower at position n, the maximum power is 1. So, for any tower, the power can't be more than min(x, n+1 -x). Wait, because the tower's coverage can't reach town 0 or n+1. So for a tower at position i, the power p must satisfy p <= i (so that i - p >= 0, but wait, the condition is that town 0 is not covered. The coverage is |c - i| < p. So town 0 is covered if 0 is within (i - p +1) to (i + p -1). Wait, the distance between 0 and i is i. So for town 0 to not be covered, we need that i >= p. Because |0 - i| = i < p would mean that town 0 is covered. So to prevent that, p must be <= i. Similarly, for town n+1, the distance between i and n+1 is (n+1 - i). So to prevent coverage, p must be <= (n+1 - i). Therefore, for any tower, the maximum allowed power is min(i, n+1 -i). \n\nBut when assigning power, we need to make sure that the coverage of each tower doesn't overlap with others, except that each town is covered exactly once. So perhaps the arrangement of towers must be such that they form a partition of the towns into intervals, where each interval is covered by exactly one tower. \n\nThis seems similar to certain tiling problems. For example, think of the towers as being placed in such a way that each tower's coverage is a segment that starts at some position and ends at another, and these segments don't overlap, and cover all towns 1..n.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe the key is that the towers must be placed in such a way that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain structure. Let's consider that for each tower, the coverage must start from the left of the tower and end at the right of the tower. For example, if a tower is at position i, and it's covering some range. Let's think of the optimal way to arrange the coverage.\n\nAn alternative approach: For the entire coverage to be valid, each tower must be responsible for a contiguous block of towns. And each such block must be covered by exactly one tower. Also, the tower's power must be sufficient to cover that block, and not spill over to the left or right.\n\nFor example, suppose a tower is placed at position i. It's responsible for covering towns from a to b. Then, the power must be such that:\n\na >= i - p + 1, and b <= i + p - 1.\n\nBut since the coverage is exactly a to b, then the maximum distance from i to a and to b must be less than p. So, the power p must be at least max(i - a + 1, b - i + 1). Also, since the tower cannot reach beyond the boundaries (towns 0 and n+1), we must have that a >= 1, and b <=n. \n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the possible ways to split the towns into segments, each covered by exactly one tower. Each segment must be covered by a tower located somewhere inside it, and the tower's power must be sufficient to cover the entire segment, without overlapping with other segments.\n\nWait, but for a segment [L, R], the tower must be placed at some position i in [L, R], and the power p must be at least max(i - L + 1, R - i + 1). Also, the power p must be such that the tower doesn't reach beyond L-1 (which is town 0 if L=1) or beyond R+1 (which is n+1 if R=n).\n\nBut in order for the tower's coverage to not reach beyond L-1 and R+1, the power p must be such that:\n\np <= i (so that i - p >= 0 if L=1?), no, perhaps the maximum p is such that the tower's coverage does not reach town 0 or town n+1. So for the segment [L, R], the tower's position i must be such that:\n\nthe tower's power p is at least (R - i + 1) and (i - L + 1), and also p <= i (so that it doesn't reach town 0) and p <= (n+1 - i) (so that it doesn't reach town n+1). \n\nBut for the segment [L, R], the tower's position i must be such that the required p is possible. Let's think of the minimal required p for the segment [L, R]. The minimal p is the maximum of (i - L + 1, R - i + 1). However, for this p to be allowed, we need that p <= i (so that the left side doesn't reach 0) and p <= (n+1 - i) (so that the right side doesn't reach n+1).\n\nAlternatively, for the segment [L, R], the tower must be placed at position i such that:\n\ni - L + 1 <= (n+1 - i) and R - i + 1 <= i ?\n\nNot sure. Maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's think of the structure that allows for a valid assignment. For example, in the sample input where n=2, the only valid case is when both towers 1 and 2 are built. Then, each has power 1. So their coverage is exactly town 1 and 2 respectively. \n\nAnother example is when there's a single tower in the middle. Like for n=3, if there's a tower at position 2. Then, the power can be 2. Then, it covers towns 1, 2, 3. But that would cover all three towns. But then, each town is covered once. Wait, but that's only possible if there's no other towers. So the tower at position 2 with power 2 would cover towns 1, 2, 3. But each of those towns is covered once. So that's acceptable. \n\nSo the key seems to be that the set of towers must form a partition of the towns into intervals, each of which is covered by exactly one tower. And for each interval, there's a tower in it that can cover the entire interval without spilling over to outside.\n\nSo, for each interval [L, R], there must be a tower at some position i in [L, R], such that the maximum of (i - L + 1, R - i + 1) is <= min(i, n+1 -i). Wait, but that's not necessarily. Because for the tower's power p, it's allowed to be as large as needed, as long as it doesn't spill over to 0 or n+1. So, the required p is the maximum of (i-L+1, R-i+1). But this p must be <= i (so that the left side doesn't reach 0) and <= (n+1 -i) (so that the right side doesn't reach n+1). \n\nBut for that to be possible, the following must hold:\n\nmax(i-L+1, R -i +1) <= min(i, n+1 -i)\n\nLet me think of the case when the tower is in the middle of the interval. For example, if the interval is [L, R], and the tower is at position i. Then, the required p is max(i-L+1, R-i+1). Let's say that this p is equal to the distance from i to the left end or to the right end. So, for example, if the interval is [L, R], and the tower is placed at the center, then the required p is (R-L+1)/2 rounded up. \n\nBut for the tower's p to not spill over to 0 or n+1, we need that:\n\ni - L + 1 <= i â†’ which is always true (since L >=1, so i - L +1 >= 1 - L +1? No, wait L is the left end of the interval. Let me think. If the interval is [L, R], then the tower is placed at i in [L, R]. The required p is the maximum of (i - L + 1) and (R - i + 1). For the tower to not reach town 0, we need that p <= i. Because the leftmost town covered by the tower is i - p + 1. To ensure that this is >= 1 (since town 0 is not covered), we need i - p + 1 >= 1 â†’ p <= i. Similarly, the rightmost town covered is i + p -1 <=n. So i + p -1 <=n â†’ p <= n +1 -i. \n\nSo combining these two conditions, p must be <= min(i, n+1 -i). \n\nBut the required p for the interval [L, R] is max(i-L+1, R-i+1). So for this p to be allowed, we must have that max(i-L+1, R-i+1) <= min(i, n+1 -i). \n\nBut how do we choose i and [L, R] such that this is true?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intervals must be such that for each interval [L, R], there exists a tower i in [L, R], and the maximum of (i-L+1, R-i+1) is <= min(i, n+1 -i). \n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let's think recursively. Suppose we want to find the number of valid tower configurations. \n\nLet me think of dynamic programming. Let dp[i] be the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (from 1 to i). Then, how can we build dp[i] based on previous values?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the towers are placed in towns 1..n, and the configuration must allow for a valid assignment of signal powers. So for the entire range 1..n, we need to find the number of subsets of towers that can be arranged into such intervals. \n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the valid configurations as those where the towers form a set that can be partitioned into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower, and each such interval satisfies the above conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid configurations are those where the towers form a set such that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain relationship. For example, if there is a tower at position i, then the next tower must be placed at i + k, where k is something. \n\nAlternatively, considering that for a valid configuration, the towers must be placed in such a way that each tower is responsible for covering a certain range. For example, the first tower could be placed at position 1, and it must cover up to position 1 (power 1), or cover up to position 2 (if there's no other tower in between). But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a tiling problem. For example, for each position i, the number of ways to arrange towers up to i such that the configuration is valid. \n\nLet me think again. For the entire range 1..n to be covered exactly once, there must be a way to partition it into segments where each segment has exactly one tower. Let's say that the last segment ends at position n. The tower in this segment could be at position j, where j can be anywhere in [a, n], where a is the start of the segment. But for the segment [a, n], the tower must be placed at j, and the required p is max(j - a + 1, n - j + 1). Also, this p must be <= min(j, n+1 -j). \n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively. For the DP approach, let's define dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. Then, for the i-th town, we can consider that the last segment ends at i, and the tower in this segment is placed at some position j (between a and i). But how to find a?\n\nAlternatively, for dp[i], the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. To compute dp[i], we can look for all possible positions j where the last tower is placed, and the segment covering i ends at j. Wait, maybe not. Let's think: the last tower in the configuration could be placed at position j, and it's responsible for covering from some position k to i. Then, for this to be valid, there must be a tower at j (so it's present), and the segment [k, i] must be covered by j. Also, the previous part [1, k-1] must be valid. \n\nSo, for dp[i], we can consider all possible positions j (from 1 to i) where a tower is placed, and the segment [k, i] is covered by j. But how to find k?\n\nThe segment [k, i] must be covered by the tower at j. Which requires that the tower's power is sufficient to cover from k to i. So, the required power is max( j - k + 1, i - j + 1 ). Also, this power must be <= min( j, n+1 -j ). Since i is the current position, and n is fixed, n+1 -j is (n+1 - j). \n\nBut for the segment [k, i], the tower j must be in [k, i]. Also, the required power must be such that the tower's coverage doesn't reach beyond the segment. \n\nBut how to find k for each j?\n\nAlternatively, for a tower placed at j, the maximum possible segment it can cover is from (j - p + 1) to (j + p -1), where p is chosen as per the constraints. But since we want to cover up to i, perhaps the maximum segment that can be covered by j ending at i is determined by the maximum possible p that allows j to reach i, but not go beyond.\n\nLet me think. For the tower at j to cover up to i, the required p must be at least i - j + 1 (since the distance from j to i is i-j, so the radius must be larger than that. So p must be >= i - j + 1. Also, since the tower's power can't reach beyond i (since the segment ends at i), the power can't be so large that j + p -1 > i. Wait, no. The segment [k, i] must be covered by the tower at j. So the tower's coverage must include all towns from k to i. Therefore, the maximum distance from j to i is i-j. So the power p must be at least i-j + 1. Also, the coverage must not reach beyond i. So j + p -1 <= i â†’ p <= i - j + 1. So combining these two, p must equal i - j + 1. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So for the tower at j to cover up to i, the power must be exactly i - j + 1. Because p must be >= i-j+1 (to reach i) and p <= i-j+1 (so that j + p -1 = i). Therefore, p = i -j +1. \n\nBut also, the tower's power must not reach beyond the left side. The leftmost town in the segment is k. The distance from j to k is j -k. The power p must be >= j -k +1 (so that the tower's coverage reaches k). Also, since the tower's coverage can't reach beyond town 0, the power must be <= j. \n\nSo p = i-j+1 must be <= j. So i-j+1 <= j â†’ i +1 <= 2j â†’ j >= (i+1)/2. \n\nSimilarly, the power p must be <= (n+1 -j). So i-j+1 <= n+1 -j â†’ i+1 <= n+1 â†’ i <=n. Which is always true since i is up to n. \n\nSo for the segment [k, i] to be covered by the tower at j, we must have that j >= (i+1)/2. Also, the left end of the segment k must be such that the distance from j to k is <= p-1. Since p = i-j+1, the distance from j to k must be <= p-1 = i-j. So j -k <= i-j â†’ k >= j - (i-j) = 2j -i. \n\nBut since the segment [k, i] must be covered entirely by the tower at j, the leftmost town k must be such that the tower's coverage starts at k. That is, the left end of the coverage is j - p +1 = j - (i-j+1) +1 = 2j -i. \n\nSo the segment must start at 2j -i, and end at i. Thus, the segment is [2j -i, i]. But this segment must lie within the towns 1..n. So 2j -i >=1. \n\nTherefore, for a tower at j to be able to cover a segment ending at i, the following must hold:\n\nj >= (i+1)/2 \n\nand \n\n2j -i >= 1 â†’ j >= (i +1)/2. \n\nWhich is the same condition. So, for any j >= ceil((i+1)/2), the tower at j can cover the segment [2j -i, i], provided that 2j -i >=1. \n\nMoreover, for this segment to be valid, there must be no other towers in this segment except for j. Because the segment is supposed to be covered by exactly one tower (j). \n\nBut how does this fit into the DP approach? Well, if we have a DP[i] that represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns, then for each i, we can consider all possible j's that can be the tower responsible for the segment ending at i. For each such j, the segment [2j -i, i] must be covered by j. Then, the number of configurations for the first i towns would be the sum over all valid j of (number of configurations for the first (2j -i -1) towns) multiplied by the probability that the tower at j is present, and that all other towers in the segment [2j -i, i] are not present (except for j). Wait, but the towers in the segment [2j -i, i] must have only j present. \n\nWait, but the DP approach is counting the number of valid tower configurations. So, for the DP[i], the total number of valid configurations is the sum for all possible j (that can be the last tower in the configuration) of the number of configurations for the first (k-1) towns multiplied by the possibilities for the segment [k, i]. \n\nBut how to model the presence of the tower at j and absence of others in the segment [k, i]. \n\nLet me think. For a segment [k, i], the tower at j must be present, and no other towers in [k, i]. So, the number of ways for this segment is 1 (tower at j is present) multiplied by the product of (probabilities that other towns in [k, i] are not present). But since we're counting the number of valid configurations, not probabilities yet, perhaps the DP counts the number of valid subsets of towers, and then we multiply by (1/2)^n, since each tower is present with probability 1/2. \n\nWait, but the problem asks for the probability. So perhaps we can model the DP as the number of valid subsets, then divide by 2^n. \n\nBut the problem says that each tower is built with probability 1/2. So the total number of possible configurations is 2^n, and the answer is (number of valid configurations) / 2^n. \n\nSo, the DP approach can be to find the number of valid subsets, then compute that divided by 2^n modulo 998244353. \n\nSo, back to the DP idea. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid subsets for the first i towns. \n\nTo compute dp[i], we can consider all possible j where the last segment ends at i. For each such j, the segment [k, i] is covered by tower j. As discussed earlier, k = 2j -i. And for this to be valid, k must be â‰¥ 1. \n\nSo, for each j in the range [ceil((i+1)/2), i], we can check if 2j -i â‰¥ 1. Then, the number of valid subsets for the first i towns would be the sum over all such j of dp[k-1] * 1 (for the tower at j being present) multiplied by the product of the possibilities that no other towers are present in [k, i] except j. \n\nWait, but in the subset, the tower at j must be present, and all other towers in [k, i] must not be present. So the number of ways for the segment [k, i] is 1 (tower at j is present) multiplied by 1 (all other positions in [k, i] are not present). However, the rest of the configuration (before k) is accounted for by dp[k-1]. \n\nSo, for each j, the contribution to dp[i] is dp[k-1] * 1, where k = 2j -i. \n\nBut why 1? Because for the segment [k, i], the tower at j is present, and all other towers in [k, i] are not present. The number of ways for that is 1 (since the presence of the tower at j is fixed, and others are not present). \n\nBut how do we account for the fact that the presence of the tower at j is part of the subset? Because the DP counts the number of valid subsets. \n\nSo, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} dp[k-1], where k = 2j -i, and j ranges over valid positions (j â‰¥ (i+1)/2, and k â‰¥ 1). \n\nBut what about the case where there are multiple j's contributing to the same dp[i]? \n\nLet me take an example. For n=2. \n\ndp[0] = 1 (base case, no towns). \n\nFor i=1:\n\nPossible j's are j â‰¥ (1+1)/2 = 1. So j=1. \n\nk = 2*1 -1 = 1. So the segment [1, 1]. \n\nThen dp[1] = dp[0] = 1. \n\nFor i=2:\n\nPossible j's are j â‰¥ (2+1)/2 = 1.5 â†’ j â‰¥ 2. So j=2. \n\nk = 2*2 -2 = 2. So segment [2,2]. Then dp[2] += dp[1] = 1. \n\nAlso, check if there's another j. For j=1.5 is not integer. So only j=2. \n\nBut wait, what about j=1? For i=2, j=1. Then k = 2*1 -2 = 0, which is invalid. So no contribution. \n\nSo dp[2] = 1. \n\nBut according to the sample input for n=2, the valid configuration is when both towers 1 and 2 are present. But according to this DP approach, dp[2] is 1. Which would imply that there's 1 valid subset. But according to the sample, the valid subset is {1,2}. But according to the DP calculation, dp[2] is 1. So that's correct. \n\nWait, but according to the DP approach, for i=2, the only way is to have the segment [2,2], which requires that the tower at 2 is present, and no other towers in [2,2]. But then, what about the first town, 1? How is it covered? \n\nAh, here's a problem. Because the DP[i] counts the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. But in the case where i=2, and we have the segment [2,2], then the first town (1) is not covered. So this suggests that the DP approach is wrong. \n\nWait, this indicates a flaw in my reasoning. Because the DP[i] must account for the entire coverage of towns 1..i. So, if the last segment is [k, i], then the previous part (before k) must cover 1..k-1. \n\nIn the example where i=2, and the last segment is [2,2], then k=2. So the previous part is 1..k-1 = 1..1. But dp[1] is 1. What does that represent? It represents the number of valid configurations for the first 1 town. Which would be the case where the segment [1,1] is covered by tower at 1. \n\nSo the total configuration would be: tower at 1 (covers 1) and tower at 2 (covers 2). Which is indeed the valid case. \n\nBut how is that captured in the DP? Because dp[1] is 1, which represents the configuration where tower 1 is present. Then, adding the tower at 2. So the total number of valid subsets is 1 (dp[1] * 1). But how is the presence of the tower at 2 accounted for? Because in the DP recurrence, for the segment [k, i], the tower at j is present and others are not. So in this case, the segment [2,2] contributes 1 (tower at 2 is present), and the previous part (dp[1]) is 1 (tower at 1 is present). So the total subset is {1,2}, which is correct. \n\nAh, I see. So the DP[i] counts the number of valid subsets of towers that cover towns 1..i exactly once. So, the recurrence is correct. \n\nSo for the case of i=2, dp[2] = dp[1] = 1. Which corresponds to the subset {1,2}. \n\nBut wait, what about the case where there is a single tower at position 2 with power 2? Then, the coverage is towns 1, 2. So that would also be a valid configuration. \n\nBut according to the DP approach, this case is not counted. Because for the segment [1, 2], the tower must be at j where k=2j -i = 2j -2. For i=2, the segment [1, 2] would require that k=1. So solving 2j -2 =1 â†’ j= 3/2. Not an integer. So there's no j for this case. \n\nSo according to the DP approach, this case is not considered. But according to the problem statement, this should be a valid configuration. \n\nWait, this is a contradiction. Let me re-examine this scenario. \n\nSuppose n=2, and the towers are built only at position 2. Can we assign signal power to meet the constraints?\n\nThe tower is at 2. Its power can be set to 2. Then, the coverage is towns where |c - 2| < 2. So c can be 0,1,2,3. But towns 0 and 3 (which is n+1=3) are not allowed. So the coverage includes towns 1 and 2. So town 1 is covered once, town 2 is covered once. This meets the conditions. \n\nSo this configuration (only tower at 2) is valid. But according to our DP approach, dp[2] is 1, which counts the case where towers are at 1 and 2. But this case (only tower at 2) is not considered. \n\nSo there's a mistake in the DP recurrence. \n\nWhat went wrong here?\n\nAh, the DP recurrence is missing some cases. For example, the case where the entire segment [1, 2] is covered by a single tower at position 2. How can this be modeled in the DP approach?\n\nIn this scenario, the segment [1, 2] is covered by the tower at j=2. \n\nFor this to happen, the required p is max(2-1+1, 2-2+1) = max(2, 1) = 2. \n\nNow, the power p must be <= min(2, n+1 -2) = min(2, 3-2) = min(2, 1) = 1. \n\nWait, but p is 2, which is larger than 1. So this is not allowed. Therefore, the tower at position 2 cannot have a power of 2, because it would reach town 3 (n+1). \n\nAh! So this case is invalid. Because the tower at position 2 with power 2 would reach town 3, which is n+1. Hence, this configuration is invalid. \n\nSo the initial thought that this case was valid was incorrect. \n\nSo the DP approach is correct. Because the tower at position 2 cannot have power 2. Because n+1 - j = 3-2 =1. So p must be <=1. So the maximum power is 1. Then, the coverage is |c -2| < 1 â†’ c=2. So only town 2 is covered. But then town 1 is not covered. Hence, this configuration is invalid. \n\nThus, the only valid configuration is when both towers are present. Which matches the DP result. \n\nSo the DP approach seems correct. \n\nAnother example: n=3. Let's see what happens. \n\nFor i=3, possible j's are those where j >= (3+1)/2 = 2. So j can be 2 or 3. \n\nFor j=2:\n\nk = 2*2 -3 = 1. So the segment is [1, 3]. \n\nBut for this to be valid, the required p is max(2-1+1, 3-2+1) = max(2, 2) = 2. \n\nCheck if p <= min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) = 2. Yes. So it's allowed. \n\nSo the contribution to dp[3] is dp[0] (since k=1, k-1=0) = 1. \n\nFor j=3:\n\nk = 2*3 -3 = 3. So segment [3,3]. The contribution is dp[2] = 1. \n\nThus, dp[3] = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nWhat are the valid configurations? \n\nCase 1: The segment [1,3] is covered by tower at 2. So the tower at 2 is present, and no other towers in [1,3]. So the subset is {2}. \n\nCheck if this is valid. Tower at 2 has p=2. Coverage is towns where |c-2| < 2 â†’ c can be 0,1,2,3. But town 0 and 3 (n+1=4?) Wait n=3, n+1 is 4. So town 3 is allowed. Wait, the coverage is |c -2| < 2 â†’ c can be 0,1,2,3. So towns 0 and 3 are included. But town 0 is not allowed. So this configuration is invalid. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the tower at 2 with p=2 would cover town 0, which is invalid. So why does our DP approach count this as valid?\n\nAh, here's another mistake. Earlier analysis said that for the segment [k, i], the tower's p must be <= min(j, n+1-j). But in this case, j=2, n=3. n+1-j = 4-2=2. So p is 2, which is allowed. But the coverage includes town 0. \n\nWait why is that? Because the coverage is |c - j| < p. So for p=2, the coverage is from j - p + 1 to j + p -1. \n\nWait j=2, p=2. So the coverage is from 2-2+1 = 1 to 2+2-1 = 3. So towns 1,2,3. Which is correct. \n\nBut why did I think earlier that it would include town 0? Because |0-2|=2 is not less than p=2. So 0 is not covered. \n\nAh, right. So the coverage is towns where the distance is strictly less than p. So for p=2, the distance must be <2. So town 0 is at distance 2, which is not less than 2. Hence, it's not covered. \n\nThus, the tower at 2 with p=2 covers towns 1, 2, 3. Which is exactly the required coverage. So this configuration is valid. \n\nThus, the subset {2} is a valid configuration. \n\nThen, the other case is the subset {3} (tower at 3). For that, the segment is [3,3]. The tower at 3 has p=1 (since it's the only way to cover 3 without reaching town 4). Then, the coverage is only town 3. But then, towns 1 and 2 are not covered. Hence, this is invalid. \n\nWait, but according to the DP approach, dp[3] is 2. Which implies that there are two valid subsets. But according to this, only the subset {2} is valid. What's wrong?\n\nAh, no. Because the DP[i] counts the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. For dp[3], the two contributions come from:\n\n1. j=2, leading to the segment [1,3], and dp[0] = 1 (no towers before 1). So this corresponds to the subset {2}.\n\n2. j=3, leading to the segment [3,3], and dp[2] = 1 (which represents the valid configurations for the first 2 towns). For dp[2], which is 1, that corresponds to the subset {1,2} (as discussed earlier). Thus, adding the tower at 3 (but in this case, the segment [3,3] requires that no other towers are present in [3,3]. So the subset is {1,2,3}? No, no. Wait, the DP recurrence for dp[3] when j=3 is dp[2] * 1. The dp[2] represents the valid configurations for the first 2 towns. Then, for the segment [3,3], the tower at 3 is added. But in this case, the configuration for the first 2 towns is {1,2}, and the tower at 3 is present. So the subset is {1,2,3}. \n\nBut in this case, how is the coverage done? \n\nThe towers are at 1, 2, 3. \n\nWe need to assign signal powers so that each town is covered exactly once. \n\nFor example:\n\n- Tower at 1: power 1 â†’ covers town 1.\n\n- Tower at 2: power 1 â†’ covers town 2.\n\n- Tower at 3: power",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 through n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The recurrence relation will help us build up the solution from smaller subproblems.\n2. **Valid Configurations**: For each town `i`, consider all possible positions `j` (from which a tower can cover the segment ending at `i`). The segment must be covered by exactly one tower placed at position `j`, ensuring no overlap and proper coverage.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, use modular inverses to handle divisions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n_values = list(map(int, input))\n    \n    max_n = max(n_values)\n    # Precompute dp up to max_n\n    dp = [0] * (max_n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case\n    \n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        # Find all j such that j >= ceil((i + 1)/2)\n        # and 2j - i >= 1\n        start_j = (i + 1 + 1) // 2  # ceil((i+1)/2)\n        for j in range(start_j, i + 1):\n            k = 2 * j - i\n            if k >= 1:\n                dp[i] += dp[k - 1]\n                dp[i] %= MOD\n    \n    # Precompute powers of 2\n    pow2 = [1] * (max_n + 2)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 2):\n        pow2[i] = (pow2[i - 1] * 2) % MOD\n    \n    # For each query, compute dp[n] * inv(2^n) mod MOD\n    results = []\n    for n in n_values:\n        if n == 0:\n            results.append(1)\n            continue\n        numerator = dp[n]\n        denominator = pow2[n]\n        # Compute denominator inverse\n        inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        res = (numerator * inv_denominator) % MOD\n        results.append(res)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: `dp[i]` stores the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. We initialize `dp[0]` to 1 as the base case (no towns to cover).\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each town `i`, we check all valid positions `j` starting from `ceil((i+1)/2)` to ensure the segment can be covered properly. The valid segment starts at `k = 2*j - i`, and we accumulate the count of valid configurations from `dp[k-1]`.\n3. **Modular Inverses**: Since we need to compute probabilities, we use modular inverses to handle division by `2^n` efficiently using Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently compute the required probabilities while adhering to constraints and handling large values using modular arithmetic.",
