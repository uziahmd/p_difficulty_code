    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count depends on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the main idea is, given m, find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that result in exactly m zeros. For example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, why? Let's check:\n\n5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! 5040 (1), etc. So all these numbers from 5 to 9 have exactly 1 trailing zero. But why? Because when you get to 10!, you add another 5 (from 10), so the count increases. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1.\n\nSo the key is to find the range of n's that give exactly m zeros. But how?\n\nThe approach I remember is that for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, the sample shows 5 numbers. But perhaps there are cases where there are multiple numbers. But how to find them?\n\nThe first step is to find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers that also have the same count. But how?\n\nWait, the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. But when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases. So for example, when n is 5, the count increases by 1. When n is 25, it increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So the count function is non-decreasing. So for any m, the possible n's that have exactly m zeros would form a contiguous range. Because once the count increases beyond m, there's no way to get back.\n\nWait, but how can there be multiple n's? For example, if m is 5, then let's see:\n\nLet's compute the trailing zeros for n=24: floor(24/5) =4, floor(24/25)=0. Total 4. For n=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 25 and 24, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer would be zero. Wait, but how?\n\nSo the problem is that sometimes, there's no n that gives exactly m zeros. So the first thing is to find if there exists any n such that the count is m. If there is, then find the range of n's that satisfy this.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the count of trailing zeros is >= m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Then check if the count for low is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions.\n\n3. Otherwise, find the maximum n where the count is exactly m. Then all numbers between low and that max n are valid.\n\nBut how to find the minimal and maximal n for a given m?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the possible n's by binary search. Because the count is non-decreasing. So for example, the first n where count is m is found by finding the first occurrence of m in the count function. Similarly, the last occurrence.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, here's an idea. For a given m, the number of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros is equal to the number of times the count increases from m-1 to m. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe count function is non-decreasing. So for example, for some m, there might be a range of n's where the count is exactly m. So the first n where count is m is the first occurrence, and the last n where count is m is the last occurrence. The difference between these two plus one gives the number of n's.\n\nBut how to find these two numbers?\n\nLet me think about using binary search to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nFor example, to find the first n where the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the first n where the count is >= m+1. Then subtract 1 to get the upper bound.\n\nWait, that's a common approach. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we want to find all n where count(n) = m. Then the first n where count(n) = m is the first occurrence. The last occurrence is the first occurrence of count(n) = m+1 minus 1.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input m=1. The first occurrence of count(n) =1 is 5. The first occurrence of count(n) =2 is 10. So the last occurrence of count(n)=1 is 9. Therefore, the numbers from 5 to 9 inclusive are the valid ones. Which gives 5 numbers.\n\nSo the number of valid n's is (upper - lower +1), where upper is the first occurrence of m+1 minus 1, and lower is the first occurrence of m.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of m?\n\nWait, the standard approach for binary search here is to find the minimal n where count(n) >= m. Let's call this lower. Then check if count(lower) == m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where count(n) >= m+1. Let's call that upper. Then the numbers from lower to upper-1 are the ones with count exactly m. So the number of such numbers is upper - lower.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample case m=1:\n\nlower is 5 (count(5)=1). upper is the first n where count(n) >=2, which is 10. So upper - lower = 5, which is the correct number of elements (5,6,7,8,9).\n\nSo yes. So the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where count(n) >= m. Let's call it low.\n\n2. Check if count(low) is equal to m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n where count(n) >= m+1. Call it high.\n\n4. The numbers from low to high-1 are the valid ones. So the count is high - low.\n\nBut how to compute count(n)? Well, the function to compute the number of trailing zeros in n! is straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic.\n\nSo first, write a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        cnt +=n\n    return cnt\n\nYes.\n\nThen, for a given m, perform binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nBut how to perform the binary search?\n\nFor example, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. The possible range for n is from 1 to ... Well, since m can be up to 1e5, the maximum possible n would be 5*m. Because for n=5m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because for example, 5m /5 = m, and higher divisions contribute more. So for binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. But maybe even higher? Well, for m=1, 5*1=5 is the correct n. For m=5, 5*5=25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is larger than 5. So maybe the upper bound can be 5*m. But perhaps for some cases, the upper bound needs to be higher. Wait, but for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m, the upper bound can be 5*m. Because count_zeros(5m) is m + floor(5m/25) + ... which is at least m. So yes.\n\nSo for binary search, the low is 0, high is 5*m.\n\nBut for some m, maybe the upper bound is even smaller. But for binary search purposes, it's okay to take a higher upper bound.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we have that, check if count_zeros(n) == m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, proceed to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the answer is the numbers between the first and second-1.\n\nSo for example, for m=5, let's see. Let's compute the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the first n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6 which is not equal to 5. Hence, there's no solution. So the answer is zero.\n\nThus, the code steps would be:\n\nGiven m, find the lower = first n where count_zeros(n) >=m. If count_zeros(lower) !=m, then return 0. Else, find upper = first n where count_zeros(n)>=m+1. Then the numbers from lower to upper-1 are the answers.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the binary search.\n\nImplementing a function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nLet's write a helper function for that.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nWait, but for example, for target=1, the function would return 5. Because when mid is 5, count_zeros(5) is 1 >=1. So high becomes 5. The loop ends. So returns 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, once we find the lower and upper, then:\n\nlower = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m: then output 0.\n\nelse:\n\nupper = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the numbers are from lower to upper-1 inclusive. So the count is upper - lower.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo, for the sample input m=1:\n\nlower = find_min_n(1) =5. count_zeros(5)=1.\n\nupper = find_min_n(2) = 10. So numbers from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nNow, the code needs to read m from input. Then process accordingly.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? According to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So the input is m >=1.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute lower = find_min_n(m).\n\nCheck if count_zeros(lower) != m: then output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute upper = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe numbers are from lower to upper-1.\n\nSo the count is upper - lower.\n\nThen, output that count, followed by the numbers in order.\n\nBut what if upper is 0? Well, no, since m is >=1, and lower is found, then upper is for m+1, which is >=1.\n\nBut let's think about the case where m is very large. For example, m=1e5. How efficient is this code?\n\nThe binary search for each find_min_n is O(log (5*m)) steps. Each step involves a count_zeros which is O(log n) steps. So for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, log2(5e5) is about 19 steps. So each find_min_n is O( log (5m) * log n ), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should be efficient enough for m up to 1e5.\n\nNow, let's test for the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1. Output is 5 numbers: 5-9.\n\nSample input 2: m=5. The lower is find_min_n(5). Let's see.\n\nLet's compute for target=5.\n\nWe need to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4. 25: 6. So the minimal n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So the answer is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample input's second case.\n\nAnother example: m=6. Let's see.\n\nlower is find_min_n(6). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25. Then upper is find_min_n(7). What's the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7?\n\nLet's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(29) is 6 (29//5=5, 29//25=1, total 6). 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7. So the minimal n is 25? No, because 25 gives 6, which is less than 7. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7 is 25? No, 25 is 6. So the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7 is 25? No. Let's compute for 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.\n\ncount_zeros(25) = 6.\n\ncount_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 =7. So the minimal n is 25? No, 25 gives 6. So the minimal n is 25? No, the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7 is 25? No. Wait, 25 is 6. So the first n is 30. So for target=7, find_min_n(7) would return 25? No. Let me think.\n\nWait, the code for find_min_n(7) would start with low=0, high=5*7=35.\n\nIn the binary search, the code would check mid values. For example, mid= (0+35)/2=17. count_zeros(17) is 3. Which is less than 7. So low becomes 18.\n\nEventually, the code will find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7. Which is 25? No. Because count_zeros(25) is 6, which is less than 7. So the code will continue searching higher.\n\nAt some point, mid=25: count_zeros(25) is 6 <7. So low becomes 26. Then mid= (26+35)/2=30.5 => 30. count_zeros(30) is 7. So high becomes 30. The loop continues until low=30. So the minimal n is 30.\n\nSo upper would be 30. So the numbers between lower (25) and upper-1 (29) are 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Which are 5 numbers. So for m=6, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would return 5 numbers: 25-29.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, in Python, the code must read m from input. But the input is given as a list of strings, according to the example.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. But the example shows:\n\nInput: ['1', '5']\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are given? But the problem says, the input is a single integer m. The example shows two cases. Wait, the example shows that for input m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for m=5, output is '0'.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read input from stdin. So perhaps the input is given as a single line, which is the integer m. But the example shows that the input is given as a list of strings, perhaps as a test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer. But the sample input shows ['1', '5'], which may be a way to represent two test cases. But the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces or similar, where the input is a single line. However, the user's example shows that for input m=1, output is the first case, and for m=5, the output is 0.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single integer m from input. So in the example, the input is given as ['1', '5'] which may be a way to show two different test cases. But the actual code must read from stdin, which is a single line.\n\nBut the user's code must read input from stdin, which is a single integer m.\n\nSo the code will read m as input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the input is given as a list, but in practice, the code reads a single integer.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen process as per above.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement count_zeros(n).\n\nImplement find_min_n(target).\n\nBut in code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n >0:\n        n = n//5\n        cnt +=n\n    return cnt\n\nThen, for find_min_n(target):\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nBut for large targets, like 1e5, 5*target is 5e5. Which is manageable.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute lower = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nupper = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the numbers are from lower to upper-1 inclusive.\n\nSo the list is [lower, lower+1, ..., upper-1]\n\nThe number of elements is upper - lower.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n >0:\n        n = n//5\n        cnt +=n\n    return cnt\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nlower = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(lower) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = upper - lower\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper))))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. However, range(lower, upper) is from 5 to 10 (since upper is 10). But range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. So that's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if upper is 0? Well, for m=0, but the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the case where m is 0, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So the code does not need to handle that.\n\nNow, testing for m=5:\n\nlower = find_min_n(5) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So the code prints 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. lower is 25 (count_zeros(25)=6). Then upper is find_min_n(7) which is 30. So the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code outputs 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10 (count_zeros(10) is 2). Then upper is find_min_n(3). Let's see.\n\nWhat is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=3?\n\ncount_zeros(14) is 2 (14//5=2, 14//25=0). count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So upper is 15. So the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Which is 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nBut what about m=3?\n\nlower is 15, count_zeros(15)=3. upper is find_min_n(4). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(19) is 3 (19//5=3, 19//25=0). count_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). So upper is 20. So numbers from 15 to 19: 5 numbers.\n\nSo code outputs 5 numbers.\n\nSo it seems that the code works.\n\nNow, the code may have an issue when m is such that there are multiple numbers. But according to the code, the number of numbers is upper - lower.\n\nBut what if upper is lower? That is, when there is no n with count m. But that is handled by the check count_zeros(lower) ==m.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. Also, note that for m=0, but according to the problem statement, m starts from 1.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nBut the code may have some edge cases. For example, when m=0, but the problem says m is at least 1. So no need to handle.\n\nAnother edge case is m=1, which works.\n\nAnother case is m=100000. Let's see. How long would the code take? Well, the binary search would take O(log(5*1e5)) steps. For each step, count_zeros is O(log n) steps. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut the code may have to handle multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe example shows input as ['1', '5'], which may be two test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the original problem is from a source where multiple test cases are given, but the user's code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So the code should read m from input as a single integer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two cases, but perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. For example, the first sample input is m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second sample input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut the code must process a single m.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut in the sample input, perhaps the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin as a single integer.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nRead m as int(input()).\n\nBut the sample input in the problem shows that for input ['1', '5'], the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nBut that may be a way to represent two test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m.\n\nTherefore, the code must read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead m = int(input())\n\nThen proceed.\n\nThus, the code is as written above.\n\nBut in the sample input, for m=5, the output is 0.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for the case where upper - lower is zero? Well, no, because if count_zeros(lower) == m, then upper is the first n where count_zeros >= m+1. So lower is the first occurrence of m. upper is the first occurrence of m+1. So the numbers between lower and upper-1 are all the numbers with count m. So if upper is lower, then upper - lower is 0. But that would imply that there are no numbers. But how?\n\nOnly possible if count_zeros(lower) is m, but upper is the first occurrence of m+1, which is lower. Which would require that count_zeros(lower) >= m+1. But since lower was found as the first occurrence of >=m, and count_zeros(lower) is m. So upper is the first occurrence of >=m+1, which is >= lower. So if upper is lower, that implies that count_zeros(lower) >= m+1. But count_zeros(lower) is m. So that can't happen. Therefore, upper must be greater than lower. So the code is safe.\n\nBut let's think: suppose m is 6, and lower is 25 (count_zeros(25)=6). Then upper is find_min_n(7) = 30. So upper is 30, which is larger than lower (25). So upper - lower is 5, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when printing the numbers, the code uses range(lower, upper). But in Python, range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, range(5, 10) gives 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nBut in Python, for the case when upper is 0? Well, for m=1, upper is 10, which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nRead m from input.\n\nImplement count_zeros, find_min_n.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be defined inside the code.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nThen:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        cnt +=n\n    return cnt\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlower = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(lower) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = upper - lower\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper))))\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\".\n\nBut the code would print 5, then the numbers. However, in the sample output, the first line is the k, and the second line is the numbers. So for the first case, the code outputs:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the print(k) is followed by print('...'), which would print the numbers. However, in Python, when you print multiple lines, the code would have the first print(k) followed by the second print, which adds a new line. So for example, the first print is '5\\n' and the second is '5 6 7 8 9\\n'.\n\nBut the sample output shows '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' which is two lines. So the code is correct.\n\nBut when the code runs, for the first case, the output is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is given as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'] which is for two test cases. But the code handles a single test case.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, test case m=5:\n\nlower is find_min_n(5) = 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case m=6, lower is 25, count_zeros(25)=6. upper is find_min_n(7)=30. So output 5 numbers from 25 to 29.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nNow, possible edge case when m=0, but problem says m >=1.\n\nAnother edge case is m=1, which works.\n\nAnother case: m=2, which gives 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=24. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5=19 + 99//25=3 + 99//125=0 → 22. count_zeros(100) is 24 (100/5=20, 100/25=4, 100/125=0 → 24). So for m=24, lower is find_min_n(24). Let's see.\n\nWhat is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=24. Well, 100 gives 24. But maybe 95?\n\ncount_zeros(95) is 95//5=19, 95//25=3, 95//125=0 → 22. Not enough. 99 gives 19+3=22. 100 gives 20+4=24. So lower is 100. count_zeros(100) is 24. So upper is find_min_n(25). Let's compute count_zeros(100) is 24, count_zeros(101) is same as 100. count_zeros(104) is same. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21 + 105//25=4 → 25. So upper is 105. So the numbers are from 100 to 104. 5 numbers. So output 5 followed by 100 101 102 103 104.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values of `n` that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: We use binary search to efficiently find the smallest value of `n` such that the count of trailing zeros is at least `m`. This helps in determining the lower bound of `n` values that could potentially have exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Range Determination**: Once we find the lower bound, we check if it indeed results in exactly `m` trailing zeros. If not, there are no valid `n` values. Otherwise, we find the upper bound by searching for the smallest `n` that results in at least `m+1` trailing zeros. The valid range of `n` values lies between these bounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        cnt += n\n    return cnt\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlower = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(lower) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = upper - lower\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5 and summing the quotients until `n` becomes zero.\n\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `target`. The search space is from 0 to `5 * target`, which is a safe upper bound given the nature of trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: \n   - Read the input value `m`.\n   - Use `find_min_n` to determine the lower bound of `n` values that could have `m` trailing zeros.\n   - Check if this lower bound actually results in exactly `m` trailing zeros. If not, print 0.\n   - If valid, determine the upper bound by finding the smallest `n` that results in `m+1` trailing zeros. The valid range of `n` values is from the lower bound to one less than the upper bound. Print the count and the range of these values.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large values of `m`.",
