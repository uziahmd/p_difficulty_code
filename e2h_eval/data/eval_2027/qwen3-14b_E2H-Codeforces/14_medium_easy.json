    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where this count equals m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Let's think about how the count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. Wait, no. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then adding 1 to n would add one more 5. But if it's a multiple of higher powers like 25, then it adds more. So the count can increase by more than 1. However, for numbers not divisible by 5, the count remains the same as previous.\n\nSo for example, if m is 5, then the numbers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 would have trailing zeros counts of 6 (since 25 contributes two 5s). Wait, no. Let me compute:\n\nFor n=24: 24/5 = 4, 24/25 = 0. Total is 4. For n=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's a jump of 2. So for m=5, there are no n's that have exactly 5 trailing zeros. Because between 24 and 25, the count skips 5. Wait, but maybe there's another range where the count increases by 1?\n\nSo the key idea here is that for some m, there are no n's that produce exactly m trailing zeros. For example, m=5 would not have any n's. Wait, but in the sample input given, when m is 1, the output is 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Let's check that. For n=5, the count is 1. For n=6, it's still 1. Because 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1. So the count increases only when n is a multiple of 5. So for numbers 5-9, the count is 1. Then when n=10, it's 2. So for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. Hence the sample output.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's such that their trailing zero count equals m. But how?\n\nThe approach I think is to find the lower and upper bounds for n where the count is exactly m. But how?\n\nFirst, we need to find the minimal n such that the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of n's that give exactly m.\n\nWait, but how to find the possible n's? Let's think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing. So for each m, there's a range of n's where f(n) = m. But sometimes, there's no such n. For example, when m is between f(n) and f(n+1) where the jump is more than 1.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the minimum n where f(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n2. Find the maximum n where f(n) = m. Let's call this high.\n3. If there are no such n (i.e., if m is not achievable), then output 0.\n4. Otherwise, the numbers from low to high inclusive are the answers. The count is high - low + 1.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, we can find the lower bound and upper bound of n where the count is exactly m.\n\nBut how to find those?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and the largest n where f(n) = m.\n\nWait, but for example, if m is 5, then the first n where f(n) >=5 is 25 (since f(24)=4, f(25)=6). So since f(n) jumps from 4 to 6, m=5 is not achievable. So the answer would be 0.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the smallest n such that f(n) >=m. Let's call it left.\n- Find the smallest n such that f(n) >=m+1. Let's call it right.\n- Then, if f(left) == m, then the numbers from left to right-1 are the possible n's. Because for all n in [left, right-1], f(n) = m. Because once you reach right, f(n) is >= m+1.\n\nSo the count is (right - left). But wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose m=1. Let's compute left and right.\n\nleft is the smallest n where f(n) >=1. That's 5. Then right is the smallest n where f(n)>=2. Which is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are the ones with exactly 1 trailing zero. So the count is 9-5+1 =5. Which matches the sample. So in this case, right-1 is 9, left is 5. So the numbers are from left to right-1, which is 5 to 9. The count is right - left.\n\nBecause right - left is 10-5=5. Which is the same as 9-5+1=5. So yes, the count is right - left.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFind left = the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nFind right = the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1.\n\nIf f(left) != m, then there are no solutions. Else, the numbers are from left to right-1, inclusive. So the count is right - left.\n\nSo how to compute left and right? Using binary search.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement the function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nImplementing that is straightforward. For example:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nSo for binary search, we can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. How to find that?\n\nThe binary search can be done between low=0 and high=5*m. Because for m, the minimal n that gives count_zeros(n) >=m is at most 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, and higher divisions contribute more).\n\nWait, but for example, m=1, 5*m=5. Which is correct. For m=5, 5*5=25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Which is >=5. So the binary search can be done between 0 and 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps even higher values can be considered, but 5*m is sufficient.\n\nSo for the binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nOnce we have left and right, then check if count_zeros(left) == m. If not, then output 0. Otherwise, the numbers are from left to right-1.\n\nSo the steps for the problem:\n\nGiven m:\n\nCompute left = minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nCompute right = minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m+1.\n\nif count_zeros(left) !=m, then output 0.\n\nElse, the answer is the numbers from left to right-1 inclusive. The count is right - left.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nleft is 5, right is 10. So numbers 5-9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's compute left and right.\n\nleft is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). So 4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5 is 25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 which is not equal to 5. So output 0.\n\nWhich is the second example in the sample input, where m=5 outputs 0.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, handle the case when m=0? Well, the problem says m starts from 1. So no need.\n\nNow, implement the count_zeros function.\n\nThen, for a given m, find left and right.\n\nBut how to perform the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nImplement a helper function to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nLet me think about the binary search logic.\n\nThe minimal n can be found by starting with low=0 and high=5*target (or something like that). Because for target m, the minimal n is at most 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is m + m//5 + m//25 + ... which is definitely >=m.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nLet me write a helper function:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for example, when target is 1, the function returns 5. Which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for target=5, returns 25. Which is correct.\n\nSo once we have left = find_min_n(m), and right = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nThen check if count_zeros(left) == m. If not, then output 0. Else, the numbers are from left to right-1.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute left = find_min_n(m)\n\ncompute right = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m: output 0\n\nelse: the numbers are from left to right-1, inclusive. So the count is right - left.\n\nBut how to generate the list of numbers?\n\nFor example, if left is 5 and right is 10, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So the list is [5,6,7,8,9].\n\nSo the code would generate that list.\n\nBut for large m, say m=1e5, what is the maximum possible size of the list? Well, for example, when m is such that there are multiple n's. For example, when m is 24, then the numbers would be from 100 to 104 (assuming that count_zeros(100) is 24, and count_zeros(105) is 25. So the list would be 5 elements. So in general, the list can have 0, 1, 2, ..., up to 5 elements. Wait, why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 when n is a multiple of 5, but sometimes more. So for example, when n is 25, the count increases by 2. So for m=5, there's no solution. But for other cases, the numbers between left and right-1 would be consecutive numbers. So the number of elements is right - left.\n\nSo the code can generate the list as [left, left+1, ..., right-1].\n\nSo the code would output the length (right - left) and the list.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there are multiple n's? For example, when m is 24, and left is 100, right is 105. Then the list is 100,101,102,103,104. Which is 5 elements.\n\nSo in code, the list is range(left, right). But in Python, range is exclusive of the upper limit. So for example, range(left, right) would generate numbers from left to right-1.\n\nSo the code can generate the list as list(range(left, right)).\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead m from input. But the input is given as a single line, which is m. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, the input is ['1', '5'] which seems to be two test cases. Wait, but the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. Wait, the problem statement says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nBut the sample input shows something different. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as ['1', '5'], and the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']. Oh, perhaps this is a way to represent multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for two test cases. But the actual code needs to read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nWait, the original problem's sample input is:\n\nInput\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut this may be a mistake in the problem description. Maybe the sample input is two separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is two test cases, but the code should read one m per input. But the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, and for the problem, the input is a single m.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. So the code should read a single integer from input. But the sample input shows two inputs, perhaps as two separate test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin, and output the correct answer.\n\nBut the user's note says that the sample input is ['1', '5'] and output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'], which suggests that the code needs to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is a single m. This seems conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the input section, it says: The only line of input contains an integer m. So the code should read one integer m from input.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's given as two lines, perhaps. But the sample shows that for input 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers, and for input 5, output is 0.\n\nBut the way the sample is presented is probably a mistake. Because the problem says that the input is a single m. So the code must read one m from input.\n\nSo for the code, the input is one line, which is m. So for example, in the first sample, the input is 1, and output is 5 followed by the numbers. In the second sample, input is 5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code must read one m from input, and output the answer.\n\nTherefore, the code will read m from input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the find_min_n function via binary search.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input. Let's proceed.\n\nBut for m=0, but the problem says m is >=1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nThen, for the given m:\n\nleft = find_min_n(m)\nright = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = right - left\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(left, right))))\n\nWait, but in Python, range(left, right) gives numbers from left to right-1, which is exactly what we need.\n\nBut let's test for m=1:\n\nleft = 5, right = 10. So range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Correct.\n\nBut for m=5:\n\nleft = find_min_n(5) = 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. Let's see. What is left?\n\nfind_min_n(6) would find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=6. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So left is 25. Then right is find_min_n(7). Let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6, which is less than 7. So the binary search for 7 would find 25? No. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So right is 30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. So 5 numbers. So for m=6, the answer is 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nBut count_zeros(25) is 6, which is correct. So the code would output 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, edge cases. What about m=0? Not allowed. So code doesn't handle it.\n\nAnother edge case: m=100000. How to handle that? Well, the binary search for find_min_n(100000) would have high=5*100000=500000. Which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut what if m is 100000, and the code runs in acceptable time? Well, the binary search is O(log(5m)) steps, and each step is O(log n) for count_zeros. So for m=1e5, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut the code needs to read m from stdin. So:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list, but in reality, the code reads from stdin. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is 1, and output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nBut in code, the code would read m = int(input().strip())\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which probably represents two test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single m. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but the code should handle one.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So the code should read one m.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen compute left and right.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code is written for a single m.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nleft = find_min_n(m)\nright = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = right - left\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(left, right))))\n\nWait, but for the case when k=0? Well, when left is such that count_zeros(left) is m, but right is left. Which would mean that right - left is zero. But that's impossible. Because for m, the find_min_n(m) returns the first n where count_zeros(n) >=m. Then find_min_n(m+1) returns the first n where count_zeros(n)>=m+1. So if the count_zeros(left) is m, then right is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=m+1. So for example, if m=6, and the count_zeros(left) is 6, then right is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7. So the numbers between left and right-1 would have count_zeros(n) =6. So right must be larger than left. So k is right-left, which is at least 1?\n\nNo, for example, if m is 6, and the first n where count_zeros(n) >=6 is 25, and the first n where count_zeros(n)>=7 is 30. Then right - left is 5, which is correct.\n\nBut suppose there's a case where m is such that the count_zeros(left) is m, and right is left+1. Then the numbers are left, and right-left is 1. So the list is [left].\n\nBut what if m is such that there's only one n? For example, m=24. Suppose that count_zeros(100) =24, count_zeros(101) =24, ... count_zeros(104)=24, count_zeros(105)=25. Then left is 100, right is 105. So the numbers are 100-104, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there's exactly one n?\n\nFor example, m=2. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. count_zeros(11) is 2. count_zeros(14) is 2. count_zeros(15) is 3. So left is 10, right is 15. So the numbers are 10-14, which is 5 numbers. So the code outputs 5 numbers. But that's not correct. Wait, no. For m=2, the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Which is 5 numbers. So code outputs 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when m is 3?\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). count_zeros(15) is 3. Then count_zeros(19) is 3. count_zeros(20) is 4. So left is 15, right is 20. So numbers are 15-19, which is 5 numbers. So code outputs 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother case: m=24. Let's compute count_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(104) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 25. So left=100, right=105. So the numbers are 100-104, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there is only one n? For example, if m is 5, but the code returns 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nleft = find_min_n(1) =5. count_zeros(5) is 1. right = find_min_n(2) =10. So numbers from 5 to 9. Output 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5. left = find_min_n(5) =25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So output 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for very large m, say 1e5, will the code run efficiently? Let's think. The binary search for find_min_n is O(log(5m)) steps. Each step involves O(log n) operations for count_zeros. So for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. So log2(5e5) is around 19 steps. Each step for count_zeros is O(log n), which is O( log(5e5) ) steps. So total steps are acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, when m is 1e5, the code will compute 5*1e5=5e5. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, the code needs to read m from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the code, when the numbers are printed, for example, when k=5, the code prints the numbers in a line. For example, the sample output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut in the code, the first print is k, then the second print is the list. So for the first sample, the code would print:\n\nprint(k) → 5\n\nprint(' '.join(...)) → 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in Python, when you print the list, the numbers are separated by spaces. So that's correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code may have a problem when m is zero, but according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is ≥1. So the code does not need to handle this.\n\nAnother edge case: m=1, but when the code returns 5 numbers. Which is handled.\n\nAnother case: m=25. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) = 24. count_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 25 (since 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. 21+4=25. So for m=25, find_min_n(25) would be 105? Or maybe some lower number?\n\nWait, let's compute count_zeros(100) is 24. So for target=25, the find_min_n would look for the first n where count_zeros(n)>=25.\n\nLet's compute for n=100: 24. n=105: 25. So the find_min_n(25) would return 105. Then, check count_zeros(105) is 25. So right is find_min_n(26). What is count_zeros(105) is 25, count_zeros(109) is 25. count_zeros(110) is 26 (110//5=22, 110//25=4, 110//125=0. 22+4=26). So find_min_n(26) returns 110. So the numbers are 105 to 109. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo code outputs 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes. Additionally, we must list these integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of $ n $ values that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes, we use binary search. We find the smallest $ n $ such that the trailing zeroes count is at least $ m $ (denoted as `left`) and the smallest $ n $ such that the trailing zeroes count is at least $ m+1 $ (denoted as `right`).\n3. **Check Validity**: If the trailing zeroes count at `left` is exactly $ m $, then the valid $ n $ values are from `left` to `right - 1`. Otherwise, there are no valid $ n $ values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    left = find_min_n(m)\n    right = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    if count_zeros(left) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = right - left\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(left, right))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in $ n! $ by summing the integer divisions of $ n $ by increasing powers of 5.\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeroes in $ n! $ is at least `target`.\n3. **main()**: Reads the input value $ m $, computes the bounds `left` and `right` using binary search, checks if `left` is valid (i.e., it results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes), and then prints the count and list of valid $ n $ values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
