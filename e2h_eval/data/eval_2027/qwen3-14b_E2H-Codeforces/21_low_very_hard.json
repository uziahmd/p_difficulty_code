The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because even chests can be paired with odd keys, and odd chests can be paired with even keys. So, for example, if there are 3 even chests and 5 odd keys, then we can pair 3 of them. Similarly for the other way around. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests=2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parity: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys=1 (7).\n\nSo min(3,1) + min(2,3) → 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the first example's output of 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example input: chests are 2,4,6,8,10 → all even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0. Keys are 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0. So min(5,1) + min(0,0) → 1 + 0 = 1. Which matches the second example's output.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 → all even. So even_chests=1, odd_chests=0. Keys: even_keys=4, odd_keys=0. So min(1,0) + min(0,4) → 0 + 0 = 0. Correct.\n\nSo this logic works. So the plan is:\n\n- Count even and odd in a_i.\n- Count even and odd in b_j.\n- Compute the sum of min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nSo the code needs to read n and m, then the list of a's and b's. Then compute the counts.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the a list, then the b list.\n\nFor the a list, count how many are even and odd. Similarly for the b list.\n\nThen compute the answer as min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nYes. So code steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\na = list of integers from input.\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nThen answer is min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nBut wait, what if even_a is larger than odd_b? Then we can take all odd_b keys to pair with even_a chests. Similarly for the other term.\n\nYes. So that's the correct approach.\n\nThis should handle all cases. Let's test edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, m=1. a is [1], b is [2]. Then even_a is 0, odd_a is 1. even_b is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. The key condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. This translates to pairing even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and odd-numbered chests with even-numbered keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Optimal Pairing**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of two minimum values:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys.\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n\nThis approach ensures that we optimally use the keys and chests based on their parity to maximize the number of successful openings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_a = n - even_a\n    \n    even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_b = m - even_b\n    \n    result = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Parity Counting**: We count how many numbers are even and odd in both the chests and keys lists.\n3. **Calculating Result**: Using the counts of even and odd numbers from both lists, we compute the maximum number of chests that can be opened by pairing even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The result is the sum of the minimum values of these two pairings.\n\nThis solution efficiently processes the input and computes the result in linear time relative to the size of the input lists, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the constraint limits.",
