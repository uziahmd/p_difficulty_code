The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because for a sum to be odd, one has to be even and the other odd. So, if a chest is even, it needs an odd key. If the chest is odd, it needs an even key. \n\nRight. So, the approach here would be to count how many even and odd chests there are, and similarly count the even and odd keys. Then, match them accordingly.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's separate the chests into even and odd. Let's say:\n\n- Even chests (a_i even) need keys that are odd (b_j odd) to make the sum odd.\n- Odd chests (a_i odd) need keys that are even (b_j even) to make the sum odd.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nOh right! Because for each even chest, we can use an odd key. But each key can be used once. Similarly for the odd chests and even keys. So the total is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. Calculate the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) and min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's the answer. \n\nLet me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's see:\n\nOdd chests: 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd). So odd_chests = 2, even_chests = 3.\n\nKeys: 8 (even), 4 (even),7 (odd), 20 (even). So even keys: 3 (8,4,20), odd keys: 1 (7).\n\nSo min(3, 1) is 1 (for even chests and odd keys). Then min(2, 3) is 2 (for odd chests and even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nChests: 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests =5, odd_chests=0.\n\nKeys: 5 (odd). So even keys:0, odd keys:1.\n\nSo min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. And odd_chests is 0, even_keys is 4. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Which matches.\n\nSo this logic works. \n\nSo the plan is straightforward. Now, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nWe need to read n and m, then the list of a_i, then list of b_j.\n\nCount even and odd in a. Then count even and odd in b.\n\nThen compute the sum of min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nYes. So code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a. For each element, check if even or odd. Count even_a and odd_a.\n\nRead the list b. Similarly count even_b and odd_b.\n\nResult is min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nThat's it. So the code can be written in Python as follows.\n\nNow, for handling large inputs, but since n and m are up to 1e5, it's manageable. Just loop through the lists once.\n\nLet me test the code with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na: 9,14,6,2,11 → odd counts: 2 (9 and 11), even counts 3.\n\nb: 8,4,7,20 → even counts 3 (8,4,20), odd counts 1 (7). \n\nmin(3,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. The key condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. This means that even chests require odd keys and odd chests require even keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Chests**: First, we count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Keys**: Similarly, we count how many keys have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n3. **Determine Maximum Matches**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of two values:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys (since each even chest needs an odd key).\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys (since each odd chest needs an even key).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    even_a = 0\n    odd_a = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_a += 1\n        else:\n            odd_a += 1\n    \n    even_b = 0\n    odd_b = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_b += 1\n        else:\n            odd_b += 1\n    \n    result = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Counting Parities**: We iterate through the list of chest numbers and key numbers to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- **Calculating Result**: Using the counts of even and odd chests and keys, we compute the maximum number of chests that can be opened by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The result is the sum of these two minimum values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal number of chests that can be opened using the given keys, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
