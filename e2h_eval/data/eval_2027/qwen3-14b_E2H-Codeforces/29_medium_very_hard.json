Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. But directly applying each substitution step-by-step would be computationally expensive, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. So we need an efficient way to handle these substitutions.\n\nHmm. The key here is that each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if we process each query naively by replacing all instances of di in the string with ti, that could lead to O(n * len(s)) operations, which might not be feasible for large n and s. For example, if each query replaces a digit that's present in the string many times, and there are many queries, this approach would be too slow.\n\nSo, what's a better way? Maybe we can model the substitutions using some kind of transformation rules, keeping track of how each digit is transformed through the queries. Since substitutions are applied in order, each query may affect the current mapping of digits.\n\nWait, think about it: each substitution replaces a digit di with ti. However, when a substitution is made, any subsequent substitutions that involve di would have to consider the new ti. But if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can find a way to compute the final value efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, think of each digit as being replaced by a certain expression. For example, suppose we have a mapping where each digit d maps to some string. But since substitutions can overwrite previous mappings, we need to track the latest substitution for each digit.\n\nBut even so, directly building the string is impossible because after multiple substitutions, the string could become extremely long. So we need a way to compute the final value without building the actual string.\n\nAh! Here's an idea: since the final value is computed modulo 1e9+7, perhaps we can represent the transformations using modular arithmetic. Let's think about how each substitution affects the numerical value of the string.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a digit d that is replaced by a string t. Let's say that before the substitution, the current value of the string is represented as a number. When we replace d with t, each occurrence of d in the string contributes to the overall number. However, since the substitution is replacing d with t, which may be a longer string, we need to model how this replacement affects the numerical value.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively. Suppose that each digit (from 0-9) has a value that represents the number it would contribute when expanded. For example, if we have a mapping where '2' is replaced by '00', then whenever we encounter a '2', it's equivalent to adding two zeros. But the problem is that substitutions can be nested. For instance, if a substitution replaces '3' with '2', and then '2' is replaced with '00', then each original '3' becomes '00'.\n\nSo the idea is to process the substitutions in reverse order. Because when you process a substitution, it might affect the current mappings. Wait, no. Let's think again. Each substitution is applied in the order given. For example, the first substitution is applied to the original string, then the second substitution is applied to the result of the first, etc. So if we want to model the final value, we need to track for each digit, what it expands to after all substitutions.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of each digit as having a function that represents its expansion. For example, if we have a substitution for 'd' that replaces it with 't', then after that substitution, whenever we see 'd', it's replaced by 't'. But if later substitutions modify other digits that are part of 't', then those would be handled in subsequent steps.\n\nWait, but substitutions are applied in sequence. So, for example, if we have:\n\nOriginal string: 'a'\n\nQueries:\n\n1. Replace 'a' with 'b'\n2. Replace 'b' with 'c'\n\nThen, the final string is 'c'.\n\nBut if we process the substitutions in reverse order, we can model the transformations. So perhaps we can model each digit's expansion as a function, and process the substitutions from last to first. Because when a substitution is applied, it's replacing a digit with another string. But if that string contains digits that have been substituted later, we need to account for that.\n\nWait, no. The substitutions are applied in the order given. So the first substitution is done first. Then, the second substitution is applied to the modified string. Therefore, if a substitution replaces 'd' with 't', and then another substitution replaces a digit in 't' with something else, that will affect the final result.\n\nSo, if we process the substitutions in reverse order, we can build up the mappings. Let me think: Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each substitution in reverse order, we can update the mapping. Wait, but that's not correct. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the substitutions are:\n\nFirst: 2 → 00\n\nSecond: 3 → 2\n\nSo, the original string is '3'. After the first substitution (replacing 2 with 00), but the original string has no 2s. Then the second substitution replaces 3 with 2. So the string becomes '2', which then is replaced by 00. But since the substitutions are applied in order, the first substitution is done first. So the order is:\n\nOriginal string is '3'.\n\nApply substitution 2→00: no effect.\n\nThen apply substitution 3→2: string becomes '2'.\n\nNow, the final string is '2', which is not replaced by 00 because the first substitution was already processed. So in this case, the substitutions are processed in order. So the first substitution is applied first, then the second.\n\nBut if we process substitutions in reverse order, how can we model the effect?\n\nLet me think again. Let's imagine that we have a mapping for each digit, which tells us what it expands to. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each substitution query, we need to update the mapping. However, when a substitution is applied, it replaces the current mapping of a digit. For example, if the substitution is 'd → t', then after this substitution, whenever we have 'd' in the string, it should expand to t. But if t contains digits that have their own mappings, then those would be expanded as well. However, since substitutions are processed in order, the substitution for d is applied before any substitutions that may affect digits in t. Wait, no. Suppose that we have a substitution for d, then later a substitution for a digit in t. Then, the substitution for the digit in t would affect the expansion of t.\n\nSo, the problem is that when we process the substitution for d, we need to replace it with t, but t may contain digits that are later substituted. So, if we process the substitutions in reverse order, we can ensure that when we process a substitution, any digits in t have already been processed, so their mappings are already accounted for. That way, when we replace d with t, we can substitute t with the current mappings of its digits.\n\nYes! This is a common trick in problems involving substitutions and dependencies. Let's think of this as building up the expansion of each digit from the last substitution to the first. Let's see:\n\nWe start with a mapping where each digit maps to itself. Then, for each substitution in reverse order, we process them. For example, suppose the substitution is di → ti. We need to update the mapping for di. However, ti may contain digits. But since we are processing substitutions in reverse order, any digits in ti would have already had their substitutions processed. Therefore, when we replace di with ti, we can replace ti with the current expansion of its digits.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the substitutions are:\n\nFirst substitution: 2 → 00\n\nSecond substitution: 3 → 2\n\nProcessing in reverse order, first process the second substitution (3 → 2). Then process the first substitution (2 → 00).\n\nSo, initially, each digit maps to itself. Let's process the second substitution (3 → 2). But how do we process this? Well, the substitution says that 3 is replaced by 2. But at this point, 2 maps to itself. So the new mapping for 3 is 2. Then, when processing the first substitution (2 → 00), we can replace the mapping of 2 with 00. But since 00 is just digits, which are mapped to themselves. So the final mapping is:\n\ndigit 2 maps to 00.\n\ndigit 3 maps to 2, which now maps to 00. So when expanding 3, it would be replaced by 2, which is replaced by 00. So the overall expansion of 3 would be 00.\n\nSo, if we process substitutions in reverse order and, for each substitution, we replace the target digit's mapping with the expansion of ti (using the current mappings of digits in ti), then we can build the correct expansion for each digit.\n\nYes! So the approach is:\n\n- Initialize a dictionary (or array) where each digit (0-9) maps to itself.\n\n- Process the substitutions in reverse order. For each substitution \"di → ti\", we need to update the mapping for di. But instead of storing ti directly, we need to replace ti with the current expansions of each of its digits. Because when we process substitutions in reverse order, any digits in ti have already had their substitutions processed. So, when we process substitution di → ti, we can compute the expansion of ti by replacing each character in ti with their current mappings. Then, we set di's mapping to this expanded string.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the expansion of ti? Because ti is a string that may consist of digits. For example, if ti is \"23\", and currently 2 maps to \"00\" and 3 maps to \"4\", then the expansion of ti is \"004\".\n\nBut if we process substitutions in reverse order, and for each substitution, we replace the di's mapping with the expansion of ti (with all digits in ti expanded according to the current mappings), then we can build up the correct expansion for each digit.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, we can take the original string, and for each character in it, expand it according to the final mappings, and then compute the numerical value mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that expanding the original string may result in a very long string. For example, if each substitution replaces a digit with a long string, and the original string is long, then the final string could be extremely long. Therefore, we can't actually build the string and then compute the mod. Instead, we need a way to compute the mod value efficiently during the expansion.\n\nSo, the next challenge is to compute the mod value of the expanded string without building the entire string. How can we do that?\n\nThe key insight is that the expansion of each digit can be represented as a value (mod MOD) and a length (number of digits). Because when you append a number to another, you can compute the new value as (original_value * 10^length_of_new_part + new_value) mod MOD.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a number A, and you append a number B (which has length L digits). Then the new number is A * 10^L + B.\n\nTherefore, for each digit, we can precompute two values:\n\n- val: the numeric value of the expansion of this digit mod MOD.\n\n- len: the number of digits in the expansion of this digit.\n\nThis way, when processing the original string, for each character in it, we can compute the contribution of that character's expansion to the overall value.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Process the substitution queries in reverse order, maintaining for each digit d, its val and len. Initially, for each digit d, val is d mod MOD, len is 1.\n\n2. For each substitution query (di → ti), we need to compute the expansion of ti. Since ti is a string, and each character in ti can be expanded using the current mappings. So, for the substitution, we need to compute the combined val and len of ti's expansion.\n\n   For example, if ti is \"abc\", then the expansion is the concatenation of the expansions of a, b, c. So, the total val is (val_a * 10^{len_b + len_c} + val_b * 10^{len_c} + val_c) mod MOD. And the total len is len_a + len_b + len_c.\n\n   However, calculating this for each ti during substitution processing is necessary.\n\n   So, for each substitution, we need to compute the combined val and len of ti's expansion. Once we have that, we can set the val and len of di to this new value.\n\n3. Once all substitutions are processed, we process the original string s. For each character in s, we get its val and len, and compute the overall value of the entire string by combining them in order.\n\nBut how do we compute the combined val and len for ti's expansion?\n\nLet's think. Suppose ti is a string, say, t = t1 t2 ... tk. Then the expansion of t is the concatenation of the expansions of each ti. For example, if each ti is replaced by their val_i and len_i, then the combined val is:\n\nval_total = val_1 * 10^{sum_{j=2}^k len_j} + val_2 * 10^{sum_{j=3}^k len_j} + ... + val_k\n\nSimilarly, the total len is sum len_i.\n\nSo, for each substitution query, when we need to compute the expansion of ti, we can iterate through each character in ti, and compute the cumulative val and len.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nWe can process each character in ti in order, maintaining the current value and length. Let's say we start with current_val = 0 and current_len = 0. For each character c in ti:\n\n- Get the val and len for c (based on current mappings).\n\n- The new current_val is (current_val * pow(10, len_c, MOD) + val_c) % MOD\n\n- The new current_len is current_len + len_c.\n\nSo, for example, if ti is \"ab\", and a has val_a and len_a, and b has val_b and len_b, then the combined val is (val_a * 10^{len_b} + val_b) mod MOD, and len is len_a + len_b.\n\nThis seems manageable. So during substitution processing, for each ti, we can compute its combined val and len as above.\n\nOnce we have that, we can update the di's val and len to this new value.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, we can process the original string s, and for each character in s, accumulate the val and len.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nInitialize for each digit d in 0-9:\n\nval[d] = int(d) % MOD\n\nlen[d] = 1\n\nThen, for each substitution in reverse order:\n\n   di is the digit to replace.\n\n   ti is the string to replace with.\n\n   Compute the combined val and len of ti, using the current val and len of each character in ti.\n\n   Set val[di] = combined_val, len[di] = combined_len.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, process the original string s:\n\nInitialize total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\nFor each c in s:\n\n   current_val = val[c], current_len = len[c]\n\n   total_val = (total_val * pow(10, current_len, MOD) + current_val) % MOD\n\n   total_len += current_len\n\nAt the end, if the total_len is zero (i.e., the string is empty), output 0. Otherwise, output total_val.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the note says that leading zeros are ignored. However, the problem says that when you represent s as a decimal number, you ignore leading zeros. However, in the example, the third sample input is \"222\" with two substitutions: 2→0 and 0→7. The output is 777. Let's see why.\n\nOriginal string is 222. First substitution is 2→0, making it 000. Then substitution 0→7, making it 777. So the output is 777, which is correct. So the leading zeros are not removed. Wait, the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string after replacement. So the problem says that when you compute the number, you ignore leading zeros, but the string itself may have leading zeros. For example, if the final string is \"000\", the number is 0, not 000. But in our calculation, how does that affect the mod?\n\nAh, the problem says that when you represent s as a decimal number, you ignore leading zeros. So if the final string is \"000\", the number is 0. If the string is \"00123\", it's 123. But how do we compute that using our method?\n\nWait, our current approach computes the value of the string as a number, including leading zeros. For example, the string \"00123\" would be treated as 00123, which is 123. However, our method would compute (0 * 10^5 + 0 * 10^4 + 1 * 10^3 + 2 * 10^2 + 3) mod MOD. Which is 123. So that's correct. Because leading zeros contribute 0 to the value. So the way we compute the total_val is correct, regardless of leading zeros. Because, for example, \"00\" would be 0, which is correct.\n\nSo, the current approach of accumulating the total_val as per the digits, including leading zeros, is correct. Because the mod calculation would automatically account for leading zeros. For example, if the string is \"000\", the total_val would be 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nProcess the substitutions in reverse order, updating for each digit d, its val and len, which represent the value and length of the expansion of d. Then, process the original string s, accumulating the total_val as per the expansion of each character.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute the pow(10, len, MOD) terms efficiently. Because for each substitution, when combining the ti's expansion, we need to compute exponents of 10. Also, during the processing of the original string, we need to multiply by 10^current_len each time.\n\nBut for that, we can precompute the powers of 10 modulo MOD. However, since the maximum possible len for a substitution is up to ... well, the sum of the lengths of ti's. Since the sum of ti's lengths is up to 1e5, but during substitution processing, the len can be up to something like 1e5 * 1e5 (but that's not feasible). However, since we are using modular exponentiation, we can compute pow(10, k, MOD) on the fly. However, for each step, when we need to compute 10^k mod MOD, we can compute it using the built-in pow function with three arguments (which is efficient).\n\nBut during substitution processing, for each ti, we need to process each character in ti and compute the pow(10, len_c, MOD) for each step. So, for example, when combining the val of a new character into the existing current_val, we need to multiply the current_val by 10^len_c mod MOD, then add the new val_c.\n\nSo, for each substitution, when we process ti, we can compute the combined val and len as follows:\n\ncurrent_val = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 0\n\nfor each char in ti:\n\n    c_val = val[char]\n\n    c_len = len[char]\n\n    current_val = (current_val * pow(10, c_len, MOD) + c_val) % MOD\n\n    current_len += c_len\n\nThen, we set the val[di] = current_val, len[di] = current_len.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nNow, the question is, how to handle the initial setup. For example, the initial val for each digit is the digit itself, and len is 1.\n\nSo, for the initial setup, we can have a list (say, for digits 0-9) of tuples (val, len). For example, for digit d, val[d] = d, len[d] = 1.\n\nNow, processing the substitution in reverse order.\n\nLet's take the first example from the problem:\n\nSample Input:\n\nOriginal string is '123123'\n\nn is 1, query is '2->00'.\n\nProcessing in reverse order (only one query). So, the substitution is 2 → 00.\n\nProcessing this substitution:\n\nti is '00'.\n\nWe need to compute the combined val and len of '00'.\n\nInitially, for each digit, val is d, len is 1.\n\nSo for the first character '0', val is 0, len 1. Then, the second character '0' is also 0, len 1.\n\nSo the combined val is (0 * 10^1 + 0) mod MOD = 0. len is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo the substitution for 2 is set to val 0, len 2.\n\nThen, when processing the original string '123123', each character is processed:\n\nFor '1', val is 1, len 1. So total_val starts as 0, then becomes (0 * 10^1 + 1) = 1. total_len is 1.\n\nThen '2' is processed. Its val is 0, len 2. So total_val = (1 * 10^2 + 0) = 100. total_len is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThen '3' is processed. val is 3, len 1. total_val = (100 * 10^1 + 3) = 1003. total_len is 4.\n\nThen '1' again: total_val = 1003 * 10^1 + 1 = 10030 + 1 = 10031. total_len 5.\n\nThen '2': 10031 * 10^2 + 0 = 1003100 + 0 = 1003100. total_len 5 + 2 = 7.\n\nThen '3': 1003100 * 10^1 + 3 = 10031000 + 3 = 10031003. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, let's think about the third sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n222\n\nn=2\n\nqueries:\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nSo the substitutions are processed in reverse order. First process 0->7, then process 2->0.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial val for 0 is 0, len 1.\n\nProcessing 0->7: ti is '7'. So for ti, compute the val and len. '7' is processed as val 7, len 1. So the substitution for 0 is now val 7, len 1.\n\nThen process 2->0. ti is '0', which is now mapped to val 7, len 1. So the combined val is 7, len 1. So substitution for 2 is val 7, len 1.\n\nOriginal string is '222'. Processing each '2' gives val 7, len 1. So:\n\ntotal_val starts at 0.\n\nAfter first '2': 0 * 10^1 +7 =7.\n\nAfter second '2': 7 * 10^1 +7 = 77.\n\nAfter third '2': 77 *10 +7 = 777. Which is the sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input:\n\nOriginal string is '123123', query is '3->'.\n\nSo substitution is 3 → empty string. Processing in reverse order (only one query).\n\nFor ti, which is empty string. So the combined val and len is 0 and 0.\n\nSo, the substitution for 3 is val 0, len 0.\n\nProcessing original string:\n\nEach character:\n\n'1' → val 1, len 1 → total_val 1.\n\n'2' → val 2, len 1 → total_val 1*10 +2 = 12.\n\n'3' → val 0, len 0 → total_val = 12 * 10^0 +0 = 12 +0 =12. len increases by 0 → remains 2.\n\nThen '1' → 12 * 10^1 +1 = 120 +1 = 121. len is 3.\n\n'2' → 121 * 10^1 +2 = 1210 +2 = 1212. len 4.\n\n'3' → 1212 * 10^0 +0 = 1212 +0 = 1212. len 4.\n\nWhich is the sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: empty string. For example, if after substitution, the string is empty, then the output is 0.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle this.\n\nNow, coding steps in Python:\n\nWe need to read the input. But the input is given as a list of test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the sample input shows that the user provided multiple test cases, but the actual input is per test case. However, the problem description says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains string s.\n\nThe second line contains integer n.\n\nThen n lines of queries.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input line is ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', ...]. But that's probably a mistake. Wait, the sample input shows that the user provided a list of inputs, but in reality, the program should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the actual input is as per the problem statement. For example, for the first sample input, the input is:\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n2->00\n\nWhich would output 10031003.\n\nBut the sample shows that the input is given as a list of test cases. However, that's probably part of the way the sample is presented. For example, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but the actual code should read from stdin. So the code must read from stdin, not from a list.\n\nBut the code must process multiple test cases? No. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains string s.\n\nThe second line contains n.\n\nThen n lines of queries.\n\nSo the code must read one test case. However, the sample shows that the input is given as multiple test cases. But that's probably part of the way the sample is presented, but in reality, the code must process one test case per run.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of four test cases. But the problem says that the code should process one test case. However, the user's sample input is perhaps a way to show multiple examples. But the actual code should read from stdin, which for each run, is one test case.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains string s (the initial string).\n\nThe second line contains n (number of queries).\n\nThen n lines of queries.\n\nSo the code must process exactly one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, that's probably a mistake in the way the sample is presented. For example, the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one test case. However, looking at the sample output, it's a list of outputs for each of those test cases. So perhaps the user is supposed to write a code that can handle multiple test cases, but that's not clear from the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, etc. So the code must read from stdin, which for each run, is one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, this is likely a mistake in the way the sample is presented. For example, the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but in reality, each test case is given as per the input format.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows that there are four test cases. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains string s. The second line contains n. Then n lines of queries.\n\nSo the code must process a single test case. However, in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake, and the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is given as a list of outputs for each of the four test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each in the format described. But the problem statement doesn't mention that.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, looking at the problem's note, the sample input is given as a list of four test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nBut this seems to be a list of four separate test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each of which is a separate input.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is conflicting. However, given that the sample output is a list of outputs for each input, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the code should read input from stdin, which for the programming competition problem, is usually one test case per run. However, perhaps the problem is designed to have multiple test cases, and the code should read until EOF.\n\nBut the problem's input format says that the first line is s, second line is n, then n lines of queries. So the code must process exactly one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output given, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. For example, the first input line is a list of test cases. However, that's not standard. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input representation.\n\nBut regardless, the problem's code must process a single test case. So the code should read from stdin, which is the input for one test case.\n\nSo, assuming that the code must read one test case, the code will read s, then n, then n lines of queries.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nImplement the approach discussed.\n\nImplement the following steps:\n\n- Read s, n, then the n queries.\n\n- Initialize for each digit (0-9) a val and len. For example, using two arrays, or a dictionary.\n\n- Process the queries in reverse order.\n\n- For each query, parse di and ti.\n\n- Compute the combined val and len of ti, using the current mappings.\n\n- Update the mapping for di with the new val and len.\n\n- Once all substitutions are processed, process the original string s.\n\n- For each character in s, accumulate the total_val and total_len.\n\n- Output total_val mod MOD, unless the total_len is zero (in which case output 0).\n\nBut how to handle the case where the total_len is zero? For example, if the original string is empty (but according to the problem statement, the initial s has length at least 1). However, after substitutions, the string may become empty. For example, if the original string is '3' and there's a substitution 3→\"\" (empty string). Then the final string is empty, which is considered as 0.\n\nIn our code, during processing the original string, if all characters are replaced with len 0, then the total_len is zero. So, in that case, output 0.\n\nSo, during the processing of the original string, we can check if total_len is zero, and output 0. Otherwise, output total_val.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\nImplementing the val and len arrays. Since digits are 0-9, we can use lists of size 10.\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nRead s: s = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, process the queries in reverse order.\n\nInitialize val = [i for i in range(10)]\n\nlen_ = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\nWait, no. The initial val for each digit is the digit itself mod MOD. So for digit d, val[d] = d % MOD. Since d is 0-9, it's just d. len_ is 1 for each.\n\nThen, for each query in reversed(queries):\n\nparse the query into di and ti.\n\nFor example, the query is of the form \"d->t\", where d is a single character, and t is the replacement string.\n\nSo, split the query into parts. For example, split on '->', which gives two parts: di and ti.\n\nSo, for each query in reversed order:\n\ndi = query[0]\n\nti = query.split('->')[1]\n\nThen, compute the combined val and len of ti.\n\nTo compute that, we can loop through each character in ti, and for each character, get its current val and len, and compute the combined val and len.\n\nFor example:\n\ncurrent_val = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 0\n\nfor c in ti:\n\n    c_val = val[int(c)]\n\n    c_len = len_[int(c)]\n\n    current_val = (current_val * pow(10, c_len, MOD) + c_val) % MOD\n\n    current_len += c_len\n\nOnce this is done, set val[int(di)] = current_val, len_[int(di)] = current_len.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, process the original string s:\n\ntotal_val = 0\n\ntotal_len = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    d = int(c)\n\n    current_val = val[d]\n\n    current_len = len_[d]\n\n    total_val = (total_val * pow(10, current_len, MOD) + current_val) % MOD\n\n    total_len += current_len\n\nif total_len == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(total_val)\n\nBut wait, the problem says that if the string is empty, output 0. However, the original s is non-empty (as per the input constraints, 1 <= |s| <= 1e5). But after substitutions, the string could be empty. For example, if the original string is '3' and substitution is 3->\"\".\n\nIn that case, during processing the original string, each character is processed. For '3', the current_val is val[3], which is the expansion of ti. But in this case, ti is empty string. So during substitution processing, the code for ti would be empty string. So, for ti being empty string, the loop for c in ti would not run, so current_val is 0, current_len is 0. So, val[di] is 0, len is 0.\n\nSo during processing the original string, for each '3', current_val is 0, current_len is 0. So total_val is (total_val * pow(10, 0) + 0) mod MOD. Which is (total_val * 1 + 0) mod MOD. But since the initial total_val is 0, after processing the first '3', it's 0. total_len is 0.\n\nThus, after processing all characters, total_len is 0, and we output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the pow(10, c_len, MOD), since c_len can be up to ... well, for each substitution, the len can be up to sum of the lengths of ti's. However, since the sum of ti's lengths across all queries is up to 1e5, the maximum possible len for a single substitution is up to 1e5. So pow(10, c_len, MOD) is manageable.\n\nBut for each step, when combining the ti's expansion, we have to compute pow(10, c_len, MOD). However, in Python, pow(10, c_len, MOD) is efficient.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the initial processing of the queries, how to parse the query.\n\nFor example, the query string is like \"2->00\". Split on '->' gives [\"2\", \"00\"].\n\nBut what if the ti is empty? For example, \"3->\" would split into [\"3\", \"\"].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor query in reversed(queries):\n\n    parts = query.split('->')\n\n    di = parts[0]\n\n    ti = parts[1]\n\n    # process ti...\n\nBut in Python, split on '->' would split into two parts. For example, if the query is \"3->\", then parts is [\"3\", \"\"].\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nNow,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The challenge lies in efficiently processing these substitutions without explicitly constructing potentially very large strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Process substitution queries in reverse order. This allows us to build up the transformations for each digit based on subsequent substitutions.\n2. **Dynamic Value Tracking**: Maintain two arrays, `val` and `len_`, where `val[d]` represents the numeric value of digit `d` after all substitutions, and `len_[d]` represents the length of the string resulting from expanding digit `d`.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently. Specifically, use powers of 10 modulo $10^9 + 7$ to compute the contribution of each digit expansion to the final result.\n4. **Combining Values**: For each substitution query, compute the combined value and length of the replacement string by iterating through its characters and using the current values from the `val` and `len_` arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize val and len_\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    len_ = [1] * 10\n    \n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1]\n        # Compute the combined val and len of ti\n        current_val = 0\n        current_len = 0\n        for c in ti:\n            d = int(c)\n            c_val = val[d]\n            c_len = len_[d]\n            current_val = (current_val * pow(10, c_len, MOD) + c_val) % MOD\n            current_len += c_len\n        # Update the di's val and len\n        d_int = int(di)\n        val[d_int] = current_val\n        len_[d_int] = current_len\n    \n    # Process the original string s\n    total_val = 0\n    total_len = 0\n    for c in s:\n        d = int(c)\n        current_val = val[d]\n        current_len = len_[d]\n        total_val = (total_val * pow(10, current_len, MOD) + current_val) % MOD\n        total_len += current_len\n    \n    if total_len == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(total_val)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The `val` array starts with each digit mapped to itself, and `len_` starts with each digit having a length of 1.\n- **Reverse Query Processing**: By processing queries in reverse, we ensure that each substitution is applied considering all subsequent transformations.\n- **Value and Length Calculation**: For each substitution, we calculate the combined value and length of the replacement string using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow and ensure efficiency.\n- **Final Result Calculation**: After processing all substitutions, we compute the final result by iterating through the original string and using the precomputed values from `val` and `len_` arrays, again using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle large transformations efficiently without explicitly constructing large intermediate strings, leveraging modular arithmetic and dynamic programming techniques.",
