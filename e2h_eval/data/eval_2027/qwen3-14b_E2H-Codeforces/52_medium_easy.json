Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take 'b' of them to make a new one. And this new candle can be used again, and so on. The question is to find the total hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned ones are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are burned, so he can make 2/2 = 1 new. Uses that, adding 1 hour. Now, that one is burned, but he can't make any more since 1 < 2. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's check:\n\nStart with 6: 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Use them, +2 hours. Now, 2 burned. Can't make more since 2 <3. Wait, but wait, the total would be 6+2=8. Which matches. But wait, what if there's a way to get more?\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to accumulate the remainders. Like, maybe after some steps, you have some leftover burned candles that can be combined with new ones. But how?\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\nInitially, the total hours is 'a', because each candle is used once. Then, the number of burned candles is 'a'. Then, each time we can take 'b' of them to make a new candle. Each new candle adds 1 hour, and when it's burned, adds another to the burned pile.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburned = a\n\nthen while burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles\n\nrepeat until burned < b.\n\nYes, that seems right. Because each time, we take as many as possible from the burned candles to make new ones. And each new candle is used immediately, adding to the total hours, and then when they burn out, they contribute to the burned pile again.\n\nSo for the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 4. burned is 4.\n\nloop:\n\n4 >= 2. new_candles = 4//2 = 2. total becomes 4+2=6. burned is (4%2=0) +2 = 2.\n\nloop again: 2 >=2. new_candles=1. total is 6+1=7. burned is 0 +1=1. Now, 1 <2, exit. So total is 7.\n\nYes. For the second example, a=6, b=3:\n\ntotal starts at 6. burned is 6.\n\nloop: 6//3=2. total is 8. burned is 0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So done. Total 8.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial hours is 5. burned is 5. 5//5=1. total becomes 6. burned is 0 +1=1. Now done. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial hours:5. burned=5.\n\nFirst loop: 5//2=2, total 5+2=7. burned is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nNext loop: 3//2=1. total 8. burned is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nNext loop: 2//2=1. total 9. burned is 0 +1=1. Now done. So total 9.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Read a and b.\n\n- Initialize total = a.\n\n- burned = a.\n\n- While burned >=b:\n\n   new = burned //b\n\n   total += new\n\n   burned = burned %b + new\n\n- Return total.\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nThe input is two integers per line, but the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers. Wait, the sample input shows ['4 2', '6 3'], but perhaps that's just the way the examples are presented. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput is a single line containing two integers a and b. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is 4 2, and output is 7. So the code must read a single line, split into two integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given in the problem statement, the user provided:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['7', '8']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the actual code should read a single line, but in the sample, there are two test cases. Wait, maybe the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases in the input, but the code is supposed to handle each line as a separate test case?\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers. So the code should read a single line, split into a and b. For example, for the first sample input, the input is \"4 2\", output is 7.\n\nBut the sample shows that the input is given as a list of two cases. However, that's probably part of the problem's example, not the actual input format. For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read from stdin, which may have multiple lines. However, according to the problem statement, the input is a single line. So perhaps the code should read a single line, split into a and b.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given in the problem:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['7', '8']\n\nWhich suggests that there are two test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement, and the actual input is multiple lines, each with two integers. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the user is supposed to read a single line, but in the sample input, there are two lines? Or maybe the problem is written in a way where the input is multiple test cases, but the code needs to process each line as a separate test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single line containing two integers a and b. So for example, the first sample input is 4 2, and output is 7. The second sample input is 6 3, output 8. So the code should read a single line, and output a single integer.\n\nBut the sample input in the problem shows two lines, perhaps as two separate test cases. However, in the problem's note, the first sample input is given as '4 2' and output is 7. So the code should read a single line, split into a and b.\n\nTherefore, the code should read a single line, split into a and b, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nThen compute the total as per the algorithm above.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new = burned // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burned = burned % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs:\n\nFor 4 2:\n\ntotal starts at 4, burned 4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew = 4//2 = 2. total 6. burned 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total 7. burned 0 +1=1. exit. Correct.\n\nFor 6 3:\n\ntotal starts at 6, burned 6.\n\nnew = 6//3=2. total 8. burned 0+2=2. exit. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2. As discussed earlier, the code would compute 9.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when a=0? But according to the input constraints, a is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=2. Then total is 1. Because burned is 1, which is less than 2.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Then initial total is 2. burned is 2. new is 1. total becomes 3. burned is 0 +1=1. exit. So total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can illuminate his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out candles to create new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and reusing the remnants optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours initially.\n2. **Track Burned Candles**: After each hour, the burned-out candles are collected. These can be reused to create new candles.\n3. **Reuse Process**: Continuously check if the number of burned-out candles can be converted into new candles using the given ratio `b`. Each time new candles are made, they are used immediately, contributing additional hours and more burned-out candles.\n4. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Repeat the process of converting burned-out candles into new ones until there are not enough burned-out candles left to form a new candle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nburned = a\nwhile burned >= b:\n    new = burned // b\n    total += new\n    burned = burned % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the input values `a` (number of initial candles) and `b` (the number of burned-out candles needed to make a new one). The total number of hours is initialized to `a` because each initial candle burns for one hour.\n2. **Burned Candles Tracking**: After using all initial candles, we track the number of burned-out candles.\n3. **Conversion Loop**: As long as there are enough burned-out candles to make a new one (i.e., `burned >= b`), we convert them into new candles. Each conversion reduces the count of burned-out candles and increases the total hours by the number of new candles made.\n4. **Update Burned Count**: After each conversion, update the count of burned-out candles to include both the leftover remnants from the conversion and the newly burned candles.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of reusing burned-out candles, ensuring that we maximize the total number of hours the room can be illuminated. The algorithm runs in O(log a) time complexity due to the repeated division of the number of burned-out candles, making it very efficient even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
