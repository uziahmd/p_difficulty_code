For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of ways to assign values c_s for each binary string s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to compute this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. The condition says that for every binary string s (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset must consist of exactly n-length binary strings.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So our goal is to find all possible assignments of c_s values such that when you choose the c_s's, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each possible assignment of c_s's, we need to determine what's the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. Then, count the number of assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum for a given set of c_s's?\n\nThis feels like a problem involving some kind of constraints and dependencies between the prefixes. For example, if a longer string has a certain c_s, it affects the counts of its prefixes.\n\nWait, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset would be determined by some constraints. Let me think of it as a tree structure. Each binary string can be considered as a node in a trie. For example, the root is the empty string, and each level represents the length of the string. But since the problem considers strings of length from 1 to n, maybe the trie is built up to depth n.\n\nBut how does the choice of c_s affect the maximum size of the multiset? The multiset consists of n-length strings. For each such string, when you add it to the multiset, it contributes to the count of all its prefixes. For example, adding '01' would increase the count for '0' (prefix of length 1), '01' (prefix of length 2), and also any longer prefixes if they exist. Wait, no: the prefixes are all the prefixes of the string. So for a string of length n, all its prefixes of length 1, 2, ..., n are considered. So each string added contributes +1 to each of its prefixes.\n\nBut the constraints are that for each prefix s, the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. So the problem is similar to choosing a set of n-length strings such that for all prefixes s, the number of strings in the set that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. And we want the maximum possible size of such a set.\n\nSo the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints on the c_s's. Now, the question is: given the c_s's, what is the maximum number of strings we can have in the multiset?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with some kind of flow or dynamic programming. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to compute this maximum using the constraints of the c_s's.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the trie structure again. For each node (binary string s), the number of strings in the multiset that pass through this node (i.e., have s as a prefix) is constrained by c_s. But each string in the multiset contributes to all its prefixes.\n\nNow, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the minimum of certain constraints along the paths. For example, if we think of each node's capacity as c_s, then the problem resembles a flow where each path from the root to a leaf (n-length string) can contribute 1 to the capacities of all nodes along its path. The maximum number of such paths that can be selected without exceeding any node's capacity is what we need.\n\nThis sounds familiar. It's similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of paths in a tree where each node has a capacity, and each path uses the capacity of all nodes along it. In such a case, the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum capacities along the paths. But how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the trie is a full binary tree of depth n. Each node corresponds to a binary string of length equal to its depth. The root is depth 0 (empty string?), but in our problem, the strings start from length 1 up to n. So perhaps the trie is structured with depth from 1 to n.\n\nBut how to model the maximum number of strings that can be chosen such that for all prefixes, their counts are within c_s?\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where each node's capacity limits the number of paths passing through it. The maximum number of paths is the minimum over all nodes of (capacity of node) multiplied by something... Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAnother approach: For each node, the number of strings that pass through it is equal to the sum of the number of strings that pass through its children. Because each string that passes through a node must go through its children. However, each node has a capacity c_s. So the maximum number of strings that can pass through a node is limited by c_s. Also, the number of strings passing through a node is equal to the sum of the number of strings passing through each of its children.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the node is not a leaf. For example, if a node is at depth d < n, then each string that goes through it can branch into two children (for the next depth). However, the capacity c_s for the node restricts how many times it can be used. So, the maximum number of strings that can pass through this node is limited by c_s. However, the number of strings that pass through it is the sum of the number of strings that pass through its children. So for each node, the sum of the number of strings in its children must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut since the leaves are at depth n, the number of strings passing through them is 1 (each string is a leaf). So this seems like a problem where we can model the constraints in a bottom-up manner.\n\nSo, for each node (starting from the deepest ones), the maximum number of strings that can pass through it is min(c_s, sum of the capacities of its children). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a node s of depth d (where d < n). Let's denote the maximum number of strings that can be passed through s as x_s. Then, the number of strings passing through s is x_s, which must be ≤ c_s. Also, since each of these x_s strings must pass through one of the two children of s. So x_s = x_{left_child} + x_{right_child}. Therefore, for each node, x_s = min(c_s, x_left + x_right).\n\nWait, but how? Because the left and right children can have their own capacities. So for a node s, the maximum number of strings that can pass through it is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum numbers of strings that can pass through its children.\n\nBut since the children's x values are themselves determined by their own capacities and their children, this suggests that we can compute x_s for all nodes in a bottom-up manner.\n\nSo, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the x_root, where the root here would be the empty string? Wait, no. The root would be the depth 0 node (empty string), but our problem considers strings of length from 1 to n. However, the root's children are the depth 1 nodes (strings of length 1). But the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the x of the root's children? Or perhaps the root's x is the sum of the x of its children, but the root itself isn't part of the constraints except for the strings of length 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the root isn't considered here. Let me think again. The problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be <= c_s. So for the root (empty string), which is not considered here (since the problem says length from 1 to n), but the root's children (the depth 1 strings) have their own c_s. However, the root's count (number of strings in the multiset that have empty string as a prefix) is exactly the number of strings in the multiset, since every string has the empty string as a prefix. But the problem doesn't mention the empty string, so perhaps the root's count is not constrained. Wait, no. The problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So the empty string is not considered. Therefore, the constraints for the root (if it were considered) would not be part of the problem. Therefore, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the constraints of the nodes at depth 1 to n.\n\nBut how does the bottom-up approach work here? Let's take an example. Suppose n=2. The nodes are:\n\n- depth 1: \"0\", \"1\"\n\n- depth 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\".\n\nEach node s has a capacity c_s. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the sum of the x values of the depth 1 nodes, but each of those x values is constrained by their own capacities and their children.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of strings is x, which is computed as follows:\n\nFor each node at depth d (from n down to 1), compute x_s as the minimum between c_s and the sum of x of its children. For the leaves (depth n), their children are none. So for leaves, their x is min(c_s, ...). Wait, but leaves have no children. So for a leaf node s (depth n), the number of strings that can pass through it is 1 (since each string is exactly s). But wait, the x_s for the leaves would be the number of times s is included in the multiset. But since each string in the multiset is exactly of length n, each such string contributes 1 to the count of its own prefix (the string itself). So for a leaf node, the maximum number of strings that can pass through it is the minimum between c_s and the number of times it can be selected. However, since the leaf's children are none, the sum of children is zero. So for the leaves, x_s is min(c_s, 0 + 0) = 0? That can't be right.\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding the x_s. Let me re-express the idea.\n\nThe x_s represents the maximum number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. For example, for a leaf node s (length n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is exactly the number of times s is in the multiset. Since each string in the multiset is of length n, and s is of length n, the only way for s to be a prefix is if the string is s itself. So the count for s is the number of times s appears in the multiset. However, the constraint is that this count must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut for a node s of depth d < n, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the sum of the counts for all its children. Because any string that has s as a prefix must be in one of the two children's subtrees. Therefore, for the node s, the count of strings that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts of its children. However, this count must be ≤ c_s. Therefore, the maximum count for s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum counts of its children.\n\nSo for the leaves, which are at depth n, their maximum count is min(c_s, ...). But since they have no children, the sum of the children is zero. So x_s = min(c_s, 0) = 0? That can't be right because we can have the string s itself in the multiset, contributing 1 to the count. So perhaps my model is wrong.\n\nAh, here's the confusion: the x_s represents the maximum number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. For a leaf node s (depth n), the count is exactly the number of times s is in the multiset. Let's call this value x_s. For this node, the count must be ≤ c_s. So x_s can be up to c_s. However, since the node has no children, the sum of children's x is zero. But for the parent node (depth n-1), the sum of the x of its children (which are the leaves) must be ≤ c_parent.\n\nSo, for a leaf node s, the maximum x_s is min(c_s, ...), but since there's no children, the sum of the children's x is zero. So the x_s for the leaf is min(c_s, ...). Wait, but what determines the maximum possible x_s for the leaf? It can be any value up to c_s, but also, the parent node's x is the sum of the children's x. So the x_s for the leaf is constrained by the parent node's c.\n\nThis suggests that the approach of computing x_s as min(c_s, sum_children_x) is not correct for the leaves. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct way is that for any node s, the maximum number of strings that can have s as a prefix is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum number of strings that can have each of its children as a prefix.\n\nFor example, for a node s of depth d < n, the sum of the maximum counts of its children (each of which is a node of depth d+1) gives the maximum number of strings that can have s as a prefix. But this sum must not exceed c_s. So x_s = min(c_s, sum_children_x).\n\nFor the leaves (depth n), they have no children. So sum_children_x is zero. However, the maximum number of strings that can have s as a prefix is the number of times s is included in the multiset. But since s is a leaf, this is exactly the number of times s is in the multiset. However, the sum of the children is zero. So according to the formula, x_s = min(c_s, 0) = 0. But that's not correct, since we can include s in the multiset as long as c_s ≥ 1.\n\nThis indicates that the model is missing something. Perhaps the formula for x_s is different for leaves. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is that for a node s of depth d, the maximum number of strings that can have s as a prefix is the sum of the maximum number of strings that can have each of its children as a prefix. However, for leaves (d = n), their children are nothing, so sum is zero. But for leaves, the maximum number of strings that can have s as a prefix is the number of times s is included in the multiset, which is not constrained by any children. So the formula for leaves is that x_s can be up to c_s. But how does this fit into the model?\n\nAh! Maybe the formula should be:\n\nFor any node s, x_s = min( c_s, sum of x_children )\n\nBut for leaves, the sum of x_children is zero. However, the x_s for the leaves is the number of times s is included in the multiset. But how does that relate to the sum of x_children?\n\nWait, the sum of x_children for a leaf is zero. However, the x_s for the leaf is the number of times s is included in the multiset. But since s is a leaf, it has no children. So the sum of x_children is zero, which would imply that x_s must be zero. Which is not correct.\n\nSo clearly, this approach is flawed. Let's think differently.\n\nThe maximum number of strings in the multiset is the sum of the x_s for the root's children (depth 1 nodes). Wait, no. The multiset consists of n-length strings. Each such string contributes 1 to the count of all its prefixes. So the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the constraints on all prefixes. How?\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a trie, and for each node, the number of strings that pass through it (i.e., have it as a prefix) is constrained by c_s. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the maximum number of paths (each path being a string of length n) that can be selected such that for every node on the path, the count of paths passing through it is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a flow network, but perhaps there's a way to compute it using dynamic programming.\n\nLet me try to model the problem recursively. For each node, the maximum number of strings that can pass through it (i.e., the number of strings in the multiset that have this node as a prefix) is limited by c_s. For a node s of depth d, the number of strings passing through it is equal to the sum of the number of strings passing through each of its children. Because each string that passes through s must pass through one of its children. So, the number of strings passing through s is the sum of the number of strings passing through each of its children. However, this sum cannot exceed c_s. Thus, the maximum number of strings passing through s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum numbers of strings passing through its children.\n\nBut for leaves (depth n), their children are none, so the sum of their children is zero. However, the number of strings passing through a leaf is the number of times that leaf is included in the multiset. So for a leaf node, the number of strings passing through it is equal to the number of times it is selected. This can be anything up to c_s. However, since the leaf has no children, the sum of children's strings is zero. But according to the formula, the maximum number of strings passing through the leaf is min(c_s, 0) = 0, which contradicts the possibility of including the leaf in the multiset.\n\nThis suggests that the formula is missing something. Perhaps the formula should be:\n\nFor non-leaf nodes, x_s = min( c_s, x_left + x_right )\n\nFor leaf nodes, x_s = min( c_s, ... ). But since there are no children, the sum is zero. However, the leaf can have x_s = any value up to c_s, but this value will be the number of times the leaf is selected. However, this value contributes to the x of its parent.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for a leaf node is x_s = min( c_s, ... ), but what's the ... ?\n\nThe parent of the leaf is a node of depth d = n-1. For that parent node, x_parent is min( c_parent, x_left + x_right ), where x_left and x_right are the x values of the two children (the leaves). So, the x_left and x_right can be any values up to their respective c_s's, but their sum must be ≤ c_parent.\n\nAh, this makes sense. So for the leaves, their x_s can be any value between 0 and c_s, but their sum (with the other child) must be ≤ c_parent. So, for the leaves, their x_s is not fixed by their own c_s, but by their parent's c_parent. However, the x_s for the leaves can be as large as possible, provided that their sum with their sibling is ≤ c_parent.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems that the x_s for leaves can vary, but their sum with their sibling must be ≤ c_parent. However, for the parent node, the x_parent is min( c_parent, x_left + x_right ). So, if x_left + x_right ≤ c_parent, then x_parent is x_left + x_right. Otherwise, it's c_parent.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of strings in the multiset (which is the x of the root's children, i.e., the depth 1 nodes)? Wait, the root's children are the depth 1 nodes. The x for the root's children would be the sum of their children's x values. But for the root's children (depth 1 nodes), their children are the depth 2 nodes. So the x for the root's children is min( c_depth1_node, sum of x of their children (depth 2 nodes) ).\n\nBut the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the sum of the x values of the depth 1 nodes. Because each string in the multiset is a path from the root's children (depth 1) to leaves (depth n). So the total number of strings is the sum of the x values of the root's children.\n\nWait, no. Because each x value of a depth 1 node represents the number of strings that have that node as a prefix. Since the strings are of length n, each such string must be in the subtree of the depth 1 node. So the x value of the depth 1 node is exactly the number of strings in the multiset that have that node as a prefix. However, since the multiset consists of strings of length n, each string is counted once in exactly one of the depth 1 nodes. Therefore, the total number of strings in the multiset is the sum of the x values of the depth 1 nodes.\n\nSo the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the sum of x_0 and x_1 (for n=1, but for general n, the sum of x values of the root's children, which are the depth 1 nodes).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to, for a given set of c_s's, compute the maximum possible sum of x values of the root's children (depth 1 nodes), where x_s for each node is defined as:\n\nx_s = min( c_s, sum of x of children )\n\nBut for leaves, the sum of x of children is zero. So for a leaf node s, x_s can be any value up to c_s, but since it's a leaf, the sum of children is zero. However, the x_s for the leaf is the number of times the string s is included in the multiset, and this value is constrained by the parent's x.\n\nWait, this seems to suggest that for leaves, their x_s can be any value up to c_s, but this value is part of the sum of the x of their parent. So the parent's x is min( c_parent, x_left + x_right ), where x_left and x_right are the x values of the two leaves (children of the parent). Therefore, the x_left and x_right can be chosen as any values such that their sum is ≤ c_parent. However, each of them can be up to their own c_s.\n\nBut how do we maximize the total number of strings in the multiset? For a given set of c_s's, the maximum number of strings is determined by propagating the constraints from the leaves up to the root.\n\nThus, the way to compute the maximum number of strings is:\n\nFor each node, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root, compute x_s as the minimum between c_s and the sum of x of its children. However, for leaves, since they have no children, their x is the minimum between c_s and something. But what?\n\nAh, for leaves, the sum of their children's x is zero. So x_s = min(c_s, 0) = 0. But that's not correct. Because for a leaf node, we can include it in the multiset as long as c_s allows. So why is this model not working?\n\nMaybe the model should be that for each node, the x_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the x of its children. But for leaves, since they have no children, their sum is zero. However, the x_s for leaves can be increased by allowing them to have their own x_s up to c_s, but how does that interact with their parents?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me think of a small example.\n\nTake n=1. The only nodes are the depth 1 nodes: \"0\" and \"1\". The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the sum of x_0 and x_1, where x_0 is the number of times \"0\" is in the multiset (which must be ≤ c_0), and similarly for x_1. So the maximum possible sum is min(c_0 + c_1, ... ?) Well, since there are no parents, the x_0 and x_1 can be up to their respective c's. So the maximum is c_0 + c_1. But according to the previous model, for each node (which is a leaf), x_s is min(c_s, sum of children's x) = min(c_s, 0) = 0. Which would give a total of 0. Which is wrong.\n\nSo clearly, the model is incorrect. What's the mistake here?\n\nThe mistake is that the formula for x_s is not correctly capturing the fact that for leaves, their x_s can be up to c_s, and this x_s contributes to their parent's sum.\n\nSo perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nFor a node s, x_s = min( c_s, sum_children_x ), but for leaves, sum_children_x is 0. However, the x_s for leaves can be set to any value up to c_s, but since there are no children, their sum_children_x is 0. However, the parent node's sum_children_x would be the sum of the x of its children (the leaves), which can be up to c_leaf_1 + c_leaf_2 (but constrained by the parent's c).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to think of the x_s as the minimum between c_s and the sum of the x of its children. But for leaves, since there are no children, their sum_children_x is zero. So x_s for leaves is min(c_s, 0) = 0. But this is not correct. However, in reality, the x_s for leaves can be up to c_s, but this value is not constrained by their own children. So the formula is missing something.\n\nAlternative idea: For a node s, the maximum number of strings that can have s as a prefix is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum number of strings that can have each of its children as a prefix. For leaves, since there are no children, the sum is zero, but the maximum number of strings that can have s as a prefix is up to c_s. So, for leaves, the x_s is min(c_s, ...). But what is the ...?\n\nAh! The sum of the children's x is zero. However, for the leaves, the maximum number of strings that can have s as a prefix is the number of times s is included in the multiset. This can be any value up to c_s. However, this value contributes to the parent's sum. So for the parent, the sum of the children's x is the sum of the leaves' x's. So the parent's x is min(c_parent, sum of leaves' x's).\n\nBut how do we determine the leaves' x's? They can be as large as possible, as long as their sum with their siblings is ≤ c_parent. So for the leaves, their x's can be chosen up to c_s, but subject to the sum with their sibling being ≤ c_parent.\n\nBut how do we compute this for the entire tree? It seems like for each node, we have to propagate the constraints from the bottom up. For the leaves, their x_s is the minimum between c_s and something. But what?\n\nMaybe the correct formula is that for a node s, x_s = min( c_s, sum_children_x ), and for leaves, sum_children_x is infinity. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps, for leaves, the sum_children_x is treated as unbounded, so x_s = min(c_s, infinity) = c_s. But then, for their parent, the sum of the children's x is the sum of the leaves' x's, which could be larger than the parent's c. Hence, the parent's x is min(c_parent, sum_children_x).\n\nYes! That makes sense. So the formula for x_s is:\n\nIf s is a leaf (depth n), then x_s = c_s. Because there are no children, so the sum_children_x is considered as infinity, hence x_s = min(c_s, infinity) = c_s.\n\nBut wait, this would mean that for leaves, their x_s is c_s. However, this would allow the parent to have sum_children_x = c_left + c_right, which may exceed the parent's c, leading to x_parent = min(c_parent, c_left + c_right).\n\nBut this seems to model the constraints correctly. Let's test this with the earlier example where n=1. For n=1, the nodes are leaves. So their x_s is c_s. The total number of strings is x_0 + x_1 = c_0 + c_1. Which matches our expectation. For example, in the first sample input where n=1, k=42, f=2. The valid assignments are those where c_0 + c_1 = 2. But the sample says that there are three ways. Let's see:\n\nIn the first sample, the answer is 3. The note says that the three ways are:\n\nc_0=0, c_1=2 → sum is 2.\n\nc_0=1, c_1=1 → sum 2.\n\nc_0=2, c_1=0 → sum 2.\n\nWhich matches the idea that the total is c_0 + c_1 = f. But in this case, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, for the assignment of c_s's, the maximum possible size is the sum of the leaves' x_s's, which is the sum of the leaves' c_s's. But wait, according to the formula, for leaves, x_s = c_s. Then the sum of the leaves' x_s's is the sum of their c_s's. But this would be the maximum possible size. However, this would only be true if the parent's constraints are satisfied. But in this case, there are no parents for n=1. So yes.\n\nBut what about for n=2? Let's take the example given in the problem statement. The example says that the multiset {11, 01, 00, 01} is beautiful. The constraints are:\n\nc_0=3, c_1=1, c_00=1, c_01=2, c_10=2, c_11=3.\n\nAccording to our formula, for each node:\n\nLeaves are depth 2. Their x_s is c_s. So:\n\nx_00 = 1\n\nx_01 = 2\n\nx_10 = 2\n\nx_11 = 3\n\nThen, their parents (depth 1 nodes):\n\nFor node '0', its children are '00' and '01'. Sum_children_x = 1 + 2 = 3. c_0 is 3. So x_0 = min(3, 3) = 3.\n\nFor node '1', its children are '10' and '11'. Sum_children_x = 2 + 3 = 5. c_1 is 1. So x_1 = min(1, 5) = 1.\n\nThe total number of strings is x_0 + x_1 = 3 + 1 = 4. Which matches the example's multiset size (4 elements). So this seems to work.\n\nAnother example: if for node '0' c_0 is 2, and for its children, their c's are 1 and 2. Then sum_children_x is 1+2=3. So x_0 is min(2, 3) = 2. So the sum for the root's children (assuming node '0' is one of them) would be 2 plus whatever comes from the other root child.\n\nSo this model seems to work. So the correct formula for x_s is:\n\nFor any node s, x_s = min( c_s, sum_children_x ), where sum_children_x is the sum of x of its children. For leaves (depth n), their children are none, so sum_children_x is considered as zero? Or is it considered as infinity? Wait, earlier example shows that for leaves, their x_s is c_s, which implies that sum_children_x is treated as infinity. Because min(c_s, infinity) = c_s.\n\nBut how to model this? For leaves, sum_children_x is zero? Or is it infinity?\n\nAh, the formula for x_s is:\n\nx_s = min( c_s, sum_children_x )\n\nBut for leaves, there are no children. So sum_children_x is zero. Then x_s would be min(c_s, 0), which would be zero. But this contradicts the earlier example. So this suggests that the sum_children_x for leaves should be considered as unbounded (like infinity), so that x_s = min(c_s, infinity) = c_s.\n\nSo how to model this? Perhaps the formula for sum_children_x is:\n\nsum_children_x = sum of x of children. For leaves, this sum is zero. But then x_s = min(c_s, 0), which is not correct. But in the example, for leaves, x_s is c_s. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nFor non-leaf nodes, x_s = min( c_s, sum_children_x )\n\nFor leaf nodes, x_s = c_s.\n\nBut then, how does this fit into the hierarchy? Because for a leaf's parent, the sum_children_x is the sum of the leaves' x_s, which is their c_s's.\n\nBut then, for the parent, the x is min( c_parent, sum_children_x ), which is min(c_parent, sum of leaves' c_s's).\n\nThis seems to work for the earlier examples.\n\nSo, the correct way to compute x_s is:\n\n- If s is a leaf (depth n), x_s = c_s.\n\n- Else, x_s = min( c_s, sum of x of children )\n\nThen, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the sum of the x values of the root's children (depth 1 nodes).\n\nThis seems to work with the earlier examples.\n\nSo, given this model, the problem becomes:\n\nFor each possible assignment of c_s's (each c_s is between 0 and k, inclusive), compute the maximum number of strings in the multiset (which is the sum of x values of the depth 1 nodes), and count the number of assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently, given that n can be up to 15, and the number of binary strings of length from 1 to n is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, this is 2^16 - 2 = 65534, which is manageable for some DP approaches, but with k up to 2e5, it's tricky.\n\nBut the problem requires us to count the number of assignments of c_s's (each from 0 to k) such that when we compute the maximum number of strings (as per the above model), it equals exactly f.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nThe key insight is that for each node, the x_s depends on the c_s and the x of its children. Therefore, we can model this with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible values of x_s and how they contribute to the overall count.\n\nHowever, since the nodes are hierarchical, we need to process them in a bottom-up manner. For leaves, x_s = c_s. For non-leaves, x_s = min( c_s, sum_children_x ). \n\nThe main idea is to compute for each node, the possible values of x_s based on the choices of c_s and the children's x_s. However, since the children's x_s depend on their own c_s, this seems complex.\n\nBut given that the tree structure is a binary tree of depth n, and each node has two children (except for leaves), perhaps we can model this recursively with memoization.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's define for a node at depth d (where d ranges from 1 to n), and for each possible value of x (the x_s for this node), what is the number of ways to choose c_s and the children's c's such that x_s is computed as per the rules.\n\nBut how to combine this for the entire tree.\n\nAlternatively, since the tree is a full binary tree, we can think of it as a collection of subtrees. For example, the root's children are two subtrees of depth n-1. Each of these subtrees contributes x values, and the root's x is min(c_root, x_left + x_right).\n\nBut the problem is that for each node, the x_s depends on c_s and the sum of the children's x. So, for each node, we need to know the possible values of x_s and how they can be achieved based on the choices of c_s and the children's x values.\n\nThis suggests that for each node, we can compute a function f(node, max_val) which returns the number of ways to assign c_s's to this subtree such that the x of this node is exactly max_val.\n\nBut since the x of a node depends on the sum of the children's x, and the choice of c_s for the node, we need to find for each node and possible x value, the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's parameters such that the x is achieved.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem where for each node, we compute a DP table that maps possible x values to the number of ways",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to assign values $ c_s $ to each binary string $ s $ of length from 1 to $ n $ such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) on a binary tree structure representing all binary strings up to length $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: Represent all binary strings as nodes in a binary tree where each node at depth $ d $ has two children (binary strings of length $ d+1 $).\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP approach to compute the number of valid assignments for each subtree rooted at a given node. This helps in efficiently combining results from child nodes to parent nodes.\n3. **Bottom-Up Calculation**: Process the tree from the leaves (depth $ n $) up to the root (depth 1). For each node, compute the number of ways to achieve a specific value of $ x $, which represents the maximum number of strings passing through that node.\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, use modulo $ 998244353 $ for all calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Precompute all nodes as tuples (depth, index)\n    # We represent the tree with nodes as depth and position in binary tree\n    # But for DP, we need to process nodes in order from leaves up\n    \n    # For each depth d from 1 to n, there are 2^d nodes\n    # We'll build a memoization table for each node\n    \n    # Let's represent each node by its depth and a unique identifier (like the number of the node in a binary heap)\n    # However, since n is small (up to 15), we can precompute for all possible subtrees\n    \n    # We will use memoization for each subtree, represented by depth and the current x value\n    \n    # For a node at depth d, the number of possible x values depends on the constraints from the children\n    \n    # We will use memoization with a dictionary for each node, but since the tree is full, we can process it level by level\n    \n    # First, precompute for all possible depths from n down to 1\n    \n    # For each depth d, we have 2^d nodes.

Let's think of it as follows:\n        # For a given pair (left_x, right_x), the sum is s = left_x + right_x. The possible x for this node is min(c_s, s). So for each possible c_s, the x is min(c_s, s)\n        # Therefore, for all possible c_s, the x is determined.

Then, for this node, the x is min(c_s, s). The number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, s) = x is:\n        # if x <= s: then c_s can be x, x+1, ..., s (since min(c_s, s) = x implies that x <= c_s <= s, but only when x is the minimum)\n        # Wait, no. For a given s, the x is min(c_s, s). So for x to be a particular value, the c_s must satisfy:\n        # if c_s >= s: x = s\n        # if c_s < s: x = c_s\n        # So, for a fixed s, the number of c_s that result in x is:\n        # if x < s: then c_s = x (only one choice)\n        # if x == s: then c_s can be any value >= s (but since c_s <=k, it's max(0, k - s + 1) ways)\n        \n        # Wait, no. For a given s, the x can be any value from 0 to min(s, k). For each x, the number of c_s choices that would make min(c_s, s) = x is:\n        # if x < s: then c_s must be exactly x. Because if c_s > x but < s, then min(c_s, s) is c_s, not x. So to have min(c_s, s) = x, c_s must be x, and x must be <= s.\n        # if x == s: then c_s must be >= s. So the number of c_s is max(0, k - s + 1)\n        # So for each s, the total ways for x is:\n        # if x < s: 1 way (c_s = x)\n        # if x == s: max(0, k - s + 1) ways\n        # if x > s: 0 ways\n        \n        # Therefore, for each pair of left_x and right_x, compute s = left_x + right_x, and then for each possible x, add to current_dp[x] the product of the counts from left and right multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s for this node to get x\n        \n        # However, this approach would be O( (k)^2 * ...) for each depth, which might be too slow for n=15 and k up to 2e5. But since n is small (<=15), and for each depth, the number of possible x values may be manageable, perhaps with some optimizations.\n        \n        # Let's proceed with this approach.\n        \n        # For the current depth d, we need to compute current_dp based on dp[d+1]\n        \n        # Get the left and right dp tables (they are the same, since the tree is symmetric)\n        child_dp = dp[d + 1]\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible left_x and right_x\n        # Since the left and right are both from the same dp[d+1], we can iterate over all possible pairs\n        \n        # However, for efficiency, we can precompute the frequency of x values in child_dp, and then compute the convolution of the frequencies to get all possible sums s = left_x + right_x\n        \n        # Let's first collect all possible x values in child_dp and their counts\n        child_x_list = []\n        for x in child_dp:\n            child_x_list.append((x, child_dp[x]))\n        \n        # Now compute the convolution of the child_x_list with itself to get the sum s and their counts\n        # We can do this by iterating through all pairs of x1 and x2, compute s = x1 + x2, and accumulate the counts\n        \n        # However, for large k, this could be expensive. But since n is small (up to 15), and for each depth, the maximum possible x is up to k * 2^{n - d}, which for n=15 and d=1 would be up to k*2^14, which could be up to 2e5 * 16384 ~ 3e9, which is way too big. So this approach is not feasible.\n        \n        # Alternative idea: for each node, the x is min(c_s, s), and the total number of ways is the sum over all possible s (sum of children x) and for each s, the number of ways to get s multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, s) = x.\n        \n        # However, since the children's x can be up to k, and for each depth, the number of possible s can be up to 2*k (for d=1), but for deeper depths, it's smaller.\n        \n        # Let's think about the following:\n        # For the current depth d, the number of ways to get x is the sum over all possible s (sum of children's x) of the number of ways to get s multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, s) = x.\n        \n        # So for each x, we need to compute:\n        # sum_{s} [ways_to_get_s * (number_of_c_s_choices_for_this_s_and_x)]\n        \n        # Where the number_of_c_s_choices_for_this_s_and_x is:\n        # if x < s: 1 (choose c_s = x)\n        # if x == s: max(0, k - s + 1)\n        # else: 0\n        \n        # So for each depth d, we can precompute the frequency of s values (sum of children's x) and then compute for each x the required sum.\n        \n        # To compute the frequency of s values, we need to calculate the convolution of the child_dp with itself.
