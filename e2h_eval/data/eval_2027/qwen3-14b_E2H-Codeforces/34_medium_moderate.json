And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I need to compute the average sleep time. Then, I have to output the average of all those averages. Oh right, but the way the problem is structured, maybe there's a smarter way than calculating each window from scratch.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line has n and k. Then the second line has n integers representing the sleep times. The output needs to be the average of all the averages of each week. Wait, but the example shows that for the first input, the weeks are [3,4] and [4,7], their averages are (3+4)/2 = 3.5 and (4+7)/2=5.5. Then the overall average is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? But the sample output is 9.0000... Wait wait, no, looking back at the example:\n\nWait the first input example is 3 2, and the array is [3,4,7]. The note says that the result is 9.000... Wait, how?\n\nWait the note says that for the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So perhaps the problem is not to take the average of the averages, but the average of the sums? Because for the first example, the weeks are two weeks. The sum of the first week is 3+4=7, the second is 4+7=11. The average of those sums would be (7 + 11)/2 = 9, which matches the sample output. Oh right! Because the average per week is (sum of the week)/k, and then the overall average is (sum of all those averages) divided by the number of weeks. But that's equivalent to (sum of all the sums of the weeks) divided by (number of weeks * k). Wait, but the problem says \"the average of all weeks\". Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks. The result is the average sleeping time over all weeks. So for each week, we calculate the average (sum of the week divided by k), then take the average of all these values. So the overall average is (sum of all the weekly averages) divided by the number of weeks. But that's equivalent to (sum of all the weekly sums) divided by (number of weeks * k). Because each weekly average is (sum_week / k), so adding them up gives (sum_weeks_total) / k, then divided by the number of weeks (let's call it m) gives (sum_weeks_total) / (k * m). \n\nBut sum_weeks_total is the sum of all the sums of each window. So, for example, in the first sample, the sum_weeks_total is 7 + 11 = 18. Then m is 2. So the overall average is 18/(2 * 2) = 18/4 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.000... Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample input says for the first case, the output is 9.000000. So according to the sample explanation, perhaps the problem is actually to compute the average of the sums of each week, not the average of the averages. Because in the first sample, the sum of the weeks is 7 + 11 = 18, divided by the number of weeks (2) gives 9. Which matches the sample output. But that contradicts the problem statement. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". So for each week, compute the average (sum of the week divided by k), then take the average of all those values. So the sample input's first case would be (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0000. That suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the example given in the problem statement:\n\nThe first example input is 3 2 and [3,4,7]. The output is 9.0000000000. According to the note, the result is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. So in this case, the sum of the weeks is 7 + 11 = 18, divided by 2 weeks gives 9. So that's what the problem wants. But that's the average of the sums of the weeks, not the average of the averages. So why is that the case?\n\nWait the problem says that the answer is the average of the averages. But the sample contradicts that. So perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". So Polycarp is considering each week's average, then taking the average of those. For example, in the first sample, the two weeks have averages 3.5 and 5.5. The average of those is (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nBut the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Let's look at the third example. The input is 8 2, and the array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. The number of weeks is 8-2+1 = 7. So the sum of all weeks is the sum of each consecutive pair. Let's compute that:\n\nWeek 1: 1+2 = 3\n\nWeek 2: 2+4=6\n\nWeek3:4+100000=100004\n\nWeek4:100000 +123= 100123\n\nWeek5:123+456= 579\n\nWeek6:456+789= 1245\n\nWeek7:789 +1 = 790\n\nTotal sum is 3 +6 +100004 +100123 +579 +1245 +790 = Let's see:\n\nAdding 3+6=9; 9 + 100004 = 100013; +100123 = 200136; +579 = 200715; +1245 = 201,960; +790 = 202,750. Then divide by 7 weeks: 202750 /7 = 28964.285714..., which matches the sample output. So according to this, the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the averages. Because in the first example, the sum of the weeks is 7 + 11 = 18, divided by 2 weeks gives 9, which is the sample output. So that's the correct approach.\n\nSo the problem statement's wording is confusing, but the actual required calculation is the average of the sum of each week. Which is the same as the sum of all the weekly sums divided by the number of weeks. Therefore, the problem requires us to compute the sum of all the k-length consecutive windows, then divide by the number of windows (which is n -k +1).\n\nSo the problem is not about the average of averages, but the average of the sums. Which is a bit different. So the key is to compute the sum of all the consecutive k-day periods, then divide by the number of such periods.\n\nSo how do I compute the sum of all consecutive k-day periods efficiently?\n\nThe naive approach is to compute each window sum by adding the elements, but that would be O(n*k) time, which is not feasible for n up to 2e5. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 1e5, then O(n*k) would be 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThus, we need an efficient way to compute the sum of all sliding windows of size k. The standard approach for this is to use a sliding window technique, where we compute the sum of the first window, then for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's leaving and add the new element that's entering. This way, each window sum is computed in O(1) time after the initial sum, leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nYes. So let's plan this:\n\n- Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n- Add this to the total sum.\n- Then, for each i from k to n-1:\n   - Subtract a[i -k] from the current sum\n   - Add a[i] to the current sum\n   - Add this to the total sum.\n- Then, divide the total sum by the number of windows (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nThis approach is O(n) time and O(1) space (excluding the input array), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array of a's.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\ntotal_sum = initial_sum\n\ncurrent_sum = initial_sum\n\nThen, for each i in range(k, n):\n\n   current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\n   total_sum += current_sum\n\nThen, the average is total_sum / (number_of_windows), where number_of_windows is (n -k +1).\n\nThen, output this average with sufficient decimal precision.\n\nBut wait, in the first example:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\nInitial sum is 3+4=7. Then, the next window is i=2 (since k=2, indexes start from 0?), let me think.\n\nWait the array is [3,4,7]. The first window is [3,4], sum 7. The next window is [4,7], sum 11. So total_sum is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 gives 9. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, for the case when k equals n. Then, there's only one window, which is the entire array. The code computes the initial sum (sum of all elements), adds it to total_sum, then returns that divided by 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when k=1. Then each window is a single element, and the total sum is sum of all elements. The number of windows is n. So the average is (sum of all elements)/n. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the problem requires to output the answer with enough decimal digits, such that absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So in Python, we can compute the average as a float, and then format it with, say, 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to handle the division? Since in Python, dividing integers with / gives a float. However, for very large numbers, perhaps we need to use floating points carefully. But since Python uses arbitrary precision for integers, but when converted to float, there might be precision issues. However, given that the constraints are up to 2e5 elements, each up to 1e5, the maximum possible sum is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10. The total_sum could be up to 2e10 * (2e5) = 4e15, which is within the range of a 64-bit float (which can handle up to about 9e18). So in Python, even with large numbers, converting to float should be okay.\n\nBut perhaps better to compute the total_sum as a float, but in practice, using integer arithmetic and then dividing once at the end is better.\n\nBut in Python, even with big integers, converting to a float is okay for the purposes of division here.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\nThen, compute the total_sum as initial_sum, then for each next window, add the current_sum.\n\nOnce total_sum is computed, divide by (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nThen, output the average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to handle the output formatting?\n\nIn Python, we can format the output with something like \"{:.10f}\".format(result), but need to make sure that even if the number is an integer, it's printed with 10 decimal digits. For example, in the first sample, 9.0 is printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input lines. Wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait looking back at the problem statement, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, the input section says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k...\n\nBut looking at the sample input, it's given as:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich seems to be three separate test cases. But the original problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Wait the original problem says that the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nOutput:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nWhich suggests that the code needs to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code needs to read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases?\n\nWait no. Looking back at the problem statement's input and output sections:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Because the sample input shows three separate test cases, but the problem says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each line represents a separate test case. However, in the original problem, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the output also shows multiple outputs. So perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases, but the problem statement didn't mention that. That's a bit confusing.\n\nWait looking back at the original problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nOutput:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps that's a mistake. Or perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, the second line the array. So for each test case, there are two lines.\n\nBut the sample input shows three separate test cases, each with two lines. So perhaps the code needs to read multiple test cases. But the original problem's input description does not mention that. This is a bit confusing. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read a single test case. However, the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, and for the sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is a contradiction. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe problem says that the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, looking at the sample output, it's possible that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description is unclear. However, the user's task is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin and prints the desired outputs. So perhaps the code needs to handle multiple test cases, but the problem statement's input description is wrong. But how to know?\n\nLooking at the original problem's sample input and output:\n\nFor example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich produces output 9.0000000000.\n\nThe second sample input is 1 1 and 10, output 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample input is 8 2 and the array, output as given.\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the input is for a single test case. But given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps the actual code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement may have been translated incorrectly, and the actual problem expects multiple test cases.\n\nBut how can we determine that?\n\nLooking at the problem's original source, perhaps this is from Codeforces. For example, the problem's title is \"Average Sleep Time\", and the sample input is similar to Codeforces problems. However, in Codeforces, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, etc. So perhaps the sample input is presented as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case. But that would not explain the sample input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement's input description is incorrect. For example, perhaps the actual problem requires reading multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says nothing about that. But given that the sample input includes multiple test cases, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from standard input. So how to read multiple test cases?\n\nIn programming competition problems, sometimes the input consists of multiple test cases. However, the problem statement must specify that. If the problem statement says that the input is for a single test case, then the code should process only one. However, in the sample input, there are three test cases, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how can we reconcile this?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's sample input and output, the first line of the sample input is ['3 2\\n3 4 7', ...], which seems to be a list of test cases. But perhaps this is a mistake in the problem's formatting, and the actual input is for a single test case. But the user's code needs to read from stdin, which for the sample input would have three separate test cases. However, without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original note, the third example has 8 2 and the array, which gives 7 weeks. So the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that each line is a separate test case. But the user's code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description doesn't mention this. This is a bit confusing.\n\nBut looking at the user's instruction, the task is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin and outputs the desired outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: first line with n and k, second line with the array.\n\nIn that case, the code needs to read all lines from stdin, split into test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the input can be read via sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), then process each line as needed.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says nothing about that. However, the sample input and output suggest that.\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input has three test cases, and the output has three outputs. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? Each test case has two lines: the first line is n and k, the second line is the array of n numbers.\n\nSo, for example, the code can read all lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut in Python, the standard way to read input is to read from stdin until EOF. So, for example, the code can read all lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the input is read as a list of lines. For each test case, we take two lines: the first line is n and k, the second line is the array.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the lines are:\n\nLine 1: '3 2'\n\nLine 2: '3 4 7'\n\nLine 3: '1 1'\n\nLine 4: '10'\n\nLine 5: '8 2'\n\nLine 6: '1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'\n\nSo the code would process three test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nTherefore, the code can read all lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n   if i+1 >= len(lines):\n\n       break\n\n   n, k = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n   a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n   # process the test case\n\n   i += 2\n\nBut this is assuming that the input is given as multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Well, looking at the sample input and output, this seems to be the case. However, the problem statement says nothing about multiple test cases. However, the sample input and output suggest that. So perhaps the problem is expecting that.\n\nBut the original problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n and k, the second line the array. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement's input description is wrong. Or perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the sample input is written in a way that each test case is on separate lines. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, but the user's code would process only one. But that would not match the sample outputs.\n\nThis is a critical point. If I proceed under the assumption that the code should handle multiple test cases, then the code will pass the sample input. Otherwise, if it's a single test case, then the code would not process the sample input correctly.\n\nBut the problem's note says that the third example has 8 2 and the array. So the code must process a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem's sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases. But without knowing the exact input format, it's hard to proceed.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement, the user is told that the input is as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo, the code is supposed to read two lines per test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. So, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, and the code is supposed to process them all.\n\nBut how can that be determined?\n\nWell, perhaps the user's code is supposed to process multiple test cases, and the problem statement's input description is incomplete. In programming contests, sometimes the input may have multiple test cases, and the problem statement may not explicitly state that. However, the sample input and output suggest that.\n\nIn the absence of clear instructions, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the code needs to handle multiple test cases, as per the sample input.\n\nBut to verify, let's look at the sample outputs. For example, the first test case's output is '9.0000000000', the second '10.0000000000', and the third '28964.2857142857'. These are three outputs for three test cases. Hence, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line with n and k, the second with the array.\n\nSo, the code will process each test case in turn.\n\nNow, back to the algorithm. Once the code reads the test case, it can compute the total sum of all sliding windows, then divide by the number of windows.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess pairs of lines.\n\nFor each pair:\n\nn, k = first line.\n\na = list of integers from second line.\n\nThen compute the sum of all sliding windows of size k.\n\nNow, for the sliding window sum:\n\nIf k == 0? No, since constraints say 1 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal_sum = initial_sum\n\ncurrent_sum = initial_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\nnumber_of_windows = n -k +1\n\naverage = total_sum / number_of_windows\n\nThen, output the average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut what about when k equals n? Then, number_of_windows is 1, and total_sum is sum(a), and average is sum(a)/1 = sum(a). Which is correct.\n\nNow, testing the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\ninitial_sum = 3+4=7\n\ntotal_sum starts at 7.\n\nThen i runs from 2 (k=2, n=3, so i ranges from 2 to 2 (since n is 3, range(k, n) is range(2,3) which is [2]).\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] (3) + a[2] (7) → 7-3+7 = 11.\n\nAdd to total_sum: 7 + 11 = 18.\n\nnumber_of_windows is 3-2+1=2.\n\naverage is 18/2 =9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1 and [10]. The initial sum is 10. number_of_windows is 1. average is 10. Correct.\n\nThird test case: 8 2 and array [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. The code computes the sum of all consecutive pairs, which totals to 202750 (as earlier calculation), divided by 7, which gives 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nNow, the code needs to output the average with at least 6 decimal digits. So, in Python, we can format the output with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to handle floating point precision? For example, when the average is an integer, like 9, we need to output 9.0000000000.\n\nIn Python, formatting with .10f will do that.\n\nSo, the code for each test case would be:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut in Python, when you do division, it returns a float. However, for very large numbers, the division may lose precision. But given that the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-6, using floating point division should be sufficient.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut for handling very large arrays, the code must be efficient. The sliding window approach is O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input_lines):\n        # Read n and k\n        if idx +1 >= len(input_lines):\n            break\n        line1 = input_lines[idx]\n        line2 = input_lines[idx+1]\n        n, k = map(int, line1.split())\n        a = list(map(int, line2.split()))\n        # Process\n        # Compute initial sum\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        # Slide window\n        for i in range(k, n):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        num_windows = n -k +1\n        average = total_sum / num_windows\n        # Print with 10 decimals\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        idx +=2\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if the input has an odd number of lines? For example, if there's a line left without a pair. But according to the problem statement, each test case has two lines, so the input will have even number of lines. But in practice, the code checks if idx+1 is within the list. So if there's an incomplete test case, it will be skipped.\n\nBut in programming competition problems, the input is always correct. So the code can assume that.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input:\n\nSample Input lines:\n\nLine 0: '3 2'\n\nLine 1: '3 4 7'\n\nLine 2: '1 1'\n\nLine 3: '10'\n\nLine 4: '8 2'\n\nLine 5: '1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst test case: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]. Output 9.0000000000.\n\nSecond test case: n=1, k=1, a=[10]. total_sum = 10. num_windows=1. average is 10.0. Output 10.0000000000.\n\nThird test case: n=8, k=2. a is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. The code computes total_sum as sum of all consecutive pairs. As discussed earlier, the total_sum is 202750. num_windows=7. 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... So the output is 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nBut when we format with .10f, the output will be 28964.2857142857, but how precise is that?\n\nThe actual value is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857142857..., which when printed with 10 decimals would be 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut the sample output is '28964.2857142857', which matches.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where n=k=1: output is a[0] /1 = a[0].\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=1. Then the number of windows is 2. The sum of the windows is a[0] + a[1]. average is (a[0]+a[1])/2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=4, k=2, a=[1,2,3,4]. The windows are [1,2] sum 3, [2,3] sum 5, [3,4] sum 7. total_sum is 3+5+7=15. average is 15/3=5.0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code reads the input as per the sample, processes each pair of lines, and outputs the correct results. So this should be the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of `k` days from a list of `n` days. The goal is to compute the average of the sums of each week's sleep times and output the result with high precision.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case includes two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (number of days per week), and the second line contains `n` integers representing the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: To efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive `k`-day window, we use the sliding window technique. This allows us to compute each window sum in constant time after the initial sum calculation, leading to an overall linear time complexity.\n3. **Summing Window Sums**: Calculate the sum of the first `k` days, then iteratively adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n4. **Average Calculation**: Once all window sums are computed, divide the total sum of these window sums by the number of windows to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input_lines):\n        if idx + 1 >= len(input_lines):\n            break\n        line1 = input_lines[idx]\n        line2 = input_lines[idx + 1]\n        n, k = map(int, line1.split())\n        a = list(map(int, line2.split()))\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        for i in range(k, n):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        num_windows = n - k + 1\n        average = total_sum / num_windows\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        idx += 2\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing. Each pair of lines represents a test case.\n- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first `k` elements is calculated to initialize the sliding window.\n- **Sliding Window Technique**: For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This ensures each window sum is calculated in constant time.\n- **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows to compute the final average, which is then printed with 10 decimal places to meet the required precision.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 days.",
