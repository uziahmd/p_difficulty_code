Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine all the letters from the guest and host, the pile should have exactly those letters, no more, no less. So, the steps are: take the first two input lines, concatenate them, then check if the third line is a permutation of that combined string.\n\nWait right. Because the pile is supposed to be all the letters from the guest and host, shuffled. So the total count of each character in the pile must exactly match the sum of the counts from the guest and host.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input.\n2. Combine the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Check if the combined string and the third line have the same character counts.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to use the Counter class from collections. For example, create a Counter for the combined guest and host names, and another Counter for the pile. Then compare if they are equal.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both Counters have the same counts for all characters, then it's a yes.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile), then output YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the lengths are different? For example, if the combined length is not equal to the pile's length. Because if the lengths are different, then obviously the counts can't be the same. So checking the length first could be a quick check.\n\nBut in Python, the Counter will automatically account for that. For example, if the combined has a different length than the pile, then the Counters would differ. So maybe checking the length first is a quick way to return NO early, which could save some processing time, but for the problem constraints (each line up to 100 chars), it's negligible. But perhaps better to check the length first.\n\nBut let's think: if the combined length is not equal to the pile's length, then the answer is definitely NO. So adding that check first could save some time.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    check if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile)\n\nBut wait, what if the combined length is same as pile's length, but the counts differ? Like, for example, combined is \"AAB\" and pile is \"ABB\". Then the counts would differ. So the Counter comparison would catch that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nThen, for each test case, read the three lines, combine the first two, check if the Counter of combined equals the Counter of pile.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input given, the first example:\n\nInput lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count the letters. Let me think:\n\nBut the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Wait, perhaps the combined length is same as pile's. Let me check:\n\nFirst line: SANTACLAUS is 10 letters? Let me count S-A-N-T-A-C-L-A-U-S: that's 10 letters. Second line DEDMOROZ: D-E-D-M-O-R-O-Z: 8 letters. Total 18 letters. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me count that. Let me see:\n\nS-A-N-T-A-M-O-R-O-Z-D-E-D-C-L-A-U-S. Let me count letters. Let me see, perhaps 18 letters. So the length matches. Then the Counter would check if all letters are present.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in the second sample input:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's count the letters. Let me think:\n\nPAPAINOEL is 9 letters. JOULUPUKKI is 10 letters. Total 19 letters. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters here. Let me see:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count letters. Let me see, perhaps the length is 20? Let me count:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I. Let me count each letter:\n\nBreaking down the pile string:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → Let's split into letters:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. That's 19 letters? Wait, let me count again. Let's see:\n\nOriginal pile string is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\".\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nJ (1), O (2?), U (3?), L (4?), N (5?), A (6?), P (7?), A (8?), O (9?), I (10?), L (11?), E (12?), L (13?), U (14?), P (15?), U (16?), K (17?), K (18?), I (19). So 19 letters. So combined length is 9 + 10 = 19. So the length matches. But the problem says that the pile has a missing P and an extra L. So the Counter would find that.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, for the third sample input:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nCombined is BABBONATALE + FATHERCHRISTMAS. Let's check the length. Let me count:\n\nBABBONATALE is 10 letters (B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E? Wait, let me count again. BABBONATALE: B A B B O N A T A L E → that's 11 letters. FATHERCHRISTMAS is F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → 14 letters. Combined length is 11 + 14 = 25. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters here. Let me see:\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER → Let me count the letters. Well, the problem says there's an extra L. So the length would be longer than the combined. Let me check:\n\nOriginal pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count letters. Let me see:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER → Let's see:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R. Let me count the letters. Let me count the letters step by step.\n\nBut perhaps the length is longer than the combined. Let me see:\n\nCombined length is 11 + 14 = 25. The pile's length is:\n\nLet me count the letters in the third sample's pile string. Let's see:\n\nThe string is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\". Let me count:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R → Let me count each character:\n\nB (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), H (5), R (6), I (7), S (8), T (9), M (10), A (11), S (12), B (13), O (14), N (15), A (16), T (17), A (18), L (19), L (20), E (21), F (22), A (23), T (24), H (25), E (26), R (27). So 27 letters. So the combined length is 25. So the code would check len(combined) (25) vs len(pile) (27), which is different, so output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code would handle that.\n\nTherefore, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut the input is three lines. Wait, the input is given as three lines. But in the sample input, the input is given as a list of three elements, but in reality, the input is three lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\nBut in reality, the input is three lines. So in the code, we need to read three lines from stdin.\n\nBut in Python, when using input(), each call reads a line. So for the code, the code would read:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen process them.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case's three lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo the code would read them correctly.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where the combined is empty? But according to the problem statement, all lines are non-empty. So the combined can't be empty. So no problem.\n\nBut in the code, even if combined is empty, but the pile is also empty, but according to the problem, all lines are non-empty. So the code is safe.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's check the length. Let's see:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S). DEDMOROZ is D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z → 8 letters. Total 18 letters. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → let's count letters. Let me see:\n\nLetters:\n\nS (1), A (2), N (3), T (4), A (5), M (6), O (7), R (8), O (9), Z (10), D (11), E (12), D (13), C (14), L (15), A (16), U (17), S (18). So 18 letters. So the length matches. Then the Counter would check if the counts are same.\n\nSo the code returns YES.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput lines:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined length is len(PAPAINOEL) + len(JOULUPUKKI) → len(\"PAPAINOEL\") is 9 letters. \"JOULUPUKKI\" is 10 letters. Total 19. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → len is 19? Let me check:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → that's 19 letters. So the length matches. But the Counter would find that the counts differ. For example, the combined has two P's (from PAPAINOEL: P appears twice?), let me check:\n\nPAPAINOEL → P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → P appears twice. JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → P once. So combined has 2 + 1 = 3 P's. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count P's. Let me see:\n\nIn the pile, looking for P's. Let's see the string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Breaking down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → P occurs at position 6 (the 'P' in JOULNAP...), then later there's a P in '...LUPUKKI' → so two P's? Or three?\n\nWait, the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → the letters:\n\nLooking for P's:\n\n- The 6th character (assuming starting from 0, but maybe easier to count manually). The first P is in \"JOULNAP...\" → the 'P' is after N. Then, later in the string, after 'LUPUKKI' → there's a P. So that's two P's. So the pile has two P's. But the combined has three P's. Therefore, the Counter would find that the counts don't match, hence output NO.\n\nSo the code would return NO for sample 2.\n\nSample 3: the code checks the length first. The combined length is 11 + 14 = 25. The pile's length is 27, so code returns NO.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where all letters are same. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES. If pile is \"BA\" → same. If pile is \"AAB\" → len is 3, combined is 2 → NO.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"ABC\", host is \"DEF\", pile is \"ABCDEFF\" → len is 6 + 3 = 9? No. Wait guest is 3 letters, host 3 letters, combined is 6 letters. Pile is 7 letters → len check fails, output NO.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES. But if pile is \"AC\", then Counter would check and find that B is missing and C is present → NO.\n\nSo the code handles these cases.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the code needs to read three lines. However, sometimes, when using input(), if the input is provided with trailing newlines or something, but the problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So the .strip() is okay, but perhaps the input may have leading or trailing whitespaces? But according to the problem statement, the input lines consist of only uppercase letters and are not empty. So using .strip() is safe, but perhaps even without it, since the problem says that the lines are correct. However, perhaps in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing whitespaces, but according to the problem statement, they are not present. So perhaps the code can just read the lines as input().strip().\n\nBut for example, if the input is read as input().strip(), then for a line that is \"ABC\\n\", the strip() would remove the newline, but in the problem statement, the input lines are correct. So perhaps the code can read as input().strip().\n\nBut in practice, when reading from standard input, the input() function will read until the newline, and the newline is not included. So for example, if the input is given as three lines, each line is read correctly. So perhaps the code can just read as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nBut in some cases, perhaps the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, they are not. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the combined and pile have same length but different characters? Like combined is \"AB\", pile is \"CD\". Then the Counter would check and find that counts differ. So code would return NO.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about if the combined is empty? According to problem statement, all lines are non-empty. So combined can't be empty. So the code is safe.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem is a list of three test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nBut in reality, the code is supposed to read three lines from input. However, in the problem statement, the input is three lines. But the sample shows that the input is given as three lines. So for example, the first test case's input is three lines:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo the code would process each of these three lines correctly.\n\nBut when the code is run, the input is read as three lines. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the pile of letters is a permutation of the combined letters from the guest's and host's names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Length Check**: If the length of the combined string does not match the length of the pile of letters, immediately return \"NO\" as they cannot be permutations of each other.\n4. **Character Count Check**: Use a counter to compare the frequency of each character in the combined string with that of the pile of letters. If the counts match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, and each line is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to represent all letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Length Check**: A quick check to ensure the lengths of the combined string and the pile are equal. If not, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n- **Counter Comparison**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile. If these counters match, it confirms that the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, hence \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently verify the permutation condition using character counts, which is both time and space efficient given the constraints.",
