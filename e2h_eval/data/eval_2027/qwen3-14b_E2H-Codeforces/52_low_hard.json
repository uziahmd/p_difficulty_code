Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can recycle the used ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The recycling rate is b: every b used candles can be turned into a new one. And this new candle can be used again, which in turn will become another used candle. So the process continues until he can't make any more new candles.\n\nThe task is to find the total number of hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He uses them all, which gives 4 hours. Then, he can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 used candles. He can make 2/2 = 1 new candle. Use that for 1 hour. Now he has 1 used candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Oh right, but wait, after using the 2 new ones, he has 2 used ones. Then making 1 new, which when used adds 1 hour, then that becomes another used candle. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. That makes sense.\n\nAnother example is 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's check:\n\nStart with 6 candles. 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Use them, 2 hours. Now 2 used. Can't make any more since 2 < 3. But wait, the output is 8. 6+2=8. Oh right. So that's the case.\n\nWait, but what if there's a way to collect more? Like, maybe after making some new ones, you can collect the used ones again?\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But each time you make new ones, they are used again, adding to the total hours, and then becoming used again.\n\nSo the algorithm would be something like:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to track the number of used candles that can be recycled.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\nEach time you burn a candle, you get one used candle. So the total hours is the sum of all the candles burned, which includes the initial ones plus the recycled ones.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nInitially, you have a candles. Each time you burn them, you add to the total hours. Then, for every b used candles, you can make a new one. So the process is:\n\ntotal = 0\n\nused = 0\n\nwhile there are candles to burn:\n\n   burn as many as possible, which is current_candles.\n\n   total += current_candles\n\n   used += current_candles\n\n   current_candles = used // b \n\n   used = used % b \n\nWait, no. Because when you burn the current_candles, you get that many used candles. Then, you can make new candles from them. So the new current_candles is (used // b). But then, after making those new ones, the used candles are (used % b) plus whatever is left from the previous step?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nWe have a variable 'used' that keeps track of the number of used candles we have. Initially, it's zero.\n\nBut each time we burn all the available candles (current_candles), which adds to the total hours. Then, the number of used candles increases by current_candles. Then, we can make new candles from the used ones. So the new current_candles is (used // b). But after that, the used candles are (used % b) because the ones that were used to make new ones are now gone (they are converted into new candles). Wait, no. Because when you take 'used' candles and make new ones, you take (used // b) new candles. The remaining used candles are (used % b). Because for example, if you have 4 used candles and b is 2, then you can make 2 new ones. The 4 used are all consumed, so remaining is 0. But if you have 5 used candles and b is 2, then you can make 2 new ones (using 4 of the 5), leaving 1 used candle.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nused",
