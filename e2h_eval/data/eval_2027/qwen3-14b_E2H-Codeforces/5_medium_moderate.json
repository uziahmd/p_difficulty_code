Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me think about how to approach it.\n\nSo the problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The colors can be letters or question marks. The question marks can match any color. Each boot can be in at most one pair. We need to find the maximum number of such pairs and output them.\n\nFirst, let's understand the compatibility rules. Two colors are compatible if:\n- Both are specific and same (like 'a' and 'a').\n- One is a question mark and the other is anything (like '?' and 'b', or '?' and '?').\n\nSo the goal is to pair left and right boots with these rules, maximizing the count.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? Let's think about possible strategies.\n\nAn initial thought: For each left boot, try to find a compatible right boot that hasn't been used yet. But since there are question marks involved, which can be flexible, we need an efficient way to match them.\n\nLet me think about grouping the boots by their color. For example, for the left boots, count how many of each color (including ?) there are. Similarly for the right boots. Then, for each color (excluding ?), we can pair as many as possible between left and right. Then handle the ?s.\n\nWait, but the ? can be matched with any color. So maybe first match the non-? colors where they can be paired, and then use the ?s to fill in the remaining.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of steps:\n\n1. Pair all left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots of the same color. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, we can pair 2 of them. The remaining left 'a's would need to be matched with ?s or other colors? No, because the ? can match them. Wait, but maybe we should first pair the non-? colors where possible, then use the ?s to match the remaining.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is:\n\n- For each color c (excluding ?), pair as many left c with right c as possible. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either ? or have colors that don't have a match), pair them using the ?s.\n\nBut how to handle the ?s?\n\nAlternatively, think of the following:\n\nWe can have three groups:\n\nLeft Specific (non-?): L_S\nRight Specific (non-?): R_S\nLeft Question Marks: L_Q\nRight Question Marks: R_Q\n\nThe idea is that for each color c (not ?), we can pair left c with right c. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those not paired yet), we can pair them using the question marks.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the question marks can be used to pair with any color. So, after pairing all possible specific color pairs, we can take the remaining left and right boots (which could be specific or ?), and pair them using the ?s.\n\nBut how to maximize the total pairs here?\n\nAnother approach: Let's first pair all left and right boots that are specific and same color. Then, for the remaining, we can use the ?s.\n\nBut how to handle the ?s optimally?\n\nFor example, suppose after pairing the specific colors, there are some left boots with specific colors (say, color 'a') and some right boots with specific colors (say, color 'b'). These can't be paired unless one of them is a ?. But since they are already processed, maybe they are not part of the specific pairs anymore.\n\nWait, no. The process would be:\n\nFor each color c (not ?), pair left c with right c as much as possible. So, for example, if there are 5 left 'a's and 3 right 'a's, we pair 3 of them. Then, the left 'a's that are left (2) can be paired with right ?s, or with other left ?s and right ?s?\n\nBut perhaps after that, the remaining left boots (specific or ?) can be paired with the remaining right boots (specific or ?). However, the problem is that the specific ones may not be able to be matched unless they are paired with ?s.\n\nSo, for example, if there are left 'a's left (unpaired) and right 'b's left (unpaired), they can't be paired. So those can't contribute to the total.\n\nThus, the only way to pair them is when one of them is a ?, which can match the other.\n\nSo, after pairing the specific colors, the remaining left and right boots can be considered as follows:\n\n- For each left boot not yet paired, it's either a specific color (but there's no corresponding right boot of that color) or a ?.\n- Similarly for the right boots.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the left ?s with right boots (specific or ?), and vice versa. But how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think of the remaining left and right boots. Let's say:\n\nAfter pairing specific colors, the left has some left_S_remaining (specific colors) and left_Q (question marks). Similarly for right.\n\nBut the left_S_remaining can't be paired with right_S_remaining (unless they are same color, which was already handled). So the only way to pair them is if one side is a ?.\n\nSo, the total number of pairs that can be made from the remaining is min( (number of left ? + number of left_S_remaining), (number of right ? + number of right_S_remaining) ) ?\n\nNo, that's not necessarily correct. Because each left ? can be paired with any right boot, and each right ? can be paired with any left boot. But we need to pair them optimally.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to pair as many as possible between left ? and right ? (since they can be paired), and then pair the remaining left ? with right specific, and right ? with left specific.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining is the sum of:\n\n- All left ? and right ? can be paired (each ? can be paired with another ?)\n- Also, left ? can be paired with right specific, and right ? can be paired with left specific.\n\nSo, the total possible is the sum of the minimum between left ? and right ?, plus the minimum between (left ? + left_S_remaining) and (right_S_remaining + right ?) ?\n\nNot sure. Maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the remaining left and right boots as follows:\n\nWe have some left boots (could be specific or ?) and some right boots (could be specific or ?). We need to pair them such that each pair is compatible.\n\nHow to model this? Well, the maximum possible pairs here is the minimum between the number of left boots and the number of right boots. Because each pair uses one left and one right. But the problem is that some left and right boots may not be compatible, so even though there are more left and right boots, you can't pair all.\n\nBut in this case, after the first step of pairing specific colors, the remaining left and right boots can be paired as long as at least one of the two is a ?.\n\nSo, the remaining left and right boots can be considered as a set of elements that can be paired with each other (as long as they are not both specific and different). So how to maximize the number of pairs?\n\nBut this seems like a bipartite graph problem. However, given the constraints of n up to 150,000, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me think about the following. After the first step (pairing same colors), the remaining left boots can be grouped into two categories:\n\n- Left_S: specific colors (but not enough right boots of that color)\n- Left_Q: question marks\n\nSimilarly for Right_S and Right_Q.\n\nNow, for the Left_S, they can only be paired with Right_Q. Because if they were paired with Right_S, that would have been handled in the first step. Similarly, Right_S can only be paired with Left_Q.\n\nAdditionally, Left_Q can be paired with Right_S, Right_Q, or other Left_Q (if paired with Right_Q). Wait, no. Each pair is a left and a right. So Left_Q can be paired with any right (specific or ?). Similarly for Right_Q.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\nWe can pair Left_S with Right_Q, and Right_S with Left_Q. Also, pair Left_Q and Right_Q.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter the initial pairing of same colors, we have:\n\ncount_left_S = number of left specific boots not yet paired.\n\ncount_right_S = number of right specific boots not yet paired.\n\ncount_left_Q = number of left ? not yet paired.\n\ncount_right_Q = number of right ? not yet paired.\n\nNow, the maximum possible pairs from this stage is:\n\nmin( (count_left_S + count_left_Q), (count_right_S + count_right_Q) )\n\nBut how to achieve that?\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, we can first pair Left_S with Right_Q, and Right_S with Left_Q. Then pair the remaining Left_Q and Right_Q.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of:\n\nThe number of Left_S is L_S, and the number of Right_Q is R_Q. We can pair as many as possible of L_S with R_Q. Similarly, pair R_S with L_Q. Then, the remaining Left_Q and Right_Q can be paired.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me formalize:\n\nLet's say:\n\nWe can pair min(L_S, R_Q) pairs between Left_S and Right_Q.\n\nThen, pair min(R_S, L_Q) pairs between Right_S and Left_Q.\n\nThen, the remaining Left_Q and Right_Q can be paired as min(remaining_LQ, remaining_RQ).\n\nBut what about the order? For example, if we pair some Left_S with Right_Q, and some Right_S with Left_Q, but perhaps there's a better way.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nLet me think through an example.\n\nSuppose:\n\nL_S = 3 (specific colors, say a, a, b)\n\nR_Q = 2 (two ?)\n\nSo pairing 2 of the L_S with R_Q. Then, the remaining L_S is 1 (say, b). Now, if R_S has 1 and L_Q has 2, then we can pair R_S with L_Q, and then pair the remaining L_Q and R_Q (but R_Q is already used? Or not?)\n\nWait, maybe I need to track how much of each group is left after each step.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is feasible.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Pair same colors (non-?).\n\n   For each color c (not ?), pair as many left c with right c as possible.\n\n   For example, for each c, the number of pairs is min(number of left c, number of right c). Then subtract that from both counts.\n\n   So, after this, the left and right have some remaining specific colors and question marks.\n\n2. Now, collect the remaining left and right boots:\n\n   left_S: list of specific colors (not paired yet)\n\n   left_Q: list of ? (not paired yet)\n\n   right_S: list of specific colors (not paired yet)\n\n   right_Q: list of ? (not paired yet)\n\n   Now, the problem is to pair these in the best way.\n\n3. Now, the idea is to pair as much as possible between left_S and right_Q, then between right_S and left_Q, then between left_Q and right_Q.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut for the actual pairing, we need to track which left and right boots are available.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to:\n\n- For the first step, collect all the left and right boots that are not yet paired.\n\nFor example, during step 1, we can track for each left boot whether it's been paired or not, and same for the right.\n\nBut for large n (up to 1.5e5), we need an efficient way.\n\nBut perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nLet me think of data structures.\n\nWe can create for the left boots a list of indices, and for the right boots a list of indices. Then, for each color, track which indices are available.\n\nBut maybe for the first step, we can process each color.\n\nLet me outline the steps again.\n\nFirst, process all same-color pairs:\n\nFor each color c (excluding ?):\n\n   count_left[c] = number of left boots with color c.\n\n   count_right[c] = number of right boots with color c.\n\n   pairs = min(count_left[c], count_right[c])\n\n   add these pairs to the result.\n\n   subtract pairs from count_left[c] and count_right[c].\n\nBut wait, but we need to track which specific left and right boots are paired. So for example, for each left boot with color c, we can pair it with a right boot with color c, but how to track which ones.\n\nBut for the purpose of the output, we need to know which indices are paired. So perhaps we need to process the left and right boots, and for each color, collect the indices, then pair them.\n\nSo for example, for color 'a', collect all left indices with 'a' and all right indices with 'a'. Then pair them in some way (like first left with first right, etc.)\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\nFor the first step:\n\n- For each color c (not ?), collect the list of left indices with that color (call it left_list[c]) and right indices with that color (right_list[c]).\n\nThen, for each c, the number of pairs is min(len(left_list[c]), len(right_list[c])).\n\nFor each pair, take the first k elements of left_list[c] and first k elements of right_list[c], and pair them. Then, those indices are marked as used.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used. So perhaps, for each left and right boot, we can have a boolean array indicating if they are already paired.\n\nSo steps:\n\nInitialize two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left_indices = [i for i in 0..n-1 if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n\n   collect right_indices = [i for i in 0..n-1 if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n\n   k = min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices))\n\n   for j in 0 to k-1:\n\n       pair left_indices[j] with right_indices[j]\n\n       mark left_used[left_indices[j]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_indices[j]] = True\n\nThis way, after this step, all same-color pairs are processed.\n\nThen, after this, we need to process the remaining left and right boots (those not yet used) which are either ? or have colors that couldn't be paired.\n\nNow, for the remaining boots, collect:\n\nleft_q: list of left indices with l[i] == '?', not used.\n\nleft_s: list of left indices with l[i] != '?', not used.\n\nSimilarly for right_q and right_s.\n\nNow, the problem is to pair these.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\nPair as many as possible between left_s and right_q.\n\nThen, pair as many as possible between right_s and left_q.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor the left_s and right_q:\n\nEach left_s can be paired with any right_q.\n\nSimilarly, each right_s can be paired with any left_q.\n\nSo, for the first part, take the left_s list and right_q list, and pair them. How many pairs can we make here? It's the minimum of len(left_s) and len(right_q). So, for example, if there are 5 left_s and 3 right_q, we pair 3 of them.\n\nSimilarly for the second part.\n\nThen, after that, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q)).\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nCollect the left_s and right_q lists.\n\nPair them:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_s), len(right_q))):\n\n   pair left_s[i] with right_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nSimilarly, collect the right_s and left_q lists.\n\nPair them:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(right_s), len(left_q))):\n\n   pair right_s[i] with left_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q (those not used yet), and pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nWait, after the first two pairings (left_s with right_q and right_s with left_q), the remaining left_q and right_q would be:\n\nremaining_left_q = original left_q - those paired in the first two steps.\n\nSimilarly for remaining_right_q.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used.\n\nAlternatively, during the pairing steps, we can iterate over the lists and pair them, and mark them as used.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\nOnce we have the left_s, left_q, right_s, right_q lists:\n\nFor the first pairing between left_s and right_q:\n\nTake the first m elements of left_s and first m elements of right_q, where m is min(len(left_s), len(right_q)).\n\nFor each i in 0..m-1:\n\n   pair left_s[i] with right_q[i]\n\n   mark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for the second pairing between right_s and left_q:\n\nTake the first p elements of right_s and first p elements of left_q, where p is min(len(right_s), len(left_q)).\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nCollect the left_q that haven't been used yet (those not paired in the previous steps), and same for right_q.\n\nThen pair them in any way, as long as each pair is one left and one right.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nWait, the left_q list was collected before any of the pairings. So during the first step (left_s with right_q), some of the right_q elements are used. Similarly, during the second step (right_s with left_q), some of the left_q elements are used.\n\nSo perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nCollect the left_s and left_q lists (all unpaired boots).\n\nThen, for the first step, pair left_s with right_q:\n\nLoop through the left_s and right_q lists, and pair as many as possible.\n\nThen, for the second step, pair right_s with left_q (but note that some of the left_q may have been used in the first step).\n\nWait, but the left_q list is the list of unpaired left boots with ?. So during the first step, when pairing left_s with right_q, the left_s are used, and the right_q are used. The left_q remains untouched.\n\nSimilarly, during the second step, when pairing right_s with left_q, the right_s are used, and the left_q are used.\n\nSo after that, the remaining left_q and right_q are those that were not used in any of the previous steps.\n\nSo, after that, collect the remaining left_q and right_q, and pair them.\n\nBut how to collect them? Well, during the first pairing, we can track which elements are used, so when collecting the left_q and right_q lists, we can have them as lists of indices that are not yet used.\n\nSo, perhaps the code would look like this:\n\nOnce we have the left_used and right_used arrays, after the first step (pairing same colors), collect:\n\nleft_s = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_s = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, for the first pairing between left_s and right_q:\n\nm = min(len(left_s), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(m):\n    pair left_s[i] with right_q[i]\n    mark left_used[left_s[i]] = True\n    mark right_used[right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, for the second pairing between right_s and left_q:\n\np = min(len(right_s), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(p):\n    pair right_s[i] with left_q[i]\n    mark right_used[right_s[i]] = True\n    mark left_used[left_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not left_used[i]]\nremaining_right_q = [i for i in right_q if not right_used[i]]\n\nThen, pair them as much as possible. For example, take the first k elements of remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q, where k is min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q)), and pair them.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q? Because after the first two pairings, some elements in left_q and right_q may have been used.\n\nWait, the initial left_q and right_q lists are the lists of indices that were not used before this step. But during the first pairing (left_s and right_q), some elements of right_q are used. Similarly, during the second pairing (right_s and left_q), some elements of left_q are used.\n\nSo the remaining_left_q is the left_q list minus those elements that were used in the second pairing.\n\nBut how to track that? Well, during the first pairing, we have modified the right_used array. So, when collecting the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q, perhaps we can generate new lists based on the current state of left_used and right_used.\n\nAlternatively, during the first two steps, when we pair elements, we can track which elements are used.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nOnce the left_s, left_q, right_s, right_q are collected, then:\n\n# Pair left_s with right_q\nfor i in range(min(len(left_s), len(right_q))):\n    left_idx = left_s[i]\n    right_idx = right_q[i]\n    # add to the result\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    left_used[left_idx] = True\n    right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n# Pair right_s with left_q\nfor i in range(min(len(right_s), len(left_q))):\n    right_idx = right_s[i]\n    left_idx = left_q[i]\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    left_used[left_idx] = True\n    right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n# Now, collect remaining left_q and right_q\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not left_used[i]]\nremaining_right_q = [i for i in right_q if not right_used[i]]\n\n# Pair them\nk = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q))\nfor i in range(k):\n    left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n    right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    left_used[left_idx] = True\n    right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nWait, but in the code above, the left_q and right_q are the original lists (before any pairing in this step). So, when we collect the remaining_left_q, it's all elements of left_q that are not used (i.e., not marked in the previous pairings).\n\nBut the problem is that during the first pairing (left_s and right_q), some elements of right_q were marked as used. Similarly, during the second pairing (right_s and left_q), some elements of left_q were marked as used.\n\nBut in the code above, the remaining_left_q is generated by checking the left_used array. So the left_q is the original list of left ?s, and the code checks which of them are still not used.\n\nBut how to get the left_q and right_q lists? Because they are generated once, before any of the pairings in this step.\n\nYes. For example, the left_q is the list of all left boots that are not used and are '?'. So, during the first pairing (left_s and right_q), the right_q elements are being used. But the left_q elements are not touched. Then, during the second pairing (right_s and left_q), some of the left_q elements are used.\n\nSo, when generating remaining_left_q, it's the list of all left_q elements that are not used now.\n\nBut how to generate this list? Well, in code, after the first two pairings, we can loop through the left_q list and check if left_used[i] is False.\n\nBut this could be O(n) time. However, considering that the total number of operations is O(n), this is acceptable.\n\nBut for large n, this may be O(n) time, but acceptable.\n\nSo this approach seems feasible.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to collect the left_s, left_q, etc. lists.\n\nNow, for the first step, after processing same colors, the left_used and right_used arrays are filled with True for the pairs that have been made.\n\nThen, collect left_s, left_q, right_s, right_q as follows:\n\nleft_s = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_s = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nBut for n up to 1.5e5, this is O(n) time and acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, list comprehensions are efficient.\n\nOnce these lists are built, proceed with the steps.\n\nNow, the problem is to collect all the pairs, and output them.\n\nNow, the code structure would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as [False] * n.\n\nProcess the same color pairs.\n\nThen process the remaining as described.\n\nNow, for the first step of processing same color pairs:\n\nWe can loop through all possible colors (a-z), and for each color, collect the left and right indices, then pair them.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can use dictionaries to track the indices for each color.\n\nBut for code simplicity, perhaps for each color in 'a' to 'z', we can collect the left and right indices.\n\nBut for Python, perhaps:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nBut perhaps for each color in the strings, we can process them.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n   collect left indices with color c and not used.\n\n   collect right indices with color c and not used.\n\n   pair as per min(len(left), len(right)).\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nBut how to collect the left and right indices for each color.\n\nAlternatively, for each color, we can precompute the lists, but during the first step, we can process them.\n\nBut perhaps the following code:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n    right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for j in range(k):\n        left_idx = left_list[j]\n        right_idx = right_list[j]\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this would be O(26n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1.5e5.\n\nBut for each color, we are scanning the entire array. Which is O(26n) = O(n) time.\n\nBut perhaps for Python, this is acceptable.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 is 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to pre-process for each color, the list of indices.\n\nBut for the first step, perhaps the code is manageable.\n\nBut this approach would work.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as False arrays.\n\nInitialize pairs as empty list.\n\nFor each color c in a-z:\n\n   collect left_list and right_list as indices with color c and not used.\n\n   pair them as much as possible.\n\nThen, collect left_s, left_q, right_s, right_q.\n\nPair left_s with right_q.\n\nPair right_s with left_q.\n\nPair remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut how to collect left_s, left_q, etc.?\n\nOnce the first step is done, collect:\n\nleft_s = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_s = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, process the left_s and right_q.\n\nBut for the code, after that, the code proceeds as follows.\n\nNow, let's think about the example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', ...]\n\nBut perhaps the first sample input is:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nBut the output is 5 pairs.\n\nBut regardless, the code should process it correctly.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where all are ?.\n\nThen, all can be paired, so n pairs.\n\nAnother case where some colors are not compatible.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut in Python, for the first step, looping through each color in 'a' to 'z' and collecting the left and right lists.\n\nBut for the first step, the code can be written as:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_list = []\n    right_list = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_list.append(i)\n        if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c:\n            right_list.append(i)\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for j in range(k):\n        left_idx = left_list[j]\n        right_idx = right_list[j]\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this would be O(26n) time. However, for n=1.5e5, this would be 3.9e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps this is too slow. Because for each color, we are looping through all n elements. So 26 * 1.5e5 = 3.9e6 steps. Which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to pre-process for each color, the list of indices.\n\nBut for the first step, perhaps we can build a dictionary for each color, mapping to the list of indices.\n\nBut for the first step, perhaps the code can be optimized as follows:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_dict = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    left_color_dict[l[i]].append(i)\n    right_color_dict[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_dict and right_color_dict, process the pairs.\n\nBut no, because the left_used and right_used arrays are dynamic. So during the first step, when we process the color c, we have to collect the indices that are not yet used.\n\nBut this approach would not work, since the left_used and right_used arrays are changing as we process the pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is the way to go.\n\nBut perhaps for each color, we can collect the list of indices that are not used and have that color.\n\nBut in code, for each color c in 'a' to 'z', we can do:\n\nleft_list = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c]\nright_list = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c]\n\nBut for each color, this is O(n) time. Which is O(26n) overall.\n\nBut in Python, list comprehensions are fast, so perhaps this is manageable.\n\nOnce the first step is done, then collect the left_s, left_q, etc.\n\nNow, the code for the rest steps.\n\nNow, after that, the code proceeds to pair left_s with right_q, etc.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nOnce the left_s, left_q, right_s, right_q are collected, then:\n\nm = min(len(left_s), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(m):\n    left_idx = left_s[i]\n    right_idx = right_q[i]\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    left_used[left_idx] = True\n    right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for the next step.\n\nBut what about the order of pairing? For example, if there are multiple options, but the code chooses to pair left_s with right_q first. But since the problem allows any valid pairing, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code for the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not left_used[i]]\nremaining_right_q = [i for i in right_q if not right_used[i]]\n\nk = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q))\nfor i in range(k):\n    left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n    right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    left_used[left_idx] = True\n    right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, the code for the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q is generated by checking the left_used and right_used arrays. However, during the pairing of left_s with right_q and right_s with left_q, some elements in left_q and right_q are marked as used. Thus, the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q would be the ones not used.\n\nBut how to collect them? For example, the left_q is the list of indices that were not used before this step. But during the pairing of left_s with right_q, some of the right_q elements are used, but the left_q elements are not touched. Then, during the pairing of right_s with left_q, some of the left_q elements are used. So, after that, the remaining_left_q is the list of left_q elements that are not used.\n\nBut in code, the left_q is a list of indices that are not used before this step. So, for example, in the code:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nSo, during the pairing of left_s with right_q, the left_used is not modified for the left_q elements. Only the right_used for right_q elements is modified. Then, during the pairing of right_s with left_q, the left_used for some left_q elements is modified. Thus, the remaining_left_q is generated by checking which elements of the left_q list are not used.\n\nBut in code, the code for remaining_left_q is [i for i in left_q if not left_used[i]], which is correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing on the sample input.\n\nBut perhaps the code works. Now, considering the problem of the output format.\n\nNow, the code must output the number of pairs followed by the pairs. So, the code collects all pairs in the 'pairs' list, then prints len(pairs), followed by each pair.\n\nNow, the code needs to read input. However, the input is given as a list of test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of test cases. For example, the first line shows:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut the actual input is given via standard input, which for the problem is multiple test cases? Or is it one test case per input?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains l.\n\nThe third line contains r.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided a list of test cases. However, the actual problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line: l.\n\nThird line: r.\n\nBut the sample input shows four different test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output the answer. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the code should read input from stdin and output the answer. So the code must read one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the code must read input from stdin, which for programming competition problems is usually a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut the output is:\n\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1",
