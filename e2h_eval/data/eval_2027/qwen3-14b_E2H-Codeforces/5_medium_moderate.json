Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair. \n\nSo, first, I need to figure out how to pair them optimally. Let's think about the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') can only pair with another 'a' or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'. \n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. Maybe we can first pair the specific colors with each other, then use the question marks to fill in the remaining gaps. But how?\n\nLet's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots that have the same specific color. For example, if there's a left boot with 'a' and a right boot with 'a', pair them. But since there might be multiple instances, we need to count how many of each color are present on both sides.\n\nBut wait, the order matters here. Because for each color, the number of pairs we can make is the minimum of the count of that color on the left and on the right. However, once we pair those, the question marks can be used for the leftovers.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. For example, some colors may have more on the left than on the right, and vice versa. So, for each color c (not '?'), we can pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, the remaining left and right boots (including the ones with '?') can be matched using the question marks.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks? Because they can act as wildcards. So, after pairing all the specific colors, we can use the question marks to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can first pair the specific colors, and then pair the question marks. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each '?' can be used to pair with any other boot. So perhaps we can first process the non-question marks, then use the question marks to cover the remaining ones.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- For each color c (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots with c (left_count[c]) and right boots with c (right_count[c]). For each such color, the number of pairs we can form is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But when we do that, we need to subtract those from the counts. However, this might not be optimal because maybe some of the question marks could be used to pair with other colors, leading to more total pairs.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Because for example, if there's a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with color 'b', they can't be paired. But if there's a left 'a' and a right '?', they can be paired. So, perhaps the optimal way is to first pair the same colors, then use the question marks to pair with the remaining specific colors.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of two separate groups: specific colors and question marks. \n\nFirst, for each color c (excluding '?'), pair left and right boots of color c. Once that's done, we have left some left and right boots with specific colors, and some question marks. Then, the question marks can be used to pair with the remaining specific colors (on either side) and also with other question marks.\n\nBut how to handle that. Let me think of the following:\n\nAfter pairing same-colored specific boots, we have:\n\nLeft_remaining: left boots that are not paired (could be specific or ?)\nRight_remaining: right boots that are not paired (could be specific or ?)\n\nNow, for the remaining left and right boots, we can try to pair them using the question marks. For example, a left '?' can pair with a right 'a' (specific), and vice versa. Also, a left '?' can pair with a right '?'. \n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs here. \n\nAn idea is to collect all the specific colors on the left and right, and pair them with question marks. For example, if there are left boots with specific color 'a' that haven't been paired yet, we can pair them with right '?'s. Similarly for right boots with specific colors and left '?'s. Then, the remaining '?'s can be paired among themselves.\n\nBut how to do this optimally. Let's think:\n\nLet me have:\n\nleft_specific: the count of each specific color (excluding ?) in left boots that haven't been paired yet.\nright_specific: same for right boots.\n\nleft_q: number of left ? boots not paired yet.\nright_q: number of right ? boots not paired yet.\n\nThen, the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from these is:\n\nFor each specific color on left, we can pair them with right ?. Similarly for specific color on right with left ?. Then, the remaining ?s can be paired between left and right.\n\nBut how to compute that. Let's think:\n\nSuppose we have L = sum of left_specific (i.e., the number of left boots with specific colors not paired yet), and R = sum of right_specific (same for right). \n\nBut the number of pairs that can be formed between left_specific and right_q is min( sum of left_specific, right_q ). Similarly, the pairs between right_specific and left_q is min( sum of right_specific, left_q ). But wait, no. Because each left_specific can be paired with a right_q, and each right_specific can be paired with a left_q. However, the total would be the sum of the min of each.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can take the sum of left_specific and pair them with the right_q. Similarly, the sum of right_specific and pair them with left_q. But since each of these is a separate pairing, perhaps the total pairs here is min( sum_left_specific, right_q ) + min( sum_right_specific, left_q ), but that's not correct. Because once you pair some left_specific with right_q, the left_specific is used up, so the sum of left_specific is reduced, which affects the next step. \n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to pair as much as possible between left specific and right q, and between right specific and left q. Let me think:\n\nLet me have:\n\nsum_left_specific = total number of left boots with specific colors (not paired yet)\nsum_right_specific = same for right.\n\nWe can pair left specific with right q, and right specific with left q. But how?\n\nLet me take the number of available right_q as rq and left_q as lq.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs is:\n\npairs1 = min( sum_left_specific, rq )\npairs2 = min( sum_right_specific, lq )\n\nBut after that, the remaining lq and rq would be:\n\nrq_remaining = rq - pairs1\nlq_remaining = lq - pairs2\n\nBut then, the remaining lq_remaining and rq_remaining can be paired as min(lq_remaining, rq_remaining).\n\nSo the total pairs from this part would be pairs1 + pairs2 + min(rq_remaining, lq_remaining).\n\nBut wait, how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose sum_left_specific is 3, sum_right_specific is 2. Left_q is 2, right_q is 3.\n\nThen pairs1 is min(3, 3) = 3. So all left specific are paired with right q. Then sum_right_specific is 2, and lq is 2. So pairs2 is min(2, 2) = 2. Now, lq_remaining is 0, and rq_remaining is 3 - 3 = 0. So the remaining is zero. Total pairs here is 3+2=5.\n\nBut what if sum_left_specific is 5, sum_right_specific is 5, left_q is 2, right_q is 2. Then pairs1 is min(5, 2) = 2. Then pairs2 is min(5, 2) = 2. Then remaining lq_remaining is 0, rq_remaining is 0. So total pairs is 4. But maybe there's a better way. Like, using some of the left q and right q to pair with each other. But in this case, after pairing pairs1 and pairs2, the sum_left_specific is 5-2=3, sum_right_specific is 5-2=3. But they are not being used anymore. Wait, no. Because the sum_left_specific is the total of left boots with specific colors not paired. After pairing pairs1, sum_left_specific is 5-2=3. But those are still specific colors, but they can't be paired with anything else except the right q's. But in this case, the right q's are already used up. So those 3 left specific and 3 right specific can't be paired. So the total pairs would be 2 + 2 = 4. However, if instead, we could pair some of the left specific with right specific, but that's already been considered in the initial step. So perhaps this approach is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe overall plan is:\n\n1. Pair same-colored specific boots (excluding ?) between left and right. For each color c (not ?), pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, if left has 3 'a's and right has 2 'a's, we pair 2 pairs. Then, subtract those counts from the respective left and right.\n\n2. Now, collect all the remaining left boots (specific and ?) and right boots (specific and ?).\n\n   For the left, the remaining specific colors are those that couldn't be paired with the same color on the right. The left ?s are all unpaired. Same for the right.\n\n3. Now, we can use the ?s to pair with the remaining specific colors.\n\n   Let's calculate:\n\n   sum_left_specific = sum of left's specific colors (non ?) that are not paired yet.\n\n   sum_right_specific = same for right.\n\n   left_q = number of left ?s not paired yet.\n\n   right_q = number of right ?s not paired yet.\n\n   Then, the number of pairs that can be formed by pairing left specific with right q, and right specific with left q, and then pairing the remaining ?s.\n\n   So, the steps are:\n\n   a. Take as many as possible left specific with right q. Let's say this is min(sum_left_specific, right_q). Let's call this a.\n\n   b. Then, take as many as possible right specific with left q. Let's say this is min(sum_right_specific, left_q). Call this b.\n\n   c. Then, the remaining left_q and right_q would be left_q - b and right_q - a. Then, the number of pairs that can be formed from these is min(remaining_left_q, remaining_right_q).\n\n   So the total pairs from this phase is a + b + min(remaining_left_q, remaining_right_q).\n\n   However, this approach may not be optimal. For example, perhaps it's better to pair some left specific with left q and right specific with right q, but that's not possible. Wait, no. The left specific can't be paired with left q, because they are both left boots. The pairing is between left and right. So, the only options are:\n\n   Pair left specific with right q, or right specific with left q, or pair left q with right q.\n\n   So, the way I described above is correct.\n\n   However, perhaps the order of a and b matters. For example, if we pair left specific with right q first, then right specific with left q, or vice versa. Which gives better results?\n\n   Let me take an example. Suppose sum_left_specific is 2, sum_right_specific is 2. left_q is 1, right_q is 1.\n\n   If I pair a = min(2, 1) = 1. Then sum_left_specific becomes 1. Then, pair b = min(2, 1) = 1. Now, left_q is 0, right_q is 0. Then, the remaining is 0. So total is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n   Alternatively, if I pair right specific with left q first. Let's say sum_right_specific is 2, left_q is 1. So b = min(2, 1) = 1. Then, sum_right_specific is 1. Then a = min(2, 1) = 1. So again, total is 2.\n\n   So, same result. So the order may not matter. Therefore, the approach is correct.\n\n   So, the total pairs from this phase is a + b + c, where c is min( (left_q - b), (right_q - a) )\n\n   But how to compute this? Well, perhaps the best way is to compute:\n\n   a = min( sum_left_specific, right_q )\n\n   sum_left_specific -= a\n\n   right_q -= a\n\n   b = min( sum_right_specific, left_q )\n\n   sum_right_specific -= b\n\n   left_q -= b\n\n   c = min( left_q, right_q )\n\n   total_pairs = a + b + c\n\n   So, this seems manageable.\n\nBut how to track which boots are paired? Because we need to output the actual pairs.\n\nSo, the problem is not only to compute the maximum number of pairs but also to track which left and right boots are paired with which.\n\nThis complicates things. Because now, we need to not just track counts, but also track individual positions.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to first collect for each color, the list of indices (positions) of left and right boots. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right, and mark them as used.\n\nBut for the first step (pairing same-colored specific boots), we can do the following:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z' (excluding '?'), we can collect all left boots with color c, and all right boots with color c. Then, pair them as much as possible. For example, if there are 3 left boots and 2 right boots, pair the first 2 left with the 2 right.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left and right boots (for each color) are left unpaired.\n\nThen, for the second step, we need to collect all the left boots that are not yet paired (either because they were not paired in the first step, or because they were ?) and same for right.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nSo, perhaps we need to track for each left boot whether it's used or not, and same for right.\n\nBut with n up to 150000, we need an efficient way.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nInitialize two arrays: left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for each color c (not ?), collect the list of left indices with color c and not used, and same for right. Then, pair them as much as possible, and mark them as used.\n\nOnce that is done, for the remaining left and right boots (those not used), we need to process the ?s.\n\nBut how to process them.\n\nLet me think. For the remaining left boots, some are specific colors (like 'a') and some are ?. Similarly for right.\n\nSo, for the second part, we need to pair:\n\nLeft boots (specific or ?) with right boots (specific or ?), with compatibility.\n\nBut how to do that optimally, and track the pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nCollect all the left boots that are not used and have specific colors (non ?) into a list. Similarly, collect all the right boots not used and have specific colors into a list. Also collect the left ?s and right ?s.\n\nThen, for the specific left boots, we can pair them with right ?s. Similarly, specific right boots can be paired with left ?s. And then, the remaining ?s can be paired with each other.\n\nBut again, the problem is to track which ones are paired.\n\nSo, perhaps for the second phase:\n\nWe can collect:\n\nleft_specific = list of left boots (indices) not used and color is not ?\n\nright_specific = list of right boots (indices) not used and color is not ?\n\nleft_q = list of left boots (indices) not used and color is ?\n\nright_q = list of right boots (indices) not used and color is ?\n\nThen, the steps would be:\n\nPair as many as possible from left_specific with right_q. For each left in left_specific, pair with a right_q. So, take the first k elements from left_specific and pair with first k elements from right_q, where k is min(len(left_specific), len(right_q)).\n\nSimilarly, pair as many as possible from right_specific with left_q. Take the first m elements from right_specific and pair with first m elements from left_q, where m is min(len(right_specific), len(left_q)).\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q. Take the first t elements from left_q and pair with first t elements from right_q, where t is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nSo, during the pairing, we can process these lists.\n\nBut how to collect the lists. Let's think.\n\nOnce the first phase is done, for each left boot, if not used, check its color. Similarly for right.\n\nSo, for the first phase:\n\nWe can process each color c in a-z (excluding ?). For each c:\n\nleft_list = list of indices i where l[i] == c and not used.\n\nright_list = list of indices i where r[i] == c and not used.\n\nThe number of pairs possible is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)).\n\nWe can pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) elements of left_list with the first min(...) elements of right_list.\n\nThen, mark those left and right indices as used.\n\nOnce this is done, we proceed to collect the left_specific, right_specific, left_q, right_q lists.\n\nBut how to collect them? Well, for each left index not used, check if the color is ?, add to left_q or left_specific accordingly. Same for right.\n\nOnce we have these four lists, proceed with the second phase.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate the actual pairs.\n\nBut how to handle the pairing steps. Let's think:\n\nFor example, in the first step of the second phase: pair left_specific with right_q.\n\nTake the first k elements of left_specific and pair each with the first k elements of right_q.\n\nSimilarly for the other steps.\n\nNow, the code structure would be:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used arrays as False.\n\nInitialize a list of pairs.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect right indices where r[i] == c and not used.\n\n   pairs_possible = min(len(left_list), len(right_list)).\n\n   for i in 0 to pairs_possible-1:\n\n       add (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) to the pairs list.\n\n       mark left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nOnce this is done, collect the left_specific, right_specific, left_q, right_q lists.\n\nThen:\n\nleft_specific = [i for i in 0..n-1 if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_specific = [i for i in 0..n-1 if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\nleft_q = [i for i in 0..n-1 if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q = [i for i in 0..n-1 if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, process:\n\nk = min(len(left_specific), len(right_q))\nfor i in 0 to k-1:\n   add (left_specific[i]+1, right_q[i]+1)\n   mark left_used[left_specific[i]] = True\n   mark right_used[right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, m = min(len(right_specific), len(left_q))\nfor i in 0 to m-1:\n   add (left_q[i]+1, right_specific[i]+1)\n   mark left_used[left_q[i]] = True\n   mark right_used[right_specific[i]] = True\n\nThen, t = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in 0 to t-1:\n   add (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1)\n   mark left_used[left_q[i]] = True\n   mark right_used[right_q[i]] = True\n\nWait, but after the first two steps, the left_q and right_q may have some elements left. For example, after pairing left_specific with right_q, the remaining right_q is len(right_q) - k. Similarly, after pairing right_specific with left_q, the remaining left_q is len(left_q) - m.\n\nThen, the third step is to pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut in the code above, after processing the first two steps, the left_q and right_q lists may have some elements. However, in the code above, the left_q and right_q lists are the original ones. So, after pairing in the first two steps, the code would need to process the remaining elements.\n\nBut the code above is not correct, because after the first step (pairing left_specific with right_q), the right_q list is modified. But in the code as written, the code uses the original lists. So, perhaps we need to process the lists in a way that allows us to take the first k elements, then the remaining elements are the rest.\n\nSo, perhaps in code, for the left_specific and right_q, we can take the first k elements, then the remaining are the rest. Similarly for the other steps.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing, we can process the lists in order, and for each step, take the first elements and pair them, and then the remaining elements are kept for further steps.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nAfter collecting left_specific, right_specific, left_q, right_q:\n\nWe can have:\n\ncurrent_left_specific = left_specific.copy()\n\ncurrent_right_q = right_q.copy()\n\nk = min(len(current_left_specific), len(current_right_q))\n\nfor i in 0 to k-1:\n\n   pair current_left_specific[i] with current_right_q[i]\n\nThen, the remaining current_left_specific is current_left_specific[k:], but since we need to mark them as used, perhaps we should not modify the original lists, but track which ones are used.\n\nWait, but in this approach, the left_specific and right_q lists are the original ones. But once we pair some elements, we need to mark them as used. So, perhaps in code, during the first step of pairing left_specific with right_q, we can iterate over the left_specific and right_q lists, and for each pair, mark them as used.\n\nBut the problem is that once we pair them, they are no longer available for the next steps.\n\nSo, for example, in the code:\n\nAfter the first phase, the left_used and right_used arrays are marked for the pairs made in the first phase.\n\nThen, for the second phase:\n\nWe collect left_specific as the list of left indices not used and with color not ?.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThen, for the first step of the second phase:\n\nWe take the first k elements from left_specific and the first k elements from right_q, pair them, and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to do that. So, for each i in 0 to k-1:\n\npair (left_specific[i], right_q[i])\n\nmark left_used[left_specific[i]] = True\n\nmark right_used[right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, for the next steps, the left_specific and right_q lists are modified. But since we have already marked them as used, the next steps will not use them again.\n\nBut in code, we can process the lists as follows:\n\ncurrent_left_specific = [i for i in left_specific]\n\ncurrent_right_q = [i for i in right_q]\n\nk = min(len(current_left_specific), len(current_right_q))\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n   add pair (current_left_specific[i]+1, current_right_q[i]+1)\n\n   mark left_used[current_left_specific[i]] = True\n\n   mark right_used[current_right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, for the next step, the remaining current_left_specific is current_left_specific[k:], but since those are not marked as used, but they are in the original left_specific list, which is not modified. Wait, no. Because in the code above, the current_left_specific is a copy of left_specific. But when we process the first k elements, we mark them as used. Then, for the next steps, the left_specific list is not modified. However, when we collect the left_specific list, it includes all the indices not used. So, after marking some of them as used, when we process the next steps, they are not considered again.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining elements for the next steps. Because, for example, in the next step, when we process right_specific and left_q, the left_q list may include some elements that were used in the previous step.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first step, we take elements from left_specific and right_q. The left_specific elements are marked as used. So, when we collect the left_q list, it's the list of left boots not used and with color ?. So, those elements are not used. So, the left_q list is not modified during the first step of the second phase.\n\nWait, no. The first step of the second phase is pairing left_specific (which are not ?) with right_q (which are ?). So, during that step, the left_specific elements are marked as used. So, they are no longer available for future steps. However, the right_q elements are marked as used, so they are also no longer available.\n\nSo, during the next steps, when we process the right_specific and left_q, the left_q list contains only the left boots not used. So, the elements that were paired in the first step of the second phase are already marked as used, and thus not in the left_q list.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nAfter collecting left_specific, right_specific, left_q, right_q:\n\nWe can process the first step by pairing left_specific and right_q. For this, we can loop through the elements of left_specific and right_q, and pair as many as possible. Then, mark those as used.\n\nSimilarly for the next steps.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nIn Python, for example, for the first step, we can take the first min(len(left_specific), len(right_q)) elements. For example:\n\nk = min(len(left_specific), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n    pair left_specific[i] and right_q[i]\n\n    mark left_used[left_specific[i]] = True\n\n    mark right_used[right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, for the next step, the right_specific and left_q lists are processed similarly.\n\nBut then, the left_specific and right_q lists are not modified. So, in the next steps, we need to process the remaining elements. However, since the elements that were used are marked as used, they will not be included in the subsequent steps. Wait, no. Because the left_specific list was generated before the first step of the second phase. So, after pairing some elements, the remaining elements in left_specific are not used yet. However, during the next steps, when we collect the right_specific and left_q, they are generated again based on the current used status. Wait, no. Because the left_specific list was generated once, before the second phase steps. So, in that list, there are elements that may have been used in the first step of the second phase. But in reality, those elements are marked as used, so when generating the left_specific list, they are not included. Wait, no. Because the left_specific list was generated once, before the second phase steps. So, during that generation, the left_used array was already updated with the first phase pairs, but not the second phase steps. So, the left_specific list includes all left boots that are not used (from first phase) and have color not ?. Then, during the second phase steps, when we pair some of them, we mark them as used. But the left_specific list is not modified. So, in the next steps, when we process the right_specific and left_q, the left_specific list may contain elements that are already used. But that's not correct. Because when we process the first step of the second phase, we pair some of the elements from left_specific and right_q, and mark them as used. However, the left_specific list is not modified. So, in the next steps, when processing other steps, the code may attempt to process those elements again. That's a problem.\n\nAh, right! This is a critical error. Because the left_specific list is generated once, before the second phase steps. So, when we start processing the second phase steps, the left_specific list contains elements that are not used (from first phase). However, during the processing of the first step of the second phase, some of those elements are marked as used. But the left_specific list is not modified. Therefore, in the next steps, when we process other parts, like pairing right_specific with left_q, the left_specific list may still contain elements that are now used. But that's not a problem because during the next steps, the code is not using the left_specific list again. Wait, no. The next steps are pairing right_specific with left_q. The left_q list is generated again, but the left_specific list is not used again. So, the problem is only in the first step of the second phase.\n\nWait, no. The first step of the second phase is pairing left_specific and right_q. The left_specific list is generated once, and during that step, some elements are marked as used. However, the left_specific list remains as it was. So, if during the next steps, we need to process other parts, like the right_specific and left_q, but the left_q list is generated again, based on the current used status. So, the left_q list will not include any elements that are already marked as used. So, the problem is only in the first step of the second phase: when we process the left_specific list, which may contain elements that are now used. But during the processing, we are pairing them and marking them as used. However, the left_specific list is not modified. But since during the processing, we are using the original left_specific list, and marking the elements as used, that's okay. Because even though the list is not modified, the elements are marked as used, so they are not considered again in any other steps.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? For example, suppose in the first step of the second phase, we pair the first k elements of left_specific. Then, those elements are marked as used. But the left_specific list is still the same. However, in the next steps, when we process other parts (like pairing right_specific with left_q), those elements are not part of left_q. So, no problem.\n\nTherefore, the approach is correct. Because even though the left_specific list is not modified, the elements are marked as used, and thus not included in any further steps.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the first phase is done, collect the left_specific, right_specific, left_q, right_q lists as:\n\nleft_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, process the first step:\n\nk = min(len(left_specific), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(k):\n    a = left_specific[i]\n    b = right_q[i]\n    pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n    left_used[a] = True\n    right_used[b] = True\n\nThen, process the second step:\n\nm = min(len(right_specific), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(m):\n    a = left_q[i]\n    b = right_specific[i]\n    pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n    left_used[a] = True\n    right_used[b] = True\n\nThen, process the third step:\n\nt = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(t):\n    a = left_q[i]\n    b = right_q[i]\n    pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n    left_used[a] = True\n    right_used[b] = True\n\nWait, but after the first step, the left_q and right_q lists are not modified. So, in the second step, when we process left_q, which is the original list, some elements may have been used in the first step. But no, because in the first step, the elements used are from left_specific and right_q. The left_q list is the list of left boots not used (from first phase) and with color ?. So, during the first step, the left_specific elements are marked as used, but the left_q elements are not affected. So, the left_q list is correct. Similarly, during the second step, the right_specific elements are marked as used, but the left_q list is not modified. So, in the third step, the left_q and right_q lists are the original ones, but after the first and second steps, some of their elements may have been marked as used. However, the code in the third step is taking the first t elements of left_q and right_q. But those elements may have been used in previous steps. Wait, no. Because in the first step, the elements that were used are from left_specific and right_q. The left_q list contains elements that are not used (from first phase) and are ?. So, during the first step, the code is pairing left_specific (non ?) with right_q (?). So, the elements in left_q are not modified. Similarly, the elements in right_q are modified (some are marked as used). However, in the second step, the code is pairing right_specific (non ?) with left_q (?). So, the left_q elements are marked as used. However, the left_q list is the original list. So, during the third step, when we take the first t elements of left_q and right_q, some of them may have been marked as used in previous steps. Which would cause errors, because they are already used.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because the left_q and right_q lists are generated once, before the second phase steps. Then, during the first and second steps, some of their elements are marked as used. However, in the third step, when we process the left_q and right_q lists, we may be trying to pair elements that have already been used.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where in the first step, some elements of right_q are marked as used. Then, in the third step, when we process right_q, which includes those elements, but they are already used. So, the code would attempt to pair them again, which is invalid.\n\nThis is a critical error. So, how to avoid that?\n\nThe solution is to process the lists in a way that, after pairing, the elements are not considered again. One way to do this is to keep track of the current index in each list.\n\nFor example, for the first step, we can have pointers into the left_specific and right_q lists. After pairing k elements, the next steps can start from k onwards. But how to manage that.\n\nAlternatively, after each step, we can create new lists that exclude the already used elements. However, that would be time-consuming for large n.\n\nAlternatively, during the steps, we can track how many elements have been processed in each list, and not reuse them.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nAfter collecting the left_specific, right_specific, left_q, right_q lists:\n\nInitialize pointers for each list:\n\nleft_spec_ptr = 0\n\nright_q_ptr = 0\n\nright_spec_ptr = 0\n\nleft_q_ptr = 0\n\nThen, for the first step:\n\nWhile left_spec_ptr < len(left_specific) and right_q_ptr < len(right_q):\n\n   pair left_specific[left_spec_ptr] with right_q[right_q_ptr]\n\n   increment both pointers.\n\nSimilarly for the other steps.\n\nBut how to track which elements are used. Because during the first step, the left_specific and right_q lists are processed in order, and once paired, they are marked as used. Then, in the next steps, the left_q and right_q lists can be processed similarly.\n\nBut how to manage the pointers for the left_q and right_q lists during the third step.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the steps, we can process the lists in order, and for each element, check if it's already used. But this would be O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of generating the lists once, during each step, we can iterate through the elements, and for each element, check if it is not used yet. For example, during the first step, for pairing left_specific with right_q, we can iterate through the left_specific list, and for each element, if it's not used, and there is a right_q element not used, pair them.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the right_q elements.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to process the lists in order, and for each step, process the first available elements.\n\nBut given that the code must be efficient, perhaps we can use the following approach:\n\nFor the first step (pairing left_specific with right_q):\n\nWe can iterate through the left_specific list. For each element in left_specific, if it's not used, and there is a corresponding element in right_q that is not used, pair them.\n\nBut how to track which elements in right_q are available.\n\nBut since the right_q list is generated once, and during the first step, we can process the elements in order, and pair them as we go.\n\nSo, for example, during the first step:\n\nfor i in range(len(left_specific)):\n\n    if left_used[left_specific[i]] is True:\n\n        continue\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?').

We then use indefinite colors to pair with remaining specific colors and finally pair remaining indefinite colors with each other.
