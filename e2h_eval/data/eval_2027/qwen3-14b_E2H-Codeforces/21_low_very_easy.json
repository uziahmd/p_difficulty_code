The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, yes. Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. But each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once. So, for example, if there are 3 even chests and 5 odd keys, then we can pair 3 even chests with 3 odd keys. Similarly, if there are 2 odd chests and 4 even keys, we can pair 2 of them. So the total is the sum of those two minima.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's see their parities:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests=2 (9,11).\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys is 1 (7), even_keys is 3 (others). \n\nSo min(3,1) is 1 (even chests paired with odd keys). Then min(2,3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: \nChests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0.\nKeys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0. So min(5,1) is 1. And min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. odd_chests is 0, even_keys is 4. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Which matches.\n\nSo this approach works. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the list of chests, count how many are even (even_chest_count) and how many are odd (odd_chest_count).\n- For the list of keys, count how many are even (even_key_count) and how many are odd (odd_key_count).\n- The answer is min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) + min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count).\n\nThis is O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for n and m up to 1e5.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of a_i, then list of b_j.\n\nThen count even and odd in a, then even and odd in b.\n\nThen compute the sum as described.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers for a.\n\nThen read next line as list of integers for b.\n\ncount_even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\ncount_odd_chest = n - count_even_chest\n\nSimilarly for keys:\n\ncount_even_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\ncount_odd_key = m - count_even_key\n\nresult = min(count_even",
