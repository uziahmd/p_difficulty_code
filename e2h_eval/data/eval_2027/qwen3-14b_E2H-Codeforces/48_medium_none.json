He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, which could be Roman numerals. So first, I need to parse the input correctly. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nFirst, the input gives me a and b. But b can be 'R' which means Roman numerals. Then there's the number c in base a. My job is to convert this c into base b, handling Roman numerals if needed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (given in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be Roman numerals.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nStep 1: Converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have letters like A, B, etc., depending on the base. For example, if a is 16, then digits could be 0-9 and A-F. Wait, but the problem says that for bases greater than 10, letters are used. So, for example, in base 12, digits would be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). So when converting c to decimal, I need to handle letters as digits beyond 9.\n\nBut wait, the input for c is given as a string. So for example, if the input is 'A', then in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo first, I need to process the input string c, which is in base a, and convert it to a decimal integer. How to do that? Well, for each character in the string, I need to find its value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So I can loop through each character, convert it to its corresponding value, then compute the decimal value.\n\nBut how to handle uppercase vs lowercase? The problem says that the input may have letters, but probably the input is in uppercase? Well, the sample input includes 'A' in one of the cases, so maybe the input is given in uppercase. So I should assume that the input c is in uppercase letters. So for example, if the input is 'A', then it's 10 in base a.\n\nSo for the conversion from base a to decimal, I can process each digit as follows:\n\nInitialize a variable decimal_value = 0.\n\nFor each char in c:\n\ndigit_value = int(char) if it's a digit, else ord(char) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nThen, decimal_value = decimal_value * a + digit_value.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? The problem says that c may have leading zeros, but that's okay because when converting to decimal, leading zeros don't affect the value. So that's handled automatically.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, the next step is to convert it to base b. However, if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string.\n\nSo for the second part, two cases:\n\nCase 1: b is not R. Then convert the decimal number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A, B, etc. as needed. Also, leading zeros must be omitted. For example, if the decimal is zero, but the problem says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number isn't zero. But in other cases, the input c may be zero? Wait, the input says that if Roman is involved, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the input c can be zero?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15.\" So when converting to Roman, the number is non-zero. But for other cases, the input can be zero? Well, the input c is a non-negative integer. So if the input is zero, then when converting to base b (not Roman), we need to output zero. But the problem says that in the case of Roman, the number is not zero. So when converting to base b (non-Roman), the input could be zero.\n\nSo for the conversion to base b (non-Roman):\n\nIf the decimal value is zero, output '0'.\n\nElse, convert to base b, with digits as per the base. For example, base 16 would have digits 0-9, A-F. For bases up to 25, letters go up to Y (since 10 is A, 25 is Y).\n\nSo how to convert decimal to base b:\n\nWe can do this by repeatedly dividing the number by b and collecting the remainders. But we need to handle the case where the number is zero.\n\nBut for the case when the decimal value is zero, the output is '0'.\n\nSo for example, if the input is '10 2\\n1', then c is '1' in base 10, which is 1 in decimal. Then converted to base 2 is '1'.\n\nAnother example: '16 R\\n5' → c is '5' in base 16. That's 5 in decimal. Then converted to Roman is 'V'.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement these steps.\n\nSo first, code steps:\n\nRead a and b. But note that the first line can have 'R' as the second element. So the first line is split into two parts. So for example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2', then another line is '16 R', etc.\n\nSo in Python, read the first line as a and b. But since b can be 'R', perhaps split the first line into parts. For example:\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb = line1[1]\n\nThen, the next line is the c string.\n\nSo for the first part, converting c from base a to decimal.\n\nNow, for that conversion, I need to process each character in the string. Let's take the example where c is 'A' in base 12. Then, the value is 10.\n\nSo for each character in c:\n\ndigit = char\n\nif it's a digit, then value is int(digit)\n\nelse, it's a letter, so value is 10 + (ord(digit) - ord('A'))\n\nBut what about lowercase letters? Well, the problem says that the input may contain letters, but the examples use uppercase. So assuming that the input is uppercase.\n\nSo code for converting c to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nBut wait, what if the input has letters that are beyond the base? Like, if the base is 10, and the input has 'A'? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is valid. So the input is guaranteed to be a valid number in base a. So no need to check for that.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then proceed.\n\nNow, the second part: converting decimal to base b, or Roman.\n\nSo for the case when b is not 'R':\n\nWe need to convert the decimal number to base b, with digits as per the base. For example, base 12 would use 0-9, A, B.\n\nBut how to handle zero? For example, if the decimal is zero, output '0'.\n\nElse, we can proceed as follows:\n\ndigits = []\nnum = decimal_value\nif num == 0:\n    digits = ['0']\nelse:\n    while num > 0:\n        remainder = num % b\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        num = num // b\n    digits = digits[::-1]  # reverse\n\nThen, convert each digit to its corresponding character. For example, 10 becomes 'A', etc.\n\nBut for digits in the list, each is a number between 0 and b-1. So for each digit in digits:\n\nif digit < 10: str(digit)\nelse: chr(ord('A') + digit - 10)\n\nBut wait, for example, digit 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc.\n\nSo code for converting decimal to base b:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nWait, but what if the number is zero? The code returns '0'.\n\nBut in the case when the input is zero, but the base is R? Well, the problem says that in that case, the input will not be zero. So for the case when b is R, the decimal value is non-zero.\n\nSo for the case when b is R, we need to convert the decimal value to Roman numerals.\n\nSo the steps for Roman conversion:\n\nImplement a function that takes an integer (decimal) and returns the Roman numeral as a string.\n\nHow to convert decimal to Roman numerals?\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For example:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number, appending the symbol each time.\n\nFor example, for 4, it's IV.\n\nSo code for converting to Roman:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is within the constraints. According to the problem statement, when converting to Roman, the number is <= 3000 (in decimal) and not zero.\n\nSo that function should work.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead a and b (with possible R in b), then read c.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal (as a number).\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert to Roman. Else, convert to base b as a string, with digits as per the base.\n\nNow, some edge cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: c is zero. For example, input a=2, b=10, c=0. Then output is '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So in that case, when converting to Roman, the input is non-zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base b (non-Roman), the decimal is zero. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 2, the decimal is 0 → output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 10, the decimal is 0 → output is '0'.\n\nNow, handling the conversion from c to decimal. For example, if c is '0', then the decimal is zero.\n\nSo, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead first line: a and b. Then read the next line as c.\n\nBut wait, the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, the input given in the sample is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut how is the input structured? The problem says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. So for each test case, there are two lines. So the code needs to read multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo the input is for one test case. But the sample input shows multiple lines, which probably represents multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. Wait, looking back:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of inputs, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code must read from stdin and output to stdout. So the actual input for the program is multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nWait, the problem's sample input shows multiple lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich outputs '1'.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem shows a list of inputs, perhaps indicating that the code should handle multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample shows multiple test cases, but perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nOutput:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nBut that's probably indicating that the code should read multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case per run. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. That suggests that perhaps the sample input is multiple test cases, but the actual input is one test case. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not mention that. But in this case, the problem says that the input is for one test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the sample shows multiple test cases. For example, the first input line is '10 2\\n1', which is two lines. Then the next input line is '16 R\\n5', etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. But how?\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem's sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual input is a single test case. But how can that be?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is multiple test cases, and the code should process them all. However, the problem's input description doesn't mention that. So this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the sample input has five test cases. For example, the first input line is '10 2\\n1', which would be a=10, b=2, c=1. The output is '1'. The second input line is '16 R\\n5', which would be a=16, b=R, c=5. Output is 'V', etc.\n\nTherefore, the code must read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So that implies that the code is to process one test case. However, the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. But perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that each test case is given in a separate line. But that's not possible. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. For example, the code should read until EOF.\n\nBut the problem's input description does not specify that. However, given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, reading from stdin, perhaps the code should read all lines at once, split into pairs.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has five test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nSo the code must read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, perhaps the code can read all lines from stdin, split into groups of two lines. For example, read all lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, in the sample input, the input is given as:\n\nLine 1: 10 2\n\nLine 2: 1\n\nLine 3: 16 R\n\nLine 4: 5\n\nLine 5: 5 R\n\nLine 6: 4\n\nLine 7: 2 2\n\nLine 8: 1111001\n\nLine 9: 12 13\n\nLine 10: A\n\nSo the code would process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, perhaps read all lines, then iterate through them in pairs.\n\nBut the problem's input description may not mention that, but the sample shows that. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description says that the input is for a single test case. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b...\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo that suggests that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But that's not possible. Because the sample output has multiple outputs, which would imply that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a contradiction. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem's input is multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs.\n\nSo, for example, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n    a_and_b_line = lines[i]\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n\n    # process a_and_b_line and c_line\n\nBut this would work if the input is given as pairs of lines. But in the problem's input description, it's not clear. However, given the sample input and output, this is the correct approach.\n\nBut the problem's note says that the sample input is given as a list of inputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as a list of inputs, but the actual code is supposed to read from stdin, perhaps the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in the sample input, each test case is two lines. So the code reads them as pairs.\n\nSo now, the code can be written as:\n\nRead all lines, then process them two at a time.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut first, the code for converting c from base a to decimal.\n\nBut for the case when c is zero, like '0' in base a. For example, if a is 10, c is '0', then decimal is 0.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement functions:\n\n- to_decimal(s, base): converts s (string) in base 'base' to decimal integer.\n\n- decimal_to_base(n, base): converts decimal n to base 'base' as a string.\n\n- decimal_to_roman(n): converts decimal to Roman.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nfor each pair of lines:\n\n   line1 = first line of the pair: a and b.\n\n   line2 = second line: c.\n\n   process:\n\n   a = int(line1.split()[0])\n\n   b = line1.split()[1]\n\n   c_str = line2\n\n   decimal_val = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\n   if b == 'R':\n\n       roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n\n       print(roman)\n\n   else:\n\n       base = int(b)\n\n       converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n\n       print(converted)\n\nBut need to handle the case where decimal_val is zero. For example, if the input is '2 10\\n0', then the output is '0'.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\ndecimal_val is 1. Convert to base 2: '1' → correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5 → decimal is 5 → Roman is V → correct.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → decimal is 4 → Roman is IV → correct.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → binary 1111001 is 121 in decimal. Convert to base 2 again: 1111001 → same as input. So output is '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → in base 12, 'A' is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 in decimal is 'A' in base 13. So output 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut need to handle the case where the decimal_val is zero. For example, in the function decimal_to_base, if n is zero, returns '0'.\n\nNow, code for the functions.\n\nImplementing to_decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nBut what about leading zeros? It's handled automatically.\n\nNow, decimal_to_base:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nNow, decimal_to_roman:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nNow, putting it all together in Python.\n\nBut in Python, how to read the input? For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut sometimes, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input is properly formatted.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        a_str, b = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        c = c_line\n        # Convert c to decimal\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the input has an odd number of lines? For example, if there's a test case with only one line. But according to the problem statement, each test case has two lines. So the code assumes that the input is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input lines:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut when read as lines, each line is split into two lines. For example, the first line is '10 2', the second is '1', then third is '16 R', fourth is '5', etc.\n\nSo the code would process each pair correctly.\n\nAnother test case: input '2 2\\n1111001' → decimal is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + ... + 1*2^0 ?\n\nWait, the string is '1111001' in base 2. Let's compute:\n\nFrom left to right:\n\nvalue starts at 0.\n\nEach character is '1', so:\n\n0 * 2 + 1 = 1\n\n1 * 2 + 1 = 3\n\n3 * 2 + 1 = 7\n\n7 * 2 + 1 = 15\n\n15 * 2 + 0 = 30\n\n30 * 2 + 0 = 60\n\n60 * 2 + 1 = 121.\n\nSo decimal is 121. Then converting to base 2 again: 121 in decimal is 1111001, which is the same as the input. So output is '1111001'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: '5 R\\n4' → c is '4' in base 5. Which is 4 in decimal. Roman is IV.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros? For example, input a=10, b=10, c='000123' → decimal is 123. Converted to base 10 is '123'.\n\nAnother case: input a=10, b=2, c='0' → decimal is 0 → output '0'.\n\nWhat about when converting to base 1? Wait, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code can assume that the bases are valid.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- What if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, it's a non-negative integer, and the length doesn't exceed 10^3. So it's not empty.\n\n- What if the input c is zero? The code handles that.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting to base b, the decimal_val is zero. For example, when the input is a=10, b=16, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 10, the code returns '0'.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1 → decimal is 1 → base 2 → '1'\n\nSample output is '1'.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5 → decimal is 5 → 'V'.\n\nSample input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → decimal is 4 → 'IV'.\n\nSample input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 → 1111001.\n\nSample input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 → 'A'.\n\nAll correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which could be a Roman numeral. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base `b`, handling Roman numerals if specified.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number `c` is given in base `a`. We convert this number to a decimal integer by processing each digit of `c` according to its value in base `a`.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a Roman numeral or another numerical base:\n   - If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal integer to a Roman numeral.\n   - Otherwise, convert the decimal integer to the specified base `b` using standard digit representation, including letters for bases greater than 10.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        a_str, b = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        c = c_line\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as multiple lines, with each test case consisting of two lines: the first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, and the second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input number `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and calculating its value based on its position and the base.\n3. **Base Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal integer to a specified base `b`, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases greater than 10.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal integer to a Roman numeral by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values from the number and appending the corresponding Roman symbols.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including leading zeros, zero values, and Roman numeral conversions.",
