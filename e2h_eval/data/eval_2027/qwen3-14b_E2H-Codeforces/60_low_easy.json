            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of S in Morse code after each modification. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Each time a character (0 or 1) is added to S, I have to compute the answer. The answer is the number of possible sequences of letters that correspond to some substring of S. But the catch is that some Morse code strings are invalid (like \"0011\", etc.), so any substring that's one of those four invalid ones shouldn't be counted.\n\nSo the main idea is: for each step, after appending a new character to S, look at all possible substrings of S and check if they are valid Morse code representations. Then count all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting these substrings into valid Morse code letters. But how do we do that efficiently?\n\nWait, but the problem says that each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4) corresponds to exactly one letter. So each valid substring represents exactly one letter. However, when considering sequences of letters, the substrings can be split into multiple valid Morse code strings. For example, if the substring is \"111\", it could be split as \"1\" followed by \"11\" (two letters), or as \"11\" followed by \"1\" (another two letters), or as \"111\" (one letter). So each such split contributes to the count.\n\nBut the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So for each substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of the forbidden four), we can consider all possible ways to split it into valid Morse code letters. Each split gives a sequence of letters. However, the question is to count all such sequences across all substrings.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the note. In the first example, S is \"111\". The substrings are:\n\n- All possible substrings:\n\nLength 1: \"1\" (valid)\nLength 2: \"11\" (valid)\nLength 3: \"111\" (valid)\nAlso, the substrings of length 1, 2, 3, etc. For example, the first '1' is a substring, the second '1' is another, the third '1', then the first two '1's, the middle two, etc. Wait, but the substrings are all possible contiguous parts of S. So for S = \"111\", the substrings are:\n\n\"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\".\n\nEach of these substrings is a valid Morse code (since none of the forbidden four are present). Now, each of these substrings can be split into sequences of letters. For example, the substring \"111\" can be split into:\n\n- One letter: \"111\" → 1 way.\n- Two letters: \"1\" + \"11\" → 1 way.\n- Three letters: \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" → 1 way.\n\nSo total 3 ways for this substring. But the problem counts all such sequences. However, the note says that for S=\"111\", the total is 7. Let's see:\n\nThe note lists the sequences as:\n\nT, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT. That's 7. So each of the substrings contributes their possible splits. But how?\n\nLet me think. For each substring, the number of possible splits into valid Morse code letters is added to the total. So for example:\n\nTake the substring \"1\" (each occurrence). It can be split into one letter. So each occurrence contributes 1. Since there are three such substrings, that's 3. But in the note, the count is 7. Wait, but the example's answer is 7 after three steps. Let me check:\n\nIn the first sample input, after three steps, S is \"111\". The output is 7. According to the note, the answer is 7. Let's see how that comes from the substrings:\n\nSubstrings of S:\n\nAll substrings (each is a valid code):\n\nFor each possible substring, we calculate the number of ways to split into valid letters. Then sum all these numbers.\n\nLet's list all substrings and their contribution:\n\nSubstrings of length 1:\n\nThere are 3 of them. Each can be split in exactly 1 way. So 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nSubstrings of length 2:\n\nThere are 2 of them (\"11\", \"11\"). Each can be split in 1 way (as one letter) or as two letters? Wait",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code after each modification. The key challenge is efficiently determining valid Morse code substrings and their possible splits into valid letter sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: First, identify the four invalid Morse code strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic String Updates**: For each character added to `S`, maintain the current string and check all possible substrings.\n3. **Substrings and Validity**: For each substring of `S`, check if it is a valid Morse code string (i.e., not one of the invalid ones).\n4. **Count Valid Sequences**: For each valid Morse code substring, compute the number of ways it can be split into valid Morse code letters (lengths 1 to 4). This is done using dynamic programming to keep track of valid splits efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    S = []\n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(c)\n        current = ''.join(S)\n        n = len(current)\n        \n        # We'll use a new dp array for the current string\n        curr_dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n        curr_dp[0] = 1\n        \n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            for k in range(1, 5):\n                if j - k >= 0:\n                    substr = current[j - k:j]\n                    if substr in forbidden:\n                        continue\n                    curr_dp[j] = (curr_dp[j] + curr_dp[j - k]) % MOD\n        \n        total = 0\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            total = (total + curr_dp[j]) % MOD\n        \n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, with the first line indicating the number of modifications.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array (`curr_dp`)**: This array keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string `S`. The value `curr_dp[j]` represents the number of valid sequences for the first `j` characters of the current string.\n3. **Forbidden Substrings Check**: For each position in the string, we check all possible substrings of lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid (not forbidden), we update the dynamic programming array to include the number of valid sequences ending at that position.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the numbers can be very large, all operations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$ to ensure they fit within standard integer limits.\n\nThis approach ensures that after each modification to the string `S`, we efficiently compute the number of valid Morse code sequences using dynamic programming, leading to an optimal solution for the given constraints.",
