He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nSo the process is: A has some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the number of 'c's could be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the string must have a certain structure. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the string must consist of some 'a's followed by some 'b's followed by some 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order is important. Like, the 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because A starts with a's, then B adds b's, then C adds c's. So the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. If there's any other order, like a c before a b, that's invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the string is given, and we have to check if it could have been formed this way. So first, the string must have a's followed by b's followed by c's. So for example, if the string is 'aabbc', that's okay. But if it's 'abac', that's not allowed because the c comes before the b's.\n\nSo first step: check that the string is composed of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So the characters must be in order a...ab...bcc...c. So any occurrence of a 'b' must come after all a's, and any 'c's must come after all b's. So if there's a 'c' before a 'b', that's invalid. Similarly, if there's an 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', that's invalid.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So how can I check that?\n\nFor example, the string 'aabc' is okay. The string 'bbacc' would have the order of b's first, but that's not allowed. Because the original string starts with a's. So the first character must be 'a' (since A starts with some a's, then B adds b's, then C adds c's). Wait, but what if there are zero a's? No, because the problem says that B appends some number of b's, but the original string from A has some number of a's. But the problem says that after B appends, there's at least one a and one b. So the original string from A must have at least one a, and B appends at least one b. So the total string after B's step has at least one a and one b. Then C adds c's. So the original string must have at least one a and one b. So the input string must have at least one a, one b, and some c's (maybe zero? No, because C appends some number of c's. Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. So the number of c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string at that point. But the problem says that the number of c's added is some number. So the number of c's can't be zero? Because C appends some number. Wait, the problem says \"some number of letters 'c'\". So that implies that the number is at least 1. Because if you append zero, that's not adding anything. But maybe the problem allows for zero? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So the word 'some' here might mean that it's possible that zero? Or does it mean that the number is at least one? Hmm. Well, the problem says that the original string (from A and B) has at least one a and one b. Then, C appends some number of c's. But the problem says that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string. So the number of c's is equal to the count of a's (which is at least 1) or the count of b's (also at least 1). Therefore, the number of c's must be at least 1. Therefore, the final string must have at least one c. So the input string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by appending 'b's and then 'c's to a string of 'a's, following specific rules. The string must be composed of a block of 'a's followed by a block of 'b's followed by a block of 'c's, with each block having at least one character. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before the 'c's were added.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Structure**: The string must be in the form of `a*b*c*`, meaning all 'a's come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's.\n2. **Check Minimum Counts**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n3. **Check C Count Validity**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before the 'c's were added.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check if the string is in the form a*b*c*\n    # First, check that all a's come before b's and c's\n    # Then all b's come before c's\n    # Also, there should be at least one a, one b, and one c\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if there are at least one a, one b, and one c\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Check the order of characters\n    # The string should be all a's followed by all b's followed by all c's\n    # So, after the first occurrence of 'b', there should be no 'a' or 'c'\n    # Similarly, after the first occurrence of 'c', there should be no 'a' or 'b'\n    i = 0\n    # Check for a's first\n    while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n    # Now check for b's\n    while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n    # Now check for c's\n    while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n    if i != len(s):\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Now check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    print(is_valid_string(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The code first checks if the string is composed of a block of 'a's followed by a block of 'b's and then a block of 'c's. This is done by iterating through the string and ensuring that once a different character is encountered, it follows the correct order.\n2. **Minimum Counts Check**: The code ensures there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' in the string.\n3. **Count Validity Check**: The number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before the 'c's were added. This is verified by comparing the counts directly.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions in linear time, ensuring the solution is both optimal and correct.",
