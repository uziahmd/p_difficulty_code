Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to feed a golorp based on its name, which seems to be a string that encodes some kind of constraints. The output needs to be the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies those constraints, or 'false' if impossible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the name translates into constraints. Looking at the examples might help. Let's look at the first example input: ['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', ...]. The output for that is '0010'. \n\nHmm. The name seems to have parts that resemble Befunge commands, given the mention in the problem statement. Befunge is a 2D esoteric programming language where the instruction pointer moves in directions (like up, down, left, right), and the program is a grid of characters. So maybe the golorp's name represents a Befunge program, and the variables are the values that need to be fed into the program in a certain way?\n\nWait, the problem says that variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9. The daily diet is defined by the name. The jaws determine the number of variables needed. The variables get into the jaws, then to the stomach. So perhaps the name is a Befunge program, and the variables are the inputs that the program requires. But how does that translate into the constraints?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is a representation of a Befunge program, and the variables are the values that are pushed onto the stack during execution. For example, the '?' in Befunge is a random direction command, but maybe here it's part of some structure that defines the required input variables.\n\nBut the problem says that the name is valid, so we don't have to validate it. Our job is to parse the name into constraints on the input variables, then find the lex smallest sequence that meets those constraints.\n\nLet me think about the sample input and output again. For example, the first input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' and the output is '0010'. Let's see: the output is four digits, which suggests that the number of variables needed is four. How does that relate to the input string?\n\nLooking at the structure of the input strings, they seem to have parts that resemble Befunge code. For example, the first sample input starts with ?(...) and then has : - etc. Maybe the name is structured as a series of instructions that involve pushing variables into the stack, and the constraints are based on the operations performed on those variables.\n\nWait, the problem says that each golorp's diet is defined by its name. The variables are consumed via the jaws. So perhaps the name is a Befunge program that uses some variables, and the variables are the inputs that need to be provided in order for the program to run correctly. But how do we model this?\n\nAnother thought: the problem mentions that the golorp's jaws determine the number of variables needed. So the length of the output sequence is determined by the number of variables required by the jaws. For example, in the first sample, the output is four digits, implying that the jaws require four variables. So the name must encode how many variables are needed and what constraints they must satisfy.\n\nBut how to parse that from the name? Let's look for patterns. The examples have parts like ?(...):-...>... which may be structured as:\n\n- The ? might indicate the start of a function or some operation.\n- The part inside the parentheses might be the variables involved.\n- The colon and other symbols might represent operations that the variables must satisfy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the name is a Befunge program, and the variables are the inputs that are pushed onto the stack. The problem states that the golorp will choose the lex smallest valid sequence. So perhaps the Befunge program must execute without errors, and the input variables are the ones that are pushed into the stack, and we need to find the lex smallest sequence of digits that allows the program to run correctly.\n\nBut how to model this? Well, Befunge programs are executed with an instruction pointer moving around, and the stack is used for operations. However, the exact mechanics would be complex. But given that the problem is from a programming competition, perhaps there's a pattern or a specific way to parse the name into constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is a regular expression or a pattern that encodes the constraints on the variables. For example, the sample input might have certain parts that indicate how the variables are used. For instance, the first sample's output is '0010', which is four digits. The input starts with ?(...), which could be a function that takes some parameters. Then the rest of the string may indicate operations that must be satisfied by the variables.\n\nAnother approach: looking for similar problems. This seems similar to the problem of parsing a Befunge-like program and determining the input that makes it halt or meet certain conditions. However, without knowing the exact rules of how the name translates into constraints, this is challenging.\n\nWait, the problem says that all names are similar to the samples. Let's look at the sample inputs again:\n\nFirst sample input: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nBreaking this down, maybe the part inside the parentheses is the variables. Let's count the underscores. The first part after ? is (_-_/___*__). There are 5 underscores in the first part? Let's count:\n\nInside the first parentheses: _ - _ / _ _ _ * _ _ \n\nWait, perhaps each underscore represents a variable. For example, the first part inside the parentheses has 5 underscores, which would imply that there are 5 variables. But the output for this sample is 4 digits. Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in a certain part of the name.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for the first sample: '0010' is four digits. Let's check the sample input again. The first sample input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' The part after the colon is ':-___>__.' Maybe the number of underscores in that part indicates the number of variables. Let's see: the part after the colon is ':-___>__.' The ':-___' part has three underscores. Then '>__.' has two underscores. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample outputs and their corresponding inputs:\n\nSample 1 output is 4 digits. The input has a part that may be indicating four variables. For example, the first sample input's part after the colon is ':-___>__.' which has three underscores followed by two underscores. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the problem says that variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws. So the number of variables is determined by the jaws. The jaws' shape determines the number of variables. So perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the name's certain parts. For example, in the first sample input, the part inside the parentheses is '(_-_/___*__)' which has 5 underscores? Let's count:\n\nInside the parentheses: _ - _ / _ _ _ * _ _ \n\nBreaking down the characters between ( and ):\n\nThe string is \"-_/___*__\".\n\nWait, let's count the underscores:\n\nThe first part after the '(' is '_', then '-', then '_', then '/', then three underscores, then '*', then two underscores. So total underscores would be 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 7? Or maybe the underscores are the variables. Wait, perhaps each underscore represents a variable. So the number of underscores in the part inside the parentheses is the number of variables required. For example, in the first sample input, the part inside the parentheses is '-_/___*__' â€” wait, no, the entire part inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__'. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nSo inside the parentheses: '_-_/___*__' â€” let's count the underscores here:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n_ - _ / _ _ _ * _ _\n\nSo underscores are in positions 0, 2, 4,5,6,8,9. That's 7 underscores. But the output is 4 digits. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For the first sample input, after the colon is ':-___>__.' So the part after the colon is ':-___>__.' The underscores here are three, then two. So maybe that's 3+2=5 variables? Not matching the output of 4.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the name as a Befunge program and try to model the execution. Let's recall that in Befunge, the program is a grid, and the instruction pointer moves in directions. The '?' command is a random direction, but perhaps in this problem, the name is a simplified version of Befunge code, and the variables are the inputs that are pushed into the stack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is structured with parts that define the number of variables and the operations that must be performed on them. For example, the '?' could represent a function that takes some variables, and the rest of the string is a series of operations that must be satisfied by the variables.\n\nWait, looking at the sample output for the first case: '0010' which is four digits. Let's think about the input: the first part is ?(...). Maybe the parentheses contain the variables. Let's count the underscores in the parentheses. The part inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__' â€” which has underscores in the following positions:\n\nLet me write the string: '_-_/___*__'\n\nBreaking it down character by character:\n\nCharacter 0: _, 1: -, 2: _, 3: /, 4: _, 5: _, 6: _, 7: *, 8: _, 9: _.\n\nSo there are 1 (pos 0) + 1 (pos 2) + 3 (positions 4-6) + 2 (positions 8-9) = total of 7 underscores. But the output is 4 digits. So that doesn't align. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For example, in the first sample, after the colon is ':-___>__.' The underscores here are three, then two. So total of 5 underscores. But output is 4 digits. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon and before the '>' or something else. For example, the part after the colon is ':-___>__.' The ':-___' part has three underscores. Then the '>__.' has two underscores. Maybe the total is 3+2=5, but the output is 4 digits. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the entire string. But that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me look at the second sample input: '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.' Output is 'false'. The output is false, meaning no solution exists. Let's see the number of underscores in the name. But again, this approach might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is a Befunge program, and the variables are the inputs that are pushed onto the stack. For example, in Befunge, the numbers are pushed onto the stack when encountered. The program may perform operations that require certain values. For example, if the program has a '+' operation, then the top two numbers on the stack must be such that their sum is something. But how do we know what the program expects?\n\nBut since the problem is about finding the lex smallest sequence of variables that allows the program to run without errors, perhaps the name represents a Befunge program that uses the variables in some way, and the variables are the inputs that are pushed into the stack. However, the exact way to model this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is structured as a series of constraints that the variables must satisfy. For example, the sample input might have parts that indicate equations between variables. For instance, the first sample's input may have something like (a - b) / (c * d) = ... and so on. But how to parse that from the string.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the sample outputs. The first sample output is '0010', which is four digits. Let's think of the variables as a sequence of digits, say, a, b, c, d. Then the name's structure may impose constraints on these variables. For example, the first part of the name may have expressions involving these variables. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is a regular expression that the variables must match. For example, the first sample's input may have some pattern that the variables must follow. However, the sample output is 0010, which is four digits. But how to derive that from the name.\n\nThis is really challenging. Since the problem is from a programming competition, perhaps there's a pattern in the input that I'm missing. Let's think about the sample inputs again and their outputs.\n\nFirst sample input: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' Output: '0010'\n\nSecond sample input: '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.' Output: 'false'\n\nThird sample input: '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', output: '0250341' (length 7)\n\nFourth sample input: '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.' Output: '0101' (length 4)\n\nLooking at the outputs, their lengths vary. For example, the third sample's output is 7 digits. Let's check the input for that sample. The part inside the parentheses is a long sequence of underscores, perhaps indicating the number of variables. Let me count the underscores in the part inside the parentheses for the third sample input:\n\nThe third input is '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', so inside the parentheses is a long string of underscores and other characters. Let's count the underscores in that part. However, it's tedious, but maybe the number of underscores corresponds to the length of the output. For example, the third sample's output is 7 digits. Let's count the underscores in the part inside the parentheses:\n\nThe string inside the parentheses starts with a bunch of underscores. Let's see:\n\nThe string is \"______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___\"\n\nBreaking it down, the initial underscores are 20 underscores? Let me count:\n\nWell, the first part is \"______________________\" which is 20 underscores (assuming each underscore is one character). Then there's '/____+...' etc. So the number of underscores in the first part is 20. But the output is 7 digits. Not matching. So that approach is probably wrong.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of commas in the part after the colon. For example, in the third sample input, after the colon, the string is '-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______'. There are five commas. So that would suggest five variables? But the output is seven digits. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of commas plus one. For example, in the third sample, five commas would mean six variables, but the output is seven. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For example, in the third sample input, the part after the colon is '-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______'. Let's count the underscores in that part:\n\nEach segment like '-__<___' has underscores. It's hard to count manually, but perhaps the number of variables is determined by the maximum number of underscores in any of the segments. For example, in the third sample, the output is seven digits. So maybe the number of variables is seven.\n\nBut how to find that from the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon, split by commas. For example, in the third sample input, the part after the colon is '-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______'. Splitting by commas gives us several parts:\n\n1. '-__<___' â†’ underscores: 2 and 3 â†’ maybe 3?\n2. '___<____' â†’ underscores: 3 and 4 â†’ 4?\n3. '____<_____' â†’ underscores: 4 and 5 â†’ 5?\n4. '_____<______' â†’ underscores: 5 and 6 â†’ 6?\n5. '______<_______' â†’ underscores: 6 and 7 â†’ 7?\n\nSo the maximum is 7, which matches the output length of 7. That seems promising. Let's check the first sample input.\n\nFirst sample input's part after colon is ':-___>__.' Split into parts by commas? Well, there are no commas in that part. So maybe it's split by something else. Or perhaps the variables are determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon, ignoring commas. For example, in the first sample, after the colon is ':-___>__.' The underscores here are three in the ':-___' part and two in the '>__.' part. Total of 5 underscores. But the output is 4 digits. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon, divided by something. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output for the fourth sample input is '0101', which is four digits. The input for that sample is '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.' The part after the colon is ':-___>__.' Again, underscores here are three and two, totaling 5. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Perhaps I need to think differently. Let's think about the problem description again.\n\nThe problem says that the golorp's daily diet is defined by its name. The jaws determine the number of variables. The variables are consumed in the order they get into the jaws. The output is the lex smallest sequence of variable values.\n\nSo, the first thing to determine is how many variables are required. Once we know that, we can generate possible sequences and check which ones meet the constraints.\n\nBut how to determine the number of variables from the name. Let's look at the sample outputs again:\n\nSample 1: output length 4. Sample 4: output length 4. Sample 3: output length 7. Sample 2: output is false.\n\nLooking at the sample 4 input: '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.' The part inside the parentheses is '(__+___+__-___)' â€” the underscores here are 1, 3, 2, 3. Maybe the number of underscores is the number of variables? But that would be 1+3+2+3=9, which doesn't match the output length of 4.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part inside the parentheses. For example, in sample 4's input, inside the parentheses is '(__+___+__-___)' â€” the underscores are in the parts:\n\nAfter the '(', the string is __+___+__-___.\n\nBreaking it down: the first part is '__' (two underscores), then '+', then '___' (three), then '+', then '__' (two), then '-___' (three). Total underscores: 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10. But the output is 4 digits. No match.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For example, sample 4's part after the colon is ':-___>__.' which has 3 + 2 = 5 underscores. Still no match.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the sample outputs and the possible constraints they satisfy.\n\nFor the first sample, output is 0010. Let's assume that the variables are a=0, b=0, c=1, d=0. What could be the constraints? Perhaps the name represents a series of operations that require certain relationships between the variables.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rules, this is guesswork. Perhaps the name is a Befunge program, and the variables are the inputs that are pushed onto the stack. For example, in Befunge, the program may read input characters and push them onto the stack. The program may have operations that require certain values. For instance, if the program has a '+' operator, then the top two elements of the stack must be numbers that can be added, but since the variables are digits, it's always possible. But how does this relate to the output being a sequence of variables?\n\nAlternatively, the program may have certain conditions that must be met for it to terminate, and the variables are the inputs that allow this. But without knowing the exact rules of how the name translates into the program, it's impossible to proceed.\n\nGiven that this is a programming competition problem, there's likely a pattern or a way to parse the name into constraints on the variables. Let's think about the sample inputs again.\n\nLooking at the first sample input: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' Output is '0010'.\n\nThe part inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__'. Maybe the underscores represent variables, and the operators between them represent operations that must be satisfied. For example, the expression could be (a - b) / (c * d). If the program evaluates this and requires it to be zero, then the variables must satisfy that equation. But how to determine what the expression evaluates to?\n\nAlternatively, the name is structured like a mathematical expression with variables and operators, and the constraints are derived from the operators. For example, the first part inside the parentheses could be an expression that must evaluate to a certain value, and the part after the colon defines what that value should be.\n\nIn the first sample, the part after the colon is ':-___>__.' This could be interpreted as the expression must be equal to something. For example, the colon might separate the expression from the desired result. The ':-___>__.' could be a way to say that the expression must be greater than or equal to some value. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the colon separates the expression from a set of conditions. For example, the part after the colon could define inequalities between variables. Like, in the third sample input, the part after the colon is '-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______', which could be a series of inequalities between variables. For example, if the variables are v1, v2, ..., vn, then each part like '-__<___' could represent v_i < v_j, and so on.\n\nIf this is the case, then the number of variables is determined by the number of variables mentioned in the inequalities. For example, in the third sample input, the part after the colon is a list of inequalities. Each inequality has a certain number of underscores, which might correspond to the indices of the variables. For example, '-__<___' could mean that variable 2 (since there are two underscores) is less than variable 3 (three underscores). Similarly, '___<____' would mean variable 3 < variable 4, and so on. This would create a chain of inequalities that the variables must satisfy.\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of variables is determined by the maximum number of underscores in any of the parts. For example, in the third sample input, the last part is '______<_______', which has 6 and 7 underscores. So the variables are numbered up to 7, which would mean 7 variables. And the output is indeed '0250341' which is 7 digits. That fits!\n\nSimilarly, let's look at the first sample input. The part after the colon is ':-___>__.' If this is a condition like 'expression > something', but perhaps the colon is separating the expression from a condition. For example, the part after the colon could be a comparison between the expression and another value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the part after the colon might define a series of comparisons. For example, in the first sample input, the part after the colon is ':-___>__.' which could be interpreted as the expression (from the parentheses) must be greater than some value. But how to determine that value?\n\nAlternatively, the part after the colon may contain a series of comparisons between variables. For example, in the first sample, if the part after the colon is '-___>__.' which could be interpreted as variable 3 (three underscores) is greater than variable 2 (two underscores). But how does this fit with the output being 0010?\n\nLet's try to think of the third sample input. The part after the colon is a list of inequalities separated by commas. Each part is like '-__<___', which might mean that the variable at position 2 (number of underscores) is less than the variable at position 3. So for example:\n\n- '-__<___' â†’ v2 < v3\n- '___<____' â†’ v3 < v4\n- '____<_____' â†’ v4 < v5\n- '_____<______' â†’ v5 < v6\n- '______<_______' â†’ v6 < v7\n\nThis creates a chain: v2 < v3 < v4 < v5 < v6 < v7. But the variables are numbered from 1 to 7? Or from 0 to 6? Well, the output is 0250341, which is seven digits. Let's see if this sequence satisfies the inequalities.\n\nThe output is 0, 2, 5, 0, 3, 4, 1. Let's check the inequalities:\n\nv2 is 2 (second digit?), or is the first digit v1? Assuming the variables are numbered from 1 to 7, and the sequence is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7.\n\nThen:\n\nv2 (2) < v3 (5) â†’ yes.\n\nv3 (5) < v4 (0)? No, 5 is not less than 0. Wait, this contradicts. So this suggests that my assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, the output is '0250341', which is seven digits. Let's break it down:\n\nDigits are [0, 2, 5, 0, 3, 4, 1].\n\nAssuming that the variables are v1=0, v2=2, v3=5, v4=0, v5=3, v6=4, v7=1.\n\nNow checking the inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: '-__<___' â†’ assuming that it's v2 < v3 â†’ 2 < 5 â†’ yes.\n\nSecond inequality: '___<____' â†’ v3 < v4 â†’ 5 < 0 â†’ no. This would not hold. But the output is supposed to be valid. So this suggests that my interpretation is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the underscores in the inequality parts represent the variables' indices. For example, the part '-__<___' might mean that the first variable (with two underscores) is less than the second (with three underscores). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of underscores in each side of the '<' or '>' determines the variable indices. For example, in '-__<___', the left side has two underscores and the right has three. So it would be v2 < v3.\n\nBut in the third sample's output, v2=2, v3=5 â†’ 2 < 5 holds. The next part is '___<____' (three vs four underscores): v3 < v4 â†’ 5 < 0? No. So this would not be valid. But the sample output is valid. So this suggests that my understanding of the pattern is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is very confusing. Let's think of another approach.\n\nPerhaps the part after the colon in the name defines a set of constraints on the variables, and the variables are the digits in the output sequence. For example, the third sample input's part after the colon has multiple inequalities that must be satisfied. The output sequence is the lex smallest sequence of digits that satisfies all these inequalities.\n\nBut how to parse the inequalities from the string.\n\nLooking at the third sample input's part after the colon: '-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______'. Each segment is something like '___<____', which could be interpreted as a comparison between the number of underscores on each side. For example, the number of underscores on the left is 3, on the right is 4. So this might mean that the variable at position 3 is less than the variable at position 4. If this is the case, then the constraints are:\n\nv3 < v4  \nv4 < v5  \nv5 < v6  \nv6 < v7  \nv2 < v3 (from the first part '-__<___' which has 2 and 3 underscores?)\n\nWait, the first part is '-__<___' â€” the left side has two underscores, the right has three. So that would be v2 < v3.\n\nThen the next part is '___<____' (3 < 4), then '____<_____' (4 < 5), then '_____<______' (5 < 6), then '______<_______' (6 < 7). So the constraints are v2 < v3 < v4 < v5 < v6 < v7.\n\nBut the output sequence is 0,2,5,0,3,4,1. Let's see:\n\nv2 is 2, v3 is 5 â†’ 2 < 5: yes.  \nv3=5 < v4=0: no. This violates the constraint. So why is this output considered valid? There must be a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the underscores in the inequality parts are not counting the number of underscores, but the number of characters in the left and right parts. For example, '-__<___' has left side length 2 (the underscores), and right side length 3. So it's comparing the values of the variables at positions 2 and 3. But the output sequence for the third sample has v4=0, which is less than v3=5, which would violate the constraint v3 < v4. So this can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of underscores on each side of the comparison determines the indices. For example, in the first part '-__<___', the left has 2 underscores, the right has 3. This could mean that the variable at position 2 must be less than the variable at position 3. Similarly, the next part '___<____' means variable at position 3 must be less than variable at position 4, and so on. So the constraints are v2 < v3 < v4 < v5 < v6 < v7.\n\nBut the output sequence is 0,2,5,0,3,4,1. Let's see:\n\nv2=2 < v3=5 â†’ ok.  \nv3=5 < v4=0 â†’ no. This violates the constraint. So why is this output valid?\n\nThis suggests that my interpretation is wrong. Perhaps the variables are indexed starting from 0? Let's try that.\n\nAssuming variables are 0-indexed:\n\nv0=0, v1=2, v2=5, v3=0, v4=3, v5=4, v6=1.\n\nConstraints are v1 < v2 < v3 < v4 < v5 < v6.\n\nCheck:\n\nv1=2 < v2=5 â†’ yes.  \nv2=5 < v3=0 â†’ no. Still invalid.\n\nThis doesn't work. So what's wrong here?\n\nMaybe the number of underscores in the entire string is not the index, but the number of underscores in the entire part. For example, in '-__<___', the left has 2 underscores, and the right has 3. But perhaps it's comparing the values of the variables at positions 2 and 3. But in the output, v2 is 5, v3 is 0. So 5 < 0 is false.\n\nThis suggests that either the interpretation is incorrect, or the sample output is wrong, which is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the comparison is in the other direction. For example, the '-' might indicate a subtraction or something else. Or perhaps the '<' is not a less-than but something else.\n\nAlternatively, the part after the colon is a series of inequalities that the variables must satisfy, but the way to parse them is different. For example, each segment like '-__<___' might represent that the value of the expression on the left is less than the value on the right. But how to parse the expressions?\n\nLet me think about the third sample input. The part inside the parentheses is a long sequence of underscores, possibly representing the variables. The part after the colon is a series of inequalities. Maybe the variables are the ones in the parentheses, and the inequalities are between them. For example, the part inside the parentheses has a certain number of variables, and the inequalities define relations between them.\n\nBut how to determine the number of variables? Let's look at the third sample input's part inside the parentheses: \"______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___\". This has a lot of underscores. Let's count the number of underscores in this part. Let's approximate:\n\nThe first part is \"______________________\" â€” 20 underscores? Then \"/____+_______*__-_____*______-___\" â€” let's count the underscores here:\n\n- \"/____\" â†’ 4 underscores\n- \"+_______\" â†’ 7 underscores\n- \"*__\" â†’ 2 underscores\n- \"-_____\" â†’ 5 underscores\n- \"*______\" â†’ 6 underscores\n- \"-___\" â†’ 3 underscores\n\nTotal underscores in this part: 20 + 4 +7 +2 +5 +6 +3 = 47? That seems too large. But the output is 7 digits. So this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part inside the parentheses, divided by some value. For example, if the part inside the parentheses has N underscores, then the number of variables is N divided by the number of operators. But this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for hints in the sample outputs and see if there's a pattern.\n\nFor the third sample, the output is '0250341', which is seven digits. Let's see if this sequence satisfies any particular pattern. The digits are 0, 2, 5, 0, 3, 4, 1. Let's look at the inequalities in the part after the colon: '-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______'.\n\nIf these are inequalities between consecutive variables, like v1 < v2 < v3 < v4 < v5 < v6 < v7, but the output sequence doesn't satisfy this, then perhaps the inequalities are between non-consecutive variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the part after the colon defines a series of inequalities that the variables must satisfy, and the variables are the ones in the part inside the parentheses. For example, the part inside the parentheses has some variables, and the inequalities are between them.\n\nBut without knowing how to parse the variables from the name, this is difficult.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern in the sample outputs and their corresponding inputs. Let's take the fourth sample input: '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.' Output is '0101'.\n\nThe part inside the parentheses is '(__+___+__-___)' â€” let's count the underscores here: the string is __+___+__-___, which has 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10 underscores. But the output is four digits. So perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of operators plus one. For example, if there are three operators (+, +, -), then four variables. This would fit the fourth sample: 3 operators, four variables. The output is four digits. This seems promising.\n\nLet's check the first sample: inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__' â€” let's count the operators. The string is _-_/___*__. The operators are '-', '/', '*'. So three operators, implying four variables. The output is four digits. This fits!\n\nThe second sample input: inside the parentheses is '(__-_+_/_____' â€” let's count the operators. The string is __-+_... so operators are '-', '+', '/'? Let's see: the part inside the parentheses is __-_+_/_____. The operators are '-', '+', '/'. Three operators, implying four variables. But the output is 'false', so it's possible that no solution exists.\n\nThe third sample input: inside the parentheses is a long string of underscores and operators. Let's count the operators. For example, the part is \"______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___\". The operators are '/', '+', '*', '-', '*', '-', so six operators, implying seven variables. The output is seven digits. This fits!\n\nSo this seems to be the key! The number of variables is equal to the number of operators in the part inside the parentheses plus one. Because each operator combines two variables, so for n operators, there are n+1 variables.\n\nThis explains all",
    "response": "To solve the problem of feeding a golorp, we need to interpret its name as a sequence of operations involving variables.
