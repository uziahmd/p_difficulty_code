He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b. Oh right, and if b is R, then I need to output the Roman numeral representation instead of a regular base.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The first line has a and b. Then the second line is the number c in base a. So the steps are:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst part: converting c from base a to decimal. But c can have letters, like in the example where the input is 'A' in base 12. So for example, if a is 12 and c is 'A', that's 10 in decimal.\n\nWait, but the input c is given as a string. So for converting it to decimal, I need to parse each character. For example, if the input is '1111001' in base 2, then that's 1*2^6 + ... etc. But how to handle letters? Well, the problem says that when converting to base b (non-R), the letters are used for digits above 9. Like for base 12, digits go up to 11, which is represented as 'B', etc. But in the input, the c is given in base a, which may have letters if a is greater than 10. Wait, but the input says that c is a non-negative integer in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then c can have digits from 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the problem says that the input may contain leading zeros, but the length is up to 10^3.\n\nBut how to parse the input c into a decimal value. So, for example, if the input c is 'A', then in base a (say 12), that's 10 in decimal. So the code needs to process each character of c as a digit in base a. So the first step is to convert the string c into a decimal integer.\n\nSo for that, I can write a helper function that takes a string s and base a, and returns the decimal value. For example:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, a):\n    value = 0\n    for char in s:\n        digit = int(char) if char.isdigit() else ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * a + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the base is 10? Then digits can be 0-9. But for bases larger than 10, digits can go up to a-1, which would be represented as letters. So the code for converting the input string to decimal is correct.\n\nBut wait, the input c is given in base a. So for example, if a is 12, then the digits can be 0-9, A (10), B (11). So the code above would process each character correctly.\n\nOnce that is done, we need to convert the decimal value to base b, unless b is R, in which case we convert to Roman numerals.\n\nSo next step: handling the conversion from decimal to base b, or to Roman.\n\nSo, for the case where b is not R, we need to convert the decimal number to base b. For example, if the decimal is 5 and b is 2, then it's 101. But for bases higher than 10, digits above 9 are represented as letters (A for 10, B for 11, etc.)\n\nSo for converting decimal to base b, here's the approach:\n\nTake the decimal number, and repeatedly divide by b, collecting the remainders. Then, the remainders are the digits in reverse order. Each remainder is converted to a character: if it's less than 10, use the digit, else use the corresponding letter.\n\nFor example, if the remainder is 10, then it's 'A', 11 is 'B', etc.\n\nBut how to handle zero? Well, the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the input is guaranteed to be non-zero. For other cases, the output must omit leading zeros. So for example, if the decimal is zero, but according to the input constraints, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the input c may be zero?\n\nWait, the input says that c is a non-negative integer. So if c is zero, then converting to base b would be zero. But the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the input is not zero. So for other cases, when converting to base b, we need to handle zero correctly.\n\nBut the input says that if Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So when converting to base b (non-R), the decimal number can be zero. For example, if the input c is zero (like '0' in base a), then the output is zero in base b. However, the problem says that the output must omit leading zeros. So for example, if the decimal is zero, the output is '0'.\n\nSo for converting decimal to base b (non-R):\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    # Now reverse the digits\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    # Convert each digit to character\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\nWait, but for example, if the number is zero, the code returns '0'. But what if the input c is zero? For example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0. Then the output is '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So for other cases, we need to handle zero correctly.\n\nNow, the other case is when b is R. Then we need to convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo for that, I need a function that converts a decimal number to Roman numerals. The problem gives some examples. For example, 4 is IV, 5 is V, 9 is IX, etc.\n\nThe standard way to convert to Roman numerals is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from largest to smallest. For each value, subtract as many as possible from the number, appending the symbols.\n\nThe standard values are:\n\nM 1000\nCM 900\nD 500\nCD 400\nC 100\nXC 90\nL 50\nXL 40\nX 10\nIX 9\nV 5\nIV 4\nI 1\n\nSo the code for converting to Roman would be something like:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, s) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += s\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000 (decimal) and not zero. So the function should handle numbers up to 3000.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead a and b. But note that b can be 'R'.\n\nThen read the string c.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal.\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert the decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert the decimal to base b, using the function above.\n\nBut need to handle leading zeros. For example, if the converted number is zero, output '0'. Otherwise, omit leading zeros.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must omit leading zeros. So, for example, if the converted number is 0, output '0'. Otherwise, for numbers like 0 in base 10, but that's handled by the function.\n\nWait, the function decimal_to_base returns '0' when n is zero. So for example, if the input is '0' in base a, then converting to base b would be '0'.\n\nBut in the case where the decimal is zero, but the output is base b (non-R), the output is '0'.\n\nSo the code for the conversion is okay.\n\nNow, let's think about the test cases.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nLet's take the first case:\n\na=10, b=2. c is '1' in base 10. So decimal is 1. Converted to base 2 is '1'.\n\nSecond case: a=16, b=R. c is 5 in base 16. Decimal is 5. Roman is 'V'.\n\nThird case: a=5, b=R. c is 4 in base 5. Decimal is 4. Roman is IV.\n\nFourth case: a=2, b=2. c is 1111001 in base 2. Which is 121 in decimal. Converting to base 2 again gives 1111001. So output is same as input.\n\nFifth case: a=12, b=13. c is A (which is 10 in decimal). Converting to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. So output is 'A'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if the input c is zero? For example, a=10, b=10, c=0. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting to base 1? Wait, but according to the input constraints, a and b are between 2 and 25. So no, the input will not have base 1.\n\nAnother case: when the decimal number is zero and b is R. But according to the problem statement, in this case, the input is guaranteed to not be zero. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nThe first line is two values: a and b. But b can be 'R'.\n\nSo, for example, in Python, the first line can be split into parts. For example, if the input is '16 R\\n5', then the first line is '16 R', so a is 16, b is 'R'.\n\nSo in code, the first line is read as input().split(). Then, a is the first part, and b is the second part.\n\nBut in Python, the input may be read via input().splitlines(), or read line by line.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. First line is a and b. Second line is the number c.\n\nSo in code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\na_and_b = lines[0].split()\na = int(a_and_b[0])\nb = a_and_b[1]\n\nc = lines[1]\n\nBut need to read from stdin. So for example, the code can read the first line, split into a and b, then read the second line as c.\n\nNow, the code for converting c to decimal.\n\nBut the input c can be up to 10^3 characters long. For example, a very long string in base a. But converting this to decimal could be a problem for very large numbers. However, the problem says that for non-Roman cases, the number won't exceed 1e15. So for Python, which handles big integers, it's okay.\n\nSo the code for converting c to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\nBut wait, what if the input is '0'? Then the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nOnce we have the decimal number, then we process based on b.\n\nNow, for the case where b is 'R', we convert to Roman numerals. Else, convert to base b.\n\nBut for the conversion to base b, the code must handle leading zeros. For example, if the decimal is zero, return '0'. Otherwise, the code as written returns the digits without leading zeros.\n\nWait, in the decimal_to_base function, if the number is zero, returns '0'. Else, for example, if the number is 5 in base 10, returns '5'.\n\nBut what about when the number is zero and the base is 2? Then the output is '0'.\n\nNow, code for converting to base b (non-R):\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, the code must read from stdin. Let me think about the code structure.\n\nThe code needs to read two lines. The first line is a and b. The second line is c.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces. But the problem says that the input is given properly.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the first line, split into a and b.\n\nThen read the second line as c.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    a_and_b = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(a_and_b[0])\n    b = a_and_b[1]\n    c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    decimal_value = 0\n    for ch in c:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        decimal_value = decimal_value * a + digit\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        # Convert decimal_value to Roman\n        roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n        print(roman)\n    else:\n        # Convert decimal_value to base b\n        result = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, int(b))\n        print(result)\n\nBut need to define the functions decimal_to_roman and decimal_to_base.\n\nWait, but what if the decimal_value is zero? For example, if c is '0' in base a, then decimal_value is zero. Then, when converting to base b, the code returns '0'.\n\nNow, the functions:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, s) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += s\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\nBut wait, the code for converting c to decimal may have a problem if the input is very long. But given that Python can handle big integers, it's okay.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFor example, the first sample input is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\ndecimal_value is 1. Then converted to base 2: 1. Output is '1'.\n\nAnother sample input is 16 R\\n5. The decimal value is 5, converted to Roman is 'V'.\n\nThird sample: 5 R\\n4. The decimal value is 4. Roman is 'IV'.\n\nFourth sample: 2 2\\n1111001. The decimal value is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0. Let's calculate:\n\n2^6 is 64, 2^5 is 32, 2^4 is 16, 2^3 is 8, then 0, 0, 1. Sum: 64+32=96 +16=112 +8=120 +1=121. Then converting to base 2 again gives 1111001. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: 12 13\\nA. The decimal value is 10. Converting to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. So output is 'A'.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in the output?\n\nFor example, if the decimal is 0, output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting 0 to base 10, output is '0'.\n\nBut what if the decimal is zero and the base is 10, but the code returns '0' which is correct.\n\nAnother case: converting 10 to base 10, returns '10'.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in the input c? For example, input c is '001' in base 2. The code converts it to decimal as 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code handles leading zeros correctly.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal is zero and the base is R? According to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed not to be zero in that case. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, code for the functions.\n\nNow, the code for the main function. Also, need to make sure that when the decimal value is zero, the code returns '0' when converting to base b.\n\nBut what if the input is '0' in base a, and the output is base b. For example, a=10, b=10, c=0. Output is '0'.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut the code must read from stdin and output to stdout. Also, the code must handle multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. First line has a and b. Second line has c. So the code must process one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking back, the sample input is given as a list of inputs and outputs. For example, the first sample input is ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', ...], but that's probably the list of test cases provided for the example. But the actual program must read one test case per run.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. So the code should process one test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. But perhaps that's just for the example. So the code should process one input, not multiple.\n\nSo the code reads two lines from stdin, processes them, and outputs the answer.\n\nSo the code is written as follows.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases. But that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple examples, but the actual code should read one input.\n\nSo the code is written for one input.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, s) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += s\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    a_and_b = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(a_and_b[0])\n    b = a_and_b[1]\n    c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    decimal_value = 0\n    for ch in c:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        decimal_value = decimal_value * a + digit\n    \n    # Process based on b\n    if b == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\n    else:\n        base = int(b)\n        print(decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, it's a non-negative integer, so it's not empty. Also, the problem says that the input c may have leading zeros but not empty.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nFor example, the first sample input:\n\nInput line 1: '10 2'\n\nInput line 2: '1'\n\ndecimal_value is 1. Converted to base 2 is '1'.\n\nSecond sample input line 1: '16 R', line 2: '5' → decimal is 5 → Roman is 'V'.\n\nThird sample input line 1: '5 R', line 2: '4' → decimal is 4 → Roman is 'IV'.\n\nFourth sample input line 1: '2 2', line 2: '1111001' → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nFifth sample input line 1: '12 13', line 2: 'A' → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about when the input is zero?\n\nFor example, input:\n\na=10, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=2, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nWhat about when converting to base 16?\n\nFor example, decimal is 255 → converted to base 16 is 'FF'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: decimal is 10, base 16 → 'A'.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, what about when the input is a very long string, like 1000 characters. But since Python can handle big integers, the code should work.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where the input c is '0' in base a, and output is base b. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when the decimal value is zero and the output is Roman. But according to the problem statement, this case is not present.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 25, and the decimal is 25. Then 25 in base 25 is '10' (since 1*25 + 0).\n\nSo code returns '10'.\n\nAnother case: decimal is 30, base 25 → 1*25 +5 → '15'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, check the code for the case when the input c is '0' and a is 10, and b is 2. The code returns '0'.\n\nAnother case: when the input is '000' in base 10. It's converted to 0, output is '0'.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another specified base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer, and then converting this decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in a specific base `a`. We convert this number to a decimal integer by processing each digit of the input string.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - If the target base is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a standard mapping of values to symbols.\n   - Otherwise, convert the decimal integer to the specified base using repeated division and modulus operations, handling digits greater than 9 with alphabetic characters (A, B, etc.).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, s) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += s\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    a_and_b = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(a_and_b[0])\n    b = a_and_b[1]\n    c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    decimal_value = 0\n    for ch in c:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        decimal_value = decimal_value * a + digit\n    \n    if b == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\n    else:\n        base = int(b)\n        print(decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains the original base `a` and the target base or 'R' for Roman numerals. The second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: Each digit of the input number is processed to convert it into a decimal integer. This is done by iterating through each character of the input string and calculating its value based on the original base.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - **Roman Numerals Conversion**: Using a list of value-symbol pairs, the decimal number is repeatedly divided by the largest possible values to construct the Roman numeral string.\n   - **Base Conversion**: The decimal number is converted to the target base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then converted to appropriate characters (digits or letters).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion process and ensures correct formatting for both numerical bases and Roman numerals.",
