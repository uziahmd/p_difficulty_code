Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (which is 1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I need to think about the approach. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, 3, maybe we can handle each weight category separately. For example, for items with weight 1, we can take as many as possible, but since they might have varying costs, we should sort them in descending order of cost and take the top ones. Same for weight 2 and 3.\n\nBut how do we combine them optimally? Because taking a certain number of weight 2 items might be better than taking some weight 1 items, depending on their cost per unit weight. But since the weights are small, perhaps we can use dynamic programming, but with the constraints of the problem.\n\nWait, but with m up to 3e5 and n up to 1e5, a standard knapsack approach (like O(nm)) would be too slow. So we need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet me think: since all items are of weight 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can process each group and then find the optimal combination of counts from each group.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weight: w1, w2, w3.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost. This way, for each group, we can take the top k items for any k.\n\n3. Then, for each possible number of weight 3 items taken (say, x), we can compute how many weight 2 and 1 items can be taken with the remaining weight. However, trying all possible x might be feasible since the maximum number of weight 3 items is up to m//3, which could be up to 1e5. But combining that with considering weight 2 and 1 items might be computationally heavy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute prefix sums for each group. Let's say:\n\nFor group 1 (weight 1), we have a prefix sum array where prefix1[k] is the maximum cost of taking k items from group 1.\n\nSimilarly for group 2 (prefix2[k] for taking k items of weight 2), and group 3 (prefix3[k] for taking k items of weight 3).\n\nOnce we have these prefix arrays, the problem reduces to finding the best combination of a, b, c such that 1*a + 2*b + 3*c ≤ m, and the total cost is prefix1[a] + prefix2[b] + prefix3[c].\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the optimal a, b, c?\n\nAnother approach: since the weights are small, perhaps for each possible number of weight 3 items (c), we can compute the maximum possible for the remaining weight (m - 3c) using the weight 1 and 2 items. But even then, for each c, we need to find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute that quickly?\n\nLet me think about the case of combining weight 1 and 2 items. Suppose we have a total weight capacity left as W. How to select the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nLet me think of this as a separate problem. Let's say we have two groups: items of weight 1 (sorted in descending order) and items of weight 2 (sorted in descending order). We need to choose some number of each to maximize the total cost, with total weight <= W.\n\nThis seems like a classic unbounded knapsack problem but with limited items. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible number of weight 2 items (say, b), the maximum number of weight 1 items (a) that can fit in W - 2b. But since the number of weight 2 items can be up to min(len(w2), W//2), this could be manageable if we precompute the prefix sums.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Precompute prefix sums for each group (w1, w2, w3).\n\n- For each possible number of weight 3 items (c) (from 0 to max_c = min(len(w3), m//3)), compute the remaining weight as rem = m - 3*c. Then, compute the maximum value obtainable from weight 1 and 2 items with total weight <= rem. Then, add the prefix3[c] to that value and keep track of the maximum overall.\n\nThe key is how to compute the maximum value for the weight 1 and 2 items given a certain rem.\n\nTo compute",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry given a weight constraint. The souvenirs have weights of 1, 2, or 3, and we can leverage this structure to optimize our solution.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Group Items by Weight**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. **Sort and Compute Prefix Sums**: For each group, sort items in descending order of cost and compute prefix sums. This helps quickly determine the maximum cost for selecting any number of items from that group.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Counts of Weight 3 Items**: Since weight 3 items are the heaviest, iterate over all possible counts of these items (from 0 to the maximum number that fits within the weight limit). For each count, calculate the remaining weight capacity.\n\n4. **Maximize Value from Weight 1 and 2 Items**: For the remaining weight after using some weight 3 items, find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fit within the remaining capacity using precomputed prefix sums.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    w1 = []\n    w2 = []\n    w3 = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        wi = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ci = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        if wi == 1:\n            w1.append(ci)\n        elif wi == 2:\n            w2.append(ci)\n        else:\n            w3.append(ci)\n\n    # Sort each list in descending order\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Compute prefix sums\n    def get_prefix(arr):\n        res = [0]\n        for x in arr:\n            res.append(res[-1] + x)\n        return res\n\n    prefix1 = get_prefix(w1)\n    prefix2 = get_prefix(w2)\n    prefix3 = get_prefix(w3)\n\n    max_total = 0\n\n    # Try all possible numbers of weight 3 items\n    max_c = min(len(w3), m // 3)\n    for c in range(0, max_c + 1):\n        weight_used = 3 * c\n        rem = m - weight_used\n        if rem < 0:\n            continue\n\n        # Now solve for weight 1 and 2 with rem weight\n        # Try all possible b (number of weight 2 items)\n        max_b = min(len(w2), rem // 2)\n        best = 0\n        for b in range(0, max_b + 1):\n            weight_b = 2 * b\n            a_max = rem - weight_b\n            a = min(len(w1), a_max)\n            current = prefix1[a] + prefix2[b]\n            if current > best:\n                best = current\n        total = prefix3[c] + best\n        if total > max_total:\n            max_total = total\n\n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Grouping and Sorting**: We group the items by their weight and sort them in descending order of cost. This allows us to take the most valuable items first.\n  \n- **Prefix Sums**: These arrays store cumulative costs for taking up to `k` items from each group. This allows O(1) lookup when evaluating combinations.\n\n- **Iterating Over Weight 3 Items**: For each possible number of weight 3 items, we compute how much weight remains and then evaluate the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items that can be carried within the remaining capacity.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently explore all viable combinations while keeping the complexity manageable due to the small weight values (1, 2, 3).",
