Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. Each takes exactly n moves, and the order of taking digits depends on the sequence of H and M. The challenge is to find the optimal sequence of moves.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to model this. Since each move is taking the leftmost digit, the order in which they take the digits determines their numbers. The key is to choose for each step whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit, such that the total sum is maximized.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the total number of possible sequences is C(2n, n), which for n=18 is 18 choose 9 = 48620. Wait, but 2n is 36, so 36 choose 18 is around 9e10. That's way too big for brute force. So we need a dynamic programming approach here.\n\nWait, but what's the state here? Let's think. At any point, the number of digits taken by Homer and Marge must be such that Homer has taken h steps and Marge has taken m steps. Since each step is taking one digit, the total steps taken is h + m. The initial state is h=0, m=0. The final state is h=n, m=n.\n\nAt each step, the next digit to take is the first digit of the current A. But since the digits are being taken from the front, the current state can be represented by how many digits have been taken so far. For example, if we have taken k digits, then the next digit is the (k+1)th digit of the original A. Wait, but the original A is being modified as digits are taken. So the current state can be determined by how many digits have been taken so far. Because the digits taken are the first k digits. So the remaining digits are A[k:].\n\nSo the state can be represented by (h, m), where h is the number of digits Homer has taken, m is the number of digits Marge has taken. The total digits taken is h + m = k. So the next digit is A[k], and the next step is to decide whether Homer or Marge takes it. But for each state (h, m), the next possible steps are:\n\n- If h < n: Homer can take the next digit, leading to state (h+1, m)\n- If m < n: Marge can take the next digit, leading to state (h, m+1)\n\nThe problem is to find the sequence of choices (H or M) that maximizes the total sum of S1 and S2.\n\nBut how do we model the sum? Because the sum depends on the digits each player collects. For example, when Homer takes a digit, it contributes to S1. Similarly for Marge. However, the value of S1 and S2 depends on the order in which digits are added. For instance, taking a digit earlier adds it to the higher position (like thousands, hundreds, etc.) in the number. So, the value of the digits depends on their position in the player's number. \n\nWait, the problem says that each time a player takes a digit, it is appended to their number. So, for example, if Homer takes digits in order 1, then 2, then his number is 12. So the first digit he takes is the most significant digit. So the value of his number is the sum of digit_i * 10^{n - 1 - i}, where i is the order of taking. Wait, but since he takes exactly n digits, the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc.\n\nBut when considering the total sum S1 + S2, each digit's contribution depends on when it was taken. For example, if a digit d is taken by Homer as his k-th move (k ranges from 1 to n), then it contributes d * 10^{n - k} to S1. Similarly for Marge's digits.\n\nBut how can we model this in DP? Because for each state (h, m), we need to track the current contribution of the digits taken so far. But with n up to 18, and h and m up to 18, the state space is 19*19 = 361. However, the contribution of the digits can be very large. For example, each digit is up to 9, and multiplied by 10^something. For n=18, the maximum contribution per digit is 9*10^17. So even for two players, the total sum could be up to 2*9*10^17 * 18, which is way beyond the capacity of standard integers. But since Python handles big integers, perhaps that's manageable.\n\nBut tracking the sum directly in the DP state would be impossible because the sum is too big, and the state space would be too large. However, maybe we can find a way to compute the optimal choice without tracking the sum, but instead making decisions based on the current digits and the positions they will contribute to.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each state (h, m), which represents that Homer has taken h digits and Marge has taken m digits, the next digit is the (h+m)th digit in the original string. Let's call this digit d. Now, the decision is whether to take it as Homer's next digit (if h < n) or Marge's next digit (if m < n). \n\nThe contribution of this digit depends on the position in which it is added. For example, if Homer takes this digit now, it will be his (h+1)th digit, which contributes d * 10^{n - (h+1)} to the total sum. Similarly, if Marge takes it, it contributes d * 10^{n - (m+1)} to the total sum.\n\nTherefore, for each state (h, m), the choice between H and M depends on which option gives a higher contribution. However, since the future choices also affect the total sum, we need to consider the optimal choice at each step.\n\nThis seems like a classic dynamic programming problem where the state is (h, m), and the value stored is the maximum total sum achievable from that state onwards. Then, for each state, we can compute the maximum by choosing the best possible next move.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let dp[h][m] be the maximum total sum achievable when Homer has already taken h digits and Marge has taken m digits. The current position in the original string is k = h + m. The next digit to take is A[k]. \n\nIf we choose Homer to take it (if h < n), then the contribution of this digit is d * 10^{n - h - 1} (since this is Homer's (h+1)th digit, and the exponent is n - (h+1) = n - h - 1). Then, we add this to the dp value of the next state (h+1, m). Similarly for Marge.\n\nSo the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[h][m] = max(\n    (if h < n: d * 10^{n - h -1} + dp[h+1][m]),\n    (if m < n: d * 10^{n - m -1} + dp[h][m+1])\n)\n\nThe base case is when h = n and m = n. Then, dp[n][n] = 0.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the maximum exponent is 18 - 0 -1 = 17, which is manageable. However, the problem is that for each state, we have to calculate the value of the digit multiplied by 10^something, and then add the DP value of the next state.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nWe can precompute the powers of 10 up to 10^18, since for n up to 18, the exponents can be up to 17 (for when h is 0, and the first digit is taken by Homer, contributing 10^{n-1}).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the powers of 10 up to 10^18.\n\n2. Use memoization (recursive DP with memo) or iterative DP to compute the maximum sum for each state (h, m).\n\n3. Once the DP table is filled, we need to reconstruct the path (sequence of H and M) that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nBut for n=18, the DP table is 19x19, which is manageable. Each state can be computed in O(1) time, so the total time complexity is O(n^2) = 361 steps.\n\nNow, the key is to compute the DP and track the choices made.\n\nBut how to handle the memoization. Let's think about using memoization with recursion. However, for Python, even with memoization, recursion depth could be a problem. Alternatively, we can use iterative DP, filling the table in bottom-up manner.\n\nLet me think about the order of filling the DP table. Since the state (h, m) depends on states (h+1, m) and (h, m+1), we can process the states in reverse order. For example, starting from h + m = 2n - 1 (but wait, when h + m = 2n, it's the end. So the maximum h + m is 2n, which is when h = n and m = n. So the states can be processed in order of decreasing (h + m). For example, for each k from 2n down to 0, we process all (h, m) pairs where h + m = k.\n\nBut for each (h, m), we can compute dp[h][m] based on the next states. For example, when k = h + m, the next step would be to take the k-th digit (assuming 0-based index?), but need to check the original input.\n\nWait, the original A is a string of 2n digits. Let's say the digits are stored as a list, with indices 0 to 2n-1. For a state (h, m), the number of digits taken so far is h + m. Therefore, the next digit is A[h + m], which is the (h + m)-th digit (0-based). So for example, when h = 0, m = 0, the next digit is A[0].\n\nSo, the DP for (h, m) is computed based on the digit A[h + m].\n\nSo, for each state (h, m), the next digit is A[k], where k = h + m.\n\nSo, the steps for the DP:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (n+1). The value dp[h][m] represents the maximum total sum achievable from this state onwards.\n\nThe base case is dp[n][n] = 0.\n\nFor other states, we compute dp[h][m] as follows:\n\nIf h < n and m < n: we can choose either H or M, whichever gives higher value.\n\nIf only h < n: must choose H.\n\nIf only m < n: must choose M.\n\nSo, for each state (h, m), we check which options are available.\n\nNow, for the transitions:\n\ndigit = A[k], where k = h + m.\n\nIf we choose H (h < n):\n\ncontribution = digit * 10^(n - h - 1) + dp[h+1][m]\n\nIf we choose M (m < n):\n\ncontribution = digit * 10^(n - m - 1) + dp[h][m+1]\n\nWe take the maximum between these options (if both are available).\n\nOnce the DP table is filled, we can reconstruct the path by starting from (0, 0) and at each step choosing the option (H or M) that leads to the maximum value.\n\nBut how to reconstruct the path? For that, during the DP computation, we can also keep track of the choice made at each state (h, m). So, we can have another 2D array, say, choice[h][m], which stores 'H' or 'M' indicating which choice was taken to reach the maximum value.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and A.\n\nPrecompute pow10[i] = 10^i for i from 0 to 18.\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of (n+1) x (n+1), filled with 0.\n\nInitialize choice as a 2D array of (n+1) x (n+1), filled with empty strings or some default.\n\nThen, fill the dp table in reverse order. For example, for k from 2n-1 down to 0:\n\nWait, the total steps for h and m is from 0 to 2n. But for each state (h, m), h + m can range from 0 to 2n. However, since the maximum h and m can be n, the valid states are those where h <= n, m <=n, and h + m <= 2n. But since h and m can't exceed n, the maximum h + m is 2n (when h = n, m = n).\n\nSo, for the DP, we can iterate over h and m in such a way that h + m is processed in decreasing order. For example, for each possible value of k = h + m, starting from 2n down to 0. For each k, iterate through all possible h and m where h + m = k, and h <=n, m <=n.\n\nBut how to generate these h and m pairs? For each k from 2n down to 0:\n\nfor h in range( max(0, k - n), min(n, k) + 1 ):\n\n    m = k - h\n\n    if m > n: continue\n\n    process (h, m)\n\nBut perhaps for each k in range(2n, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in 0 ... n:\n\n        m = k - h\n\n        if m is between 0 and n, then process (h, m)\n\nBut for each k, the possible h ranges from max(0, k - n) to min(n, k). Because m = k - h must be >= 0 and <=n. So, for example, if k is larger than n, then m = k - h must be <=n. So h >= k - n.\n\nBut regardless, for each k from 2n down to 0, we can process the states (h, m) where h + m = k.\n\nOnce that is done, for each state (h, m), we compute the dp value.\n\nOnce the dp table is filled, we can reconstruct the path.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nFirst, read n and A. For example, input is n, then A as a string.\n\nThen, precompute the pow10 array. Since the maximum exponent needed is 18-1=17 (for n=18, when h=0, the first digit taken by Homer would contribute 10^(18-0-1) = 10^17).\n\nBut for each digit, when it's taken as the (h+1)th digit by Homer, the exponent is (n - h - 1). Similarly for Marge.\n\nSo, pow10 needs to be up to 10^(n-1). For n up to 18, that's 10^17.\n\nSo, precompute pow10 as [10**i for i in range(0, n)] ?\n\nWait, for example, if n is 2, then the exponents can be up to 2 - 0 -1 = 1. So 10^0, 10^1.\n\nSo, for general n, the maximum exponent is (n-1). So, we can precompute pow10 up to (n-1) exponents.\n\nBut for each digit, when it is taken by Homer as his (h+1)th move, the exponent is (n - (h+1)) = n - h -1. So, for h ranging from 0 to n-1, that exponent ranges from (n - 1) down to 0. So, the maximum exponent is (n-1). Therefore, precomputing pow10 up to (n-1) is sufficient.\n\nSo, in code:\n\npow10 = [1] * (n)\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nWait, but pow10[0] is 1 (10^0), pow10[1] is 10^1, etc. So for exponent e, the value is pow10[e].\n\nWait, perhaps better to precompute pow10 as [10^i for i in 0..n], but for n up to 18, that's manageable.\n\nOnce that's done, proceed with the DP.\n\nNow, for the DP table:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of (n+1) x (n+1). Since n can be up to 18, this is manageable.\n\nThen, for each state (h, m), compute dp[h][m] as follows.\n\nLet me think of the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\n\npow10 = [1] * (n)\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nBut wait, for exponents up to n-1, the pow10 array needs to have length n. For example, pow10[0] is 10^0 = 1, pow10[1] is 10^1, ..., pow10[n-1] is 10^{n-1}.\n\nBut for the case where a digit is taken as the first digit by Homer (h=0), then the exponent is n - 0 -1 = n-1, which is pow10[n-1].\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the DP:\n\nWe can create a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1). Let's use a list of lists.\n\ndp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nchoice = [[None]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nThen, for k in range(2*n, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in range(0, n+1):\n\n        m = k - h\n\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # process (h, m)\n\n        if h == n and m == n:\n\n            continue # already initialized to 0\n\n        current_digit = A[k] # since k = h + m, and the next digit is A[k]\n\n        # but wait, the original A is 2n digits. So when k is h + m, the next digit is A[k], but when k is up to 2n-1?\n\n        # For example, when h + m is 0, then the next digit is A[0]. When h + m is 2n - 1, then the next digit is A[2n -1]. Then, when h + m is 2n, it's the end.\n\n        # So for the state (h, m), the next digit is A[k], where k = h + m. But when h + m = 2n, then it's the end state (h = n, m = n). So for the processing of (h, m), we need to check if h + m is less than 2n.\n\n        # So during the processing of (h, m), k = h + m. So when k is 2n, it's the end state. So for the code above, when k is 2n, then h and m must be n and n. Which is the base case.\n\n        # So for the current state (h, m), we need to process when k = h + m < 2n. Otherwise, it's the end.\n\n        # So in code, for each (h, m) pair, check if k = h + m < 2n.\n\n        # So, in the code, after getting m, check if k = h + m < 2n.\n\n        # So:\n\n        k_val = h + m\n\n        if k_val >= 2*n:\n\n            continue # already handled\n\n        digit = int(A[k_val])\n\n        # Now, decide which options are available.\n\n        # Possible options: H or M.\n\n        # For H: only if h < n.\n\n        # For M: only if m < n.\n\n        # Compute the possible values.\n\n        max_val = -1\n\n        best_choice = ''\n\n        # Try H if possible.\n\n        if h < n:\n\n            # Take H: contribution is digit * 10^{n - h -1} + dp[h+1][m]\n\n            contribution_h = digit * pow10[n - h -1] + dp[h+1][m]\n\n            if contribution_h > max_val:\n\n                max_val = contribution_h\n\n                best_choice = 'H'\n\n        # Try M if possible.\n\n        if m < n:\n\n            contribution_m = digit * pow10[n - m -1] + dp[h][m+1]\n\n            if contribution_m > max_val:\n\n                max_val = contribution_m\n\n                best_choice = 'M'\n\n        # Assign the dp value and the choice.\n\n        dp[h][m] = max_val\n\n        choice[h][m] = best_choice\n\nWait, but this code has a problem. The pow10 array is precomputed up to n-1. For example, when n is 2, pow10 has 2 elements: 10^0 and 10^1. For n - h -1, when h is 0, n - h -1 = 2 -0 -1 = 1, which is okay. But when h is 1, n - h -1 is 0. So yes, the pow10 array is correct.\n\nBut wait, pow10 is of size n. For example, pow10[0] is 10^0, pow10[1] is 10^1, ..., pow10[n-1] is 10^{n-1}.\n\nBut when n - h -1 can be up to n-1, which is covered by the pow10 array.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nOnce the dp table is filled, then we can reconstruct the path.\n\nReconstruction:\n\nStart at h=0, m=0. For each step, look at choice[h][m], append 'H' or 'M' accordingly, and increment h or m accordingly.\n\nFor example:\n\nresult = []\n\nh = 0\n\nm = 0\n\nwhile h + m < 2*n:\n\n    c = choice[h][m]\n\n    result.append(c)\n\n    if c == 'H':\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        m += 1\n\nThen, the result is the sequence of moves.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple choices with the same maximum value? The problem says to output any of them. So the code as written will choose the first one encountered (H or M, depending on which is checked first). For example, in the code above, if H and M give the same contribution, the code will choose H, since it checks H first. However, the problem allows any of the correct sequences. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut in the code above, the 'best_choice' is set to 'H' if H is possible and gives the maximum. Then, if M gives the same value, it will be replaced by 'M' only if contribution_m is greater than the current max_val. But if they are equal, then the code would not change the best_choice. So in that case, the code would prefer H. However, the problem allows any correct choice, so this is acceptable.\n\nBut in the sample input, for example, the first input is:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\nThe output is HHMM.\n\nLet me see what the code would generate.\n\nLet me try to simulate.\n\nBut perhaps that's tedious. However, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the pow10 array is precomputed as [10^0, 10^1, ... 10^{n-1}].\n\nBut for n=2, pow10 has length 2. For example, pow10[0] = 1, pow10[1] = 10.\n\nNow, when h=0, and the digit is taken by Homer, the contribution is digit * 10^{n - h -1} = digit * 10^{2 - 0 -1} = digit * 10^1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses pow10[n - h -1]. But when n - h -1 could be negative? No. Because h can be up to n-1. For example, if h = n-1, then n - h -1 = 0. So it's okay.\n\nNow, the code for the DP.\n\nBut in Python, when you have a 2D list, and you're filling it in a certain order, how to process the states.\n\nThe code for filling the DP:\n\nfor k in range(2*n -1, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in range(0, n+1):\n\n        m = k - h\n\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # process (h, m)\n\nBut perhaps the loop should iterate through all possible (h, m) pairs where h + m = k. So the code may need to be adjusted.\n\nWait, the previous code outline had:\n\nfor k in range(2n, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in ...:\n\n        m = k - h\n\n        if m is between 0 and n, process (h, m)\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nfor k in range(2 * n -1, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in range(0, n +1):\n\n        m = k - h\n\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # process (h, m)\n\nBut for k in range(2n, -1, -1), but 2n is the maximum possible sum of h + m. However, when k = 2n, then h can be n and m = n. But in the code, when k = 2n, then h can be from 0 to n, and m = k - h = 2n - h. For m to be <=n, 2n - h <=n => h >=n. But h can be at most n. So h =n, m=2n -n =n. So only (n, n) is processed. But since dp[n][n] is initialized to 0, and we don't process it again. So perhaps the code should start from k = 2n -1 down to 0.\n\nSo the correct loop is:\n\nfor k in range(2 * n - 1, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in range(0, n + 1):\n\n        m = k - h\n\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # process (h, m)\n\nBut in this case, for each (h, m) where h + m =k, and k ranges from 2n-1 down to 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting this together into code.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, read A.\n\nprecompute pow10.\n\ninitialize dp and choice.\n\nfill dp and choice.\n\nreconstruct the path.\n\nBut in Python, for pow10, since n can be up to 18, pow10 can be precomputed as:\n\npow10 = [1] * n\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nWait, but for i from 1 to n-1, because pow10 has length n. So for example, pow10[0] is 1, pow10[1] is 10, ..., pow10[n-1] is 10^{n-1}.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for n=1, the pow10 array is [1], and for exponents 0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nOnce the dp is filled, the path can be reconstructed.\n\nBut what about when the code tries to access dp[h+1][m] or dp[h][m+1]? Those states have already been processed, since we are processing the states in order of decreasing k. For example, when processing (h, m) with k = h + m, the next states (h+1, m) and (h, m+1) have k+1 = (h+1) + m = h + m + 1, which is larger than the current k. Since we are processing in order of decreasing k, the next states have already been processed. Therefore, their dp values are already computed.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2\n\nA=1234\n\nSample Output: HHMM.\n\nLet's see what the code would generate.\n\npow10 for n=2 is [1, 10].\n\nProcessing for k from 3 down to 0.\n\nLet's think about the states:\n\nFor k=3 (h + m = 3). The possible (h, m) pairs are:\n\nh can be 2, m = 1 (since 2 +1 =3)\n\nh can be 1, m=2 (1+2=3)\n\nh can be 3, but m = 0. But since n=2, h can't be 3. So only (2,1) and (1,2).\n\nFor (2,1):\n\nh=2 (max n is 2), m=1 <2. So possible to take M.\n\ndigit is A[3] = '4'.\n\ncontribution for M is 4 * 10^{2 - 1 -1} = 4 * 10^0 = 4. Then, dp[2][2] is 0. So total is 4 + 0 =4.\n\nSo dp[2][1] = 4, choice is 'M'.\n\nSimilarly for (1, 2): h=1 <2, m=2 (max). So must take H. digit is A[3] =4. contribution is 4 * 10^{2 -1 -1} = 4 * 1 =4. So dp[1][2] =4, choice 'H'.\n\nThen, for k=2:\n\npossible (h, m) pairs:\n\nh + m =2. h can be 0, m=2 (but m can't be more than n=2. So m=2 is allowed. h=0, m=2: but m=2 is allowed. So for (0,2): m is 2, which is equal to n=2. So can't take M. Only take H.\n\ndigit is A[2] = '3'.\n\ncontribution is 3 * 10^{2 -0 -1} = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then, dp[1][2] is 4. So total is 30 +4 =34. So dp[0][2] =34, choice 'H'.\n\nOther pairs: h=1, m=1: sum is 2. h=1 <2, m=1 <2. So can choose H or M.\n\ndigit is A[2] =3.\n\nFor H: contribution is 3 * 10^{2 -1 -1} = 3*1 =3. Then, dp[2][1] is 4. Total is 3 +4 =7.\n\nFor M: contribution is 3 * 10^{2 -1 -1} = 3*1 =3. Then, dp[1][2] is 4. Total is 3 +4=7. So both options are same. The code will choose 'H' first, so choice is 'H'.\n\nSo dp[1][1] =7, choice 'H'.\n\nAnother pair: h=2, m=0: sum 2. h=2 (max), m=0 <2. So must take M. digit is A[2] =3. contribution is 3 * 10^{2 -0 -1} = 3*10^1 =30. Then, dp[2][1] is 4. So total 30 +4=34. So dp[2][0] =34, choice 'M'.\n\nThen for k=1:\n\nh + m =1.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nh=0, m=1.\n\nh=1, m=0.\n\nFor (0,1):\n\ndigit is A[1] =2.\n\ncan choose H or M.\n\nh=0 <2, m=1 <2.\n\nFor H: contribution is 2 * 10^{2 -0 -1} = 2 *10^1 =20. Then, dp[1][1] is 7. total 20+7=27.\n\nFor M: contribution is 2 * 10^{2 -1 -1} = 2*1 =2. Then, dp[0][2] is 34. total 2+34=36. So choose M, which is higher. So dp[0][1] =36, choice 'M'.\n\nFor (1,0):\n\ndigit is A[1] =2.\n\ncan choose H or M.\n\nh=1 <2, m=0 <2.\n\nFor H: contribution is 2 * 10^{2-1-1} = 2*1 =2. Then, dp[2][0] is 34. total 2+34=36.\n\nFor M: contribution is 2 * 10^{2 -0 -1} = 2*10^1=20. Then, dp[1][1] is 7. total 20 +7=27. So choose H. So dp[1][0] =36, choice 'H'.\n\nThen for k=0:\n\nh=0, m=0.\n\ndigit is A[0] =1.\n\ncan choose H or M.\n\nFor H: contribution is 1 * 10^{2-0-1} = 1 *10^1 =10. Then, dp[1][0] is 36. total 10 +36 =46.\n\nFor M: contribution is 1 * 10^{2 -0 -1} = 1 *10^1=10. Then, dp[0][1] is 36. total 10+36=46. So same value. The code will choose 'H' first, so choice is 'H'.\n\nThus, dp[0][0] =46, choice 'H'.\n\nNow, reconstructing the path.\n\nStart at (0,0), choice 'H' → h becomes 1, m=0.\n\nNext state (1, 0). choice is 'H' → h becomes 2, m=0.\n\nNext state (2, 0). choice is 'M' → m becomes 1.\n\nNext state (2, 1). choice is 'M' → m becomes 2.\n\nSo the sequence is H, H, M, M → 'HHMM', which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for this case.\n\nAnother sample input is ['2\\n9911'] → output is 'HMHM'.\n\nLet's see. n=2, A=9911.\n\nThe code would generate:\n\nLet me try to simulate the steps.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to trust the code once it's written. But the code should handle that.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the pow10 correctly. For example, when n=1, pow10 is [1], which is 10^0. For n=1, when a digit is taken as the first (and only) digit by Homer, the exponent is n - h -1 = 1 - 0 -1 = 0 → 10^0 =1. Correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: the pow10 array is of size n. For example, when n=18, the pow10 array has 18 elements, indexes 0 to 17. For exponents up to 17. Which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the code in Python.\n\nBut note that for the pow10 array, the code is:\n\npow10 = [1] * n\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nWait, but for n=1, the loop runs from 1 to n-1=0, which is not executed. So pow10 remains [1], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, A.\n\nThen:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nThen, precompute pow10:\n\npow10 = [1] * n\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nBut wait, for n=0? But n is at least 1.\n\nThen, initialize dp and choice:\n\ndp =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a number A, where each player takes exactly n digits, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers formed by these digits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a DP table where `dp[h][m]` represents the maximum total prize achievable when Homer has taken `h` digits and Marge has taken `m` digits.\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: Since the value of each digit depends on its position in the number, precompute powers of 10 up to `10^(n-1)` to efficiently calculate the contribution of each digit when it is taken.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each state `(h, m)`, determine whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit based on which choice yields a higher total prize. This decision is made by evaluating the contribution of the current digit to the total prize if taken by either player.\n4. **Reconstruct Path**: After filling the DP table, reconstruct the sequence of moves by backtracking from the initial state `(0, 0)` using the choices recorded during the DP transitions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1].strip()\n    \n    # Precompute powers of 10\n    pow10 = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n    \n    # Initialize DP table and choice table\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    choice = [['']*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    # Fill DP table in reverse order\n    for k in range(2*n - 1, -1, -1):\n        for h in range(n+1):\n            m = k - h\n            if m < 0 or m > n:\n                continue\n            # Check if this state is already the end\n            if h == n and m == n:\n                continue\n            # Current digit\n            current_digit = int(A[k])\n            max_val = -1\n            best_c = ''\n            # Try Homer's move\n            if h < n:\n                contribution = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] + dp[h+1][m]\n                if contribution > max_val:\n                    max_val = contribution\n                    best_c = 'H'\n            # Try Marge's move\n            if m < n:\n                contribution = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] + dp[h][m+1]\n                if contribution > max_val:\n                    max_val = contribution\n                    best_c = 'M'\n            dp[h][m] = max_val\n            choice[h][m] = best_c\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path\n    res = []\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        c = choice[h][m]\n        res.append(c)\n        if c == 'H':\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            m += 1\n    print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to get the integer `n` and the string `A`.\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: This helps in quickly calculating the positional value of each digit when forming the numbers for Homer and Marge.\n3. **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized to store the maximum total prize from each state `(h, m)`. The `choice` table keeps track of whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit at each state.\n4. **Filling DP Table**: The DP table is filled in reverse order (from the end state back to the start) to ensure that each state's value is computed based on previously computed states.\n5. **Path Reconstruction**: Starting from the initial state `(0, 0)`, the sequence of moves is reconstructed by following the choices stored in the `choice` table, ensuring the optimal sequence of moves is determined.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal sequence using dynamic programming, ensuring both correctness and performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
