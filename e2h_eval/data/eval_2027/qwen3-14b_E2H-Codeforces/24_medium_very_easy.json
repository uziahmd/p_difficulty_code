She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem says that each second she can move left or right, or close tabs on one side. So, the goal is to figure out the optimal steps.\n\nFirst, let's understand the scenario. The initial state has all tabs open from 1 to n. But after closing some tabs, the a and b (the min and max of the remaining tabs) change. But maybe for this problem, since we need to end up with exactly [l, r], maybe we can think about the steps required to close tabs outside this range.\n\nWait, but the closing operations can be done in any order. However, the key is that when you close tabs, the a and b adjust. For example, if you close tabs to the left of the current position, then the new a becomes the current tab's index, but only if there are tabs left. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to first close all tabs to the left of l, and then close all tabs to the right of r. Or maybe do it in another order. But how?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. Let's consider the positions of pos relative to l and r.\n\nCase 1: The current pos is already within [l, r]. Then, perhaps we need to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. But how?\n\nBut to close tabs to the left of l, Luba needs to move her cursor to l, then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to move to r, then close all tabs to the right. But how long does that take?\n\nWait, but when you close tabs, the a and b change. For example, suppose she closes all tabs to the left of l. Then, the new a is l. Similarly, after closing tabs to the right of r, the new b is r. But during the process, the movement steps need to be calculated.\n\nBut maybe the minimal steps can be determined by considering the positions of the cursor and the positions of l and r.\n\nLet me think of the example given. For the first input:\n\n6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The desired tabs are 2,3,4. So the initial tabs are 1-6. She needs to close 1,5,6.\n\nIn the example explanation, she moves to tab 2 (from 3, which takes 1 second?), closes left (which would close tab 1). Then moves to 3 (maybe 1 sec?), then to 4 (another sec), then closes right (closing 5 and 6). So total steps: moving from 3 to 2 (1 sec), close left (1 sec). Then move to 3 (1 sec?), move to 4 (another sec?), close right (1 sec). That totals 1+1 + 1+1 +1 = 5 seconds. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Move to l (if needed), then close left. Then move to r (if needed), then close right. But maybe there are other possibilities.\n\nAnother example is when the current pos is already in [l, r], and l is 1, r is n. Then no steps needed.\n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nLet me think about the steps required.\n\nFirst, we need to close all tabs to the left of l. To do that, Luba must be at l, and then perform a close-left operation. Similarly, to close all tabs to the right of r, she must be at r and perform a close-right operation.\n\nBut what if l is 1? Then there are no tabs to the left of l, so no need to close. Similarly for r = n.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nIf l > 1: need to close left. So steps to move to l, then close left.\n\nIf r < n: need to close right. Steps to move to r, then close right.\n\nBut wait, the movement steps depend on the current position. For example, if the initial pos is already at l, then moving takes zero steps. But if the initial pos is to the right of l, then moving left to l requires (pos - l) steps. Or if pos is to the left of l, then moving right to l requires (l - pos) steps.\n\nBut wait, the movement is allowed step by step. So moving from pos to l takes |pos - l| steps. Then, closing left takes 1 second. Similarly for moving to r and closing right.\n\nBut what if the initial pos is already in the [l, r] range?\n\nFor example, in the second sample input: 6 3 1 3. So l is 1, r is 3. The current pos is 3. Since l is 1, there's no need to close left. But the right side is r=3. So tabs to the right of 3 (i.e., 4,5,6) need to be closed. So she can be at pos 3, and close right. Which takes 1 second. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- If l > 1: need to move to l, then close left. The time is |pos - l| + 1.\n\n- If r < n: need to move to r, then close right. The time is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is n? Then no steps needed. So the total time is 0.\n\nBut what about when l is 1, but r is less than n? Then we have to close the right part.\n\nBut what about when the initial pos is already at l? Then moving takes 0 steps, then close left (but if l is 1, then there's nothing to close. So perhaps we need to check whether l is 1 or not.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nCalculate the time needed for closing left (if necessary) and closing right (if necessary). The total time is the sum of these two times.\n\nBut wait, what if the movement for closing left and closing right can be optimized? Like, maybe after closing left, the position is already in the right place for closing right. But since the movement is allowed to be done in steps, perhaps the movement steps for closing left and closing right are independent.\n\nFor example, suppose that l is 2, r is 4, and pos is 3. Then, to close left, we need to move to l=2 (which takes 1 step) and close left (1 sec). Then, to close right, we need to move to r=4 (which takes 1 step) and close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1+1 + 1+1 = 4 steps. But maybe there's a better way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can close left and right in some order. For example, if you first move to l, close left, then move to r. But the movement steps would be same as before.\n\nSo, the total time would be:\n\ntime_left = (steps to move to l) + 1 (for closing left) if l > 1.\n\ntime_right = (steps to move to r) + 1 (for closing right) if r < n.\n\nBut what if the initial pos is already in the correct position for both steps?\n\nLike, if l=2, r=4, and pos=2. Then, to close left, you are already at l. So steps to move is 0. Close left. Then, move to r=4 (2 steps) and close right. So total is 0+1 + 2+1 = 4 steps.\n\nBut what if you can do something else? Like, close left first, then close right. But the movement steps are the same.\n\nSo, the formula seems to be:\n\ntotal_time = (if l > 1 then |pos - l| + 1 else 0) + (if r < n then |pos - r| + 1 else 0).\n\nBut wait, wait. What if l is 2, r is 4, and pos is 3. Then, for the left part, moving to l=2 takes 1 step, then close left (1 sec). For the right part, moving to r=4 takes 1 step, then close right (1 sec). So total is 1+1 + 1+1 = 4. But according to the first example, the answer was 5. Wait, what's happening here?\n\nWait, in the first example, the input is 6 3 2 4. So l=2, r=4. So according to this formula:\n\ntime_left = |3-2| + 1 = 1+1=2.\n\ntime_right = |3-4| + 1 = 1+1=2. Total 4. But the sample output is 5. So there's a discrepancy here. So why?\n\nAh, because after closing the left, the position may change. Wait, no. Because when you close the tabs to the left, the a and b change. But when you close tabs to the left of the current position, the a becomes the current position. But in this case, after closing left, the current position is at l (since you moved there). So when you close left, the tabs to the left of l (which is 2) are closed. But after that, the a is 2. Then, when moving to r (which is 4), the movement steps are from 2 to 4, which takes 2 steps. Then close right. So the total steps would be (1 step to move to l) + 1 (close left) + (2 steps to move to r) + 1 (close right) = 1+1+2+1=5. Which matches the sample.\n\nAh, so my previous formula was wrong. Because when you have to move to l and then move to r, the movement steps for the r part is not |pos - r|, but |l - r|, because after moving to l, the current position is l. So the movement steps for the right part is |l - r|. So the previous approach of considering |pos - l| + |pos - r| is incorrect. Because the movement for the right part depends on where you are after closing the left part.\n\nWait, but how can we model this? Because depending on the order in which we perform the closing steps, the movement steps could vary. For example, if we first close the left part, then move to r. Or first move to r, then move to l. So which order gives the minimal steps?\n\nSo the problem is that the movement steps for closing left and closing right are not independent. So the initial approach of adding the two separate times (for left and right) is wrong. Because the movement steps for the right part depends on where you are after handling the left part.\n\nSo this complicates things. How do we model this?\n\nLet me think again. The problem is that after closing the left part, the current position is at l. Then moving to r takes |l - r| steps. Similarly, if we first close the right part, then the current position is at r, and moving to l takes |r - l| steps.\n\nBut what is the minimal steps between the two options?\n\nSo, for example, if we need to close both left and right, then the total steps would be:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then close right.\n\nSteps: (move to l) + 1 (close left) + (move from l to r) + 1 (close right).\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then close left.\n\nSteps: (move to r) + 1 (close right) + (move from r to l) + 1 (close left).\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nBut which option is better? Well, it depends on the positions. For example, if pos is closer to l, then option 1 might be better. If pos is closer to r, option 2 might be better.\n\nBut what if we can choose the order? Then, the minimal steps would be the minimum between option 1 and option 2.\n\nBut wait, what if the movement steps for both options can be optimized?\n\nBut in the first example, l is 2, r is 4, pos is 3. So option 1:\n\n|3-2| + 1 + |2-4| + 1 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5, which matches the sample.\n\nOption 2: |3-4| + 1 + |4-2| + 1 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Same result.\n\nSo in that case, either order gives the same total steps.\n\nBut what about if pos is 1, l=2, r=4. So pos is to the left of l.\n\nOption 1: move to l (distance 1) + 1, then move from l to r (distance 2) + 1. Total 1+1 + 2+1 = 5.\n\nOption 2: move to r (distance 3) + 1, then move from r to l (distance 2) + 1. Total 3+1 + 2+1 = 7. So option 1 is better.\n\nThus, the minimal steps would be min(option1, option2).\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nSo, the total steps for closing left and right is:\n\nif l > 1 and r < n:\n\n   total = min( (|pos - l| + |l - r|) + 2 , (|pos - r| + |r - l|) + 2 )\n\nBut since |l - r| is same as |r - l|, then it's min( |pos - l| + |l - r| , |pos - r| + |l - r| ) + 2.\n\nWhich simplifies to |l - r| + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to think about this.\n\nBut what if l and r are adjacent? Like l=2, r=3, then |l - r| is 1.\n\nBut regardless, the formula would be:\n\nfor the case when both left and right need to be closed, the steps are:\n\nsteps = (steps to move to l or r) + (steps to move from there to the other) + 2 (for closing left and right).\n\nBut how to compute the minimal steps for this part?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps for moving to l and then to r, or moving to r and then to l.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nmin( |pos - l| + |l - r|, |pos - r| + |r - l| ) + 2.\n\nBut since |l - r| is same as |r - l|, this is:\n\n(|l - r|) + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + 2.\n\nBut in any case, the formula for when both left and right need to be closed is:\n\nsteps = (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + |l - r|) + 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to think about this. For example, the minimal steps needed to reach l and r in some order, then perform the two closes.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to model this.\n\nBut perhaps the overall approach is:\n\nWe have to consider four cases:\n\nCase 1: l == 1 and r == n. No need to close anything. Time is 0.\n\nCase 2: l == 1, but r < n. Need to close right. Steps: move to r, then close. Time is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase 3: r == n, but l > 1. Need to close left. Steps: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase 4: Both l > 1 and r < n. Need to close left and right. So steps are as discussed earlier.\n\nBut how to handle case 4?\n\nSo, in case 4, the steps are:\n\nThe minimal steps between:\n\nOption A: move to l, close left (1 sec), then move to r (steps |l - r|), close right (1 sec). Total steps: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nOption B: move to r, close right (1 sec), then move to l (steps |r - l|), close left (1 sec). Total steps: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nSo the minimal between option A and B.\n\nWhich is the same as (min( |pos - l| + |l - r|, |pos - r| + |r - l| )) + 2.\n\nBut since |l - r| is same as |r - l|, it's equal to |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + 2 ?\n\nNo, because for example, if |pos - l| is 1, |pos - r| is 3, |l - r| is 2. Then option A is 1 + 2 = 3, option B is 3 + 2 =5. So the min is 3. So the total steps is 3 + 2 = 5. Which is |l - r| + min(...) ?\n\nWait, |l - r| is 2. min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) is 1. So adding them gives 3, plus 2 gives 5. Which is the same as option A's value (3) + 2 (the 2 closes). So yes.\n\nSo, in case 4, the steps are |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + 2.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause option A is |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2. Which is |l - r| + |pos - l| + 2. And since |l - r| is fixed, and |pos - l| is the minimal between |pos - l| and |pos - r|, then the minimal steps is |l - r| + min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + 2.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n: answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if l == 1: then need to close right. Steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCheck if r == n: then need to close left. Steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nElse: need to close both left and right. Compute steps as (|l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )) + 2.\n\nWait, but in the first example, l=2, r=4. |l - r| is 2. min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) is 1. So 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nAnother example: in the second sample input: 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. Since l is 1, and r is not n (n=6). So steps are |pos - r| + 1. pos is 3, r is 3. So 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input: 5 2 1 5. So l=1 and r=5. So answer is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So l>1 and r <n. So steps would be |2-3| + min( |1-2|, |1-3| ) + 2. |2-3| is 1. min(1, 2) is 1. So 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n\nLet me think. The steps would be:\n\nOption A: move to l=2 (steps 1), close left (1 sec). Then move to r=3 (steps 1), close right (1 sec). Total 1+1+1+1=4. Correct.\n\nAnother scenario: pos=1, l=3, r=4. So l>1 and r <n. So steps would be |3-4| + min( |1-3|, |1-4| ) + 2. 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Let's see:\n\nOption A: move to l=3 (steps 2), close left (1). Then move to r=4 (step 1), close right (1). Total 2+1+1+1=5. Correct.\n\nAnother scenario: pos=4, l=2, r=3. So steps are |2-3| + min(|4-2|, |4-3|) + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n\nOption A: move to l=2 (steps 2), close left (1). Then move to r=3 (steps 1), close right (1). Total 2+1+1+1=5? Wait, why the discrepancy here?\n\nWait, according to the formula, |l - r| is 1, min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) is min(2, 1) = 1. So 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. But according to the actual steps, the steps would be 2+1 + 1 +1 = 5. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?\n\nAh, wait. Oh no! My formula must be wrong. Because the formula says that the steps are |l - r| + min(...) + 2. But in this case, |l - r| is 1, min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) is 1. So 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. But according to the actual steps, the steps are 2 (move to l) + 1 (close left) + 1 (move to r) + 1 (close right) → 5 steps. Where is the mistake here?\n\nHmm. Let me re-examine the derivation.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the steps for case 4 are (|l - r| + min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|)) + 2. But in this case, that gives 1+1+2=4. But actual steps are 5. So the formula is wrong. What's the error?\n\nLet me re-examine the case:\n\ncase 4: l>1 and r <n.\n\nsteps for option A: |pos - l| (steps to move to l) + 1 (close left) + |l - r| (steps to move to r) + 1 (close right) → total is |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nSimilarly, option B: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nSo the minimal steps between option A and B is min( |pos - l| + |l - r|, |pos - r| + |r - l| ) + 2.\n\nIn the example above, pos=4, l=2, r=3. So option A is |4-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3. Plus 2 → 5. Option B is |4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 → plus 2 → 4. So the minimal between 5 and 4 is 4. So the correct steps would be 4. But how?\n\nHow can that be achieved?\n\nOption B: move to r (3), then close right, then move to l (2), then close left.\n\nBut r is 3, which is in the [l, r] range. So closing right would close tabs to the right of 3. But since r is 3, and the target is to leave tabs up to r=3, then closing right would close tabs to the right of 3 (i.e., 4, 5, etc.). But in this case, the original n is 5. So after closing right, the current position is at r=3. Then, moving to l=2 (steps 1) and closing left (which would close tabs to the left of 2, i.e., tab 1). So the steps would be:\n\nmove from pos=4 to r=3 (steps 1), close right (1 sec). Then move to l=2 (steps 1), close left (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. Which is correct. So the formula is correct. But earlier calculation of the formula was wrong. Because the formula is min( |pos - l| + |l - r|, |pos - r| + |r - l| ) + 2. Which for this example is min(2+1=3, 1+1=2) +2 → 2 +2 =4. Which is correct.\n\nSo my previous mistake was in thinking that the formula was |l - r| + min(...). But actually, the formula is min( (|pos - l| + |l - r| ), (|pos - r| + |r - l| )) + 2. Which can be rewritten as min( |pos - l| + |l - r|, |pos - r| + |l - r| ) + 2 → which equals |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + 2. Because |l - r| is common in both terms.\n\nYes. Because |pos - l| + |l - r| = |l - r| + |pos - l|. Similarly for the other term. So the min between those two is |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ). Then adding the 2.\n\nSo the formula for case 4 is |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + 2.\n\nBut in the example above, |l - r| is 1. min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) is min(2, 1) = 1. So 1 + 1 + 2 =4. Which matches. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    answer is 0\n\nelif l == 1:\n\n    answer is |pos - r| + 1\n\nelif r == n:\n\n    answer is |pos - l| + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    answer is (|l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )) + 2\n\nBut wait, why is that the case? Because in this case, we need to close both left and right, and the minimal steps is |l - r| + min( ... ) + 2.\n\nBut let's test the first example again. l=2, r=4, pos=3. |l - r| is 2. min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) is 1. So 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example where pos is between l and r. For example, l=2, r=4, pos=3. So steps are 5. Which matches the first sample.\n\nAnother example: pos=2, l=2, r=4. Then, since l is 2, which is not 1, and r is not n. So the formula applies. |l - r| is 2. min( |2-2|, |2-4| ) is 0. So 2 + 0 + 2 =4. Let's see: steps would be:\n\nOption B: move to r (4) from pos 2: steps 2. Close right (1 sec). Then move to l (2) from r (4): steps 2. Close left (1 sec). Total steps 2 +1 +2 +1 = 6? Wait, no. Wait, no, the formula says that the steps are (|l - r| + min(... )) + 2. Which is 2 + 0 + 2 =4. But how?\n\nWait, in this scenario, pos is already at l=2. So for case 4, l=2, r=4, pos=2.\n\nSo the formula is |l - r| (2) + min( |pos - l| (0), |pos - r| (2) ) → 0 → 2 + 0 + 2 =4 steps.\n\nBut what's the actual steps? Let's think:\n\nOption A: move to l (already there), close left (but l is 2, which is not 1. So closing left would close tabs to the left of l, i.e., tab 1. Then move to r (steps 2) and close right. So steps:\n\n0 (move to l) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move to r) + 1 (close right) → 0+1+2+1 =4 steps. Which matches the formula. So yes.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif l == 1:\n\n    # need to close right\n\n    print( abs(pos - r) + 1 )\n\nelif r == n:\n\n    # need to close left\n\n    print( abs(pos - l) + 1 )\n\nelse:\n\n    # need to close both left and right\n\n    distance_between = abs(l - r)\n\n    min_pos = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\n    print( distance_between + min_pos + 2 )\n\nBut wait, why is that the case? Because the steps are (distance_between + min_pos) + 2?\n\nYes, because the formula is |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + 2.\n\nBut let's test another case where the pos is not between l and r.\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. So l and r are not 1 or 5. So case 4.\n\ndistance_between is 1. min( |5-2|=3, |5-3|=2 ) → 2. So total steps is 1 + 2 + 2 =5.\n\nWhat's the actual steps?\n\nOption B: move to r (3) from pos 5: steps 2. Close right (tabs to the right of 3, which is 4 and 5. So after closing, the current position is at 3. Then move to l (2) from 3: steps 1. Close left (tabs to the left of 2, which is 1). Steps: 2 +1 + 1 +1 = 5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: pos is to the left of l. For example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So case 4. distance_between is 1. min( |1-2|=1, |1-3|=2 ) → 1. total steps 1 +1 +2 =4.\n\nSteps: option A: move to l (steps 1), close left (tabs to left of 2, which is 1. Then move to r (steps 1) and close right. Total steps 1+1 +1+1 =4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nNow, let's test the third sample input: 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. So the first condition is true, answer is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. Since l is 1, and r is not n (6). So steps is |3-3| +1 → 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5. So l is not 1, r is not 7. So case 4. distance between is 2. min( |4-3|=1, |4-5|=1 ) → 1. total steps 2+1+2=5.\n\nWhat steps? For example, move to l (3) steps 1, close left (tabs to left of 3, i.e., 1,2. Then move to r (5) steps 2, close right (tabs 6,7). Total steps: 1+1 +2+1 =5. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when l is greater than r? No, the input constraints say that l ≤ r.\n\nSo the code should handle all possible cases.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nRead the input as four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nThen, check:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif l == 1:\n\n    print( abs(pos - r) + 1 )\n\nelif r == n:\n\n    print( abs(pos - l) + 1 )\n\nelse:\n\n    distance_between = abs(l - r)\n\n    min_pos = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\n    print( distance_between + min_pos + 2 )\n\nWait, but what if l is 1 and r is not n, but the pos is already at r? Then, the steps are 0 +1 =1. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's think about when l=1 and r=3, and pos=3. Then, the steps are 0 +1=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=3, pos=4. Then steps are |4-3| +1 =1+1=2. Which would be moving to r (steps 1) and close right. Correct.\n\nBut what about if l=1 and r=3, and pos=2. Then steps is |2-3| +1 =1+1=2? No. Wait, no. Because in this case, the code says that l ==1, so the steps are |pos - r| +1. Which is |2-3| +1 = 1+1=2. Which is correct. Because you need to move to r (3) from 2 (1 step), then close right (1 sec). So total 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: l=2, r=4, pos=5. So case 4. distance_between is 2. min( |5-2|=3, |5-4|=1 ) → 1. So total steps 2+1+2=5. Which would be: move to r (4) from 5 (1 step), close right (tabs 5,6?), then move to l (2) (steps 2), close left (tabs 1). So steps: 1+1 +2+1=5. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. Not 1 or n. So case 4. distance_between is 2. min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 → 1. So 2 + 1 + 2 =5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. So steps is |3-3| +1 → 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1 and r=5. Output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when l = r. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3. Then, since l=3 and r=3. So we need to close all tabs except 3. So what's the steps?\n\nIn this case, l=3, r=3. So since l is not 1 and r is not n (assuming n is larger than 3). For example, n=5. So code would go into case 4. distance_between is 0. min( |3-3|=0, |3-3|=0 → 0. So total steps 0 +0 +2 =2.\n\nBut what's the actual steps?\n\nWe need to close all tabs to the left of 3 and to the right of 3. So:\n\nFor example, pos is 3. So steps: move to l (3) (0 steps), close left (tabs 1,2). Then move to r (3) (0 steps), close right (tabs 4,5). So steps: 0 +1 + 0 +1 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: l=3, r=3, pos=1. So code would calculate:\n\ndistance between is 0. min( |1-3|=2, |1-3|=2 → 2. total steps 0+2+2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The solution involves calculating the optimal steps to move the cursor and close tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check for Full Range**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no action is needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Closing Tabs on One Side**:\n   - If the left boundary `l` is 1, only tabs to the right of `r` need closing. The time required is the distance from `pos` to `r` plus one second to close the tabs.\n   - If the right boundary `r` is n, only tabs to the left of `l` need closing. The time required is the distance from `pos` to `l` plus one second to close the tabs.\n3. **Closing Tabs on Both Sides**: When both `l` and `r` are within the range of tabs (not at the edges), calculate the minimum steps required to move to either `l` or `r`, then move to the other boundary and close tabs. This involves:\n   - Calculating the distance between `l` and `r`.\n   - Determining the minimum distance from `pos` to either `l` or `r`.\n   - Summing these distances and adding 2 seconds for the two closing operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelif l == 1:\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\nelif r == n:\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\nelse:\n    distance_between = abs(l - r)\n    min_pos = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))\n    print(distance_between + min_pos + 2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] spans the entire range of tabs (from 1 to n), no actions are needed.\n- **Single Side Closing**: If either boundary is at the edge of the tab range, only the opposite side needs closing, calculated by moving the cursor to the respective boundary and closing the tabs.\n- **Both Sides Closing**: When both boundaries are within the range, the optimal strategy involves moving to the nearest boundary first, then moving to the other boundary, and closing tabs on both sides. The total time includes moving to the nearest boundary, moving to the far boundary, and two closing operations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required using direct calculations based on positions and distances, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
