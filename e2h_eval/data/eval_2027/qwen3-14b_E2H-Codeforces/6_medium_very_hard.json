Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that Leha wants to choose two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the total cost is minimized. If it's not possible, return -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the duration is. For each voucher i, the duration is ri - li + 1. So, for two vouchers i and j, the sum of their durations must be exactly x. Also, they can't overlap. So either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to find such pairs efficiently given the constraints of n up to 2e5. A brute force approach checking all pairs would be O(n²), which is way too slow for n=2e5. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about possible steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each voucher, compute its duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we need to find another voucher with duration (x - d) that doesn't overlap with it. And among all such possible pairs, find the minimum sum of costs.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find those vouchers?\n\nAnother idea: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with the required duration (x - d) that starts after the first ends, or ends before the first starts. But again, checking all possibilities for each voucher is O(n²) in the worst case.\n\nSo perhaps we can group vouchers by their duration. Let's create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we look into the group for duration (x - d). For each such voucher in that group, we check if they don't overlap. However, even this might not be efficient enough if there are many vouchers with the same duration.\n\nBut maybe we can optimize further. For example, for a given voucher i with duration d, we need to find vouchers j with duration (x - d) that end before li (so that j ends before i starts) or start after ri (so that i ends before j starts). \n\nBut how do we find the minimum cost vouchers in these regions?\n\nLet me think. For each duration d, we can pre-process the vouchers with that duration in a way that allows us to quickly query the minimum cost of vouchers that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a duration t. For all vouchers with duration t, we can sort them by their end time (ri) and also by their start time (li). Then, for a given voucher i with duration d, when looking for vouchers of duration t = x - d that end before li, we can find the earliest possible ones. Similarly for those that start after ri.\n\nBut how to structure this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Precompute for each duration d, a sorted list of vouchers (sorted by their end time, and also by their start time? Or maybe sorted by end time and start time separately?).\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each duration t, we can have two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by their end time. This would allow us to find all vouchers with duration t that end before a certain day (like li of voucher i). For these, the minimal cost can be found by pre-processing a prefix minimum array.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers with duration t, sorted by their start time. Then, for a voucher i's end time (ri), we can find all vouchers with duration t that start after ri, and find the minimal cost among them.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each voucher i with duration d:\n\n   Check if (x - d) is a valid duration (i.e., exists in our duration map).\n\n   If yes, then:\n\n      For vouchers of duration t = x - d:\n\n         Find the minimum cost among those that end before li (so that they don't overlap with voucher i).\n\n         Find the minimum cost among those that start after ri (so that they don't overlap with voucher i).\n\n      Take the minimum between these two options and add to the current voucher's cost. Keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the min cost for vouchers of duration t that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day.\n\nLet me think about the first part: vouchers with duration t that end before a certain day (say, L). Since we have all vouchers of duration t sorted by their end time, we can perform a binary search to find the largest end time that is <= L. Then, in the prefix up to that index, we can find the minimum cost. So for this, we need for each duration t, a sorted list of end times, and a corresponding prefix min array.\n\nSimilarly, for the start time: vouchers with duration t that start after a certain day R. So we can sort the vouchers of duration t by their start time, and for a given R, find the first voucher with start time > R, and then find the min cost in the suffix starting from that index. For this, we can have a sorted list of start times and a suffix min array.\n\nSo here's how we can proceed:\n\nFor each duration t, we pre-process two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time (ri), and a prefix min array of costs. So for any L, we can find the maximum end time <= L, and get the min cost up to that point.\n\n- Sorted by start time (li), and a suffix min array of costs. So for any R, we can find the first start time > R, and get the min cost from that index onwards.\n\nThis way, for each voucher i, when we need to find vouchers of duration t that end before li, we can query the prefix min for that duration's end-sorted list. Similarly for the start-sorted list.\n\nNow, the steps to implement this:\n\nFirst, process all vouchers and group them by their duration. For each duration, store two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time (ri), and for that list, a prefix min array.\n\n- One sorted by start time (li), and for that list, a suffix min array.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i with duration d, we check if (x - d) is present in the duration groups. If so, we proceed.\n\nFor example, suppose voucher i has duration d, and we need to find vouchers of duration t = x - d. For voucher i, we can:\n\n1. Find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration t that end before li. How?\n\n   For the duration t's end-sorted list, perform a binary search to find the largest end time <= li - 1 (since if a voucher ends on li-1, then it's before the start of voucher i, which starts at li). Then, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimum cost.\n\n2. Find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration t that start after ri. How?\n\n   For the duration t's start-sorted list, perform a binary search to find the first start time > ri. Then, the suffix min from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nIf either of these is possible, then we take the minimum between the two and add to the current voucher's cost. We keep track of the global minimum across all such pairs.\n\nBut wait, we also need to make sure that the voucher i is not the same as the voucher j. However, since we are considering all vouchers in the duration t group, and the current voucher i is of duration d, and t is x - d, then if d + t = x, but if d = t (i.e., x is even and d = x/2), then we need to make sure that voucher j is not the same as voucher i. However, since we are grouping vouchers by duration, and when d = t, the group will include voucher i. So when we check for vouchers in the group, we need to ensure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i. But how?\n\nThis could be a problem. For example, if a voucher i has duration d, and x is 2d, then when we look for vouchers in duration t = d, and there's only one voucher (voucher i itself), then we can't pair it with itself. So, when we query the min cost for vouchers of duration t, we need to make sure that there's at least one other voucher in that group. However, the way we process the data may not account for this.\n\nBut how can we handle that?\n\nWell, during the processing for voucher i, when we check the group for duration t = x - d, which is same as d (when x is 2d), we need to find vouchers in that group that are not voucher i. However, when we query the prefix min or suffix min arrays, they may include voucher i itself. So we need to make sure that when we are considering vouchers in the same group, we exclude voucher i.\n\nThis complicates things. How can we handle this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to pre-process all vouchers for each duration, and for each voucher i, when looking for vouchers in the same duration group (if t = d), we need to check if there are at least two vouchers in that group. If so, then we can find the min cost excluding voucher i. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial grouping, for each duration, we can have all vouchers stored, and when we query the min cost, we can check if the voucher is the same as i. But that would require checking each candidate voucher, which is not feasible for large n.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a better way. Let's think again. Suppose that for a voucher i, we are looking for vouchers in the group of duration t. If t is not equal to d (i.e., d + t = x, and t != d), then all vouchers in the group are different from voucher i. However, if t = d (i.e., x is even and d = x/2), then the group includes voucher i. So when we query the min cost for vouchers in the group, we need to make sure that the voucher is not i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, perhaps during the query phase, when we find the min cost for vouchers in the group, we can check if the min cost is achieved by voucher i. If so, we need to find the next minimum, excluding voucher i.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nThis seems challenging. For example, if the group has multiple vouchers, and the min cost is achieved by multiple vouchers, then even if one of them is i, there might be others. But if the min is only achieved by i, then we need to find the next min.\n\nBut this seems very complicated. How can we handle this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can pre-process for each duration group, the list of vouchers, and for each voucher in the group, when we query for the min cost in that group (excluding itself), we can find the minimum of all vouchers except that one. However, this would require for each voucher in the group, knowing the min cost of the rest of the group, which is not feasible unless we have some kind of structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can allow the possibility of including voucher i in the group, but during the pairing, check if the voucher i is being paired with itself. But since the problem requires i and j to be different, we need to avoid that.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a voucher i with duration d. We are looking for vouchers j with duration t = x - d. If t = d, then we need to find j such that j is not i, and the vouchers don't overlap.\n\nBut during the query for vouchers j with duration t, we can find the min cost, but we have to ensure that there's at least one voucher in the group that is not i, and that it doesn't overlap with i.\n\nSo, perhaps when t = d, during the query, we can check if there are at least two vouchers in the group. If not, then we can't use this group. Otherwise, we can proceed to find the min cost, but ensuring that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nMaybe during the query for the min cost in the group, we can find the minimum cost, and then check if that minimum is achieved by a voucher that doesn't overlap with i. However, even that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process all vouchers, and for each voucher i, when looking for j in the same duration group (t = d), we can find the min cost of vouchers in the group that are not i, and that don't overlap with i. But again, how to do that efficiently.\n\nThis seems really tricky. Let me think of an example. Suppose there are two vouchers in the same duration group. Voucher i and voucher j. If they don't overlap, then they can be paired. But if they do overlap, then they can't be paired. So even if the group has multiple vouchers, we need to find those that don't overlap with i.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach of checking for vouchers in the group that end before li, or start after ri, and then taking the min cost of those, but for the case where t = d, we need to ensure that the voucher j is not i. However, if the voucher j is in the group and satisfies the non-overlapping condition, then even if it's the same as i, it's not allowed. Wait, no. Because j can't be i. So when t = d, and we are looking for vouchers in the group, we have to ensure that j is not i.\n\nBut how can we handle this?\n\nPerhaps during the query for vouchers in the group, we can include all vouchers except i, and then proceed as before. However, how to do that?\n\nThis seems like a big problem. Maybe the initial approach is to ignore this case and then later check if the pair is valid. But that would complicate the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the grouping, for each duration, we can have all vouchers sorted, and when querying for the min cost, we can consider all vouchers except the current one. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process all possible pairs, but during the pairing, check that the two vouchers are different. However, this would require checking for that, which may be possible if we can find the min cost for the group, and then see if there exists a voucher in the group that is not i and satisfies the non-overlapping condition.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems really complex. Let's think again. Perhaps the problem can be handled by allowing the same voucher to be considered, but during the pairing, we check if i and j are different. However, in practice, if we have a voucher i, and during the query for the group, we find that the min cost is from voucher i, then we can't use it. So, perhaps we can first find the min cost for the group (including voucher i), and then check if there exists another voucher in the group that satisfies the non-overlapping condition and has the same or lower cost.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can just proceed with the initial approach, and when we find that the min cost comes from voucher i, we can check if there are other vouchers in the group that meet the criteria. However, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is rare. For example, if x is even and there is only one voucher with duration x/2, then it's impossible to pair it with another. However, if there are multiple vouchers, then even if one is voucher i, there's at least another one. So perhaps during the initial grouping, when we process a voucher i, and t = d, we can check if the group has more than one voucher, and then proceed. If the group has more than one voucher, then there's a chance that there's a voucher j that is not i and meets the non-overlapping conditions.\n\nBut how to ensure that during the query?\n\nMaybe the answer is that during the query, even if the min is achieved by voucher i, there's another voucher in the group that can be used. However, this isn't guaranteed. For example, if there are two vouchers in the group, both overlapping with i, but one of them is i. In that case, even though there's another voucher, it overlaps with i, so they can't be paired.\n\nSo, this seems complicated.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to proceed with the initial approach, and during the query, allow the same voucher to be considered, but then during the pairing check, ensure that the two vouchers are different. However, how to do that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose for voucher i, we find that the min cost for vouchers j in the group with duration t is from voucher j. Then, during the pairing, we check if j is not i, and that they don't overlap. But how can we track which voucher j is?\n\nAh, right! Because when we query for the min cost, we need to know not just the min cost, but also the voucher that provides it. However, that's not feasible with the prefix min arrays. Because the prefix min array just stores the minimum up to that point, but not which voucher it is.\n\nSo this suggests that the approach of using prefix and suffix min arrays is insufficient, because we can't track which voucher is providing the min. Therefore, perhaps we need to find a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For each voucher, precompute for each possible duration t, the min cost of vouchers that end before a certain day, and the min cost of vouchers that start after a certain day. However, this seems similar to the previous approach, but without tracking specific vouchers.\n\nWait, but even if we find that the min cost is achievable by some voucher j, we can't be sure that j is not i. However, perhaps the probability that the same voucher i is the one that provides the min is low, but we can't ignore it. So perhaps, during the query, we can find the min cost for vouchers in the group (including voucher i), and then check if there's at least one voucher in the group that satisfies the non-overlapping condition and is not i. However, how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the query, we can find the min cost for vouchers that end before li (excluding voucher i), and similarly for the other case. But how to do that?\n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nLet me think of all possible pairs of vouchers (i, j) where the durations sum to x and they don't overlap. The problem is to find the minimum cost.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, O(n²) is impossible. So we need to find a way to find for each voucher i, the best possible j that satisfies the conditions.\n\nLet me think again about grouping by duration. For each voucher i with duration d, we need to find a voucher j with duration t = x - d. So for each voucher i, we can look up in the group of duration t.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can:\n\n- Check if t = x - d is a valid duration (i.e., exists in the groups).\n\n- For that group, find the minimal cost of vouchers that end before li (so that j ends before i starts), or start after ri (so that j starts after i ends).\n\nSo the question is, how to find the minimal cost in those two categories.\n\nLet me think about the first case: vouchers in the t group that end before li.\n\nIf we have all vouchers in the t group sorted by end time, then for a given li, we can find the largest end time <= li - 1. All vouchers up to that index in the sorted list end before li. The minimal cost among these is what we need.\n\nSimilarly for the second case: vouchers in the t group that start after ri. So sorted by start time, find the first start time > ri. All vouchers from that index onwards start after ri. The minimal cost among them is needed.\n\nBut how to compute these minima?\n\nWe can preprocess for each duration t, two sorted lists:\n\n- A list sorted by end time, with a prefix minimum array. So for each position in the list, we know the minimum cost up to that position.\n\n- A list sorted by start time, with a suffix minimum array. For each position in the list, we know the minimum cost from that position to the end.\n\nThen, for the first case, when we find the largest end time <= li-1, we can look up the prefix min array at that index to get the minimal cost.\n\nFor the second case, when we find the first start time > ri, we can look up the suffix min array at that index to get the minimal cost.\n\nBut what if there are no such vouchers? Then we can't take that option.\n\nNow, the problem is when the voucher j is the same as voucher i. But how likely is that?\n\nOnly when t = d, i.e., x = 2d. So, for voucher i, when looking for vouchers in the same duration group (t = d), which is x - d = d. So, during the query, the group includes voucher i. However, if voucher i is the only one in the group, then there's no j. If there are multiple vouchers in the group, then we need to make sure that the voucher j is not i.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a group of vouchers for duration t. For voucher i, when we query the prefix min for vouchers ending before li, and the suffix min for vouchers starting after ri, the min cost could be from voucher i itself. However, in that case, we need to check if there exists another voucher in the group that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut how to do that? Well, during the query, if the min cost is from voucher i, then we can check if there are other vouchers in the group that satisfy the same condition (end before li, or start after ri). However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the initial grouping, we can include all vouchers, and when we find that the minimal cost is from voucher i, we can check if there's another voucher in the group that also satisfies the condition and has the same or lower cost.\n\nBut again, how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can allow the same voucher to be considered, but then during the pairing check, ensure that the two vouchers are different. However, since the voucher j is in the group, and the voucher i is in the group, we need to check if the voucher j is not i.\n\nBut how can we know which voucher j is responsible for the min cost? Because the prefix min array only gives the min cost, not the voucher itself.\n\nThis seems like a dead end.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nMaybe the problem of voucher i being paired with itself can be ignored in most cases. Because, for a voucher to be paired with itself, it must have duration d and x = 2d. Also, the voucher must not overlap with itself, which is impossible. Because the voucher starts at li and ends at ri. So, voucher i cannot be paired with itself. Therefore, even if the query returns voucher i, it's not a valid pair. Hence, we can safely ignore such cases.\n\nWait! That's an important observation. Because for a voucher i and j to be the same, they must be the same voucher. But the problem requires i != j. Also, for two vouchers to not overlap, they must not have overlapping intervals. But if i and j are the same voucher, then their intervals are the same. So they definitely overlap. Hence, even if the group contains voucher i, when we query for vouchers that end before li or start after ri, voucher i cannot be included, because:\n\n- If we are looking for vouchers that end before li: voucher i's end time is ri. For voucher i to end before li, we need ri < li. But since li <= ri (as per the input constraints), this is only possible if li = ri and ri < li, which is impossible. Hence, voucher i can't be in the list of vouchers that end before li. Similarly, for vouchers that start after ri, voucher i's start time is li. To have li > ri, which is impossible since li <= ri. Hence, voucher i can't be in either of the two lists. Therefore, when we query for the vouchers in the group that end before li or start after ri, voucher i is automatically excluded. Thus, even if the group contains voucher i, it's not included in the query results. Therefore, the earlier problem of voucher i being considered is not a problem.\n\nThis is a critical insight. So, when we are querying for vouchers in the group that end before li, we are looking for vouchers j where rj < li. Since voucher i's rj is ri >= li, it's not included. Similarly for the other case. Hence, even if the group includes voucher i, it's not considered in the queries. Therefore, the problem of pairing a voucher with itself is automatically handled.\n\nThat's a relief! So this means that during the query, we don't have to worry about voucher i being in the group and being selected as j. Because the queries for vouchers that end before li or start after ri exclude voucher i.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach is safe.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\n   Compute d = ri - li + 1.\n\n   t = x - d.\n\n   if t < 0: skip.\n\n   if t not in the duration map: skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      For the duration t group:\n\n         Check for vouchers that end before li (so j ends before i starts). To find the minimal cost.\n\n         Check for vouchers that start after ri (so j starts after i ends). To find the minimal cost.\n\n         Take the minimum of these two options (if available), and add to voucher i's cost. Update the global minimum.\n\nThus, the key steps are:\n\nImplementing the grouping for each duration, with sorted end times and start times, along with prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet's think about the data structures.\n\nFirst, create a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are tuples of two lists:\n\n- end_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by end time (ri), and a prefix_min array.\n\n- start_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by start time (li), and a suffix_min array.\n\nBut how to represent the vouchers? Each voucher has li, ri, cost. So for each duration, we can have:\n\nFor end_sorted:\n\nSort the vouchers by ri. Then, create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers.\n\nSimilarly, for start_sorted:\n\nSort the vouchers by li. Create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end of the list.\n\nSo, for each duration t, the data structure would be:\n\n{\n    'end_sorted': sorted list of (ri, cost) by ri,\n    'prefix_min': [ ... ],\n    'start_sorted': sorted list of (li, cost) by li,\n    'suffix_min': [ ... ]\n}\n\nWait, but the vouchers have li and ri. For the end_sorted list, we need to sort by ri. For each voucher in the group, we can store (ri, cost), but also need to know li for checking overlaps. Wait, no. The end_sorted list is sorted by ri. When we query for vouchers ending before li, we need to find the max ri <= li-1. Once we find that, the prefix_min gives the minimal cost for all vouchers up to that index. However, the actual vouchers' li may vary. But since we are only checking that their ri is <= li-1, the vouchers are guaranteed to end before li. Hence, they don't overlap with voucher i.\n\nSimilarly for the start_sorted list: sorted by li. We find the first li > ri, and then the suffix_min gives the minimal cost for vouchers starting after ri.\n\nSo, the data structures for each duration can be built as follows:\n\nFor each duration t:\n\n   collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\n   sort the vouchers by ri, and create a prefix_min array.\n\n   sort the vouchers by li, and create a suffix_min array.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nInitialize duration_dict as a defaultdict.\n\nFor each voucher:\n\n   li, ri, cost = ...\n\n   duration = ri - li + 1\n\n   add this voucher to duration_dict[duration]\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, for each duration in duration_dict:\n\n   process the vouchers for end_sorted and start_sorted.\n\nFor example, for a duration t, vouchers are stored in a list. For end_sorted:\n\nsorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nthen create a prefix_min array:\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end)\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0].cost\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for start_sorted:\n\nsorted_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1].cost\nfor i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i].cost)\n\nBut in Python, how to represent these? Maybe for each duration, we can store:\n\n- a list of end_sorted_ri, and a prefix_min list.\n\n- a list of start_sorted_li, and a suffix_min list.\n\nBut perhaps we can store for each duration, the sorted list of (ri, cost) for end_sorted, and similarly for start_sorted.\n\nWait, but the vouchers have li and ri. So for the end_sorted list, we need to have their ri and cost. For the start_sorted list, we need their li and cost.\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each duration t, we have:\n\nend_list = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nstart_list = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\nThen, for end_list, we can create a list of ri and a prefix_min array of costs.\n\nSimilarly for start_list, a list of li and a suffix_min array.\n\nOnce these are preprocessed, for each voucher i:\n\nd = ri_i - li_i + 1\n\nt = x - d\n\nif t < 0: continue\n\nif t not in duration_dict: continue\n\nelse:\n\n   process the two cases.\n\nCase 1: find vouchers in duration t with ri_j <= li_i - 1.\n\nFor this, in the end_list for duration t, perform a binary search to find the largest ri_j <= li_i - 1. Let's call this index 'pos'. If pos is -1 (no such vouchers), then skip. Else, the min cost is prefix_min[pos].\n\nCase 2: find vouchers in duration t with li_j >= ri_i + 1.\n\nFor this, in the start_list for duration t, perform a binary search to find the first li_j >= ri_i + 1. Let's call this index 'pos'. If pos is beyond the list length, then skip. Else, the min cost is suffix_min[pos].\n\nNow, for each of these cases, if there is a valid min cost, we can add it to the current voucher's cost and update the global minimum.\n\nNow, the problem is how to perform the binary search for these cases.\n\nFor case 1:\n\nIn the end_list, which is sorted by ri. We want the largest ri <= target (li_i - 1). So we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point, then subtract 1.\n\nFor example:\n\ntarget = li_i - 1\n\nusing bisect.bisect_right(end_ri_list, target) gives us the first index where ri > target. So the largest index with ri <= target is index = insertion_point - 1.\n\nIf insertion_point is 0, then there are no such vouchers.\n\nFor case 2:\n\nIn the start_list, sorted by li. We want the first li >= target (ri_i + 1). Using bisect_left, which returns the first index where li >= target. If this index is within the list, then the suffix_min from that index onwards is the min cost.\n\nNow, in code, for each duration t, we need to have the end_ri_list and the prefix_min array. Similarly for the start_li_list and suffix_min array.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration t, we can store:\n\nend_ri_list = [voucher.ri for voucher in end_list]\n\nprefix_min = [...] as computed earlier.\n\nSimilarly for start_li_list and suffix_min.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nBut how to represent the vouchers? Perhaps, for each duration, we can store:\n\nFor example, for duration t:\n\nend_sorted: list of tuples (ri, cost), sorted by ri.\n\nstart_sorted: list of tuples (li, cost), sorted by li.\n\nBut during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can generate the end_ri_list as the list of ri's, and the prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly for the start_sorted list.\n\nSo, for each duration in duration_dict:\n\n   vouchers = list of vouchers (each with li, ri, cost)\n\n   sorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\n   end_ri_list = [v.ri for v in sorted_end]\n\n   prefix_min = [ ... ]\n\n   sorted_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\n   start_li_list = [v.li for v in sorted_start]\n\n   suffix_min = [ ... ]\n\nSo, during the processing of each voucher i:\n\n   d = ri_i - li_i + 1\n\n   t = x - d\n\n   if t not in duration_dict: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      get the end_ri_list and prefix_min for duration t.\n\n      target = li_i - 1\n\n      using bisect.bisect_right(end_ri_list, target) to find insertion point.\n\n      if insertion_point > 0:\n\n          min_cost1 = prefix_min[insertion_point - 1]\n\n      else:\n\n          min_cost1 = infinity\n\n      similarly for case 2:\n\n          target = ri_i + 1\n\n          using bisect.bisect_left(start_li_list, target) to find insertion_point.\n\n          if insertion_point < len(start_li_list):\n\n              min_cost2 = suffix_min[insertion_point]\n\n          else:\n\n              min_cost2 = infinity\n\n      then, current_min_candidate = min(min_cost1, min_cost2)\n\n      if current_min_candidate is not infinity:\n\n          total = current_min_candidate + voucher_i.cost\n\n          update the global minimum.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle all of this.\n\nNow, handling the edge cases.\n\nFor example, when x is 0? No, since x >= 2 (from input constraints: n and x are >= 2). Wait, no. The input says that x can be as small as 2. For example, the second sample input has x=2, and each voucher's duration is 3, so sum is 6, which is larger than 2. Hence, output is -1.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures. For each duration, during preprocessing, we need to have:\n\nend_ri_list, prefix_min, start_li_list, suffix_min.\n\nIn Python, perhaps we can represent this with a dictionary, where for each duration, we have a tuple of (end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_li_list, suffix_min).\n\nBut how to generate these during preprocessing.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nWe can read all vouchers first, group them by duration. Then for each duration, process the vouchers into the required data structures.\n\nBut in Python, for each voucher, we can represent it as a tuple (li, ri, cost).\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n    duration = ri - li + 1\n    duration_dict[duration].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\n# Preprocess each duration in duration_dict\nprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_li_list, suffix_min)\n\nfor duration in duration_dict:\n    # process end_sorted\n    end_list = sorted( duration_dict[duration], key=lambda v: v[1] )  # sorted by ri\n    end_ri_list = [v[1] for v in end_list]\n    # compute prefix_min\n    prefix_min = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for v in end_list:\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, v[2] )\n        prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n    # process start_sorted\n    start_list = sorted( duration_dict[duration], key=lambda v: v[0] )  # sorted by li\n    start_li_list = [v[0] for v in start_list]\n    # compute suffix_min\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(start_list)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, start_list[i][2] )\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n    # store in processed\n    processed[duration] = (end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_li_list, suffix_min)\n\n# Now, iterate through each voucher and check\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor li_i, ri_i, cost_i in vouchers:\n    d = ri_i - li_i + 1\n    t = x - d\n    if t < 0:\n        continue\n    if t not in processed:\n        continue\n    # get the data for duration t\n    end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_li_list, suffix_min = processed[t]\n    # case 1: find vouchers in t that end before li_i\n    target_case1 = li_i - 1\n    # find insertion point in end_ri_list\n    pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_ri_list, target_case1)\n    if pos > 0:\n        min_case1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n    else:\n        min_case1 = float('inf')\n    # case 2:",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches Leha's vacation duration, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently finding pairs of vouchers whose durations sum up to the required value.\n2. **Preprocess Data Structures**: For each duration, we preprocess two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end date of the voucher, with a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - Another sorted by the start date of the voucher, with a suffix minimum cost array.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration (i.e., `x - duration`). Using binary search on the preprocessed data structures, we efficiently find the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ri = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    processed = dict()\n    \n    for duration in duration_dict:\n        end_list = sorted(duration_dict[duration], key=lambda v: v[1])\n        end_ri_list = [v[1] for v in end_list]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in end_list:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        \n        start_list = sorted(duration_dict[duration], key=lambda v: v[0])\n        start_li_list = [v[0] for v in start_list]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(start_list)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, start_list[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        \n        processed[duration] = (end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_li_list, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li_i, ri_i, cost_i in vouchers:\n        d = ri_i - li_i + 1\n        t = x - d\n        if t < 0:\n            continue\n        if t not in processed:\n            continue\n        end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_li_list, suffix_min = processed[t]\n        \n        # Case 1: find vouchers ending before li_i\n        target_case1 = li_i - 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_ri_list, target_case1)\n        min_case1 = float('inf')\n        if pos > 0:\n            min_case1 = prefix_min[pos - 1]\n        \n        # Case 2: find vouchers starting after ri_i\n        target_case2 = ri_i + 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(start_li_list, target_case2)\n        min_case2 = float('inf')\n        if pos < len(start_li_list):\n            min_case2 = suffix_min[pos]\n        \n        current_min = min(min_case1, min_case2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = current_min + cost_i\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, we sort vouchers by their end and start times and compute prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays.\n4. **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration.
