The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key points here are:\n\n1. The districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So the initial structure is a tree.\n2. After removing k districts, the remaining n - k districts must form a connected subtree.\n3. We want to maximize the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute much more. So ideally, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that the remaining districts are connected? Because if we just keep the highest possible numbers, maybe they aren't connected. So the challenge is to choose which districts to remove so that the remaining ones are connected and include as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nLet me think. Since the value of each district is 2^i, which increases with i, the optimal strategy would be to keep the largest possible districts. But how to ensure connectivity?\n\nSo maybe the approach is to select a subtree that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible. But how?\n\nAnother thought: The problem is similar to finding a subtree with (n - k) nodes that has the maximum possible sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, and the higher-numbered nodes contribute more, we need to select the nodes with the highest possible numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree?\n\nAn idea: Start from the highest-numbered node and try to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, ensuring connectivity. But how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we need to remove k nodes, and the remaining nodes must form a connected component. To maximize the sum, we need to keep the nodes with the highest possible values. So perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we prioritize keeping higher-numbered nodes, and remove lower ones, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the tree structure. Let's consider that the optimal solution is to keep the nodes with the highest numbers possible. However, if some of those nodes are not connected, we might have to remove some lower-numbered nodes to connect them. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal subtree is a subtree that includes the node with the highest number (n), and then as many high-numbered nodes as possible connected to it. Because including node n gives 2^n, which is way larger than any other combination.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to build a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, starting from the highest, and then adding their neighbors in a way that ensures connectivity.\n\nAnother angle: Since the tree is connected, the minimal requirement is that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. To maximize the sum, we need to keep the nodes with the highest values. So the problem reduces to selecting a subtree with (n -k) nodes that contains the highest possible nodes.\n\nBut how to find this subtree?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: We need to select a subset of nodes of size (n -k) that forms a connected subtree, and maximizes the sum of 2^i. Since the sum is maximized when we include the largest possible nodes, perhaps the optimal strategy is to keep the nodes with the largest numbers possible, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, perhaps we can start by considering that the best is to keep all nodes except the k smallest ones. But that's only possible if those nodes form a connected subtree. However, that's not necessarily true. For example, if the tree is a chain like 1-2-3-4-5-6, and we need to remove 3 nodes. Then the optimal would be to keep 4,5,6. But if the tree is structured such that node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 1, etc., then maybe the nodes 4,5,6 are not connected. So we need to find a way to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\nThis seems tricky. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: The problem is equivalent to choosing a subtree with (n -k) nodes, and the sum is maximized. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, we can model this as a problem of selecting the nodes with the highest possible values, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to select those nodes?\n\nLet me think of the following idea: the nodes that are kept should form a subtree that includes the node with the highest number (n),",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: Since the value of each district is $2^i$, higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more.
