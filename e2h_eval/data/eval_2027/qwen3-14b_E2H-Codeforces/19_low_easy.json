The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every two districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nWait, the key here is to maximize the sum. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, the higher-numbered districts contribute much more. So ideally, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. But we have to ensure that the remaining districts are connected.\n\nSo the strategy would be to keep the largest possible districts, but ensuring that they are connected. But how?\n\nLet me think. The problem is similar to selecting a subtree with (n - k) nodes, which must be connected, and maximize the sum of their 2^i values. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the highest possible numbers, perhaps we need to find a way to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, while maintaining connectivity.\n\nBut how to do that? One approach is to think about the tree structure and prioritize keeping the higher-numbered nodes. However, the tree's structure might require that certain nodes are kept to connect others.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible districts, maybe we can start by considering that we want to keep all districts from (n - k + 1) to n, but check if they form a connected component. If not, we need to include some lower-numbered districts to connect them. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as selecting a subtree with (n -k) nodes. Since each node's value is 2^i, which is larger for higher i, the optimal solution is to select the (n -k) largest possible nodes, but ensuring they are connected. However, how do we ensure that?\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal solution is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but possibly including some lower ones if they are needed to connect them. However, since the tree is connected, perhaps we can find a way to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to remove?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as choosing which nodes to keep. The optimal set is the one that includes the highest possible nodes, and forms a connected subtree. So, perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we start from the highest-numbered node and try to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, ensuring connectivity.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWait, here's a thought. Since the tree is connected, and we need to keep a connected subtree. Let's consider that the maximum sum is achieved by keeping the largest (n -k) nodes. However, if those nodes are not connected, we need to add some lower-numbered nodes to connect them. But since adding lower-numbered nodes would decrease the sum, we need to minimize the number of such additions.\n\nBut how to check if the largest (n -k) nodes are connected?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to remove k nodes, and the remaining nodes must be connected. So the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree of size (n -k), which has the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nSince the sum is determined by the nodes kept, and since higher-numbered nodes contribute more, the optimal strategy is to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and remove the lower ones. However, the challenge is ensuring that the kept nodes are connected.\n\nSo here's an idea: We can perform a priority-based selection. Start with the highest-numbered node. Then, iteratively add the next highest-numbered node that connects to the current subtree. But how to implement that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of selecting a subtree where the nodes are as high as possible. For example, we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the highest-numbered node, and greedily include nodes in order of their value. But how to manage that?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Since the sum is 2^i, which is strictly increasing with i, the optimal set of nodes to keep must include the highest possible nodes. So the problem reduces to finding a subtree that includes as many of the top (n -k) nodes as possible, and the rest are the lowest possible.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree?\n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the problem as removing the k smallest nodes, but ensuring that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. But that's not necessarily correct because removing certain small nodes may break the connectivity. However, perhaps the optimal way is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, and if they are not connected, then we need to find which nodes to remove (the smallest ones) that are necessary to connect",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to remove `k` contestants from `n` districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there's exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Greedy Selection**: Since the fan count for a district `i` is `2^i`, we prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected subtree. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered district and using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the tree, prioritizing higher-numbered nodes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) districts, which are the largest ones possible\n    # Start from the highest node and perform BFS/DFS, keeping track of visited nodes\n    # The nodes not visited in this process are the ones to be removed\n    \n    # We will use a priority queue (max-heap) approach, but since Python's heapq is min-heap,\n    # we can simulate a max-heap by pushing negative values. However, for simplicity, we can start from the largest node.\n    # Let's start from the largest node and do BFS to collect as many large nodes as possible.\n    \n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(n)\n    visited[n] = True\n    count = 1\n    \n    while q and count < (n - k):\n        u = q.popleft()\n        # Sort neighbors in descending order to prioritize larger nodes first\n        for v in sorted(tree[u], reverse=True):\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                count += 1\n                q.append(v)\n    \n    # Collect the nodes to remove\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    # Sort the result in increasing order\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Construction**: We first build the tree from the input edges.\n2. **BFS from Largest Node**: Starting from the highest-numbered node (which has the highest fan count), we use BFS to traverse the tree. This ensures we prioritize including higher-numbered nodes first.\n3. **Tracking Visited Nodes**: We keep track of visited nodes during BFS to ensure we only include nodes that form a connected component.\n4. **Determine Nodes to Remove**: After BFS completes, the nodes not visited are the ones to be removed. These are collected, sorted, and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by keeping the highest-numbered districts while maintaining connectivity through a greedy BFS traversal.",
