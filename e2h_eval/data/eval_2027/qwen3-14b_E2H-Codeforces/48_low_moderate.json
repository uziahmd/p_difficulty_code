He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, which could be Roman numerals. Oh right, and there are some edge cases to consider. Let me think about the steps needed here.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the second line is the number c in base a. So the plan is:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals instead of a regular base.\n\nSo the main steps are converting from base a to decimal, then converting from decimal to base b (or Roman).\n\nLet me start with the first part: converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay because when converting to decimal, leading zeros don't affect the value. However, for cases where the input is zero, but according to the note, if Roman numerals are involved, the number isn't zero. But in other cases, the number can be zero? Wait, the problem says that if Roman is included, the number is not zero. Otherwise, the number can be up to 1e15. So for the case where the input is zero, but the output is not Roman, we need to handle that. But according to the input description, the input c may have leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. Also, the input is guaranteed that if Roman is involved, it's not zero. So for the conversion from base a to decimal, I need to process the digits correctly.\n\nBut how to handle the digits? For example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the input is given as a string. Wait, the input is given as a string. For example, in the sample input, one of the cases is '12 13\\nA' which is converted to 'A' in base 13. So the input c may contain letters for bases higher than 10. So when converting from base a to decimal, each character in the string represents a digit in base a. So for example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). But the input c is given as a string, which may include letters. So I need to process each character in the string, converting it to its numerical value.\n\nSo for the first step, the function to convert the input string to decimal. Let's think about how to do that. For each character in the string, we need to get its value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So perhaps we can create a mapping for characters to their values. For example, for a digit in the string, if it's a digit (0-9), then its value is int(c). If it's a letter, then it's ord(c) - ord('A') + 10, but we need to make sure that the letters are uppercase. Wait, the problem says that the input c may contain letters? Well, the problem says that for bases greater than 10, letters are used. So the input c is given as a string, which may contain letters. So the code should read the string and process each character accordingly.\n\nSo for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, then it's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo the first step is to process the input string into a decimal value. Let's write a helper function for that. Let me think: the function takes the string and the base a, and returns the decimal integer. For each character in the string, we need to convert it to its value. Let's see:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        digit = int(c) if c.isdigit() else ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the input has letters that are invalid for the base? Like, for example, if the base is 10, but the input has 'A'? But according to the problem statement, the input is correct. So we don't have to handle invalid inputs.\n\nSo that's the first part. Now, once we have the decimal value, we need to convert it to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nSo the next part is converting from decimal to base b, or to Roman.\n\nLet's split this into two cases: when b is 'R' and when it's a",
    "response": "To solve the problem of converting a number from one base to another (or to Roman numerals), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the input number from base `a` to decimal**.\n2. **Convert the resulting decimal number to the desired output format**, which can be either:\n   - A number in base `b`, where `b` is an integer between 2 and 25.\n   - Roman numerals, if `b` is specified as `'R'`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Convert from Base `a` to Decimal\n\nEach digit in the input string represents a value in base `a`. For bases greater than 10, letters are used (e.g., A=10, B=11, ..., Z=35). We convert each character in the string to its corresponding numeric value and build the decimal representation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Convert from Decimal to Target Format\n\n#### Case A: Convert to Base `b` (where `b` is an integer)\n\n- If `b` is 1, we cannot proceed (but the problem constraints ensure `b >= 2`).\n- We repeatedly divide the number by `b`, collecting remainders.\n- We map digits greater than 9 to letters (e.g., 10 -> 'A', 11 -> 'B', etc.).\n- We reverse the collected digits to get the final result.\n\n#### Case B: Convert to Roman Numerals\n\n- We use a mapping of Roman numeral symbols to their values.\n- We subtract the largest possible value from the number and append the corresponding symbol.\n- We repeat this process until the number is reduced to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation in Python\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            digit = int(c)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n]\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    result = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            result += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        a_part, c_part = line.split('\\n')\n        a_str, b_str = a_part.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        c = c_part\n\n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n\n        # Determine the output format\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\n        else:\n            b = int(b_str)\n            print(decimal_to_base(decimal_value, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes on Edge Cases\n\n- The input number may have leading zeros, but they do not affect the value during conversion.\n- Roman numerals are only used when `b == 'R'`, and the number is guaranteed to be non-zero and ≤ 3000.\n- The output must omit leading zeros for numerical bases (e.g., if the result is `'00101'`, it should be printed as `'101'`).\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.",
