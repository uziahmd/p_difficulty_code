Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. The problem says that the X is formed when both diagonals have the same letters, and all other squares have the same letter different from the diagonals. So, how do I check this?\n\nFirst, let me think about the structure. For a square of size n x n where n is odd, the main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left. All the cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'o', and make sure that 'o' is not equal to 'd'.\n\nBut how to check these conditions?\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through the matrix. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if it's on either of these diagonals, it should be equal to the diagonal character. Otherwise, it should be equal to the other character.\n\nBut first, I need to collect all the diagonal characters and check they are the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are the same and different from the diagonal ones.\n\nWait, but there's a possibility that the diagonals have different characters. Like, maybe the main diagonal is 'x' and the anti-diagonal is 'y'. But according to the problem statement, both diagonals must have the same letters. So the first condition is that all elements on both diagonals are the same. So, for example, in the first sample input, the first case is:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nLooking at the diagonals. The main diagonal is positions (0,0) = x, (1,1)=o, (2,2)=x, (3,3)=o, (4,4)=x. Wait, but that's not all the same. Wait, the first line is xooox. So first row is x o o o x. Then second row o x o x o. Third row s o x o o. Fourth row o x o x o. Fifth row x o o o x.\n\nWait, the main diagonal would be (0,0) x, (1,1) x, (2,2) x, (3,3) x, (4,4) x? Wait no. Let me check:\n\nFor n=5, the indices go from 0 to 4. For the main diagonal, i = j. So for each row i, column i.\n\nRow 0: x (i=0, j=0)\nRow 1: x (i=1, j=1)\nRow 2: x (i=2, j=2)\nRow 3: x (i=3, j=3)\nRow 4: x (i=4, j=4). So the main diagonal is all x's?\n\nWait the third row is 'soxoo' — so row 2 (third line) is s o x o o. So (2,2) is x. Yes. Then the main diagonal is x, x, x, x, x. Then the anti-diagonal is when i + j = 4 (since n-1 is 4). So for (0,4) which is x, (1,3) which is x, (2,2) which is x, (3,1) which is x, (4,0) which is x. So both diagonals are all x's. Then the other cells must be same and different from x. But looking at the first row, the first and last are x. The middle three are o's. But in the third row, the third element is x (part of the diagonal), but the others? Let me check the third row: s o x o o. So the non-diagonal elements here are s, o, o. Wait, but the cell (2,0) is s. Which is not on the diagonal. So the non-diagonal elements must all be same. But in this case, there's s, o, etc. So that's why the first sample input gives NO. Because the non-diagonal elements are not same. So the problem is that the non-diagonal elements must all be same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Collect all the characters on the diagonals. Check that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all characters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Diagonals**: For an `n x n` grid where `n` is odd, the main diagonal consists of elements where the row index equals the column index (i.e., positions (i, i)). The anti-diagonal consists of elements where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n - 1` (i.e., positions (i, n-1-i)).\n2. **Check Diagonal Characters**: Collect all characters from both diagonals and ensure they are all the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Characters**: Collect all characters not on the diagonals and ensure they are all the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_char = None\nother_char = None\n\n# Check all diagonal elements and non-diagonal elements\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            # Check if it's the first diagonal character\n            if diag_char is None:\n                diag_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit()\n        else:\n            # Check if it's the first non-diagonal character\n            if other_char is None:\n                other_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit()\n\n# After checking all elements, verify that the two characters are different\nif diag_char == other_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Iterating Through Grid**: For each cell in the grid, check if it lies on either of the two diagonals.\n3. **Character Validation**:\n   - If the cell is on a diagonal, ensure all such cells have the same character (`diag_char`).\n   - If the cell is not on a diagonal, ensure all such cells have the same character (`other_char`).\n4. **Final Check**: Ensure that `diag_char` and `other_char` are different. If they are the same, print \"NO\"; otherwise, print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal given the constraints.",
