The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, and for the i-th ring, it's the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle is 4 less in both width and height. Because for example, the first ring is around the entire plate. Then the next ring would be inside, so the width and height are reduced by 2*2=4? Like, for the first ring, the rectangle is w x h, then the next is (w-4) x (h-4), etc. So each ring is the perimeter of that rectangle.\n\nSo the number of cells in each ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. But wait, the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter in cells would be the outer layer. For example, a rectangle of 3x3 cells: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice) → 8 cells. Which matches the first example input where 3x3 with 1 ring gives 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that each ring is possible. For example, if the current i-th ring's rectangle has width or height less than 1, but according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3, you can only have one ring. For a 7x9, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be up to 2. Which matches the third example where k=2.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum them all.\n\nSo the formula for each ring i (starting from 1 to k) is:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\nsum all these perimeters.\n\nWait, let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, current_w=3, current_h=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So i=1, current_w=7, current_h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example input: 7 9 2. For i=1: 7x9 → 28. For i=2: current_w = 7 - 4*(1) = 3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Sum 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So that's correct.\n\nSo the plan is to loop from 1 to k, compute for each i, the current width and height, compute the perimeter, add to total.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to do this?\n\nRead w, h, k from input. Then initialize total = 0. For each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\ntotal += perimeter\n\nThen print total.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So for example, when i is up to k, the current_w and current_h must be at least 1. Because the input constraints for k is floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me check for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then k can be 1. For i=1, 3 - 4*(0) = 3, which is okay. For k=2, min(w, h) must be at least 7? Because (7 + 1)/4 is 2. So for example, if min(w, h) is 7, then for i=2, 7 - 4*(1) = 3, which is okay. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me test another case. Suppose w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: current_w=5, current_h=5. perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16. \n\ni=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, that's 0. But that's a 1x1 cell. The perimeter would be zero, but according to the problem statement, each ring is the border of the inner rectangle. But for a 1x1 rectangle, there's no border. So the perimeter is zero. But according to the formula, yes.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). For w=5, h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code will not have to handle that case. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother example: w=7, h=7, k=2. Then for i=1, 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 24. For i=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Total is 24+8=32. So if input is 7 7 2, output is 32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then compute the sum as described.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in Python, the input is read as a single line. For example, the input could be given as '3 3 1' etc.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as above.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12=40. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line, split into three integers. Then loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter, sum.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me write it.\n",
