The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. And each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, we take the perimeter of that rectangle. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width w and height h is 2*(w + h - 2). Because each side contributes (w) and (h), but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Wait, for example, a rectangle of 3x3. The perimeter would be 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. The perimeter in terms of cells: for a rectangle of width w and height h, the number of cells in the perimeter (the outer ring) is 2*w + 2*(h-2). Because the top and bottom rows have w cells each, and the left and right sides (excluding the top and bottom) have (h-2) each. So total is 2w + 2(h-2) = 2(w + h -2). Alternatively, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter is 2*(m + n) -4. Because each side has m or n cells, but subtracting 4 because the four corners are counted twice. So yes, 2*(m + n - 2).\n\nSo for each ring i, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w' × h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1) and h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of that inner rectangle. So that's the perimeter of that rectangle. But then, for each i from 1 to k, we calculate that perimeter and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, what if the rectangle becomes too small? Like, for example, when i increases, the dimensions may become less than 1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3, the first ring is the perimeter. If you tried to do k=2, then the next ring would be (w -4*(2-1)) = 3-4= -1, which is invalid. But the input constraints ensure that k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. So we don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. The perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 -2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. The perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output of 28.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So first ring is perimeter of 7x9: 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring is for i=2, so dimensions are 7 -4*(1) = 3, 9-4*(1)=5. So the perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6 = 12. Wait, but 28 + 12 is 40, which matches the output. So that's correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo the plan is: loop for each i from 1 to k, compute the current width and height as w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then compute the perimeter for each, which is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Sum all those.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k. Then for each of the k rings, calculate the perimeter and add to the total.\n\nBut wait, let me check for i=1, the first ring. The formula for the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, let me test for the third example. For i=1, current_w =7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. For i=2, current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if w=5, h=5, k=2. Then first ring is 5x5: perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Second ring: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, but that's 2*(0) =0. So total would be 16+0=16? But that's not possible. Wait, but according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). For min(w,h)=5, (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So in this case, the input would not allow k=2. So our code is safe.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then loop from 1 to k, compute current_w and current_h, then perimeter, add to total.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Let's compute:\n\ncurrent_w =3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nNow, what about when k is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be the answer.\n\nAnother case: w=4, h=4, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(4+4-2)= 2*6=12. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
