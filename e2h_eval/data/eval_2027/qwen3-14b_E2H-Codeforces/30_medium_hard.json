Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. Each takes exactly n moves, and the order of taking digits depends on who goes first each turn. The challenge is to find the sequence of H and M moves that gives the maximum total.\n\nHmm, the key here is that for each step, the choice of who takes the next digit affects the future possibilities. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. So a brute force approach would be O(2^36), which is way too big. That's impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible n? For n=18, 2n=36 steps. So maybe a dynamic programming approach with memoization. But even then, the state space might be too large. Let's think about the state parameters.\n\nAt any point in the game, the state can be represented by how many digits have been taken by Homer and Marge. Let's say that Homer has taken h moves and Marge has taken m moves. Since each move is either H or M, and the total steps is 2n, we have h + m = current step. Also, since each must take exactly n moves, h can range from 0 to n, and m similarly. So the state can be represented as (h, m). However, since h + m = steps taken so far, which is equal to (h + m) = t steps. So for a given h and m, t is fixed. So the state can be represented by (h, m), but since h + m = t, perhaps we can represent it with just h and m, but with the constraint that h + m ≤ 2n and h ≤n, m ≤n.\n\nBut how do we model the choices here? Because at each step, the next move is either H or M, but only if they haven't taken n moves yet. For example, if h is already n, then the next move must be M, and vice versa.\n\nThe problem is to choose between H and M at each step, such that the sum of S1 and S2 is maximized. But how do we model the sum? Because the digits are being added to the front of their numbers. Wait, no. Wait, when a player takes a digit, they append it to their number. So for example, if the initial A is '1234', and Homer takes first, then his number becomes '1', then the next digit is '2', and if Marge takes it, her number is '2', etc. So the actual value of S1 and S2 depends on the order in which digits are taken. However, the sum S1 + S2 is the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective place values. Wait, but since each digit is taken once, and added to either S1 or S2, the total sum is the sum of each digit multiplied by 10^k, where k depends on when the digit was taken.\n\nWait, but the position of the digit in their own number determines its contribution. For example, if a digit is taken as the first move, it's the first digit of the number, which is multiplied by 10^{n-1} for Homer (since he takes n digits). Wait, no. Suppose Homer takes a digit in his i-th move (i ranges from 1 to n). Then that digit will be the i-th digit in his number. Since the number is built by appending digits, the first digit taken is the first digit of the number, then the next is the second, etc. So the value of the digit depends on its position in the number. For example, the first digit taken contributes digit * 10^{n-1}, the second contributes digit * 10^{n-2}, etc. So for each digit in the original A, the position in which it is taken (i.e., which move it is taken in for the respective player) determines its contribution to the total sum.\n\nBut since the total sum is the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective place values in their own numbers, how can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total sum can be considered as the sum of each digit multiplied by 10^p, where p depends on when the digit was taken. For example, if a digit is taken as the k-th digit of Homer's number, then its contribution is digit * 10^{n - k} (assuming Homer's number has n digits). Similarly for Marge's digits.\n\nBut how do we track this during the DP process?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps the key insight here is that the order of taking digits affects the place value of each digit. For example, taking a digit early gives it a higher place value. Therefore, the problem reduces to choosing which player takes which digits, in such a way that the sum of their digits' place values is maximized.\n\nBut how do we model that in the DP?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that the digits are taken in order. The original number A is processed left to right. At each step, the first digit is taken by either Homer or Marge. Once taken, it's removed from A. So the order of taking digits is determined by the sequence of H and M choices.\n\nSo for the DP state, we can track how many digits Homer and Marge have already taken. Let's say that Homer has taken h digits, and Marge has taken m digits. The total steps taken is h + m. The next digit to take is the (h + m + 1)-th digit of the original A. Then, the next move can be H or M, provided that h < n or m < n respectively.\n\nFor each state (h, m), we can decide whether to take H or M next. The choice will affect the contribution of the current digit to the total sum.\n\nBut how to compute the contribution of the current digit? Let's say that the current digit is d. If it's taken by Homer, then it's his (h+1)-th digit. Since Homer's number has n digits, the place value of this digit is 10^{n - (h+1)}. Similarly for Marge.\n\nSo the contribution of taking d as H's next digit is d * 10^{n - h - 1} (since h is the current count, adding one makes it h+1). Similarly for Marge: d * 10^{n - m - 1}.\n\nWait, but wait. For example, if Homer has taken h digits, then when he takes another digit, it's his (h+1)th digit. So in his number, this digit will be in position (h+1), which in terms of place value is 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nYes. So for the current digit, if we choose to assign it to Homer, the contribution is d * 10^{n - h - 1}. Similarly for Marge, it's d * 10^{n - m - 1}.\n\nTherefore, the DP state can be (h, m), and for each state, we can choose the best option between H and M (if allowed).\n\nSo the DP transition would be:\n\ndp[h][m] = max( (current digit's contribution for H) + dp[h+1][m], (current digit's contribution for M) + dp[h][m+1] )\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, h and m can be up to 18. So the total number of states is (18+1) * (18+1) = 361, which is manageable.\n\nWait, that's a very small number. So the DP approach is feasible here.\n\nBut how to compute the current digit for a given state (h, m)? Because the current digit is the (h + m + 1)-th digit of the original A. For example, when h=0 and m=0, the first digit is taken. Then, when h=1 and m=0, the next digit is the second one, etc.\n\nSo the original A is a string of length 2n. Let's index it from 0 to 2n-1. Then, for a state (h, m), the current digit is the (h + m)-th index (since 0-based). Wait, because when h + m steps have been taken, the next digit is the (h + m)th digit in the original string. For example, when h=0 and m=0, the next digit is the 0-th (first) digit. After taking that, h + m is 1, so next digit is 1st, etc. So the current digit is A[h + m].\n\nSo for each state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m].\n\nSo the DP approach can be memoized with these parameters. The base case is when h = n and m = n, which means all digits have been taken, and the total contribution is 0.\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\nFor each (h, m), if h + m == 2n, return 0.\n\nElse, the current digit is A[h + m]. Then, if h < n and m < n, we can choose either H or M. But if h == n, then only M can take the next step. Similarly, if m == n, only H can take.\n\nSo the DP function would look like this:\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h + m == 2n:\n        return 0\n    if memo has (h, m):\n        return memo[(h, m)]\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n    if h == n:\n        # only M can take\n        res = current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp(h, m + 1)\n    elif m == n:\n        # only H can take\n        res = current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp(h + 1, m)\n    else:\n        option1 = current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp(h + 1, m)\n        option2 = current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp(h, m + 1)\n        res = max(option1, option2)\n    memo[(h, m)] = res\n    return res\n\nBut then, the problem is not only to compute the maximum sum, but also to reconstruct the path (the sequence of H and M choices). So we need to track not just the maximum value, but also the decisions made at each step.\n\nSo, for the DP, we can use memoization to store both the maximum value and the choice made (H or M) for each state.\n\nBut how to compute the exponents? Well, for each digit, when it's taken by Homer or Marge, the exponent depends on how many digits they have already taken. For example, when Homer has taken h digits, and takes another, the new count is h+1. The place value for that digit is 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nBut calculating 10^something for exponents up to n=18. For n=18, the maximum exponent is 17 (when h is 0, and the first digit is taken by Homer, contributing 10^(18-1) = 10^17). However, since the digits can be up to 9, and multiplied by 1e17, the sum could be up to 9* (n * 1e17) which is manageable as a Python integer.\n\nBut how do we compute these exponents efficiently? We can precompute them. For example, for each possible h and m, the exponents can be calculated as needed. Alternatively, precompute a power array.\n\nBut for the purposes of the DP, we can compute the value on the fly. For example, for a given h and m, when we take the current digit as H, the exponent is (n - h - 1). Wait, let me think again. For Homer's (h+1)th move, the digit is placed as the (h+1)th digit in his number. Since he has n digits, the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, ..., the nth by 10^0. So the exponent is (n - (h+1)) ?\n\nWait, for h=0, when he takes the first digit, it's the first digit of his number. So exponent is n-1. So yes, when h is the current count, taking another digit would be (h+1)th digit, so exponent is n - (h+1) = n - h - 1. Correct.\n\nSo the contribution is digit * 10^{n - h - 1} if taken by Homer, and digit * 10^{n - m - 1} if taken by Marge.\n\nSo, the DP approach is feasible.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this DP with memoization and also track the path of choices (H or M) made at each step.\n\nBut for n up to 18, the number of states is (19)^2 = 361. So for each state, we can compute the maximum sum and track which choice leads to it.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the powers of 10 up to 1e18, but since n can be up to 18, the maximum exponent is 18-0-1 = 17. So 10^17 is manageable.\n\nBut for each digit, when it's taken, we can compute 10 ** (n - h - 1) or similar.\n\nBut in Python, exponentiation is easy.\n\nNow, for memoization, we can use memoization via a dictionary or a memo table. However, since the parameters h and m are small, a memo table can be implemented as a 2D array.\n\nBut for the path reconstruction, we need to know for each state (h, m) which choice (H or M) was taken to reach the maximum value.\n\nSo, during the DP computation, we can store both the maximum value and the choice made. Then, once the DP is computed, we can start from (0, 0) and for each step, choose the decision (H or M) that was stored, until we reach (n, n).\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nWe can have two memo tables: one for the maximum value, and another for the choice (H or M) made at each state.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, for each state, we can compute the best choice and store it.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Read n and A (as a string).\n- Precompute the digits of A as integers.\n- Implement a memoization-based DP function that returns the maximum sum and the choice (H or M) for each state (h, m).\n\nBut for Python, recursion with memoization may be feasible for small state sizes. However, for n=18, the maximum recursion depth would be 2n = 36 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can implement the DP using memoization via memo tables and iterative methods.\n\nBut for code simplicity, perhaps memoization via lru_cache with memoization.\n\nBut considering that for n=18, the number of states is 19 * 19 = 361, and each state can be processed quickly, recursion is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, using functools.lru_cache is convenient.\n\nBut since the digits are needed for each state, and the current digit is determined by h + m, we can compute that.\n\nBut the problem is that for the DP function, the current digit depends on h and m, which are the parameters. So the DP function can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the problem is that the DP needs to return both the maximum value and the choice made. So perhaps we can use memoization for the maximum value, and then another memoization for the choice. Or, during the DP, when we compute the maximum value, we can also record the choice.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP, once the maximum value is computed, we can backtrack through the choices.\n\nBut for backtracking, once the DP is filled, we can start from (0, 0) and for each step, check whether choosing H or M gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose we have a memo table called dp_value[h][m], which stores the maximum total sum achievable from state (h, m). Then, for each state (h, m), we can determine whether choosing H or M gives the maximum value. So, for the state (h, m), if h < n and m < n, then:\n\ncurrent_digit = A[h + m]\n\noption1 = current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp_value[h+1][m]\n\noption2 = current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp_value[h][m+1]\n\nif option1 >= option2, then the choice is H, else M.\n\nSo during the backtracking phase, we can determine the choice for each state.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the dp_value table using dynamic programming, starting from the base case (h = n, m = n) which is 0.\n\n2. Then, reconstruct the path by starting from (0, 0) and at each step, choosing H or M based on which option gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to compute the dp_value table?\n\nWe can use memoization with recursion, or use iterative DP.\n\nLet's think of the iterative approach.\n\nWe can create a 2D array dp_value of size (n+1) x (n+1). The entries dp_value[h][m] represent the maximum sum achievable from state (h, m).\n\nWe can fill this table in a bottom-up manner. Since the transitions depend on states with higher h or m. For example, dp_value[h][m] depends on dp_value[h+1][m] and dp_value[h][m+1]. Therefore, we can process the states in reverse order, starting from h + m = 2n-1 down to 0.\n\nWait, for h and m such that h + m = k, where k ranges from 2n down to 0. But since h and m can't exceed n, for each possible h and m, we can process them in order of decreasing h + m.\n\nSo for example, for the maximum possible h + m, which is 2n (when h = n and m = n), the value is zero. Then for h + m = 2n - 1, which can be (n, n-1) or (n-1, n), etc.\n\nSo the steps for filling dp_value:\n\nInitialize dp_value[h][m] for all h and m where h + m = 2n (only (n, n)) as 0.\n\nThen for each k from 2n-1 down to 0:\n\n   for all possible h and m such that h + m = k:\n\n      if h > n or m > n: skip\n\n      current_digit = A[k] (since h + m = k, the next digit is A[k], which is the (k)th index in 0-based)\n\n      if h == n:\n\n          dp_value[h][m] = current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp_value[h][m+1]\n\n      elif m == n:\n\n          dp_value[h][m] = current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp_value[h+1][m]\n\n      else:\n\n          option1 = current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp_value[h+1][m]\n\n          option2 = current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp_value[h][m+1]\n\n          dp_value[h][m] = max(option1, option2)\n\nBut how to iterate over h and m for each k?\n\nWell, for each k, h can range from max(0, k - n) to min(n, k), and m = k - h. But since m must be <= n, we have h >= k - n, and h <= min(n, k).\n\nBut perhaps for each k, we can iterate h from 0 to n, and check if m = k - h is between 0 and n.\n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps:\n\nfor k in range(2n-1, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in range(0, n+1):\n\n        m = k - h\n\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # process (h, m)\n\nThis way, for each k, we check all possible h and compute m.\n\nOnce the dp_value table is filled, then we can reconstruct the path.\n\nReconstructing the path:\n\nStart with h = 0, m = 0.\n\nAt each step, check whether the current state (h, m) allows for H or M.\n\nIf h == n: must choose M.\n\nIf m == n: must choose H.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck which option (H or M) gives the maximum value. For the current state (h, m), the value is dp_value[h][m].\n\nThe current digit is A[k], where k = h + m.\n\noption1 is current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp_value[h+1][m]\n\noption2 is current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp_value[h][m+1]\n\nIf option1 >= option2, choose H, else choose M.\n\nBut how do we compute option1 and option2? Well, since we have the dp_value table, we can compute these options.\n\nBut during the reconstruction phase, we can compute this for each state.\n\nSo during the reconstruction, for each step, we can check which choice (H or M) was taken.\n\nOnce the choice is determined, we append 'H' or 'M' to the result, and increment h or m accordingly.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, read n and A. For example, input is given as two lines: first line is n, second line is A. But in the sample input, the user provided something like ['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911'], which seems like multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as first line n, second line A. So in the example, the user shows two examples. But the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is one case.\n\nSo the code will read n and A as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nThen, precompute the digits as a list of integers.\n\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\nThen, compute the dp_value table.\n\nBut for the exponents, we can compute 10 ** (n - h - 1) etc. However, for n up to 18, and h up to 18, this is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, exponents can be computed as pow(10, exponent).\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps precompute all possible powers. For example, for exponents from 0 to 18.\n\nBut for code simplicity, perhaps compute them on the fly.\n\nNow, the code for the dp_value:\n\nInitialize a 2D array of (n+1) x (n+1) elements. Since n can be up to 18, the size is 19x19, which is trivial.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = ... \n\ndigits = ... \n\ndp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nThen, for k in range(2*n - 1, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in range(0, n+1):\n\n        m = k - h\n\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # process (h, m)\n\n        if h + m == 2*n:\n\n            # already initialized to 0\n\n            continue\n\n        current_digit = digits[k]\n\n        if h == n:\n\n            # must take M\n\n            # m is currently m, and after taking, m becomes m + 1\n\n            # the contribution is current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1}\n\n            contribution = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1))\n\n            dp[h][m] = contribution + dp[h][m+1]\n\n        elif m == n:\n\n            contribution = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1))\n\n            dp[h][m] = contribution + dp[h+1][m]\n\n        else:\n\n            # compute option1 and option2\n\n            option1 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n            option2 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n\n            dp[h][m] = max(option1, option2)\n\nWait, but for the case when h + m = k, and we are processing the state (h, m), the next steps are h+1, m or h, m+1, which have h + m + 1 = k + 1, which would have been processed earlier (since we are processing k in descending order). So yes, the dp for h+1, m and h, m+1 are already computed.\n\nOnce the dp table is filled, then the path reconstruction can be done.\n\nNow, the path reconstruction.\n\nInitialize h = 0, m = 0.\n\nresult = []\n\nfor _ in range(2*n):\n\n    if h == n:\n\n        # must take M\n\n        result.append('M')\n\n        m += 1\n\n    elif m == n:\n\n        # must take H\n\n        result.append('H')\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        current_k = h + m\n\n        current_digit = digits[current_k]\n\n        # compute option1 and option2\n\n        option1 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n        option2 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n\n        if option1 >= option2:\n\n            result.append('H')\n\n            h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            result.append('M')\n\n            m += 1\n\nThen, the result is a list of 'H' and 'M' characters, which is joined into a string and printed.\n\nBut wait, the code for path reconstruction must check for the current state (h, m) and decide which choice gives the maximum value. However, during the dp_value calculation, the dp_value[h][m] is the maximum of the two options. So comparing option1 and option2 gives the correct choice.\n\nBut why not compare the two options directly?\n\nYes. Because the dp_value[h][m] is set to max(option1, option2). So during reconstruction, for each (h, m), the decision is based on which option is larger.\n\nBut how to handle the case when option1 equals option2? The problem says that any correct solution can be output. So in that case, we can choose either option.\n\nThus, the code for reconstruction is as above.\n\nBut there's a problem here: the code for the dp_value uses the same formula as the reconstruction. However, during the dp_value calculation, the code uses the same formula. So the reconstruction is correct.\n\nNow, testing this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nSample Output: HHMM\n\nLet's see.\n\nn=2, A is '1234' (digits [1,2,3,4])\n\nThe dp table is filled for h and m from 0 to 2.\n\nLet's see the steps for the dp.\n\nProcessing k from 3 down to 0.\n\nFor k=3 (h + m = 3). Possible (h, m) pairs:\n\nh can be 2, m=1 (since 2+1=3). Also h=1, m=2 (1+2=3). But for h=2, m=1: h is 2 (n=2), so m can be 1 (<=2). Similarly for h=1, m=2.\n\nBut for k=3, which is 2n-1 = 3 (since 2n=4). So for each of these states:\n\nFirst, for (h=2, m=1):\n\ncurrent_digit is digits[3] = 4.\n\nh == n (2), so must take M. The contribution is 4 * 10^{n - m -1} = 4 * 10^{2-1-1} = 4 * 10^0 = 4. Then add dp[2][2], which is 0. So dp[2][1] = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nFor (h=1, m=2): m is n=2. So must take H. current digit is 4. Contribution is 4 * 10^{2 -1 -1} = 4 * 10^0 = 4. Add dp[2][2] (0). So dp[1][2] = 4.\n\nNext, k=2. For h + m =2. Possible (h, m) pairs:\n\nh=0, m=2 (but m=2 is n, so h=0, m=2. Then, since m is n, must take H. current digit is digits[2] = 3. contribution is 3 * 10^{2-0-1} = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then add dp[1][2] which is 4. So dp[0][2] = 30 +4=34.\n\nh=1, m=1. Both less than n. current digit is digits[2] =3.\n\noption1: take H. contribution 3 * 10^{2-1-1} =3 * 10^0 =3. Then add dp[2][1] =4. Total 3+4=7.\n\noption2: take M. contribution 3 * 10^{2-1-1} =3 *1=3. add dp[1][2] =4. total 7. So dp[1][1] =7. Either choice is acceptable. So during reconstruction, we can choose either.\n\nh=2, m=0: h is 2, must take M. current digit is digits[2] =3. contribution is 3 * 10^{2 -0 -1} =3 *10^1=30. add dp[2][1] which is 4. total 34. So dp[2][0] =34.\n\nThen k=1. For h + m=1.\n\nPossible (h, m) pairs:\n\nh=0, m=1. current digit is digits[1] =2.\n\noption1: take H. contribution 2 * 10^{2-0-1} = 2*10^1=20. add dp[1][1] =7. total 27.\n\noption2: take M. contribution 2 * 10^{2-1-1} =2*10^0=2. add dp[0][2] =34. total 36. So dp[0][1] =36.\n\nh=1, m=0. current digit is 2.\n\noption1: take H. contribution 2 * 10^{2-1-1} =2*10^0=2. add dp[2][0] =34. total 36.\n\noption2: take M. contribution 2 * 10^{2-0-1} =2*10^1=20. add dp[1][1] =7. total 27. So dp[1][0] =36.\n\nk=0. h + m=0. h=0, m=0. current digit is digits[0] =1.\n\noption1: take H. contribution 1 * 10^{2-0-1} =1*10^1=10. add dp[1][0] =36. total 46.\n\noption2: take M. contribution 1 * 10^{2-0-1} =10. add dp[0][1] =36. total 46. So dp[0][0] =46. Either choice is acceptable.\n\nDuring reconstruction, starting from (0,0):\n\ncurrent_k = 0. h=0, m=0.\n\noption1 and option2 are both 46. So can choose either H or M.\n\nBut the sample output is 'HHMM', which implies that first two are H.\n\nSo during reconstruction, when options are equal, the code can choose H or M. So for the first step, the code would choose H, then proceed.\n\nLet's see. Let's simulate the path reconstruction.\n\nh=0, m=0.\n\ncurrent_k=0. current_digit=1.\n\noption1: 1*10^(2-0-1) + dp[1][0] = 10 + 36 =46.\n\noption2: same. So choose H (arbitrary choice). So append 'H', h becomes 1.\n\nNow h=1, m=0. current_k=1. current_digit=2.\n\noption1: take H. contribution is 2 * 10^{2 -1-1} =2*10^0=2. dp[2][0] is 34. total 2+34=36.\n\noption2: take M. 2 * 10^{2-0-1} = 2*10^1=20. dp[1][1] is 7. total 27. So choose H. append 'H', h becomes 2.\n\nNow h=2, m=0. current_k=2. current_digit=3. Must take M. append 'M', m becomes 1.\n\nNow h=2, m=1. current_k=3. current_digit=4. Must take M. append 'M', m becomes 2. Now done. So the sequence is HHMM, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother possibility is if during the first step, the code chooses M. Then the path would be MHMM, which would also give the same total sum. But the sample output is HHMM, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code's choice during reconstruction when options are equal can be arbitrary, but the problem allows any correct sequence.\n\nSo the code for reconstruction is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut there is one thing to note: for exponents, 10 ** (n - h - 1) can be very large. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and A.\n\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with 0.\n\nThen, for k in range(2n-1, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in 0...n:\n\n        m = k - h\n\n        if m < 0 or m >n: continue\n\n        if h + m == 2n: continue (already 0)\n\n        current_digit = digits[k]\n\n        if h == n:\n\n            contribution = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m -1))\n\n            dp[h][m] = contribution + dp[h][m+1]\n\n        elif m == n:\n\n            contribution = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h -1))\n\n            dp[h][m] = contribution + dp[h+1][m]\n\n        else:\n\n            option1 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h -1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n            option2 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m -1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n\n            dp[h][m] = max(option1, option2)\n\nOnce that is done, reconstruct the path.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut for the loop over k, 2n is 2 * n. For example, when n=2, 2n is 4. So for k in range(2n-1, -1, -1) → 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nBut in Python, the range is exclusive of the end. So for example, range(a, b, step) includes a but stops before b. So to generate from 2n-1 down to 0 inclusive, the code should be:\n\nfor k in range(2 * n - 1, -1, -1):\n\nBut in Python, the range is written as range(start, stop, step). So for example, to go from 3 down to 0, it's range(3, -1, -1). Because the stop is exclusive. So when you have range(3, -1, -1), it includes 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\nsize = 2 * n\n\n# Initialize dp table\ndp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor k in range(2 * n - 1, -1, -1):\n    for h in range(n+1):\n        m = k - h\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n            continue\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            continue  # already 0\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a number A, where each player takes exactly n digits, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers formed by these digits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a 2D DP table where `dp[h][m]` represents the maximum total prize money achievable when Homer has taken `h` digits and Marge has taken `m` digits.\n2. **State Transition**: For each state `(h, m)`, compute the maximum value by considering both possible moves (Homer or Marge) and their respective contributions based on the position of the digit in their number.\n3. **Reconstruction of Path**: After filling the DP table, reconstruct the sequence of moves by backtracking from the initial state `(0, 0)` to the final state `(n, n)`, choosing the move (Homer or Marge) that leads to the maximum prize value at each step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\nsize = 2 * n\n\n# Initialize dp table\ndp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor k in range(2 * n - 1, -1, -1):\n    for h in range(n+1):\n        m = k - h\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n            continue\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            continue  # already initialized to 0\n        current_digit = digits[k]\n        if h == n:\n            contribution = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1))\n            dp[h][m] = contribution + dp[h][m+1]\n        elif m == n:\n            contribution = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1))\n            dp[h][m] = contribution + dp[h+1][m]\n        else:\n            option1 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n            option2 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n            dp[h][m] = max(option1, option2)\n\n# Reconstruct the path\nh, m = 0, 0\nresult = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n):\n    if h == n:\n        result.append('M')\n        m += 1\n    elif m == n:\n        result.append('H')\n        h += 1\n    else:\n        current_k = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[current_k]\n        option1 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n        option2 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n        if option1 >= option2:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('M')\n            m += 1\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized to store the maximum prize values for each state `(h, m)`.\n2. **Filling the DP Table**: We iterate from the end of the number towards the beginning, calculating the optimal value for each state by considering the contribution of the current digit if taken by either Homer or Marge.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Starting from the initial state `(0, 0)`, we determine the optimal move (Homer or Marge) at each step by comparing the potential future values stored in the DP table, ensuring the sequence of moves maximizes the total prize.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal sequence using dynamic programming, ensuring that both players take exactly `n` digits and maximizing their combined prize money.",
