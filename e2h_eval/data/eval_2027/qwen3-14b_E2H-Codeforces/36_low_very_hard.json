The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what configurations of towers are valid. Let's think about the conditions. The signal power for each tower must be set so that:\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n- Each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nLet me think about how the towers can be arranged. For example, if there's a tower at position i, its signal power p must be such that it covers some towns, but not 0 or n+1. Also, each town must be covered exactly once.\n\nWait, the signal power p for a tower at i can reach cities c where |c - i| < p. So, for a tower at i, the maximum distance it can reach is p-1. So, the signal power p must be at least 1. But for the tower to not cover town 0, the coverage can't include 0. Similarly for town n+1.\n\nSo, for a tower at position i, the maximum reach is p-1. To not cover town 0, the tower's coverage can't reach 0. That means, for the tower at i, the maximum reach (p-1) must be less than i. Because if p-1 >= i, then i - (p-1) would be negative, which would include town 0. Wait, no. Let's think: the tower at i can reach town 0 if |0 - i| < p → i < p. So, to prevent town 0 from being covered, we must have p ≤ i. Similarly, for town n+1, we must have p ≤ (n+1 - i). Because |(n+1) - i| < p → (n+1 -i) < p → p > (n+1 -i). Wait, no. Wait, the condition is that town n+1 is not covered. So for the tower at i, the distance between i and n+1 is (n+1 - i). For the tower's signal to not reach there, we must have that (n+1 - i) ≥ p. So p ≤ (n+1 - i). Therefore, for any tower, its signal power p must satisfy p ≤ min(i, n+1 -i). But since p is at least 1, this implies that for a tower to exist, it must be possible to choose p such that these conditions hold.\n\nBut the main problem is not just about individual towers, but arranging the entire set of towers such that each town is covered exactly once. How can we model this?\n\nMaybe the key is to find all subsets of towers that can be arranged in a way that each town is covered exactly once. Then, compute the probability as (number of valid subsets) / (2^n), since each subset has probability 1/(2^n).\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of valid subsets of towers (each subset is a selection of towns 1..n, each included with probability 1/2) that can be assigned signal powers to meet the constraints. Then, the answer is (count) * inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nNow the challenge is to compute this count efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the structure of valid subsets. For a subset to be valid, there must be a way to assign signal powers such that:\n\n- Each town 1..n is covered exactly once.\n- Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nHow can such a configuration look? Let's think of the coverage as intervals. Each tower's coverage is an interval [i - p + 1, i + p - 1], but since p can be chosen, perhaps there's a way to model this as intervals that partition the towns 1..n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the valid subsets are those that form a certain kind of pattern. For example, in the first sample input where n=2, the valid subset is {1,2}. Then each tower can have p=1, covering their own town only. That way, town 1 is covered by tower 1, town 2 by tower 2. Also, town 0 is not covered by any tower (since p=1 for tower 1: |0-1| =1, which is not less than 1. So yes. Similarly for town 3 (n+1=3). So that's valid.\n\nAnother example given is when n=5 and towers are at 2,4,5. Then tower 2 can have p=2, covering",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Configurations**: A valid configuration of towers must allow each town from 1 to n to be covered exactly once by some tower's signal, while ensuring towns 0 and n+1 are not covered. This can be modeled using dynamic programming (DP) to count valid configurations efficiently.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We define `dp[i]` as the number of valid ways to place towers up to position `i` such that the constraints are satisfied. The recurrence relation involves considering whether to place a tower at position `i` or not, and ensuring coverage constraints are met.\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle divisions and ensure all operations are performed under the given modulus.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: no towns considered\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: do not build a tower at i\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]\n        \n        # Case 2: build a tower at i\n        # It must cover town i and possibly some to the left\n        # But also ensure that the previous coverage ends before i\n        # So the previous tower must end at i-1\n        # So we can look back to j where j is such that the tower at j covers up to i-1\n        # This is similar to the problem of tiling with dominoes or similar\n        # Here, we can consider that the tower at i must cover from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1\n        # To ensure that town i is covered and that town i+1 is not covered (if any)\n        # However, for the DP approach, we can think that when placing a tower at i, it must cover town i, and the previous part must be covered up to i-1.\n        # Therefore, we can add dp[i - 1] (but wait, no, because the tower at i can cover some towns to the left)\n        # Alternatively, the idea is that the tower at i must cover town i, and the previous coverage must end before i.\n        # Therefore, the previous valid configuration must end at i-1, and then we place a tower at i with power 1 (covers only i)\n        # But there might be other possibilities where the tower at i has larger power, covering more towns to the left.\n        # However, for the DP approach, we can think that the tower at i must be the first tower that covers town i, and the previous coverage must end before i.\n        # Thus, the number of ways to have a tower at i is equal to the number of ways to have a valid configuration up to i-1, and then place a tower at i.\n        # But this seems too simplistic.

For n=5, it's 5/32.\n        # Looking at the values, it seems that the number of valid configurations is the (n)th Fibonacci number divided by 2^n.\n        # Wait, for n=2, the count is 1, which is F(2) = 1. For n=3, count is 2 (since 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4). For n=5, count is 5 (since 5/32).\n        # So perhaps the count is the (n)th Fibonacci number.
