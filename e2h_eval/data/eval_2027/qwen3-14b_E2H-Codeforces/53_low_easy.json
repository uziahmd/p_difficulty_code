Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the answer for that case is 3.\n\nThe input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. If there's no such substring (like in 'abcd' where all characters are unique), the output is 0.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to generate all possible substrings of the given string, check which ones appear at least twice, and then find the maximum length among them.\n\nBut generating all substrings could be computationally intensive, but since the maximum length of the string is 100, it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. For all possible substring lengths, starting from the maximum possible down to 1, check if there's a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\nOnce we find the maximum such length, we can return it.\n\nSo for example, for a string of length N, the maximum possible substring length is N-1 (if the first and second characters are same, etc). But for each possible length L, we need to check all possible substrings of length L and see if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over possible lengths L from the maximum possible (which is len(s) - 1) down to 1. For each L, check all possible substrings of length L. For each substring, check if it appears at least two times in the string. If yes, return L as the answer. Because we're checking from largest to smallest, the first occurrence of such a substring would be the maximum possible.\n\nIf after checking all lengths down to 1, no such substring is found, return 0.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently?\n\nFor each possible L (starting from max possible down to 1):\n\n   For each starting index i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n       check if this substring appears again in the string (at least once more)\n\n       if yes, then return L as the answer.\n\nBut how to check if the substring appears again?\n\nWe can collect all substrings of length L and count their occurrences. If any count is >=2, then return L.\n\nBut for each L, we can generate all substrings of that length, store them in a dictionary with counts, and check if any count is >=2.\n\nAlternatively, for each substring of length L, check if it exists in the rest of the string.\n\nBut for small N (up to 100), even O(N^3) approaches would work.\n\nLet me think about the steps for code:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCompute N = len(s).\n\nIf N is 0, return 0 (but the problem says the string is non-empty).\n\nInitialize the maximum length as 0.\n\nFor L in range from N-1 down to 1:\n\n   create a set or a dictionary to track the substrings of length L.\n\n   for i in 0 to N-L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr is already in the set, then return L as the answer (since we are checking from largest to smallest, first occurrence is the maximum)\n\n       else add it to the set.\n\n   After checking all substrings of length L, if any duplicates were found, return L.\n\nWait, but the above approach would miss cases where a substring appears more than once but not in the first occurrence. For example, if the first occurrence is at i=0, and another at i=2. But when processing i=0, we add it to the set. Then when processing i=2, we check if it's in the set. If yes, then return L.\n\nSo for each L, we can iterate through all possible substrings, and for each, check if it has been seen before. If yes, then return L.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n\n        current_substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if current_substring in seen:\n\n            return L\n\n        seen.add(current_substring)\n\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but this would miss some cases? Like if a substring appears three times. For example, the first occurrence is added to the set. The second occurrence checks and finds it in the set, returns L. So that's correct.\n\nBut for example, in the case of 'zzz', for L=2:\n\nthe substrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2).",
