    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But you can't swap 0 and 2 directly. So, what's the approach here?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the allowed swaps. Since we can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, but not 0 and 2. So, the key here is that 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s. But 0s can't move past 2s. Wait, but maybe through some indirect way? Like, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, maybe we can move the 0 past the 1 and then the 1 past the 2, but that would allow the 0 to end up before the 2. Wait, no. Because the 0 can move past the 1, but the 1 can move past the 2. But if you have 0,1,2, then you can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1,0,2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. Wait, but the 0 and 2 are not adjacent. So maybe the 0 can't move past the 2. So in this case, the order of 0 and 2 can't be changed. Wait, but maybe if there's a 1 between them?\n\nLike, if you have 0, 1, 2. Then you can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1, 0, 2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. So that's not allowed. So the 0 can't get past the 2. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because any 0 that's before a 2 can't move past it. Because to do that would require moving through a 1. But even if there's a 1 between them, the 0 can move left or right through 1s, but the 2 can only move through 1s. So maybe the 0s and 2s can't pass each other. So the original positions of 0s and 2s relative to each other are fixed. Wait, that seems important.\n\nSo, for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 will still be before the 2. Because you can't swap them. Similarly, if there's a 2 followed by a 0, then they can't be swapped. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. But the 1s can move around, as long as they are between 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think again. Suppose I have a 0 and a 2. If they are not adjacent, but there are 1s in between. For example, 0, 1, 1, 2. Then the 0 can move to the right through the 1s, and the 2 can move to the left through the 1s. So maybe they can meet. But when they meet, they can't swap. So the 0 can move as far right as possible until it hits a 2. But once it's next to a 2, they can't swap. So the relative order between 0 and 2 is fixed. So in the original string, if a 0 comes before a 2, then in the final string, all 0s that were before 2s in the original string will remain before those 2s. Similarly for 2s that were before 0s.\n\nSo, this suggests that the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. Only the 1s can be moved around. So, the approach is to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, but arrange the 1s in between as much as possible.\n\nWait, but how can we arrange the 1s? Because 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. For example, a 1 can move left through 0s (since 0 and 1 can be swapped) and right through 2s (since 1 and 2 can be swapped). So the 1s can be moved anywhere between the 0s and 2s. Wait, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. So, perhaps the 1s can be placed in any positions between the 0s and 2s. So the idea is that the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order, and the 1s can be placed in between them. But how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the first sample input: \"100210\". The output is \"001120\".\n\nOriginal string: 1 0 0 2 1 0.\n\nThe 0s and 2s in the original string are in positions where the 0s are before the 2. So the 0s and 2s must remain in that order. The 2 is in position 4, and the 0s are before that. So in the final string, the 0s and 2s must be ordered as per the original. So the 0s and 2s can be arranged as 0, 0, 2, 0 (but wait, the original has 0, 0, 2, then another 0. So the original 0s and 2s are in the order 0, 0, 2, 0. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is that the first two 0s are before the 2, which is before the last 0. So in the output, the 0s and 2s are ordered as 0, 0, 0, 2. Wait, but how? Because the original has the 2 before the last 0. So in the original, the 2 is before the last 0. So in the final string, the 2 must come before the last 0? Or is that not the case?\n\nWait, the original string is 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0. The 2 is before the last 0. So in the final string, the 2 must be before the last 0. But the output is \"001120\" — the 2 is before the last 0. So yes. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is preserved. So the 0s and 2s in the original string can't be reordered. So the 2 is before the last 0 in the original, so in the final string, the 2 is before that 0.\n\nBut how can we arrange the 1s? Well, since 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. So for example, the 1s can be moved to the left of 0s, or to the right of 2s. But the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Separate the original string into groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s, but considering that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. But the 1s can be moved around.\n\nWait, but maybe the correct way is to collect all the 0s, 1s, and 2s, but arrange them such that:\n\n- All the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order. But the 1s can be placed between them.\n\nSo for example, if the original string has a sequence of 0s, then 1s, then 2s, then the 1s can be moved to the left of the 0s or between the 0s and 2s, etc. But the 0s and 2s are in their original order.\n\nSo the idea is to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert the 1s in between them as much as possible. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: since 1s can be moved freely through 0s and 2s, but 0s and 2s cannot pass each other. So the minimal string would be formed by:\n\n- Collecting all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then inserting all the 1s between them, but also possibly at the beginning or end.\n\nWait, but inserting the 1s between the 0s and 2s. Because 1s can be moved to any position between the 0s and 2s. So for example, if there are 0s and 2s in the original string, then the 1s can be placed anywhere between them. So the minimal lex string would be to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert all the 1s as early as possible.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s. For example, if we have a 0 followed by a 2, then we can arrange the 1s between them. So the minimal string would have the 1s as far to the left as possible. Because 1 is smaller than 2, but larger than 0. Hmm, but how?\n\nLet me think of the example. Suppose the original string is \"02\". We can't swap them. So the minimal string is \"02\". But if there's a 1 between them, like \"012\", then we can arrange the 1s. Wait, but in that case, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 2. So the string becomes \"012\" → \"012\" (since the 1 can be moved to the left of the 2). But since the 0 and 2 can't be swapped, the 0 is before the 2. So the 1 can be placed between them, but how does that affect the minimal string?\n\nSo, the idea is that the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s. So the minimal string would be to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert the 1s in between them as much as possible. But since 1 is larger than 0 and smaller than 2, inserting 1s between 0s and 2s would help make the string lex smaller.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 1s optimally. For example, if we have a 0 followed by a 2. Then inserting 1s between them would make the string 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s. Because 0 is better than 0, but 1 is better than 2. So inserting the 1s between 0 and 2 would make the string lex smaller.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe the correct approach is to collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert all the 1s between them, but also before the first 0 and after the last 2. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the 1s can be moved anywhere. For example, in the original string, the 1s can be moved to the front. But if there are 0s and 2s, then the 1s can be placed before the 0s, between 0s and 2s, or after 2s. However, the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order.\n\nSo, the minimal string would be:\n\nAll the 1s that can be moved to the left of the 0s, then the 0s and 2s in their original order, with the 1s inserted between them. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order. Then, the 1s can be placed anywhere. So the minimal string would be to arrange all the 1s as far to the left as possible, but considering that the 0s and 2s are in their original order.\n\nWait, but the 0s are already in their original order. For example, if the original string has a 0, then a 1, then a 2, then the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. But that's not possible, because the 1 can move left through 0s. Wait, the 1 can be swapped with 0s. For example, if the string is \"01\", you can swap them to get \"10\". Wait, but that's allowed. So the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. So in that case, the 1 can be placed before the 0. So in that case, the 0s and 2s' relative order is preserved, but the 1s can be placed before them.\n\nSo, the overall idea is that the 0s and 2s are in their original order, but the 1s can be placed anywhere in the string, including before the first 0, between 0s and 2s, and after the last 2.\n\nSo, the minimal string would be the following:\n\nCollect all the 1s and arrange them as early as possible. But how to do that while keeping the 0s and 2s in their original order.\n\nWait, but the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So, the minimal string would be:\n\nTake all the 1s, then the 0s and 2s in their original order. But that's not correct. Because suppose the original string is \"02\". Then the 1s can't be placed anywhere, but if the original string has 0, then 1, then 2, then the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. So the minimal string would be \"102\".\n\nWait, but how to model this. So the 0s and 2s are in their original order, but the 1s can be placed before the first 0, between the 0s and 2s, or after the last 2. So the minimal lex string is to have as many 1s as possible as early as possible. But since 1 is larger than 0, but smaller than 2.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to arrange all the 1s in between the 0s and 2s in such a way that the 1s are placed in positions where they can contribute to the lex smallest string.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire string as consisting of three parts: the 0s and 2s in their original order, and the 1s. The 1s can be placed anywhere, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order.\n\nSo, to minimize the lex order, we want as many 1s as possible to be placed before the 0s and 2s. But wait, no. Because 0 is smaller than 1, so placing 0s before 1s would be better. So for example, if there is a 0 in the original string, we can move the 1s to the right of the 0s, but that would not be helpful. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original string is \"012\". The 0s and 2s are in the order 0 followed by 2. The 1 is in between. Now, since the 1 can be moved past the 0 (to the left of the 0) or past the 2 (to the right of the 2). But the minimal string would be \"012\" → can we get a smaller string? Let's see. If we move the 1 to the left of the 0, we get \"102\", but that's worse than \"012\". Alternatively, move the 1 to the right of the 2: \"021\", which is worse than \"012\". So the minimal is \"012\". So in this case, the original arrangement of the 1s is already optimal.\n\nAnother example: \"102\". The 0 and 2 are in order 0 followed by 2. The 1 is before the 0. So the minimal string would be \"012\", which is achieved by moving the 1 to the right of the 0 (since the 1 can be swapped with the 0). So in this case, the 1s can be moved to the right of the 0s and left of the 2s.\n\nSo the minimal string would be to arrange the 1s between the 0s and 2s. So, the idea is that the 0s and 2s are in their original order, and the 1s are placed in between them, but also before the first 0 and after the last 2. However, the optimal placement would be to have as many 1s as possible in the earliest positions where they can be placed without violating the order of 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 1s optimally. Let's think of the 0s and 2s as a sequence. For example, the original string may have some 0s and 2s in certain positions. For instance, the original string could be '0', '2', '0', '2' — but the order of 0s and 2s is preserved. So, the 0s and 2s are in their original order, but the 1s can be placed in between them.\n\nSo, the minimal string is obtained by arranging the 1s in between the 0s and 2s in a way that allows the earliest possible 1s to be as small as possible.\n\nBut since 1 is bigger than 0 and smaller than 2, inserting 1s between 0s and 2s would be better than having 0 followed by 2. For example, 0 followed by 1 followed by 2 is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1. But in this case, the 1s can be placed between the 0 and 2.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order.\n\n- Collect all the 1s.\n\n- Then, arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s in a way that minimizes the lex order.\n\nBut how to do that. Let me think of the 0s and 2s as being a list. For example, suppose the original string has the 0s and 2s as [0, 2, 0, 2]. Then, the 1s can be placed in between these elements. So between the 0 and 2, between the 2 and 0, between the 0 and 2. Also before the first 0 and after the last 2.\n\nTo make the lex smallest string, we want to place as many 1s as possible in the earliest positions where they can be placed. However, inserting 1s before the first 0 would be better than inserting them after the first 0. But 0 is smaller than 1, so inserting 1s before the first 0 would make the string lex larger. Wait, that's not good. So perhaps the best is to insert the 1s as far to the left as possible, but in a way that doesn't interfere with the 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but inserting a 1 before the first 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So, in that case, we should not do that. So, the 1s should be placed in the earliest positions where they can be placed without being before the 0s. But how?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since 1 can be moved past 0s and 2s. So, the 1s can be placed between the 0s and 2s, but not before the 0s. Because placing a 1 before the 0s would make the string lex larger. So the optimal way is to arrange the 1s between the 0s and 2s, but not before the 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order, and the 1s can be inserted between them. So, for example, the 1s can be inserted between the 0s and 2s, and after the last 2. But not before the first 0. Because inserting them before the first 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So the minimal string is to have all the 0s and 2s in their original order, with the 1s inserted between them and after them, but not before them.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s between the 0s and 2s. For example, between two 0s, between a 0 and a 2, between a 2 and a 0, etc.\n\nBut in terms of lex order, the best is to have as many 1s as possible in the earliest positions. However, the 1s can't be placed before the 0s. So, the 1s can be placed in the earliest positions possible, which is between the 0s and 2s.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the 0s and 2s as a list. Let's say the list is called 'fixed'. Then, the 1s can be inserted into the 'fixed' list in any positions, but the order of the 'fixed' elements remains the same.\n\nThe minimal lex string would be obtained by inserting all the 1s as early as possible. But how to do that.\n\nFor example, if the fixed list is [0, 2], then inserting the 1s between 0 and 2 gives 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than inserting them after the 2. So, the minimal is to insert all the 1s between the 0 and 2.\n\nBut if the fixed list is [0, 0, 2], then inserting the 1s between the first 0 and the second 0, between the second 0 and the 2, or after the 2. To get the minimal string, we want to insert the 1s as early as possible. For example, inserting all the 1s between the first 0 and the second 0, then between the second 0 and the 2, etc.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s optimally. Since the 1s are all the same, inserting them in the earliest possible positions would give the minimal string.\n\nSo, the approach is to insert all the 1s between the elements of the fixed list. So, between each pair of consecutive elements in the fixed list, and also before the first element and after the last element. But to choose where to insert the 1s to get the minimal lex string.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s. Since the 1s are all the same, inserting them in the earliest possible positions would be better.\n\nWait, but inserting the 1s before the first element (the first 0) would make the string start with 1, which is worse. So we don't want to do that. Similarly, inserting them after the last element (the last 2) is better than inserting them between elements where the insertion would cause higher lex order.\n\nSo the optimal way is to insert the 1s between the elements of the fixed list where inserting them would result in the minimal lex string. But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the fixed list as a series of blocks. Between each pair of consecutive elements, we can insert some number of 1s. But how to distribute the 1s between these gaps.\n\nLet me think of the fixed list as [a_0, a_1, ..., a_n-1], where each a_i is either 0 or 2. The gaps are:\n\n- Before a_0\n\n- Between a_0 and a_1\n\n- Between a_1 and a_2\n\n...\n\n- After a_n-1\n\nWe need to distribute all the 1s into these gaps. But inserting 1s into the gaps before a_0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So we should avoid inserting 1s into that gap. Similarly, inserting 1s into the gaps between elements where inserting them would lead to a better lex order.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s. For example, inserting between a_0 and a_1, which is a 0 and a 2, is better than inserting after a_1 (which is a 2). Because inserting between 0 and 2 gives 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s.\n\nSimilarly, inserting between a_0 (0) and a_1 (0) would give 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is better than inserting after a_1 (0), which would be 0 followed by 0 followed by 1s. So inserting between the two 0s is better.\n\nWait, but inserting between 0 and 0, the 1s would be between the two 0s. For example, 0 1 0 is better than 0 0 1. Because the first character is 0 in both cases, but the second character is 1 vs 0. Oh, wait, 0 0 1 is better than 0 1 0. Because the second character is 0 in the former, which is better than 1 in the latter. So inserting the 1s after the 0s is better than inserting them between 0s.\n\nSo this suggests that the optimal way is to insert the 1s into the gaps where inserting them would not create a lex larger string. So, for each gap between elements, we can decide whether inserting the 1s there would be better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nBut how to model this. For example, consider two adjacent elements in the fixed list, say x and y. Where x is either 0 or 2, and y is either 0 or 2. The gap between x and y is where we can insert some number of 1s. The question is, how to decide whether inserting the 1s here is better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nBut since the 1s are all the same, inserting them into the earliest possible gaps that are as early as possible and where the insertion leads to the minimal lex order.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause a problem. For example, the earliest gap is between the first and second element of the fixed list. But how to decide which gaps to choose.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: for each gap, the best time to insert the 1s is in the earliest possible gap where inserting them would not create a lex larger string. But how?\n\nWait, the fixed list consists of 0s and 2s. Let's consider the gaps between them. The gaps can be categorized based on the elements x and y that are adjacent. For example:\n\nCase 1: x is 0 and y is 0. Inserting 1s between them would create 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. But inserting the 1s after the first 0 would be better (i.e., in the next gap). Because 0 0 1... is better than 0 1 0 ... (since the second character is 0 vs 1).\n\nCase 2: x is 0 and y is 2. Inserting 1s between them would create 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than inserting after the 2. So inserting here is better.\n\nCase 3: x is 2 and y is 0. Inserting 1s between them would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. But since 2 is larger than 1, inserting the 1s before the 2 would be better. But in this case, the 2 is before the 0 in the fixed list. So inserting the 1s between them would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. But inserting the 1s before the 2 (in the gap before the first element) would be worse. However, inserting them between the 2 and 0 would be better than inserting after the 0. But since the 2 is before the 0 in the fixed list, which is allowed because the 2 was originally before the 0. So inserting 1s between them would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than inserting the 1s before the 2 (but that's not allowed because that would be before the first 0). Wait, but the fixed list starts with 2? How is that possible?\n\nAh, no. The fixed list is the 0s and 2s in their original relative order. So, if the original string had a 2 followed by a 0, then the fixed list would have 2 followed by 0. So inserting 1s between them would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than inserting the 1s before the 2. But inserting before the 2 is not allowed because the fixed list starts with the 2, and inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 2. So the minimal option is to insert the 1s between the 2 and 0, leading to 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is better than inserting them after the 0 (which would be 2 followed by 0 followed by 1s). Because comparing 210... and 201..., the second character is 1 vs 0. So 201 is better. So inserting the 1s between 2 and 0 is worse than inserting them after the 0. So this suggests that inserting the 1s into the gaps where inserting them would be between elements that are 2 and 0 is not optimal.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler approach. Since the 1s can be inserted anywhere between the 0s and 2s, and after the last 2, and before the first 0 is not allowed, perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s as early as possible, but in the gaps where inserting them would not create a lex larger string.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire fixed list (0s and 2s) and the 1s. The minimal string is obtained by placing all the 1s in between the 0s and 2s in such a way that they are as far left as possible. But how?\n\nLet me think of the fixed list as a sequence. For example, if the fixed list is [0, 2], then inserting all the 1s between them would give 0 followed by all 1s followed by 2, which is better than inserting them after the 2 (02...1s) or before the 0 (1s...02).\n\nIf the fixed list is [2, 0], then inserting the 1s between them would give 2 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than inserting them after the 0 (20...1s), which is better. Because 20... is better than 21... (since the second character is 0 vs 1). So in this case, inserting the 1s after the 0 is better.\n\nSo, the decision of where to insert the 1s depends on the adjacent elements in the fixed list.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gaps that are between elements where the left element is 0 and the right element is 2, or between elements where the left element is 0 and the right is 0, or between elements where the left is 2 and the right is 0.\n\nBut how to determine which gaps are better for inserting the 1s.\n\nLet me think about the following: for each gap between elements in the fixed list, we can decide whether inserting the 1s into this gap is better than inserting them into other gaps.\n\nBut how? For example, between two elements x and y, inserting the 1s would create x followed by 1s followed by y. We want to choose the earliest gap where this is better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, since all the 1s are the same, we can insert them all into the earliest possible gap that allows the earliest occurrence of 1s.\n\nBut which gap is that? For example, if the fixed list starts with 0, then inserting the 1s between the first 0 and the next element (if it's 0 or 2) would be better than inserting them after the last element.\n\nBut for example, if the fixed list is [0, 0, 2], then the earliest gaps are:\n\n- before the first 0 (not allowed)\n\n- between first 0 and second 0.\n\n- between second 0 and 2.\n\n- after 2.\n\nInserting the 1s between the first 0 and second 0 would give 0 followed by 1s followed by 0, then 2. Which is better than inserting them between 0 and 2, which would be 0, 0, 1s, 2. Which is better than inserting after 2. But comparing inserting between the first two 0s versus between the second 0 and 2: inserting between the first two 0s would create 010... whereas inserting between the second 0 and 2 creates 001... which is better. Because the third character is 0 vs 1. So inserting between the second 0 and 2 is better.\n\nAh, so inserting the 1s into the earliest possible gap that is after a 0 and before a 2 is better. Because inserting the 1s between 0 and 2 gives 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than inserting them between 0 and 0. So perhaps the priority is to insert the 1s between the 0 and 2 pairs, then between 0 and 0, then between 2 and 0, and finally after the last element.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nCollect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Let's call this list 'fixed'.\n\nCollect all the 1s into a list 'ones'.\n\nNow, we need to distribute the 'ones' into the gaps between the elements of 'fixed'. The gaps are:\n\n- before the first element (gap 0)\n\n- between elements i and i+1 (gaps 1 to len(fixed)-1)\n\n- after the last element (gap len(fixed)).\n\nBut inserting into gap 0 (before the first element) is not desired, as it would add 1s before the first 0, which makes the string start with 1, which is worse than 0.\n\nSo we can ignore gap 0.\n\nNow, for the remaining gaps, we need to decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nThe idea is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gaps that are as beneficial as possible.\n\nFor example, inserting the 1s into gaps between 0 and 2 is better than inserting into gaps between 0 and 0 or 2 and 0, etc.\n\nSo, for each gap between elements x and y in the fixed list, we can calculate the benefit of inserting the 1s here. The benefit is determined by the characters x and y.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\n- If x is 0 and y is 2: inserting 1s here is good because it turns 02 into 0...1s...2, which is better than leaving it as 02.\n\n- If x is 0 and y is 0: inserting 1s here would turn 00 into 0...1s...0, which is worse than 00...1s.\n\nWait, no. Inserting between two 0s would create 0 1s 0. But if we instead insert the 1s after the two 0s, it would be 00 followed by 1s. Which is better than 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Because in the first case, the first two characters are 0 and 0, which is better than 0 and 1.\n\nSo, in this case, inserting the 1s after the two 0s is better than inserting them between them.\n\nSo, the priority for inserting the 1s should be:\n\n1. Insert between 0 and 2 (since this is the most beneficial).\n\n2. Insert between 0 and 0 (but after the 0s would be better).\n\nWait, but how to handle this. It's getting complicated. Perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gap that is between a 0 and a 2, and if there are none, insert them into the earliest possible gap that is between a 0 and a 0, and then between 2 and 0, etc.\n\nAlternatively, think of the gaps in the fixed list and for each gap, determine whether inserting the 1s into that gap would improve the lex order compared to not inserting them there. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the 1s can be inserted anywhere,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a ternary string consisting of characters '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be directly swapped.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: The key insight is that '0's and '2's cannot pass each other, but '1's can move freely through both '0's and '2's. This means that the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain unchanged.\n2. **Separate Elements**: We separate the input string into two parts: the fixed elements (which are '0's and '2's in their original order) and the movable elements (all '1's).\n3. **Insert Movable Elements**: The '1's can be inserted into the gaps between the fixed elements. To ensure the lexicographically smallest result, we prioritize inserting '1's between '0' and '2' pairs first, followed by other positions where they can be placed without disrupting the order of '0's and '2's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            fixed.append(c)\n    \n    result = []\n    # Insert 1s between the fixed elements\n    # We will insert all 1s at the earliest possible position that minimizes lex order\n    # First, check between elements where x is '0' and y is '2'\n    # Then other positions\n    \n    # We'll iterate through the fixed list and insert the ones as needed\n    # We can use a greedy approach to insert all ones between the first occurrence of '0' followed by '2'\n    # If there are no such positions, insert them after the last element or between other positions\n    \n    # Let's first check where to insert the ones\n    # We can insert them in the earliest possible position that allows the minimal lex\n    # For example, between '0' and '2' is best, then between '0's, then between '2's and '0's, then after the end\n    \n    # We'll create a list of gaps, and decide which one to choose\n    # Initially, the result is the fixed list with all ones inserted at the end\n    # Then, we try to move the ones to better positions\n    \n    # Alternative approach: insert all ones at the beginning of the fixed list if possible?
