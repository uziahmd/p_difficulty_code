And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I have to compute the average sleep time. Then, I have to output the average of all those averages. Oh right, but the way the problem is structured, maybe there's a smarter way than calculating each window from scratch.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line has n and k. Then the second line has n integers. For example, in the first sample input, n is 3 and k is 2. So there are 3-2+1=2 weeks. The weeks are days 1-2 and days 2-3. The sum for the first week is 3+4=7, average is 3.5. Second week is 4+7=11, average 5.5. The overall average is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2=4.5? Wait but the sample output is 9.000... Wait wait no, looking back at the example:\n\nWait the first example input is 3 2 and the array [3,4,7]. The output is 9.000... Wait wait, how?\n\nWait the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. So maybe the problem requires the average of all the averages. Wait, but for the first example, the two weeks have averages 3.5 and 5.5. The average of those two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0... Wait that's conflicting. Oh wait no, looking back at the sample input and output:\n\nWait the first sample's output is '9.0000000000'? Wait that doesn't make sense. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the problem says: \"the result is\" (for the example where k=2, n=3, a=[3,4,7]) then the result is ... Well the example says the output is 9.0... Wait what's the correct calculation here?\n\nWait the problem says that the answer is the average of all the weeks. Let me recheck the note. The note says in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So for the first example, the sum of all weeks would be 7 (sum of first week) + 11 (sum of second week) = 18. Then divide by 2 weeks, which gives 9. So the average is 9. Oh! So the problem is not taking the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. Because the average of the sums divided by the number of weeks is the same as the average of the averages. Wait, because each average is sum /k, so the average of all averages is (sum of all sums)/(k * number of weeks). But the problem says that the answer is the average of the averages. But according to the note, the answer is sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which would be the average of the sums. So why is that the case?\n\nWait the problem statement says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". So Polycarp is considering each week as k consecutive days, and for each of them, compute the average (sum divided by k), and then take the average of all these averages. But according to the note, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which would be the average of the sums, not the average of the averages. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait let me read the problem statement again. The problem says that the answer is the average of the averages. But according to the note, in the third example, the answer is sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which would be the average of the sums. Let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst example: Input is 3 2 and [3,4,7]. The weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. The average for each week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5 and (4+7)/2 = 5.5. The average of these two averages is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. However, the sample output is 9.000... So this suggests that the problem is not asking for the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. Which would be (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 =9. So the sample output is 9.0.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as a sequence of `k` consecutive days from a list of `n` recorded sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of each consecutive `k`-day window and then finding the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each `k`-day window. This technique allows us to compute the sum of each window in linear time by reusing the sum of the previous window.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Initialize the sum for the first window of `k` days. Then, for each subsequent window, subtract the element that is left behind and add the new element that comes into the window.\n3. **Average Calculation**: Once we have the sum of all valid windows, we divide this total sum by the number of windows (which is `n - k + 1`) to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].strip().split()))\n        total_sum = 0\n        # Calculate the sum of the first window\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum += current_sum\n        # Slide the window\n        for i in range(k, n):\n            current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        # Calculate the average\n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. Each line is processed to extract the values of `n`, `k`, and the list of sleep times.\n2. **Initial Window Sum**: The sum of the first `k` elements is calculated to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding the Window**: For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by adding the next element and subtracting the element that exits the window. This ensures that each sum calculation is done in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows to get the final average, which is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for large input sizes up to the given constraints.",
