Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the input is two integers, a and b. Initially, he has a candles. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every b used candles, he can make a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn will become another used candle after burning. So it's like a process that can repeat until he can't make any more candles.\n\nThe task is to find the total number of hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He burns them all, which takes 4 hours. Now he has 4 used candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So he lights those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 used candles. Again, he can make 2/2 = 1 new candle. That adds 1 hour. Now he has 1 used candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\nAnother example: 6 3. Output is 8. Let's check:\n\nStart with 6, burn them all. 6 hours. Then 6 used candles. 6 /3 = 2 new. Burn those, 2 hours. Now 2 used. Can't make any more (since 2 <3). Wait, but wait, the sample says output is 8. 6+2=8? Oh right. But wait, what about the 2 used candles? Oh, no, because 2 is less than 3. So no more. So total is 6+2=8. But wait, maybe there's another step?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Let's take the first example. After burning the initial 4, he has 4 used. Makes 2 new. Burn them (2 hours), now he has 2 used. Then makes 1 new. Burn that (1 hour), now he has 1 used. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the process is: each time you have some used candles, you can make new ones by grouping them into batches of b. Each batch gives you one new candle. Then, when you burn that new candle, it becomes another used one.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours, and the number of used candles. Let me think of an algorithm.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Wait, when you burn a candle, it's consumed, and then becomes a used candle. So perhaps the process is:\n\nEach time you burn a candle, you add 1 hour. Then, after burning, you collect that candle as used.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nStart with a candles. Burn them all. So total_hours += a. Now, you have a used candles. Then, you can make new candles from them.\n\nBut how to model this? Let me think of it as a loop.\n\nWe can have a variable that tracks the number of used candles. Then, while we can make new candles from them, we do so.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nused = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Let's think of the process as:\n\nInitially, you have a candles. You burn them all, which takes a hours. Then, you have a used candles. Then, you can make new candles from those used ones. So for every b used candles, you can make 1 new. So the number of new candles is (used // b). Then, those new candles are burned, adding to the total hours. And then, those new candles become used again.\n\nBut wait, the process is that each time you make new candles, you have to burn them. So the steps would be:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nused = 0\n\nInitially, you have a candles. You burn them, which adds a to total_hours. Then, used += a. Then, while used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    used = (used % b) + new_candles \n\nSo this loop continues until used < b.\n\nWait, let's test this with the first example.\n\nExample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial step: total_hours =4, used=4.\n\nNow, enter loop:\n\nused >=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total_hours +=2 → 6. used = 4%2=0 + 2 → 2.\n\nAgain, loop: used=2 >=2.\n\nnew_candles =2//2=1 → total_hours is 6+1=7. used is 0 +1=1. Now, loop ends. So total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\nInitial total_hours =6, used=6.\n\nLoop: 6 >=3 → new_candles=6//3=2. total becomes 6+2=8. used is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now, 2 <3. So loop ends. So total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5, used=5. Then new_candles=1. total becomes 5+1=6. used is 0 +1=1. Loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see.\n\nInitial total is 5. used=5.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew_candles=5//2=2. total becomes 5+2=7. used is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nAgain, 3 >=2. new_candles=3//2=1. total is 7+1=8. used is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2. new_candles=1. total is 8+1=9. used is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually:\n\nStart with 5 candles. Burn them (5h). 5 used.\n\nMake 2 new (5//2=2). Burn them (2h). Now, 2 used. So total 5+2=7. Then, 5-2*2=1 used (from 5, 5-2*2=1?), wait no. Wait original used was 5. After making 2 new, the used is 5 - 2*2 = 1? Or 5%2=1, plus the new 2. So 1+2=3. Then, when you burn the 2 new, you add 2 hours, and then the used becomes 3 (the 1 left from before plus 2 new ones that were burned).\n\nYes. So next step, 3 used. Make 1 new (3//2=1). Burn it (add 1h). Now used is 3%2=1 +1=2. Then, make 1 new (2//2=1). Burn it (add 1h). Now used is 0 +1=1. So total hours is 5 + 2 +1 +1 = 9. Yes. So the algorithm works.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total_hours as a. Then, used = a. Then, while used >=b:\n\n   new_candles = used // b\n\n   total_hours += new_candles\n\n   used = (used % b) + new_candles \n\nRepeat until used <b.\n\nSo that's the algorithm.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = used % b + new\n\nreturn total.\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if a=1, b=2. Then, total is 1. used=1. No loop. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Then initial total is 2. used=2. loop runs once: new=1, total becomes 3. used is 0 +1=1. loop ends. So output 3.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. Initial total is 3. used=3. new=1, total 4. used is 0 +1=1. loop ends. So output 4.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total=5, used=5.\n\nloop: 5//3=1. total becomes 6. used is 5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nloop again: 3//3=1. total 7. used is 0+1=1. loop ends. So total is 7.\n\nYes. So the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nThe input is two integers, a and b. Read from stdin.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead a and b. For example, input could be read via input().split().\n\nThen compute as per the algorithm.\n\nSo code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = used % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if a=0? Well, according to the problem statement, a is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: input 4 2.\n\ntotal starts as 4, used=4.\n\nloop: 4//2=2. total is 6. used = 0 +2=2.\n\nloop again: 2//2=1. total 7. used is 0 +1=1. loop ends. Output 7. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 6 3. total starts as 6. used=6. 6//3=2. total 8. used is 0 +2=2. which is less than 3. So output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: 5 2. As discussed earlier, returns 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, code that.\n",
