He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo, given m, we need to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5! it's 120 (one zero). 6! is 720, same count. Up to 9! which is 362880. So all those numbers have exactly one trailing zero. But why? Because when you go from 5 to 9, the count of 5s increases only once (for 5, 10 would add another). Wait, but 5,6,7,8,9: each of their factorials have exactly one 5 in their factors. Because 5 contributes one, 6-9 don't add any more 5s. So the count is 1 for all of them. So the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nBut how to find for a given m, what are the possible n's?\n\nThe approach I think is:\n\n1. Find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nFirst, note that for a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if m is 5, then maybe there's a range of numbers. Let me think. Let's take m=5. Let's compute the trailing zeros for numbers.\n\nFor example, 25! has floor(25/5) + floor(25/25) = 5 + 1 = 6 zeros. So maybe numbers between 24 and 24? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, let's find for m=5. Let's find n where trailing zeros count is 5.\n\nLet me compute for n=24: floor(24/5)=4, floor(24/25)=0. Total 4. Not enough. n=25 gives 6. So between 24 and 25, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer is zero. So that's why in the sample input when m=5, the output is 0.\n\nSo the problem is that for some m, there's no n that gives exactly that count. So the first step is to find for a given m, whether there exists n's, and then find them.\n\nSo how can we find the possible n's?\n\nThe idea is that the count of trailing zeros increases as n increases, but sometimes jumps by more than 1. For example, when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1, but when it crosses a multiple of 25, it increases by 2, etc. So, for a given m, there might be a range of n's where the count is exactly m. But how to find that range?\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the minimal n where the count is m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower and upper bounds of n such that the count is exactly m.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think about binary search. Because the count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function. So for a given m, we can find the smallest n where the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of n's where the count is exactly m.\n\nWait, but how to find the range?\n\nSuppose we find the smallest n where the count is m. Then find the largest n where the count is m. All numbers between them would be valid.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's are in a range. Let me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where the count of trailing zeros is m. Let's call it low.\n\n2. Find the minimal n where the count is m+1. Let's call it high",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. If such numbers exist, we should also list them in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are more factors of 2 than 5 in the factorial product, and each pair of 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero. The count of trailing zeros is given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{count}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\n\nThis function is non-decreasing as `n` increases. Therefore, for any given `m`, the values of `n` that produce exactly `m` trailing zeros will form a contiguous range (if they exist at all).\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Use binary search to find:\n   - The smallest `n` such that `count(n) = m` → call it `low`.\n   - The smallest `n` such that `count(n) = m + 1` → call it `high`.\n\n2. **Determine Valid Range**: All integers between `low` and `high - 1` will have exactly `m` trailing zeros. If no such `n` exists (i.e., if `count(low) != m`), then the answer is zero.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If `m = 0`, the only valid `n` is `1`, since `0! = 1` has 0 trailing zeros.\n   - For some values of `m`, there may be no `n` such that `count(n) = m`.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- A helper function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` computes the number of trailing zeros in `n!`.\n- Use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds.\n- Handle the edge case where `m = 0` separately.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_for_m(m):\n    # Find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n        return []\n    \n    # Find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m + 1\n    low2 = 0\n    high2 = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low2 < high2:\n        mid = (low2 + high2) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m + 1:\n            low2 = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high2 = mid\n    return list(range(low, low2))\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        m = int(line.strip())\n        if m == 0:\n            print(\"1\\n1\")\n            continue\n        results = find_n_for_m(m)\n        print(len(results))\n        if len(results) > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, results)))\n        else:\n            print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Execution\n\nFor input:\n```\n1\n5\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n0\n```\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- The `count_trailing_zeros` function runs in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n- The binary search runs in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n- The overall complexity is efficient enough for the input constraint $1 \\leq m \\leq 100,000$.\n\nThis solution handles all edge cases and ensures correctness and performance.",
