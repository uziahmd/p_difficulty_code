He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then output the count and the numbers in order.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how do I find such n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors but the count remains the same until 10! which adds another 5 (from 10).\n\nWait, but how do I find the possible n's?\n\nThe approach I think is:\n\n1. Find the minimum n such that the trailing zeros count is exactly m. Then check if there are other numbers that also give the same count.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 possible n's? Or maybe some other number. Wait, in the sample, there are 5 numbers. Let me think about why that is.\n\nFor example, when m=1, the first n that gives exactly 1 zero is 5. Then 6,7,8,9 also give 1 zero. Because 5! has one zero, 6! is 5! *6, which adds no new 5s. Similarly for 7,8,9. But when you get to 10, it adds another 5 (from 10), so the count becomes 2. So for m=1, the numbers are 5-9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the question is, for a given m, how many n's exist such that their trailing zero count is exactly m?\n\nBut how to find those n's?\n\nThe key idea here is that the trailing zero count function is non-decreasing. As n increases, the count of trailing zeros either stays the same or increases. So for each m, there's a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find that range?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we want to find the smallest n where the count is m. Then find the largest n where the count is m. Then all numbers between them would be the possible n's. But how?\n\nWait, for example, for m=1, the smallest n is 5, the largest is 9. So the count is 5 numbers. But how do I find the smallest and largest n for a given m?\n\nBut how do I find the smallest n such that the count is m? And then find the largest n where the count is m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there is a certain number of n's. But sometimes there may be no n's. For example, if m is 5, then maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Wait, let's check.\n\nLet me compute the trailing zeros for some numbers:\n\nn=24: 24/5 =4, 24/25=0. Total 4 zeros.\n\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6 zeros. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. So the answer would be 0.\n\nSo for some m, there are zero n's. So the problem requires us to check for that.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. For a given m, find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe approach is to find the lower and upper bounds of n that satisfy the condition. Let me think of using binary search to find the minimal and maximal n for a given m.\n\nBut first, how to find the minimal n where the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where count is m, and then find the maximal n where count is m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) are the valid n's.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count is exactly m?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values of `n` that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials. The formula to count trailing zeroes in `n!` is:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeroes}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Using binary search, we can efficiently find the smallest and largest values of `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeroes. If no such `n` exists, the answer is zero.\n\n3. **Range Check**: Once we find the smallest value `low` where the count of trailing zeroes is exactly `m`, we check for the largest value `high` where the count remains `m`. The valid values of `n` will be from `low` to `high`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Find the lower bound\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n        return []\n    \n    # Find the upper bound\n    low_upper = low\n    high_upper = 5 * m + 5\n    while low_upper < high_upper:\n        mid = (low_upper + high_upper) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) <= m:\n            low_upper = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high_upper = mid\n    upper = low_upper - 1\n    \n    return list(range(low, upper + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(result))\n    if len(result) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` using the formula mentioned above.\n\n2. **find_n_values**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It then finds the largest `n` for which this condition holds true. If no such `n` exists, it returns an empty list.\n\n3. **main**: This reads the input value `m`, calls `find_n_values` to get the valid `n` values, and prints the results in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the range of valid `n` values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large values of `m`.",
