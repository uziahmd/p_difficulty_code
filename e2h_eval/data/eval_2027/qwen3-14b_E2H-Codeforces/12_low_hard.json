The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task ai must be done in order, and she can only do task i after all tasks before it (with numbers less than i) are done. The challenge is to calculate the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the movement. The houses are arranged in a circle. Moving clockwise, each step takes 1 unit of time. She starts at house 1.\n\nSo for each task, she has to move from her current position to the required house ai. But since the tasks are in order, each subsequent task depends on the previous. So the order of tasks is fixed, and we have to process them sequentially.\n\nThe key here is to compute the total time taken to move between consecutive tasks. For example, if the first task is at a1, then she starts at 1 and moves to a1. Then for the next task a2, she moves from a1 to a2, and so on.\n\nBut how to compute the movement time between two points on a ringroad?\n\nLet me think. The ringroad is a circle with n houses. Moving clockwise, the distance between house x and y can be calculated as (y - x) mod n? Or wait, maybe not. Because if moving clockwise, the distance from x to y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - x + y). But since it's a circle, the minimal steps would be (y - x) if moving clockwise, but since movement is only allowed clockwise, the distance between x and y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - x + y). Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, the number of steps from x to y is (y - x) mod n. But since the movement is forced to be clockwise, you can't go backward. So for example, if x is 3 and y is 2, and n is 4, then moving clockwise from 3 to 2 requires 3 steps: 3→4→1→2. Which is (n - x + y) steps. So the formula for the distance between x and y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + n). But that's equivalent to (y - x) % n? Well, no. Because if y is less than x, then (y -x) is negative, and mod n would give the correct positive value. For example, (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. So the distance between x and y is (y - x) mod n. But wait, in the example where x is 3 and y is 2, the distance is 3 steps. Which is (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. So yes. So the distance between current position and next position is (next - current) mod n. But since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct way to calculate steps.\n\nWait, but in the first example given:\n\nSample input is 4 3, and the tasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nThe initial position is 1. Let's compute the steps:\n\nFirst task is 3. So from 1 to 3. The distance is (3-1) = 2 steps. So that's 2 steps. Then, the next task is 2. So from 3 to 2. The distance is (2 -3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3 steps. Then next task is 3 again. From 2 to 3: (3-2)=1 step. So total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the sample output. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is: track Xenia's current position. For each task in order, compute the distance from current position to the target ai, add that to the total time, and then update current position to ai.\n\nBut wait, the note says that the tasks can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the movement time between them is zero. So, the code should process each task in order, and for each, compute the movement from the previous position (which could be the same as the current task's position) and accumulate the time.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in the list of tasks:\n\n   distance = (ai - current_position) mod n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_position = ai\n\nReturn total_time.\n\nWait, but why mod n? Because when ai is less than current_position, the mod n gives the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad where houses are arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time required to move between consecutive tasks, considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current position to the target house of the task.\n3. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Since the movement is only allowed clockwise, the distance between two houses can be calculated using modular arithmetic. Specifically, the distance from house `current_position` to house `ai` is `(ai - current_position) % n`, which ensures the correct number of steps even when moving around the circle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        diff = (ai - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = ai\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `current` set to 1 and `total` time initialized to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the distance from the current position to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road. This distance is added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the target house.\n- **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that each movement is calculated optimally, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular structure efficiently, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(m), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
