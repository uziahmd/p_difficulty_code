The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks in certain houses arranged in a ringroad. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. \n\nSo the problem says that each task i requires her to be in house ai, and she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). Oh right, and moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Also, the houses are arranged in a circle, clockwise. So moving from house n to 1 would take 1 step, right?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The explanation is that she moves from 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's see how that adds up. \n\nStarting at 1. First task is 3. So she needs to get to 3. From 1 to 3, clockwise. How many steps? Well, 1→2 is 1, 2→3 is another. So 2 steps. Then she does task 1. Then task 2 is at 2. But she's currently at 3. So moving from 3 to 2: since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, but from 3 to 2 would require going through 4 and then 1, then 2? Wait no. Wait, moving clockwise, the next house after 3 is 4, then 1, then 2. So moving from 3 to 2 clockwise would take 3 steps. But that's not efficient. Wait, but maybe the problem considers that moving from 3 to 2 is not possible directly clockwise. Wait, the movement is only allowed along the ringroad in the clockwise direction. So to move from house x to house y, if x < y, then the steps are y - x. But if x > y, then it's (n - x) + y. Or maybe (y - x + n) % n? But since movement is only clockwise, the time between x and y is (y - x) mod n if we take the shortest path? No, wait, no. Because the movement is forced to be clockwise. So for example, if you are at house 3 and need to get to house 2, you have to go through 4, 1, then 2. Which is 3 steps. Because moving clockwise. So the time between x and y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + n). But since moving clockwise, the number of steps is (y - x) mod n. Wait, no. Let's take x=3, y=2. The steps would be (2 -3 +4) = 3 steps. Which is (y -x +n) if y <x. So the formula for steps between x and y is (y -x) if y >=x, else (y -x +n). Which can be written as (y -x) % n if the mod is positive. Wait, but (y -x) mod n would give the same as (y -x +n) if y <x. For example, (2-3) mod 4 is 3. So yes. So the steps between x and y is (y -x) mod n. But since in the problem, the movement is only allowed clockwise, so the steps needed to get from x to y is (y -x) if y >=x, else (y -x +n). So that's the formula.\n\nBut for the problem, Xenia starts at house 1. She must perform tasks in order. For each task, she must be at ai. But the tasks are given in order, and she must complete them in order. So for each task i, she must be at ai. But she can have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house. So for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, she doesn't need to move. \n\nSo the approach is to track her current position, and for each task, compute the steps needed to get from her current position to the next task's house, then add that to the total time. Then update her current position to the new house.\n\nBut how to handle the order. Let's think about the example:\n\nFirst example: the tasks are [3,2,3]. So the first task is 3, then 2, then 3.\n\nStarts at 1. So first move to 3. Steps from 1 to 3: 2 steps (since 3-1=2). Then, current position is 3. Next task is 2. So steps from 3 to ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks in a city arranged in a ringroad. The tasks must be completed in a specific order, and movement is only allowed clockwise along the ringroad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the houses are arranged in a ringroad, moving from house `x` to house `y` clockwise takes `(y - x) % n` steps if `y >= x`, otherwise `(y - x + n)` steps.\n2. **Tracking Position**: Start from house 1. For each task, compute the time required to move from the current position to the target house of the current task.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task in sequence, calculate the movement time from the current position to the target house and accumulate the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    if current == target:\n        continue\n    # Calculate the steps needed to move clockwise from current to target\n    if target >= current:\n        total_time += target - current\n    else:\n        total_time += (target - current + n)\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with total time set to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, determine the target house.\n- **Calculate Movement**: If the target house is ahead (clockwise), move directly. If it's behind, wrap around the ringroad using modulo arithmetic to compute the correct number of steps.\n- **Update Position**: After each move, update the current position to the target house.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by always moving clockwise and considering the ringroad structure, leading to an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
