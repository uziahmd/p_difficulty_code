Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. The problem says that the X is formed when both diagonals have the same letters, and all other squares have the same letter different from the diagonals. So, how do I check this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure. For a square of size n x n where n is odd, the main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left. All the cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check that all the diagonal elements are the same. Both diagonals must have the same character, but wait, wait. Wait, the problem says that on both diagonals all letters are the same. Does that mean that both diagonals have the same letter? Or each diagonal can have their own letter, but they must be same across their own diagonal?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So, for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x' and the other diagonal has all 'x' as well. So both diagonals must have the same letter. Because the wording says \"all letters are the same\" on both diagonals. So the two diagonals must have the same character. Because if one diagonal has 'a' and another has 'b', then they are not same. So the first condition is that all elements on both diagonals are the same character. Let me confirm that.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the second case is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nLet's see. The main diagonal is positions (0,0) = 'w', (1,1) = 's', (2,2) = 'w'. Wait, but that's not all same. Wait, but the sample output says it's YES. Oh wait, no. Wait the second input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'. Let me visualize:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nSo the main diagonal is (0,0) = w, (1,1) = w, (2,2) = w. The other diagonal is (0,2) = w, (1,1) = w, (2,0) = w. So both diagonals are all 'w's. Then the other squares are the ones not on the diagonals. Let's see: for example, (0,1) is s, (1,0) is s, (1,2) is s, (2,1) is s. So all non-diagonal are s, which is different from the diagonal's w. So that's why it's YES.\n\nSo in that case, both diagonals have same letters, and the non-diagonal have same letters different from the diagonals.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal elements. Check that all of them are the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal elements and check that they are all same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonals?\n\nFor a square matrix of size n x n, the main diagonal is where row == column. The other diagonal is where row + column == n-1. For example, in a 3x3 matrix, (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonal. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo first, we need to collect all the characters on the diagonals. Let's check that all of them are the same. Then collect all non-diagonal characters and check that they are same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, what if there's overlapping? Like in the case of n=3, the center cell (1,1) is part of both diagonals. But that's okay, because it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- For each cell in the grid:\n\n   - Check if it's on either diagonal.\n\n   - If yes, collect it into the diagonal set.\n\n   - Else, collect into the non-diagonal set.\n\nThen:\n\n- All elements in the diagonal set must be the same.\n\n- All elements in the non-diagonal set must be the same.\n\n- And the diagonal's character must differ from the non-diagonal's.\n\nBut how to collect these sets?\n\nAlternatively, we can check for all the diagonal elements. Let's take the first diagonal element (0,0) as the reference. Then check that every",
