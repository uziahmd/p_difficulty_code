Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for a grid of size n x n where n is odd. The main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left.\n\nFor each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. Because indices start at 0, right?\n\nSo, for all cells in the grid, we need to check if they are on either of the two diagonals. For those that are, they must be the same as each other. For those not on the diagonals, they must all be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Collect all the characters on the diagonals. Check if they are all the same. Also, collect the characters not on the diagonals. Check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think:\n\nFirst, get the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal (i == j) and the second (i + j == n-1). But note that for the center cell (when n is odd), it's part of both diagonals. So when collecting the characters, we need to make sure that we don't count duplicates. Wait, but for checking if all diagonal characters are same, even if there's overlapping, it's okay. Because the center cell is part of both diagonals, but it's just one cell. So, for example, if all the cells on both diagonals are same, then the entire diagonals are same.\n\nBut how to collect all the diagonal characters? Well, for each cell in the grid, check if it is on either diagonal. If yes, collect it. Then check if all of them are same. Then collect all non-diagonal cells and check if they are same and different.\n\nWait, but for the diagonals, perhaps the two diagonals can have different letters? No. Because the first condition says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So all the cells on the two diagonals must be same. So for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti-diagonal has 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Collect all characters from both diagonals. Check that they are all the same. Let's call this diagonal_char.\n\n- Collect all other characters (non-diagonal). Check that they are all same, and different from diagonal_char.\n\nSo, how to collect these?\n\nLet me think for each cell (i, j):\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for j in 0..n-1:\n\n      if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n          add to diagonal_chars\n\n      else:\n\n          add to other_chars\n\nThen, check:\n\nif all elements in diagonal_chars are same, and all elements in other_chars are same, and the two are different.\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, since n is at least 3, and odd. For example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but the center cell is counted once. So total diagonal cells: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. The other cells are 9 - 5 = 4. So for n=3, other_chars is 4 cells. So for n=3, other_chars is not empty.\n\nSo in general, for n ≥3, the other_chars will have some elements.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nother_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(other_chars) == 1, and the two elements are different.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because for example, if the diagonals have all same letters, but other_chars have same letters as diagonals, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- All diagonal characters are same (so len(diagonal_chars) == 1)\n\n- All other characters are same (len(other_chars) == 1",
