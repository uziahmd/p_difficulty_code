Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l.\n\nHmm. So the approach here is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered in those gaps. Because the worst case is between two adjacent lanterns. Also, we need to check the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would be a candidate. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nWait, right. Let me think. Let's sort the lantern positions first. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive ones might not be adjacent. For example, if the lanterns are at positions 3, 5, 1, then sorting them gives 1,3,5. Then the gaps between them are 2 (from 1 to 3) and 2 (from 3 to 5). But the maximum gap is 2. Then the required radius would be half of that, because each lantern covers up to d distance. So for a gap between two lanterns, say between a and b, the maximum distance between them is (b - a). The minimal d needed for that gap is (b - a)/2. Because if you have a gap of length g, then placing the radius as g/2 would cover the entire gap. Because each lantern's light covers up to d from their positions. So the middle of the gap would be (a + b)/2, and the distance from either lantern is (b - a)/2. So that's the maximum required for that gap.\n\nBut also, we need to check the ends. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1 - 0. So the required d must be at least a1, because otherwise the area from 0 to a1 -d would not be covered. Similarly, if the last lantern is at a_n, then the distance from a_n to l is l - a_n. So the required d must be at least that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the first lantern's position. The initial distance is a[0] - 0. So the required d must be at least this value.\n3. Check the last lantern's position. The distance is l - a[-1]. So required d must be at least this.\n4. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum gap is (current - previous). Then the required d for that gap is (current - previous)/2. So we take the maximum of all these values.\n5. The answer is the maximum between the initial and final distances, and the maximum gap's half.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the initial distance is a[0], the final is l - a[0]. The maximum between those two would be the required d. Because the lantern's light has to cover from 0 to l. So for example, if the lantern is at position 5, and the street is length 10, then the d must be 5, since the lantern can cover up to 5 units on either side. So from 0 to 10, which is exactly the street.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Read n and l.\n- Read the list of a_i.\n- Sort the list.\n- Initialize max_d as 0.\n- Check the first element: distance is a[0] - 0. So current_max = a[0]. Compare with max_d.\n- Then check the last element: distance is l - a[-1]. Compare with max_d.\n- Then iterate through the sorted list, for each consecutive pair, compute the difference. Then divide by 2. Compare with max_d.\n- The answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nWait, but for the first and last elements, the required d is the distance from the start or end to the lantern. Because the lantern's light has to reach that point. For example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to 3 is 3. So the d must be at least 3, because otherwise the area from 0 to 3 -d would not be covered. So the initial part is correct.\n\nSo let's take the sample input.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lanterns are at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,1",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can light up to a distance `d` from its position. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and ensuring the ends of the street are also covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to easily determine the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`). These distances are critical as they determine the minimum radius needed to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum radius required to cover this gap is half the size of the gap since the lanterns can illuminate up to `d` distance on either side.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius `d` is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the ends of the street and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    first_dist = a[0]\n    if first_dist > max_d:\n        max_d = first_dist\n    \n    # Check the last lantern\n    last_dist = l - a[-1]\n    if last_dist > max_d:\n        max_d = last_dist\n    \n    # Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting ensures that we can easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Ends of the Street**: The initial and final distances from the lanterns to the ends of the street are checked to ensure these areas are illuminated.\n- **Gaps Between Lanterns**: By iterating through the sorted list of lantern positions, we calculate the gap between each consecutive pair. The maximum required radius for these gaps is half the gap size, as each lantern can illuminate up to `d` distance on either side.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is the maximum value among the distances from the ends of the street and the gaps between lanterns, ensuring the entire street is illuminated with the minimum radius.",
