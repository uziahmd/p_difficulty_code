Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment around it with radius d. We need to find the smallest d such that all points on the street are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. So the approach here would be to figure out the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required radius based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the radius needs to cover that gap. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Suppose two consecutive lanterns are at positions a and b. The distance between them is (b - a). The maximum distance from the edge of their coverage areas would be half of that distance. Because if the lanterns are placed such that their coverage areas just touch each other, then the radius needed for each would be (b - a)/2. Wait, no. Let's imagine that between two lanterns, the worst case is the midpoint between them. For example, if two lanterns are at positions 0 and 5, then the middle point is 2.5. So the radius must be at least 2.5 to cover that point. So the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2 is part of the answer.\n\nBut also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is something. Similarly for the end of the street. So the maximum between those two cases and the gaps between lanterns.\n\nWait, right. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in order.\n2. Check the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The required radius here is (first lantern's position - 0), because the lantern's coverage needs to reach from 0 to the first lantern's position. Wait, no. If the first lantern is at position a, then the leftmost point is 0. The lantern's coverage needs to reach 0. So the radius must be at least a - 0. Because the lantern is at a, and the distance from a to 0 is a. So the radius must be at least a, otherwise the 0 point isn't covered. Similarly, for the end of the street. If the last lantern is at position b, then the distance from b to l is l - b. So the radius must be at least that.\n\nBut then, between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap is (current - previous). The maximum of these gaps divided by two would be the required radius for that gap. Because the middle point between the two lanterns would be (previous + current)/2. The distance from each lantern to that point is (current - previous)/2. So the radius must be at least that.\n\nSo overall, the minimal required d is the maximum between:\n\n- the first lantern's position (since 0 to a1 needs to be covered)\n- the last lantern's distance to l (since l - an)\n- the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen, iterate through the sorted array, compute the difference between consecutive elements, and find the maximum gap. Then divide that by 2.0. Then compare that with the initial max_d, and take the maximum between them.\n\nThat's the answer.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like, n=1. Then the max gap between consecutive lanterns is zero (since there's only one). So the initial max_d would be max(a[0], l - a[0]). Which is correct. Because the lantern has to cover from 0 to l. So the radius must be max(a[0], l - a[0]).\n\nYes. So that seems to handle that case.\n\nAnother example: the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input is 7 15, and the lantern positions are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. When sorted, they become [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then:\n\nThe first lantern is at 0. So the distance from 0 is 0. The last lantern is at 15, which is the end of the street, so l - a[-1] is 0. So the initial max_d is 0.\n\nThen, the gaps between consecutive lanterns are:\n\n3-0 = 3 → gap is 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n\n5-3 = 2 → 1.0\n\n7",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street, we can break the task into a few logical steps based on the positions of the lanterns and the constraints of the street.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the given lantern positions in ascending order. This helps in evaluating the gaps between consecutive lanterns systematically.\n\n2. **Check Endpoints**:\n   - The distance from the beginning of the street (position `0`) to the first lantern.\n   - The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`).\n\n3. **Evaluate Gaps Between Lanterns**:\n   - For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the gap between them.\n   - The worst-case point in this gap is the midpoint, which requires a radius of half the gap to be covered by either lantern.\n\n4. **Compute the Maximum Required Radius**:\n   - The required radius is the maximum among the following:\n     - Distance from the start to the first lantern.\n     - Distance from the last lantern to the end.\n     - Half of the largest gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        n, l = map(int, parts[:2])\n        a = list(map(int, parts[2:]))\n        \n        a.sort()\n        max_d = 0.0\n        \n        # Check the start of the street\n        max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n        \n        # Check the end of the street\n        max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n        \n        # Check gaps between lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i - 1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            max_d = max(max_d, current)\n        \n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Edge Cases Handled**\n\n- **Single Lantern**: If there is only one lantern, it must cover the entire street. The required radius is the maximum of its distance from both ends of the street.\n- **Multiple Lanterns at Same Position**: Even if multiple lanterns are at the same point, they will still be sorted, and the gap calculation ensures that no area is left unlit.\n- **Lanterns at Ends of Street**: If any lantern is already at 0 or l, the corresponding distance is zero, and no extra radius is needed for that edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Output**\n\nFor the input:\n```\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n```\n\nSorted lanterns: `[0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]`  \nLargest gap is between 9 and 14 → 5 → half is 2.5  \nStart and end distances are 0 → result is `2.5000000000`.\n\nFor input:\n```\n2 5\n2 5\n```\n\nSorted lanterns: `[2, 5]`  \nLargest gap is 3 → half is 1.5  \nStart distance is 2, end distance is 0 → result is `2.0000000000`.\n\n---\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the minimal required radius with a time complexity of **O(n log n)** due to sorting, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
