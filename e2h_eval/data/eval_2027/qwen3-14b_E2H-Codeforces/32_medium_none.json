    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. So, when we remove one element, we want this difference to be as small as possible.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be: for each element in the array, consider removing it, then compute the max and min of the remaining elements, and find the minimum instability. However, if the array is large (like up to 1e5 elements), this approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. For n=1e5, that's 1e10 operations, which won't work. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the properties. The instability after removing one element depends on the max and min of the remaining elements. So, if I can find for each possible removal, what the new max and min are, then compute their difference.\n\nBut how can I compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think: the original array's max and min are known. If I remove an element that's not the max or min, then the max and min remain the same. But if I remove the current max, then the new max is the second highest element. Similarly for the min.\n\nWait, but the array might have multiple elements with the same value. For example, if the array has multiple maxima, then removing one of them won't change the max. So, the key is to find for each possible element to remove, what the new max and min would be.\n\nBut how can I precompute these values?\n\nLet me think: if I sort the array first. Let's say the array is sorted. Then, for each position i in the sorted array, if I remove that element, the new min and max would be:\n\nIf the array is sorted as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1].\n\nIf I remove a[i], then the new max is a[n-2] if i is the last element (since the original max was a[n-1], and removing it would make the new max a[n-2]). Similarly, if I remove a[0], the new min is a[1].\n\nBut for elements in the middle, removing them doesn't affect the min or max. So for example, if I remove a[i] where i is not the first or last element in the sorted array, then the min is still a[0], max is a[n-1]. So the instability is a[n-1] - a[0].\n\nBut if I remove the first element (the min), then the new min is a[1], and the max is a[n-1]. So the instability is a[n-1] - a[1].\n\nSimilarly, if I remove the last element (the max), the instability is a[n-2] - a[0].\n\nSo, the idea is that the optimal choice is either:\n\n- Remove the first element (so the instability is max of the rest minus the new min)\n- Remove the last element (so the instability is new max minus min of the rest)\n- Or remove some other element, but in that case, the instability is the same as the original max minus original min, but only if that element isn't the max or min.\n\nWait, but if there are multiple elements with the same value as the original min or max, then removing one of them may not affect the min or max.\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 7]. The original min is 1, max is 7. If I remove one of the 1s, the new min is 1 (the other one). So the instability remains 7-1=6. But if I remove the 7, the instability becomes 3-1=2.\n\nSo, the key insight here is that when the array is sorted, the minimal instability after removing one element can be found by considering the cases where we remove the first element, the last element, or maybe some other elements. But perhaps the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the first element or the last element, or maybe the second element or the second last.\n\nWait, but for the sorted array, the minimal instability after removing one element would be the minimum between:\n\n- The instability when we remove the first element (so the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1], so instability is a[-1] - a[1])\n- The instability when we remove the last element (so the new max is a[-2], and the min is a[0], so instability is a[-2] - a[0])\n- Or, if there are duplicates in the min or max, maybe removing one of the duplicates allows for a smaller instability.\n\nWait, but if the array is sorted, then the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If I remove any element that's not the first or last, then the instability remains the same. So, the only way to get a better instability is to remove either the first or last element.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple elements equal to the min or max? For example, let's say the array is [1, 1, 3, 3]. Original instability is 3-1=2. If I remove one of the 1's, the new array is [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. If I remove one of the 3's, the new array is [1,1,3], instability is 3-1=2. So no improvement. But if I remove the first element, the instability is 3-1=2. Same as before. So no gain.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4]. Original instability is 3. If I remove 1, the instability is 3-2=1. If I remove 4, the instability is 3-1=2. So the best is to remove 1. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-2]-a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nSo, for the sorted array, the minimal possible instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if there are more than two elements?\n\nLet me take another example. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. Original instability is 7-1=6. If I remove 7, the instability is 5-1=4. If I remove 1, it's 7-3=4. If I remove 3, the instability is 7-1=6. So the best is 4. Which is min between a[-2] - a[0] (5-1=4) and a[-1] - a[1] (7-3=4). So the minimum is 4.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. If I remove 1, instability is 4-2=2. If I remove 5, instability is 4-1=3. So the minimum is 2. Which is a[-2] - a[0] = 4-1=3? Wait wait, no. Wait the array is [1,2,3,4,5]. After removing 1, the array is [2,3,4,5], so max is 5, min is 2. Instability is 3. Oh, but earlier thought that a[-2] is 4. So a[-2] - a[0] would be 4 - 1 = 3, which matches. But the other option is a[-1] - a[1], which is 5-2=3. So the minimum is 3. But wait, in this case, the best possible is 3. But what if you remove 5? Then the instability is 4-1=3. So yes, the answer is 3. But according to the previous idea, the answer is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nSo, in this case, both options give 3. So the answer is 3.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. Then the options are a[-2] - a[0] =5-1=4, a[-1]-a[1]=7-3=4. So the answer is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo this suggests that the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (max of the array after removing the first element) - (min of the array after removing the first element) and (max of the array after removing the last element) - (min of the array after removing the last element).\n\nBut since the array is sorted, when we remove the first element, the new min is a[1], and the new max is a[-1]. So the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. When we remove the last element, the new max is a[-2], and the new min is a[0], so the instability is a[-2] - a[0]. \n\nSo the answer is the minimum between these two values.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements that are the same as the min or max?\n\nLet me take the example from the problem statement. The first input is [1,3,3,7]. When sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. So the options are:\n\nIf we remove the first element (1), the new array is [3,3,7], instability is 7-3=4. If we remove the last element (7), the new array is [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is 2, which is the minimum between 4 and 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]). That's the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has more than two elements, and there's a scenario where removing an element in the middle gives a better instability?\n\nLike, for example, let's say the array is [1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6]. The original instability is 6-1=5. If I remove the first element (1), the instability is 6-2=4. If I remove the last element (6), the instability is 5-1=4. But if I remove one of the 5s, then the instability is 6-1=5. So the best is 4. Which is the min between the two options.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Removing the first element gives instability 5-2=3. Removing the last element gives 5-1=4. So the answer is 3. But what if there's a scenario where removing a middle element gives a better result?\n\nWait, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100]. The original instability is 99. If we remove the 100, the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove the 1, the instability is 100-2=98. So the answer is 4. Which is the min between (a[-2] - a[0] = 5-1=4) and (a[-1] - a[1] = 100-2=98). So the answer is 4.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 100, 101, 102]. Then, removing the 100, 101, or 102 would leave the instability as 101-1=100, etc. But the best is to remove the 102, giving instability 101-1=100. But if we remove the first element, the instability is 102 - 2 = 100. If we remove the last element, the instability is 101 - 1 = 100. So the answer is 100. However, if we remove the 100, the instability is 102 -1 = 101, which is worse. So in this case, the answer is 100, which is the min between the two options (a[-2] - a[0] = 101-1=100, and a[-1] -a[1] = 102 -2=100). So the answer is 100.\n\nSo in all these cases, the answer is the minimum between the two options: removing the first element or the last element. So, the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut why is that? Because when you remove any element that's not the first or last in the sorted array, the instability remains the same as the original (a[-1] - a[0]). But if you remove the first element, you get a new instability of (a[-1] - a[1]), and if you remove the last element, you get (a[-2] - a[0]). So the minimal possible is the minimum between those two options.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if n is 2? For example, the second sample input is [1, 100000]. When sorted, it's [1, 100000]. Then, removing the first element gives instability 0 (since the array is [100000], and max and min are same). Similarly for removing the second element. So the answer is 0. Which is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) which is (1 - 1) = 0, and (a[-1] - a[1]) which is (100000 - 100000) = 0. So it works.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n\n2. Compute the two possible values: (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\n3. The answer is the minimum of these two.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements in the array that are not the first or last, but when removed, the instability is lower? For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6]. Original instability is 6-1=5. If I remove 5, the instability is 6-1=5. So no gain. But if I remove 6, the instability is 5-1=4. Which is better. Which is covered by the a[-2] -a[0] =5-1=4. So the code would return that.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. The options are:\n\na[-2] - a[0] = 7-1=6.\n\na[-1] - a[1] =9-3=6. So the answer is 6. But what if I remove 5? The instability is 9-1=8, which is worse. So the answer is indeed 6.\n\nSo, the approach seems valid.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it, then compute min between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut wait, what if n is 2? Then a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So the two options are (a[0] - a[0]) =0 and (a[1] -a[1])=0. So the answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nIf n == 2, then the answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute the two options:\n\noption1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\noption2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\nresult = min(option1, option2)\n\nPrint result.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3?\n\nFor example, array [1,2,3]. After sorting, [1,2,3].\n\noption1 is a[-2] -a[0] = 2-1=1.\n\noption2 is a[-1] -a[1] =3-2=1. So answer is 1.\n\nWhich is correct. Because if you remove 3, the instability is 2-1=1. If you remove 1, instability is 3-2=1. If you remove 2, instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is 1.\n\nYes, the code would return that.\n\nAnother example: [1, 1, 1]. The code returns min(1-1=0, 1-1=0) → 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4]. The code returns min(3-1=2, 4-2=2) → 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array.\n\nSort it.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=3, the code is correct. For example, the array [1,3,7]. The options are a[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1 → 2. a[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3 → 4. min is 2. Which is correct. If you remove 7, the instability is 3-1=2. If you remove 1, the instability is 7-3=4. So the answer is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow let's check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1: a[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1 → 3-1=2.\n\noption2: a[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3 → 7-3=4. min(2,4) is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]. n=2 → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1,2,3]. Output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The code returns min(4-1=3, 5-2=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. The code returns min(7-1=6, 9-3=6) → 6. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]. The code returns min(9-1=8, 10-3=7) → 7. Which is correct. Because removing the last element (10) gives the array [1,3,5,7,9], instability 8. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the code says option1 is a[-2] - a[0]. For the array [1,3,5,7,9,10], a[-2] is 9, a[0] is 1 → 9-1=8. option2 is a[-1] (10) - a[1] (3) → 7. So the min is 7. Which is achieved by removing the first element (1) → the array becomes [3,5,7,9,10], instability is 10-3=7. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, when n is 2, the code will have a[-2] as a[0], and a[-1] as a[1]. So the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\na = list of integers.\n\na.sort()\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nBut wait, for n=3, the code is okay. Let's test.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the input constraints say n >=2.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead the array as list of integers.\n\nSort the array.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, the array after sorting is [1,3,3,7], so a[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1. So option1 is 3-1=2. option2 is 7 - a[1] = 7-3=4. min is 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut let's see for n=2, the code returns 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, array [1, 1, 1]. sorted is [1,1,1]. option1 is a[-2] - a[0] = 1-1=0. option2 is a[-1] -a[1] = 1-1=0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1, 2, 5]. option1 is 2-1=1, option2 is 5-2=3. min is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, this approach is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the minimum and maximum values after removing one element.\n2. **Evaluate Instability**: After sorting, the minimum instability can be found by considering two scenarios:\n   - Removing the first element of the sorted array, which results in the instability being the difference between the second last element and the first element.\n   - Removing the last element of the sorted array, which results in the instability being the difference between the last element and the second element.\n3. **Compute Minimum Instability**: The minimum instability is the smaller value between the two scenarios evaluated above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for calculating instability.\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If the array has only two elements, removing either will result in an array with a single element, hence zero instability.\n3. **Evaluating Options**: For arrays with more than two elements, we consider the instability when removing the first element (which affects the minimum value) and when removing the last element (which affects the maximum value). The minimum of these two scenarios gives the optimal solution.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum possible instability in O(n log n) time due to sorting, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
