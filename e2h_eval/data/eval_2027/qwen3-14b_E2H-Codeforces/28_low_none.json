String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, we need to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. The beautiful string has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's a catch: the string must be obtainable by modifying some original string through certain operations. \n\nThe modification operation is replacing the last two characters with one new character. For example, if you have two zeros, you replace them with a one. If you have two ones, replace with zero. Otherwise, if they are different, I guess you replace them with something else? Wait, no, the problem says that when you replace two last characters, you replace them with exactly one other character. The rule is: if you replace two zeros, you get one. If you replace two ones, you get zero. Otherwise, like if they are different, what happens? Wait the problem says \"exactly one other character\". Wait the description says:\n\n\"A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\n\nSo, if you replace two zeros, you get a 1. Otherwise, if you replace any other pair (like 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, or two 1s?), then you get a 0. Wait, no. Let me re-read that part.\n\nThe problem says: \"This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So, if the two characters being replaced are both zeros, then the replacement is 1. Otherwise, regardless of what they are (like two ones, or one and zero), the replacement is zero. Oh right! So for example, replacing two ones would result in a zero. Replacing a 0 and 1 would also result in zero. So, the replacement is 1 only when the two last characters are both 0s. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nNow, the key point here is that the original string s can be modified through some number of operations (possibly zero) to get the character g. Wait, the problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\" So, the final string after all modifications must be a single character equal to g. But how?\n\nWait, the process of modification reduces the length of the string. Each modification reduces the length by 1. Because you replace two characters with one. So, for example, starting with a string of length L, after k modifications, the length is L - k. To end up with a single character, the original string's length must be such that after k steps, you reach 1. So, the original string's length must be k + 1, and k steps are needed. But since the problem says that the string s can be modified to get g, which is a single character, that implies that the original string s must be modifiable down to a single character. So the original string's length must be such that it can be reduced to 1 via some number of steps. Which means that the original string's length must be >= 1, but since each modification requires the string to be at least two characters, the original string's length must be such that you can apply enough steps to get down to 1. For example, if the original string has length l, then l - k = 1 => k = l-1. So the original string must have length l, and l must be >= 1. But since the problem says that the original string s is the one that has exactly n zeros and m ones, so the total length is n + m. So, for the original string s to be reducible to a single character, the length must be such that (n + m) - k = 1, where k is the number of modifications. So k = (n + m) - 1. Which means that the original string's length must be at least 1, which it is since n + m >= 1. So any original string s can be modified down to a single character, as long as the number of modifications is (n + m - 1). But wait, for example, if the original string's length is 2, you can do one modification. If it's 3, you can do two modifications. So yes, the process is possible.\n\nBut the problem says that the string s must be such that after some number of modifications (possibly zero), you end up with the character g. Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, perhaps the original string s can be modified into the character g. So the question is, for a given s (with n zeros and m ones), is there a way to perform some number of modifications (possibly zero) such that the final string is exactly the character g",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of \"beautiful\" strings that can be reduced to a given character `g` through a series of specified operations. The beautiful strings must contain exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Reduction Process**: Each modification operation reduces the string length by 1 by replacing the last two characters with a new character. The new character is `1` if both replaced characters are `0`, otherwise it is `0`.\n\n2. **Final Character Determination**: To determine if a string can be reduced to a specific character `g`, we need to consider the parity (even or odd) of the number of operations required to reduce the string to a single character. This is because each operation changes the count of zeros and ones in a specific way.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: We use combinatorial mathematics to count the number of valid strings. The key insight is that the final character `g` depends on the parity of the number of operations and the initial counts of zeros and ones.\n\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we use modulo $10^9 + 7$ for all calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        m = int(input[idx+1])\n        g = int(input[idx+2])\n        cases.append((n, m, g))\n        idx += 3\n    \n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to 2*1e5 + 1\n    max_nm = 2 * 10**5 + 10\n    fact = [1] * (max_nm)\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_nm)\n    \n    for i in range(1, max_nm):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    \n    inv_fact[max_nm - 1] = pow(fact[max_nm - 1], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_nm - 2, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    def comb(n, k):\n        if k < 0 or k > n:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, m, g in cases:\n        total = n + m\n        if total == 0:\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # The number of operations needed to reduce to one character is (total - 1)\n        # Each operation reduces the length by 1.\n        # Now, the final character depends on the process.\n        # Let's think about the parity of the number of operations and the initial counts.\n        \n        # For the final character to be g, we need to determine the conditions.\n        # Let's denote the total number of operations as k = total - 1.\n        # Each operation replaces two characters with one.

Result is 0.\n        \n        # Hmm, not sure about the pattern. Maybe another approach is needed.\n        \n        # Let's think of the final character as the XOR of the number of 0s and the number of operations.\n        # Or maybe the parity of the number of operations and the number of 0s.\n        \n        # Let's consider that during the entire reduction process, every time you replace two 0s, you add a 1. Otherwise, you add a 0.\n        # However, the exact sequence depends on the order of operations, which complicates things.\n        \n        # Another idea: the final character depends on the parity of the number of 0s and the parity of the number of operations.\n        # For example, if the number of operations is even, then the parity of the number of 0s remains the same.
