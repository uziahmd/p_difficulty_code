A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible value determined by the available resources divided by the number of friends, right?\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt. But since there are n friends, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend makes one toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs their own portion. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends uses nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires n slices (one per friend), and n * np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose there are 3 friends. For one toast, each of them makes a toast. So total drink required is 3 * nl. Because each of them uses nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires 3 slices of lime (each friend has one slice) and 3 * np grams of salt.\n\nSo the total resources required for t toasts would be:\n\nDrink: t * n * nl\n\nLime slices: t * n\n\nSalt: t * n * np\n\nBut the available resources are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nSalt: p grams.\n\nSo, the maximum t possible is the minimum between:\n\n- (total drink) / (n * nl) → floor division?\n\n- (total lime slices) / (n) → floor division?\n\n- (total salt) / (n * np) → floor division?\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, yes. Because for each toast, all friends need to have their portions. So for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So the total required for each resource is as above.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d.\n\ntotal_salt = p.\n\nThen, compute how many toasts are possible based on each resource:\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. n * nl is 3 * 3 =9. So 20//9 is 2 (since 9*2=18, 9*3=27>20). Then lime slices: c*d is 10 *8=80. Divided by n=3 → 80//3=26. But wait, the sample says that the drink allows 6 toasts. Wait, what's happening here?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why? Oh, because for each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total drink is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222... which floor to 2. But the sample explanation says that 20 /3 =6. Wait, that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So per toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But the sample input says that for the first case, the drink is 20 ml. nl is 3. So per toast, 3 friends * 3 ml =9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222, so floor to 2. But according to the sample explanation, they have 20 /3 =6 toasts. That suggests that the sample explanation is considering per toast per friend, but perhaps the calculation is different.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says: \"the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts\". Wait, why 20/3? Because 20 is total drink. Each toast requires 3 ml per friend. So for one toast, 3 friends need 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, but the sample explanation says 20/3=6. So that suggests that perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is considering per toast per friend. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So the total number of toasts is (total drink) / (nl) divided by n? Or perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is wrong? No, that's unlikely.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the sample input:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends. Each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total drink is 3 * 3 =9 ml. Total drink is 4*5=20 ml. So 20 /9 = 2.222, which would mean 2 toasts. But according to the sample explanation, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe I have the formula backwards. Maybe the total number of toasts is (total_drink) / (nl) divided by n? Or maybe the total toasts is (total_drink) / (nl * n) ?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that 20 / 3 = 6. Which would be 20 divided by 3 is 6.666... but rounded down to 6. So that suggests that the total toasts is (total_drink) / (nl) divided by n? Or perhaps the total toasts is (total_drink) / (nl) divided by n?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose each toast requires per friend nl ml. So for each toast, per friend, it's nl. So for t toasts, each friend has t * nl ml. So for all friends, total drink is t * n * nl. So solving for t:\n\nt = total_drink / (n * nl). So in the first sample, 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, which would floor to 2. But sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So that contradicts. Therefore, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So 20 is the total drink, 3 is nl. So that suggests that the total number of toasts is (total_drink) / (nl) divided by n? Or perhaps the sample explanation is considering that each toast requires nl per friend, but the total per toast is nl, not multiplied by n?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs those. So if there are t toasts, then each friend will have t toasts. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml of drink. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nSo the total drink must be >= n * t * nl.\n\nSo t can be at most total_drink // (n * nl).\n\nBut in the sample explanation, they have 20 / 3 =6. Which is 20 divided by 3 equals 6.666. So that suggests that the sample is using total_drink / (nl) and then divided by something else. So why is that?\n\nIn the sample explanation, they say that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. But according to our formula, that would be 20 / (3*3) = 2.222. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe I have the formula reversed. Maybe the problem says that each toast requires per friend nl ml. But the total number of toasts is t, so each friend makes t toasts. Therefore, each friend needs t * nl ml. So for all friends, total drink is t * nl * n. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml. For 6 toasts, each friend would need 6 * 3 = 18 ml. Total for 3 friends is 3 * 18 = 54 ml. But the total drink is only 20. That's impossible. So the sample explanation must have a different reasoning.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait, why is it divided by 3? Because perhaps the sample explanation is thinking that each toast requires 3 ml total, not per friend. But that would be wrong according to the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. But the total number of toasts is t, and each toast is made by all friends. So for example, for one toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So total for one toast is n * nl ml. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl. Which is what we thought before.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, they have 20 / 3 = 6. So that suggests that the total number of toasts is 20 / 3 = 6. So that would imply that per toast, the total drink needed is 3 ml. Which would be possible if each toast requires 3 ml total, not per friend. But that would contradict the problem statement.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each friend has one toast. So for each toast, the total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml, which allows for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 6 * n * nl = 6 *3 *3 =54 ml. But that's more than 20. So that's impossible. So there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl ml per friend. But the total number of toasts is t, and each friend can make t toasts. But the total drink is t * nl per friend. So for all friends, it's t * nl * n. So that's the same as before.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. So how?\n\nWait, maybe the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait the sample input is:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, each friend uses 3 ml. So for one toast, total drink is 3 *3 =9 ml. For 6 toasts, it would be 6 *9 =54 ml. But the total is only 20. So that's impossible. So why does the sample explanation say that?\n\nWait, maybe the sample explanation is wrong? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, all friends drink together. So each toast requires nl ml per friend. But for one toast, each friend has one toast, so total drink is nl per friend. So for one toast, total drink is nl * n. But the sample explanation says that the drink is 20 /3 =6 toasts. So 20 /3 is 6.666, which would be 6 toasts. So that would suggest that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. So 6 *3 =18 ml. Which would be possible. But that would imply that per toast, the total drink is nl, not nl * n. So that would be a contradiction with the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the problem statement says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each friend uses nl. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl. So total for all friends is t * nl * n. But the sample explanation seems to think that total drink is divided by nl, then divided by n? Or perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is correct, and I'm miscalculating. Let me look again at the sample explanation:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait, why 20 / 3? Because 20 is the total drink, and 3 is the nl. So that suggests that for each toast, the total drink required is nl. Which would be 3 ml per toast. But that would be for all friends combined. So for one toast, all friends together need 3 ml. Which would mean that each friend gets 1 ml per toast. But according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl=3 ml per toast. That's conflicting.\n\nThis is very confusing. How can the sample explanation be correct?\n\nLet me check the sample input again. The first input is:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nWhich corresponds to n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo according to the sample explanation, the drink allows 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which implies that for each toast, the total drink required is 3 ml. So for 6 toasts, 6 *3 =18 ml. Which is within 20.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, each friend needs 3 ml per toast. So for each toast, 3 friends need 3 *3 =9 ml. For 6 toasts, that's 6 *9 =54 ml. Which is way over 20. So why is the sample explanation saying that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the question is asking how many toasts each friend can make. So for example, if each friend can make t toasts, then each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, they say that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. So that would be t=6. Which would require 3 *6 *3 =54 ml. But 20 <54. So this is impossible. Therefore, the sample explanation must be wrong? Or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters for all friends combined. For example, per toast, the total drink is nl. Then, the sample explanation makes sense. But that would be a different problem.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the description says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend needs their own portion. So for one toast, each friend uses nl, so total for all friends is n * nl.\n\nSo why does the sample explanation say that the drink allows 20 /3 =6 toasts?\n\nLet me look at the sample explanation again. The sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So the 6 comes from 20 /3. Which suggests that the drink allows for 6 toasts, then divided by 3 friends gives 2 toasts per friend. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is calculating the total number of toasts that can be made in total, not per friend. Then, the answer is that total toasts divided by number of friends.\n\nFor example, if the total number of toasts possible is T, then each friend can make T // n toasts.\n\nBut that would be a different approach.\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the total number of toasts possible is T, and each toast requires that all friends participate. So for T toasts, each friend makes T toasts. Then, the total drink required would be T * n * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink allows for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be T=6. Then, the number of toasts per friend is T / n = 6 /3 = 2. Which is the sample output.\n\nSo that makes sense. So the sample explanation is saying that the drink allows for 6 total toasts. Then, since there are 3 friends, each can make 6 /3 =2 toasts. But how is 6 computed?\n\nSo for the total toasts T, the drink must satisfy T * n * nl ≤ total_drink.\n\nSo T can be up to total_drink // (n * nl). Which for the first sample is 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2. So T=2. Then, each friend can make 2 toasts. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that T is 6. Which would be 20//3 =6. Which suggests that T is calculated as total_drink // nl. But then T is divided by n to get per friend toasts.\n\nSo this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, or that there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the question is asking for the number of toasts each friend can make, which is t. So for each friend, they make t toasts. Therefore, for all friends, the total number of toasts is n * t. Because each friend makes t toasts. So for example, if each friend makes 2 toasts, then there are 3 *2 =6 total toasts.\n\nSo for each resource, the constraints are:\n\nDrink: total_drink ≥ (n * t) * nl → t ≤ total_drink / (n * nl).\n\nLime slices: total_lime_slices ≥ (n * t) → t ≤ total_lime_slices / n.\n\nSalt: total_salt ≥ (n * t) * np → t ≤ total_salt / (n * np).\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of those three values.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink = 20.\n\nn * nl =3 *3=9. So 20//9 =2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices is 10 *8=80. 80//3=26.\n\nsalt: 100/(3 *1) =33.333 → 33.\n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink allows 6 toasts. Which would be the total toasts T=6. Which would be t= T /n =6/3=2. So the sample explanation is calculating T as 20 /3 =6. Which is the total toasts, and then dividing by n to get per friend toasts. But that's not the correct way to compute T. Because T is n*t. So in this case, T= n*t =3*2=6. And the drink requirement is T * nl =6 *3 =18 ≤20. Which is true. So how did they calculate T as 20 /3 =6?\n\nBecause T * nl = total_drink → T = total_drink / nl. Which would be 20/3 =6.666. So T is 6. Which is the maximum T such that T * nl ≤ total_drink. But T is the total number of toasts, not per friend. So then, the per friend toasts is T /n. But this approach is wrong because it ignores that the other resources may be limiting.\n\nBut why would this approach work? Because for the drink, T is the total toasts, and T must be ≤ total_drink / nl. But this is not considering that T is also limited by the other resources. But in this case, the sample explanation uses this approach for drink, and then divides by n to get per friend toasts. However, this approach is incorrect because the other resources are also involved.\n\nSo why is this approach giving the correct answer in the sample? Let's see:\n\nIn the sample, the drink allows T =20//3=6 (if we do T = total_drink // nl). Then, the per friend toasts is 6//3=2. Which is correct. But what if the other resources are limiting? For example, if the lime slices are only enough for T= 80//1=80 (if we use T = total_lime_slices // 1). Then the per friend toasts would be 80//3=26. So the minimum between 2, 26, etc. is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the sample explanation's approach is to calculate for each resource the maximum possible T (total toasts) and then take the minimum of those T's, then divide by n to get the per friend toasts. Which is the same as calculating for each resource the maximum t (per friend toasts) as T_resource //n.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf for each resource, the maximum total toasts T is:\n\nT_drink = total_drink // nl.\n\nT_lime = total_lime_slices // 1.\n\nT_salt = total_salt // np.\n\nThen the maximum total toasts is min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt).\n\nThen, the per friend toasts is total_toasts //n.\n\nBut this is different from the previous approach. Which one is correct?\n\nLet's take the first sample.\n\ntotal_drink =20, nl=3. T_drink =20//3=6.\n\ntotal_lime_slices =80. T_lime =80//1=80.\n\ntotal_salt =100, np=1. T_salt=100//1=100.\n\nTotal_toasts = min(6,80,100)=6. per friend toasts is 6//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut according to the earlier approach, the drink allows t=20//(3*3)=2. So the per friend toasts is 2. Which is the same result.\n\nSo in this case, both approaches give the same answer.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause the first approach computes T_drink = total_drink // nl. Then divides by n to get per friend toasts. Which is equivalent to:\n\nt = (total_drink // nl) //n.\n\nWhich is the same as total_drink // (nl *n) ?\n\nNo, not exactly. Because integer division is not associative. For example, 20//3=6. 6//3=2. Which is the same as 20// (3*3) =20//9=2. So in this case, the two approaches give the same result.\n\nBut what if the numbers are different? Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose total_drink is 10, nl=3, n=3.\n\nApproach 1: T_drink =10//3=3. t=3//3=1.\n\nApproach 2: t=10//(3*3)=10//9=1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: total_drink=11, nl=3, n=3.\n\nApproach 1: 11//3=3. 3//3=1.\n\nApproach 2: 11//9=1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: total_drink= 12, nl=3, n=3.\n\nApproach 1: 12//3=4, 4//3=1.333→1.\n\nApproach 2: 12//9=1.333→1. Same.\n\nAnother example: total_drink= 13, nl=3, n=3.\n\nApproach 1: 13//3=4. 4//3=1.333 →1.\n\nApproach 2: 13//9=1.444 →1. Same.\n\nAnother example: total_drink=9, nl=3, n=3.\n\nApproach 1: 9//3=3 →3//3=1.\n\nApproach 2: 9//9=1 → same.\n\nAnother example: total_drink= 10, nl=3, n=2.\n\nApproach 1: T_drink=10//3=3. t=3//2=1.5 →1.\n\nApproach 2: t=10/(3*2) =10//6=1. Same.\n\nAnother example: total_drink= 7, nl=3, n=2.\n\nApproach 1: T_drink=7//3=2. t=2//2=1.\n\nApproach 2: 7//6=1. Same.\n\nSo it seems that the two approaches are equivalent. Because:\n\nt = floor( (total_drink / nl) /n ) = floor( total_drink / (nl *n) )\n\nBut is that always true?\n\nYes, because:\n\nfloor( (a / b) / c ) = floor( a/(b*c) )\n\nIs this identity true?\n\nLet me think. For positive integers a, b, c.\n\nLet me suppose that a = q*b + r, where 0 ≤r <b.\n\nThen, (a /b) = q + r/b.\n\nDivided by c: (q + r/b)/c = q/c + r/(b*c).\n\nFloor of that is floor(q/c + r/(b*c)).\n\nBut q/c could be an integer or not. However, when you take the floor of (a/(b*c)), it's equivalent to floor( (q*b + r) / (b*c) ) = floor( q/(c) + r/(b*c) ), which is the same as floor( (q/c) + r/(b*c) ). Which is equal to floor( (a /b)/c ).\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, in practice, for all the examples I tried, the two approaches give the same result. So perhaps they are equivalent.\n\nThus, the two approaches are equivalent. Therefore, the sample explanation's method is correct, and the initial approach I thought was also correct. Both approaches are equivalent.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute for each resource the maximum total toasts possible, then take the minimum of those, then divide by n (integer division) to get the per friend toasts.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum total toasts for each resource?\n\nFor drink: total_drink // nl.\n\nFor lime slices: total_lime_slices // 1 (because each toast requires one slice per friend, so total toasts T must be ≤ total_lime_slices // 1. Because per toast, total slices needed is n *1. So T *n ≤ total_lime_slices → T ≤ total_lime_slices //n.\n\nWait, this is conflicting with the previous approach. Earlier, I thought that T is the total toasts, and for lime slices, the maximum T is total_lime_slices //n. But according to the sample explanation, for lime slices, the maximum T is total_lime_slices // 1. Which is not correct.\n\nWait, this suggests that there's a mistake in the previous analysis.\n\nLet me re-analyze the resources:\n\nThe total toasts T is the number of toasts that all friends can make collectively. For example, if each friend makes t toasts, then T = n * t.\n\nFor the drink:\n\nEach toast requires nl per friend. For T toasts, total drink is T * nl. Because each toast has n friends, each needing nl. Wait no. Wait, T is the total number of toasts. For example, if there are T toasts, then each toast involves all friends. So for each toast, the drink is n * nl. So total drink required is T * n * nl. Which must be ≤ total_drink.\n\nThus, T ≤ total_drink / (n * nl).\n\nSimilarly, for lime slices: each toast requires n slices (one per friend). So total slices needed is T * n. Which must be ≤ total_lime_slices. Thus, T ≤ total_lime_slices / n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires n * np grams. So total salt is T * n * np ≤ p. So T ≤ p/(n * np).\n\nThus, the maximum T is the minimum of:\n\ntotal_drink // (n * nl),\n\ntotal_lime_slices // n,\n\np // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is T, which is the maximum number of total toasts. But the question asks for the number of toasts each friend can make, which is T // n ?\n\nNo, because T is the total number of toasts. Since each friend makes t toasts, T = n * t. So t = T //n ?\n\nNo, because T must be divisible by n? No, because T is the maximum possible total toasts such that T ≤ ... So for example, if T is 6 and n=3, then t=2. If T is 7 and n=3, then t=2 (since 3*2=6 ≤7, but 3*3=9>7).\n\nThus, the answer is T //n.\n\nBut how is T computed? T is the minimum of:\n\ntotal_drink // (n * nl),\n\ntotal_lime_slices // n,\n\np // (n * np).\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink is 20, n * nl is 3 *3=9. 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices is 80, divided by n=3 → 80//3=26.\n\np is 100, divided by n*np =3 *1=3 → 100//3=33.\n\nThus, T is min(2, 26, 33) =2. Answer is 2//n? No, answer is T divided by n? No, because T is the total toasts. Each friend makes T /n toasts. But T is already the minimum of the three values. For example, T is 2, which is the total toasts. So each friend makes 2 /3 toasts? No, that can't be. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the previous analysis.\n\nWait, no. Wait T is the maximum total number of toasts that can be made, such that all constraints are satisfied. Then, since each friend makes t toasts, T = n * t. So t = T //n ?\n\nNo, T must be equal to n * t. So if T is the maximum possible total toasts, then t = T //n ?\n\nNo, that's not right. For example, if T is 2, and n is 3, then t = 0.666, but since we can't have fractions, the actual t is 0. But that's not possible because the sample answer is 2. So clearly, there's a mistake in this line of thinking.\n\nThis indicates that the previous analysis is wrong. So what's the correct way to compute T?\n\nLet me go back to the original problem. The answer is the maximum t such that:\n\nn * t * nl ≤ total_drink,\n\nn * t ≤ total_lime_slices,\n\nn * t * np ≤ p.\n\nThus, solving for t:\n\nt ≤ total_drink/(n * nl),\n\nt ≤ total_lime_slices /n,\n\nt ≤ p/(n * np).\n\nThus, the maximum t is the minimum of these three values, floored to integer.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink/(n * nl) = 20/(3*3) = 2.222 → floor 2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices /n =80/3=26.666 → floor 26.\n\np/(n * np) =100/(3*1)=33.333 → floor 33.\n\nThus, the minimum is 2. So the answer is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to compute for each resource the maximum possible t, and take the minimum of those.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate:\n\ndrink_t = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_t = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_t = p // (n * np)\n\nanswer = min(drink_t, lime_t, salt_t)\n\nSo that's the correct approach.\n\nBut why does the sample explanation say that the drink allows for 20/3=6 toasts? Because that's the total toasts T = n*t. In this case, T is 3 * 2 =6. And the drink constraint is T * nl =6 *3 =18 <=20. So the sample explanation is calculating T as 6, which is n*t. But the sample explanation says that T is 20 /3 =6. Which is the same as (k*l) / nl = 20/3 =6.666, which is floored to 6. But according to the correct approach, the drink_t is (k*l) // (n * nl) =20//9=2. So the sample explanation's calculation is for T, which is n*t. So T is the total toasts. And in that case, T is min( (k*l)//nl, (c*d)//1, p//np ). Then, t = T //n ?\n\nNo, because for the drink, T = (k*l) // nl → which is 20//3=6. But this T must also satisfy T *n *nl ≤k*l. Let's see: T=6, n=3, nl=3. 6 *3 *3=54 >20. Which is not allowed. So this approach is wrong.\n\nSo why does the sample explanation say that the drink allows for 6 toasts? It seems like a mistake. But the sample explanation is part of the problem statement. So there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nBut the sample output is correct. So the correct approach is the one that gives the answer 2, which is the minimum of the three values calculated as (k*l) // (n*nl), etc.\n\nSo perhaps the sample explanation is wrong, but the sample output is correct. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the sample explanation.\n\nIn any case, the code should be written according to the correct approach, which is to compute for each resource the maximum t, and take the minimum of those.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input as n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ndrink_t = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_t = total_lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_t = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_t, lime_t, salt_t)\n\nprint(result)\n\nTesting this with the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink=20\n\ndrink_t =20/(3*3) =20//9=2.\n\nlime_t: c*d=10*8=80. 80//3=26.\n\nsalt_t: p=100, n*np=3*1=3 → 100//3=33. min is 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink=100*10=1000.\n\ndrink_t = 1000/(5 *4) = 1000/(20) =50.\n\nlime_t: c*d=1*19=19. 19//5=3 (since 19/5=3.8 → floor ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The goal is to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Constraints**: Each toast requires `nl` milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and `np` grams of salt per friend. For `t` toasts, each friend will need `t * nl` milliliters of drink, `t` slices of lime, and `t * np` grams of salt.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total available drink, lime slices, and salt.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: For each resource, calculate the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on the available quantity. This is done by dividing the total available quantity by the required amount per toast for each resource.\n4. **Find Minimum Constraint**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Thus, we take the minimum of the values calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split the input into individual numbers\n    numbers = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the parameters\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = numbers\n    \n    # Calculate total resources\n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    # Calculate maximum toasts possible for each resource\n    drink_t = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    lime_t = total_lime_slices // n\n    salt_t = total_salt // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(drink_t, lime_t, salt_t)\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers representing the parameters of the problem.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: The total amount of drink is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle. Similarly, the total number of lime slices is obtained by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n- **Maximum Toasts Calculation**: For each resource (drink, lime slices, salt), we determine how many toasts can be made by dividing the total available quantity by the required amount per toast. This division uses integer division to ensure we get the floor value.\n- **Result Determination**: The result is the minimum value among the maximum toasts possible for each resource, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limit.",
