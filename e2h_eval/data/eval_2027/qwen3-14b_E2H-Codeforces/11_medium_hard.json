A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per person such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input consists of n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend). \n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. But since there are n friends, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, all n friends take their share. So total drink per toast is n * nl. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total available resources:\n\nDrink: k * l ml. Total toasts possible based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Because each toast takes n * nl ml. \n\nLime slices: c limes, each cut into d slices. Total slices is c*d. Each toast needs n slices. So possible toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: p grams. Each toast needs n * np grams. So possible toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources are required for each toast. So the maximum possible toasts is the minimum of the three possible numbers.\n\nWait, but the example given in the note: Let's check. First sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. \n\nSo n=3 friends. \n\nDrink: 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl=3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 *3 =9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the note's first calculation. Then limes: 10 limes, 8 slices each. 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 / 3 is 26.666, floor 26. But wait, the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, no. Wait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait, the note says: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but that's not correct. Because each toast requires n slices. So for each toast, 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, what's the note's explanation?\n\nIn the note, the first sample: the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Wait, why is the drink part 6? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal note says: drink is 4*5=20ml. Enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait, but why is that? Because each toast requires n * nl ml. Oh wait, no. Wait, the note says that for the drink, 20 /3 =6 toasts. But that would be if each toast requires 3 ml per friend, but for all friends. Wait, perhaps the note is considering per toast per friend. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me re-express the problem. For each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, each of the n friends takes nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl ml. So for the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. The total drink is 20ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But according to the note, they have 20 /3 =6 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So why is the drink part 6?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the note is considering that each toast per friend. Like, if each friend makes t toasts, then each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. So the total drink available is k*l. So solving for t: t = (k*l) / (n * nl). But since it's integer division, it's floor((k*l) / (n * nl)).\n\nBut in the note, the first sample's drink is 4*5=20. n is 3, nl is 3. So 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, which would be 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So why is that?\n\nWait, the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" Wait, why divided by 3? Because perhaps the note is thinking that each toast requires 3 ml per friend. So for each toast, each friend uses 3 ml. So for one toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222. But the note says 20 /3 =6. So that suggests that the note is considering that each toast requires 3 ml per friend, but not multiplied by the number of friends. Which would be wrong. But why does the note say that?\n\nWait, the note says: \"the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2.\" So the initial numbers are 6, 80, 100. Then divided by 3. So why is the drink part 6?\n\nAh! Maybe the note is considering that each toast is per friend. Like, each friend makes t toasts. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). But in the note, the sample has k*l = 20, n=3, nl=3. So 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, which is 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So that suggests that the note is calculating (k*l) / nl, then dividing by n. Because 20 /3 = 6.666, then divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2. So that would be the same as (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nSo in other words, the note is saying that the drink can make 20 /3 = 6 toasts (but that's per friend?), and then divided by 3 friends. So the actual number is 6 /3 = 2. Which is the same as (20 / (3*3)) = 2.222 floored to 2. \n\nSo the note's explanation is perhaps a bit confusing, but the correct way is to calculate for each resource how many toasts can be made, considering that each toast requires all the friends to take their share. \n\nSo for the drink, the total available is k*l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the number of toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nSimilarly for the limes: total slices is c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So (c*d) // n. \n\nFor the salt: total is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So p // (n * np). \n\nThen the answer is the minimum of those three numbers. \n\nBut according to the note's example, that's exactly what happens. Let's check:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nDrink: 4*5=20. n * nl = 3*3=9. 20//9 = 2. \n\nLimes: c*d=10*8=80. divided by n (3) is 80//3=26. \n\nSalt: p=100, n * np =3*1=3. 100//3=33. \n\nMinimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, which is 20 /3 =6. But that's 20/(nl) = 6.666. But why? Because that would be the total number of toasts per friend. \n\nWait, perhaps the note's explanation is wrong. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each of the n friends takes their share. Therefore, the total amount of drink needed for one toast is n * nl. \n\nSo the note's explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But 20 /3 is 6.666, which would be 6 toasts. But why is that? Because if you think that for each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So for 6 toasts, that's 6 * 9 = 54 ml. But the total available is 20. Which is not enough. So that's conflicting. \n\nBut according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So why is 6 the value for the drink? Because the note's explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. But how?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is considering that the total number of toasts per friend. So if each friend can make t toasts, then the total drink needed is n * t * nl. So solving for t: t = (k*l) / (n * nl). But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if t was (k*l) / nl, then divided by n. \n\nWait, 20 /3 = 6.666, which would be the total number of toasts per friend (if each toast per friend requires 3 ml). So for example, if each friend can make 6 toasts, then total drink is 3 friends * 6 toasts * 3 ml per toast = 54 ml, which is more than 20. So that's impossible. \n\nThis suggests that the note's explanation is incorrect, but the actual correct approach is the one I thought earlier. However, the sample output is 2. Which matches with the correct approach. So perhaps the note's explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note's explanation is not precise. Let's think again. The note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. But then divides by 3 friends to get 2. Which implies that the 6 is the total number of toasts across all friends. But that can't be. Because if each toast is made by all friends, then the number of toasts is the same for all. So for example, if there are 6 toasts, that's 6 toasts in total, each of which requires all friends to take their share. So the total drink is 6 * n * nl. \n\nBut in the note's example, the drink is 20. So 6 * 3 *3 =54 > 20. Which is not possible. So this suggests that the note's explanation is wrong. But the actual answer is 2, which is the minimum between 2 (drink), 26 (limes), 33 (salt). So why does the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts? That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note's explanation is wrong. But the sample output is correct. So perhaps the note's explanation is incorrect, but the actual correct approach is the one I thought of earlier.\n\nSo how to proceed? Let's take the sample input and compute according to my approach.\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nDrink: k*l = 4*5=20. Each toast requires n * nl = 3 *3=9. 20//9 = 2. \n\nLimes: c*d=10*8=80. Each toast requires n slices (3). 80//3=26. \n\nSalt: p=100. Each toast requires n * np = 3*1=3. 100//3=33. \n\nMinimum of 2,26,33 is 2. Which is the correct answer. So the note's explanation is wrong. But the sample output is correct. So perhaps the note's explanation is wrong, but the correct approach is to calculate the three values as I did.\n\nSo the code should compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input given in the note. The first sample input:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1']\n\nWhich gives the output 2. Which matches.\n\nAnother sample input is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3' → output '3'.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000.\n\nnl=4. So per toast, n * nl =5*4=20. 1000//20 =50.\n\nLimes: c=1, d=19 → total slices 1*19=19. Divided by n=5 → 19//5=3.\n\nSalt: p=90. np=3. n*np=5*3=15. 90//15=6. \n\nmin(50,3,6) → 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample input is '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'.\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink is 1e6.\n\nnl=50. So per toast, 10 *50 =500. 1e6 // 500 = 2000.\n\nLimes: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575 slices. Divided by n=10 → 575//10=57.\n\nSalt: p=1. np=1. n*np=10*1=10. 1//10=0. \n\nmin(2000,57,0) → 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input line, split into the numbers, compute the three values, take the minimum, and output it.\n\nSo in Python, the steps are:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut need to handle cases where division is zero? Well, since all inputs are >=1, but for example, if n * nl is larger than total_drink, then toast_drink is zero. Which is handled correctly.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → outputs 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → outputs 3.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → outputs 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line, split into integers, compute as above.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line. But the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is the first and only line. So the code reads one line, splits into the numbers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given, the first example shows that the input is a list of multiple lines. Wait, no. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is the first and only line. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but in reality, the program is supposed to process one line of input. \n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nSo the code should read one line. For example, in the first sample input, the input is one line, which is the first string in the list. The other entries are other test cases. So the code should read one line, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead the input line as a single line, split into the 8 integers.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute the three values, then print the minimum.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input, compute the three values.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlimes = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(drink, limes, salt))\n\nThat's the code. Let me test with the first sample input.\n\nSample input line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → drink is (4*5) // (3*3) = 20//9=2. limes: (10*8)//3 = 80//3=26. salt: 100//(3*1)=33. min(2, 26, 33) is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → drink is (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000//20=50. limes (1*19)//5 = 19//5=3. salt 90//(5*3)=90//15=6. min(50,3,6)=3. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → drink: 1000*1000 // (10*50) → 1,000,000 // 500 = 2000. limes: 25*23=575 //10=57. salt: 1//(10*1)=0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for all samples.\n\nEdge cases: for example, when any of the resources is zero. But since the input constraints state that all numbers are at least 1, so no division by zero. For example, n is at least 1, etc.\n\nAnother edge case: when all resources are exactly enough. Like, if drink is exactly divisible by n * nl, etc.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The goal is to find the maximum number of toasts that can be made such that all friends can participate equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink available from the bottles, the total number of lime slices available, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts can be made based on the available quantity:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink and divide by the required amount per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices and divide by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate the total grams of salt and divide by the required amount per toast for all friends.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value among the three calculated constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlimes = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, limes, salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, number of bottles, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle to get the total drink available. Divide this by the total milliliters needed per toast for all friends (number of friends multiplied by milliliters per toast per friend).\n3. **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime to get the total slices available. Divide this by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends (number of friends).\n4. **Total Salt Calculation**: Divide the total grams of salt by the total grams needed per toast for all friends (number of friends multiplied by grams of salt per toast per friend).\n5. **Determine Minimum**: The result is the minimum value of the three calculated values, as this represents the limiting resource that determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.",
