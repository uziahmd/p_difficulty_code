    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain inequalities. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the main condition we need to check is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order x ≤ y ≤ z, the sum x + y must be greater than z. Otherwise, it's degenerate.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate through all possible x, y, z values within their ranges and count those that satisfy x + y > z. However, given that the ranges can be up to 5e5, a brute force approach would be way too slow. We need an efficient way to calculate this.\n\nLet me think about the ranges. The variables are constrained as follows:\n\nx is between A and B (inclusive), y is between B and C (inclusive), z is between C and D (inclusive). Also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, and y ≤ C ≤ z, so the order is x ≤ y ≤ z. Wait, no. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y starts at B and goes up to C, and z starts at C and goes up to D. So the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z. Because x can be up to B, and y starts at B. So for example, if x is B and y is B, then x = y. Then z is at least C which is ≥ B. So yes, the order is x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nTherefore, for each valid triplet (x,y,z), the triangle inequality is x + y > z. So how do we count all such triplets?\n\nThe challenge is to compute this efficiently. Let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's note that for each x and y, we can find the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. Because z has to be at least C and at most D, but also less than x + y. However, since z must be ≥ C, the valid z's are those between max(C, ...) and min(D, x + y - 1). Wait, because z has to be less than x + y. So the upper bound for z is x + y - 1. So for each x and y, the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut wait, z must be ≥ C. So the lower bound is C, upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). If the upper bound is less than C, then there are zero z's. Otherwise, the count is upper_bound - C + 1.\n\nSo the plan is to iterate over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], compute for each (x,y) the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y - 1), and sum all those counts.\n\nBut the problem is that B and C could be up to 5e5, so the total number of (x,y) pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). Let's see. For example, if A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, then (B-A+1) is 5e5, and (C-B+1) is 1. So total pairs would be 5e5. For each pair, we compute the count of z's. So overall, the time complexity would be O((B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)). But if B and C are up to 5e5, then in worst case, B - A + 1 is 5e5, and C - B + 1 is 5e5. So the total number of pairs is (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. Which is way too big for Python to handle in reasonable time. That's impossible. So this approach would not work for large inputs.\n\nWe need a smarter way to compute this.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's find for each possible y, the range of x's and then compute the number of z's for each x and y. But again, perhaps we can find a way to compute the sum over x and y efficiently.\n\nWait, but maybe the key is to find for each possible x and y, the number of z's. But how can we compute this without iterating all x and y?\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. Since x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let's note that for a given x and y, the maximum value of z is min(D, x + y - 1). But z must be ≥ C. Therefore, the number of valid z is:\n\nif x + y - 1 < C → 0\n\nelse:\n\nthe number is min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1 = min(D - C + 1, x + y - 1 - C + 1) = min(D - C + 1, x + y - C).\n\nWait, because:\n\nmin(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1 = (if x + y - 1 >= D → D - C + 1; else x + y - 1 - C + 1 = x + y - C )\n\nSo the count is max(0, min(D - C + 1, x + y - C )) )\n\nBut how can we compute the sum over all x and y of this value?\n\nHmm. Let's split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: x + y - C <= D - C + 1 → x + y <= D - C + 1 + C → x + y <= D + 1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me rephrase. The value of x + y - C can be up to (B + C) - C = B. So D - C + 1 may be larger or smaller than x + y - C.\n\nBut regardless, the count is:\n\nif x + y > C → then the number of z's is min(D - C + 1, x + y - C) → because x + y - C is the number of z's from C to x + y - 1 (since z can be up to x + y - 1). But if x + y - 1 is larger than D, then it's capped at D.\n\nSo for each (x, y) where x + y > C, the count is min(D - C + 1, x + y - C).\n\nBut how do we compute the sum over all x and y in their ranges of this value?\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think of it as:\n\nTotal = sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C [ max(0, min(D - C + 1, x + y - C )) ] \n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me denote S = D - C + 1. So S is the maximum number of z's possible for a given x and y. For each x and y, if x + y - C <= S, then the contribution is x + y - C. Otherwise, it's S.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nsum_{x, y} [ if x + y > C then min(S, x + y - C) else 0 ]\n\nBut how can we compute this sum?\n\nLet me consider that for x and y, the condition x + y > C must hold. Let's first find the region where x + y > C. For each x and y in their ranges, that's the condition. Let's note that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C.\n\nBut since x can be as small as A and y as small as B. So the minimum value of x + y is A + B. But since the constraints are A ≤ B ≤ C, and the problem says that A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So, for example, if A + B > C, then all (x, y) pairs will contribute. Otherwise, some pairs contribute.\n\nSo let's first compute for all x and y, the sum of min(S, x + y - C) where x + y > C.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of x and y as variables. Let me define k = x + y. Then for each k, the value is min(S, k - C). But k can range from (A + B) to (B + C). Because x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C.\n\nSo for each possible k, we can compute how many (x, y) pairs have x + y = k, then multiply by the corresponding min(S, k - C) value. Then sum over all k where k > C.\n\nBut even this approach might be feasible if we can compute the number of pairs (x, y) for each k quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, let's split the problem into two parts:\n\n1. All pairs (x, y) where x + y - C ≤ S → x + y ≤ C + S → since S = D - C + 1 → C + S = D + 1. So x + y ≤ D + 1. Since z can be up to D, but x + y - C can be up to x + y - C. So for x + y ≤ D + 1, the contribution is x + y - C.\n\nBut since x + y can be up to B + C (since x is up to B, y up to C). So if B + C ≤ D + 1 → then all pairs contribute x + y - C. Otherwise, for x + y > D + 1, the contribution is S = D - C + 1.\n\nSo the total sum can be written as:\n\nsum_{x, y} [ if x + y > C then (if x + y <= D + 1 then (x + y - C) else S) else 0 ]\n\nWhich can be split into two parts:\n\nsum_part1: sum over all (x, y) where C < x + y ≤ D + 1 of (x + y - C)\n\nsum_part2: sum over all (x, y) where x + y > D + 1 of S.\n\nSo total = sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\nNow, how to compute sum_part1 and sum_part2.\n\nLet me first compute the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy x + y > C. Let's call this count_total. Then sum_part2 is equal to S multiplied by the number of pairs where x + y > D + 1.\n\nBut how to compute these counts and sums?\n\nLet me think about the variables again. x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C.\n\nLet me first find the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > C. Let's call this N1.\n\nSimilarly, the number of pairs where x + y > D + 1 is N2.\n\nThen sum_part2 = S * N2.\n\nFor sum_part1, it's the sum over all pairs where x + y > C and x + y ≤ D + 1 of (x + y - C) → which can be rewritten as sum (x + y) for those pairs minus C * (number of such pairs). So sum_part1 = (sum_k (k * cnt_k)) - C * (N1 - N2), where cnt_k is the number of pairs with x + y = k. Because sum (k - C) = sum k - C * count.\n\nBut how to compute sum (k * cnt_k) for k in (C, D + 1] ?\n\nAlternatively, the sum_part1 is equal to sum_{k = C+1}^{D+1} (k - C) * cnt_k, where cnt_k is the number of pairs (x,y) with x + y = k.\n\nBut how to compute cnt_k for all k?\n\nThis seems manageable if we can find the number of pairs (x, y) for each k in a certain range.\n\nSo, the problem now becomes:\n\nCompute for all k in [L, R], the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y = k.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of counting the number of integer solutions to x + y = k with x in [A, B], y in [B, C].\n\nLet me think about how to compute cnt_k for a given k.\n\nFor x in [A, B], y must be in [B, C], and x + y = k → y = k - x. So for each x, check if y is in [B, C].\n\nSo for a given k, the valid x's are those such that:\n\ny = k - x must be between B and C → B ≤ k - x ≤ C → rearranged:\n\nk - C ≤ x ≤ k - B.\n\nAlso, x must be in [A, B].\n\nSo combining these two conditions:\n\nx must be in [max(A, k - C), min(B, k - B)].\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nB ≤ k - x ≤ C → subtracting k:\n\n- k + B ≤ -x ≤ -k + C → multiply by -1 and reverse inequalities:\n\nk - C ≤ x ≤ k - B.\n\nSo x must be in [k - C, k - B], and also in [A, B].\n\nSo the valid x's are in the intersection of [A, B] and [k - C, k - B].\n\nSo for each k, the number of x's is the number of integers x in this overlapping interval.\n\nSo the lower bound for x is L = max(A, k - C).\n\nThe upper bound is U = min(B, k - B).\n\nIf L > U, then there are zero solutions. Otherwise, the count is U - L + 1.\n\nSo for each k, cnt_k = max(0, U - L + 1) where U and L are as above.\n\nBut calculating this for every k in the required range (from C+1 to D+1) could be computationally intensive. However, perhaps we can find ranges of k where the formula for cnt_k can be expressed as a function, allowing us to compute the sum using mathematical formulas.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the possible k ranges from (A + B) to (B + C). But since we are interested in k from (C+1) to (D+1), but D can be larger than B + C. So the actual upper limit for k is min(B + C, D + 1).\n\nSo let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the sum_part1 and sum_part2.\n\nBut how to compute the sum over all pairs (x, y) where x + y is in [C+1, D+1], of (x + y - C) ?\n\nWhich is equivalent to sum (x + y) for those pairs minus C multiplied by the number of such pairs.\n\nSo sum_part1 = (sum_xy) - C * (N1 - N2), where sum_xy is the sum of x + y for all pairs where x + y is in [C+1, D+1], and N1 is the number of pairs with x + y > C, and N2 is the number of pairs with x + y > D + 1.\n\nSo the problem now is to compute:\n\n1. N1: number of pairs (x, y) with x + y > C.\n\n2. N2: number of pairs (x, y) with x + y > D + 1.\n\n3. sum_xy: sum of x + y for pairs where x + y is in [C+1, D+1].\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about how to compute N1 and N2.\n\nFor N1: the number of pairs (x, y) where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], x + y > C.\n\nSimilarly, for N2: same but x + y > D + 1.\n\nLet me find a general way to compute the number of pairs (x, y) where x ∈ [a, b], y ∈ [c, d], and x + y > K.\n\nIn our case, a = A, b = B, c = B, d = C, and K is either C or D+1.\n\nSo how to compute this?\n\nAn efficient way is to compute for each x, the number of y's such that y ≥ max(c, K - x + 1) ?\n\nWait, x + y > K → y > K - x → since y is integer, y ≥ K - x + 1.\n\nBut y must be in [c, d].\n\nSo for each x, the number of valid y's is:\n\nmax(0, d - max(c, K - x + 1) + 1 )\n\nSo the total number of pairs is sum_{x=a}^b max(0, d - max(c, K - x + 1) + 1 )\n\nBut again, for large ranges, this could be O(B - A + 1) operations, which may be acceptable if B - A is up to 5e5, and we have to do this twice (for K=C and K=D+1).\n\nBut given that B can be up to 5e5, and for each K, this would take O(5e5) steps, then for two K's, it's 1e6 steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo perhaps this is feasible.\n\nSimilarly, for sum_xy, which is the sum over x and y of (x + y) for pairs where x + y is in [C+1, D+1]. But how?\n\nAlternatively, sum_xy can be computed as sum_{x,y} (x + y) for pairs where x + y > C and x + y ≤ D+1.\n\nWhich is equal to sum_{x,y} (x + y) for x + y > C minus sum_{x,y} (x + y) for x + y > D+1.\n\nSo sum_xy = sum_all_gt_C - sum_all_gt_D_plus_1.\n\nWhere sum_all_gt_C is the sum of (x + y) for all pairs (x, y) with x + y > C.\n\nSimilarly sum_all_gt_D_plus_1 is the same for x + y > D+1.\n\nSo if we can compute sum_all_gt_K for a given K, then we can compute sum_xy as sum_all_gt_C - sum_all_gt_D_plus_1.\n\nSo the problem now becomes:\n\nHow to compute for a given K, the number of pairs (x, y) where x + y > K, and the sum of x + y for those pairs.\n\nLet me think about how to compute these.\n\nFor the count:\n\nAs discussed earlier, for each x in [A, B], the number of y's in [B, C] that satisfy y ≥ (K - x + 1) is:\n\nmax(0, C - max(B, K - x + 1) + 1 )\n\nSo the count is the sum over x of that.\n\nFor the sum of x + y:\n\nFor each x, the valid y's are from y_min to y_max, where y_min = max(B, K - x + 1), y_max = C.\n\nThe number of terms is cnt_y = max(0, y_max - y_min + 1).\n\nThe sum for a given x is sum_{y=y_min}^{y_max} (x + y) = x * cnt_y + sum_{y=y_min}^{y_max} y.\n\nSum y from a to b is (b - a + 1) * (a + b) / 2.\n\nSo for each x, we can compute this contribution.\n\nTherefore, the total sum for all pairs where x + y > K is sum over x of (x * cnt_y + sum_y).\n\nSo, putting this all together, here's the plan:\n\nImplement functions to compute for a given K:\n\n- count_gt(K): returns the number of pairs (x, y) with x + y > K.\n\n- sum_gt(K): returns the sum of (x + y) for those pairs.\n\nOnce we have these, then:\n\nsum_part1 = (sum_gt(C) - sum_gt(D + 1)) - C * (count_gt(C) - count_gt(D + 1))\n\nsum_part2 = (D - C + 1) * (count_gt(D + 1))\n\nThen total = sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\nBut wait, sum_part1 is sum over (x + y - C) for pairs where x + y > C and x + y <= D + 1. Which equals (sum_gt(C) - sum_gt(D + 1)) ) - C * (count_gt(C) - count_gt(D + 1)).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute:\n\ncount_gt_C = count_gt(C)\n\ncount_gt_D_plus_1 = count_gt(D + 1)\n\nsum_gt_C = sum_gt(C)\n\nsum_gt_D_plus_1 = sum_gt(D + 1)\n\nsum_xy = (sum_gt_C - sum_gt_D_plus_1) \n\nsum_part1 = sum_xy - C * (count_gt_C - count_gt_D_plus_1)\n\nsum_part2 = (D - C + 1) * count_gt_D_plus_1\n\ntotal = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nThat's the total number of valid triangles.\n\nSo the core is to implement count_gt and sum_gt functions.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement these functions efficiently.\n\nFor count_gt(K):\n\nWe need to iterate x from A to B, and for each x, compute the number of y's in [B, C] where y ≥ (K - x + 1).\n\nLet me define for each x:\n\nlow_y = max(B, K - x + 1)\n\nhigh_y = C\n\nif low_y > high_y → 0 else high_y - low_y + 1.\n\nSo the count for each x is max(0, high_y - low_y + 1).\n\nSimilarly for sum_gt(K), for each x, compute the same low_y and high_y, then:\n\ncnt_y = high_y - low_y + 1 if low_y <= high_y else 0.\n\nsum_x_part = x * cnt_y.\n\nsum_y_part = sum from low_y to high_y of y → which is (low_y + high_y) * cnt_y // 2.\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is sum_x_part + sum_y_part.\n\nNow, the question is, how efficient is this?\n\nAssuming that B can be up to 5e5, then for each K, we loop over B - A + 1 elements. For two K's (C and D+1), this would be O(2*(B - A + 1)) operations. Which for B - A up to 5e5 is acceptable.\n\nBut what if A is 1 and B is 5e5? Then 5e5 iterations per K. For two K's, that's 1e6 steps. Which is manageable.\n\nSo this approach is feasible.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet's compute.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nCompute:\n\ncount_gt_C is count_gt(3).\n\nsum_gt_C is sum_gt(3).\n\ncount_gt_D_plus_1 is count_gt(4+1=5).\n\nsum_gt_D_plus_1 is sum_gt(5).\n\nS = D - C + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\n\nLet's compute count_gt(3):\n\nFor each x in [1, 2], compute the number of y in [2, 3] where y >= (3 - x + 1) = 4 -x.\n\nFor x=1:\n\nlow_y = max(2, 4 - 1) = max(2, 3) = 3. high_y =3. cnt = 1.\n\nFor x=2:\n\nlow_y = max(2, 4 - 2) = max(2, 2) =2. high_y=3. cnt = 2.\n\nTotal count_gt_C = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nsum_gt_C:\n\nFor x=1, low_y=3, high_y=3. cnt=1. sum_x_part = 1*1=1. sum_y_part = (3 + 3)*1//2 = 3. Total contribution 4.\n\nFor x=2, low_y=2, high_y=3. cnt=2. sum_x_part = 2*2=4. sum_y_part = (2+3)*2/2 = 5. Total contribution 4+5=9. Total sum_gt_C is 4 +9 =13.\n\ncount_gt_D_plus_1 is count_gt(5). For K=5.\n\nFor each x in [1,2], compute y >= 5 -x +1 = 6 -x.\n\nx=1: 6-1=5. y must be >=5. But y ranges from 2 to 3. So no solutions. cnt=0.\n\nx=2: 6-2=4. y >=4. y ranges up to 3.

No. So count_gt_D_plus_1 is 0.\n\nsum_part1 = (7 - 0) - 2*(2 - 0) → 7 - 4 =3.\n\nsum_part2 = 4 * 0 =0 → total 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: input 500000 500000 500000 500000. Output 1.\n\nA=B=C=D=5e5.\n\ncount_gt_C = count_gt(5e5). For K=5e5.\n\nx ranges from 5e5 to 5e5 (only x=5e5). y ranges from 5e5 to 5e5.\n\nFor x=5e5, y must be >= 5e5 -x +1 = 5e5 -5e5 +1 =1. Since y is 5e5, which is >=1. So cnt is 1. So count_gt_C is 1.\n\nsum_gt_C is 5e5 +5e5 = 1e6.\n\ncount_gt_D_plus_1 is count_gt(5e5 +1). For K=5e5 +1.\n\nFor x=5e5: y >= (5e5 +1) -x +1 = 5e5 +1 -5e5 +1 = 2. But y is 5e5 ≥2. So cnt is 1. So count_gt_D_plus_1 is 1.\n\nsum_gt_D_plus_1 is 5e5 +5e5 = 1e6.\n\nsum_xy = (sum_gt_C - sum_gt_D_plus_1) → 1e6 - 1e6 = 0.\n\nsum_part1 = 0 - 5e5 * (1 - 1) = 0.\n\nsum_part2 = (D - C +1) * count_gt_D_plus_1 → (5e5 -5e5 +1) * 1 = 1 *1 =1.\n\nTotal is 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nImplement functions count_gt(K) and sum_gt(K).\n\nBut how to handle the parameters?\n\nIn code, for a given K, we loop x from A to B, inclusive.\n\nFor each x, compute:\n\nlow_y = max(B, K - x + 1)\n\nhigh_y = C\n\nif low_y > high_y → contribute 0 to count and sum.\n\nElse:\n\ncnt_y = high_y - low_y + 1\n\nadd to count.\n\nsum_x_part = x * cnt_y\n\nsum_y_part = (low_y + high_y) * cnt_y // 2\n\nadd to sum.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef count_gt(K, A, B, C):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    for x in range(A, B+1):\n\n        low_y = max(B, K - x + 1)\n\n        high_y = C\n\n        if low_y > high_y:\n\n            continue\n\n        count += high_y - low_y + 1\n\n    return count\n\nSimilarly for sum_gt:\n\ndef sum_gt(K, A, B, C):\n\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    for x in range(A, B+1):\n\n        low_y = max(B, K - x + 1)\n\n        high_y = C\n\n        if low_y > high_y:\n\n            continue\n\n        cnt_y = high_y - low_y + 1\n\n        sum_x_part = x * cnt_y\n\n        sum_y_part = (low_y + high_y) * cnt_y // 2\n\n        total_sum += sum_x_part + sum_y_part\n\n    return total_sum\n\nBut for large ranges, like when B is 5e5, looping in Python for 5e5 elements may be slow. However, given that Python can handle loops up to 1e6 steps in acceptable time, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut let's think about possible optimizations. For example, precomputing the ranges for x.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute:\n\nK1 = C\n\nK2 = D + 1\n\ncount_gt_C = count_gt(K1, A, B, C)\n\ncount_gt_D_plus_1 = count_gt(K2, A, B, C)\n\nsum_gt_C = sum_gt(K1, A, B, C)\n\nsum_gt_D_plus_1 = sum_gt(K2, A, B, C)\n\nsum_xy = sum_gt_C - sum_gt_D_plus_1\n\nsum_part1 = sum_xy - C * (count_gt_C - count_gt_D_plus_1)\n\nS = D - C + 1\n\nsum_part2 = S * count_gt_D_plus_1\n\ntotal = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, what if D < C? Well, according to the input constraints, A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So D >= C.\n\nSo S is always ≥ 1.\n\nBut let's test when D = C. For example, the third sample where D = C = 5e5.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut for large values of B (up to 5e5), the for loops in count_gt and sum_gt may be slow in Python. For example, if B is 5e5, and A is 1, then the for loop runs 5e5 times. For two K's, that's 1e6 iterations. Each iteration is simple operations. But in Python, even 1e6 steps can be acceptable, but perhaps we can optimize further.\n\nAlternative approach: find mathematical expressions for the count and sum.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the count_gt(K) more efficiently.\n\nFor x in [A, B], and y in [B, C], x + y > K.\n\nLet me find for each x, the minimal y that satisfies y ≥ (K - x + 1). Since y is in [B, C], the minimal y is max(B, K -x + 1).\n\nBut for a given x, the number of valid y's is max(0, C - max(B, K - x + 1) + 1).\n\nLet me denote:\n\nfor each x, the lower bound for y is L(x) = max(B, K - x + 1)\n\nso the count is max(0, C - L(x) + 1) if L(x) <= C.\n\nLet me think about the range of x where L(x) <= C.\n\nWhich is equivalent to K - x + 1 <= C → x >= K - C + 1.\n\nBut x is also in [A, B].\n\nSo the valid x's are those in [x_min, B], where x_min is max(A, K - C + 1).\n\nBut perhaps this can be used to find ranges of x where L(x) is B or K - x + 1.\n\nBut this may complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, for the count_gt(K), we can find the x's for which K - x + 1 <= B → x >= K - B + 1.\n\nIn that case, L(x) = B. So for x >= K - B + 1, the lower bound is B.\n\nOtherwise, L(x) = K - x + 1.\n\nSo the x can be split into two regions:\n\nCase 1: x >= K - B + 1 → L(x) = B. So the count is max(0, C - B + 1) if B <= C.\n\nBut since B <= C (given), then C - B + 1 is the number of y's in [B, C], which is C - B + 1. So for x >= K - B + 1, the count is C - B + 1.\n\nCase 2: x < K - B + 1 → L(x) = K - x + 1. So for these x, we need K - x + 1 <= C → x >= K - C + 1.\n\nSo for x in [max(A, K - C + 1), K - B] (assuming K - B > K - C + 1?), the count is C - (K - x + 1) + 1 = C - K + x - 1 + 1 = x + C - K.\n\nSo combining these two cases, the total count can be calculated by finding the ranges of x where each case applies and summing accordingly.\n\nThis would allow us to compute the count_gt(K) using mathematical formulas instead of iterating through all x.\n\nThis optimization would be crucial for handling large ranges efficiently.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me define:\n\nFor a given K:\n\nThe threshold for x is x0 = K - B + 1.\n\nFor x >= x0 → L(x) = B.\n\nFor x < x0 → L(x) = K -x + 1.\n\nBut for L(x) to be <= C, we need K -x + 1 <= C → x >= K - C + 1.\n\nSo for x < x0, but x >= x1 (where x1 = K - C + 1), then L(x) is K -x + 1 <= C. Otherwise, for x < x1, L(x) = K -x + 1 > C → no valid y's.\n\nSo the valid x ranges are:\n\nx in [x_low, x_high], where x_low = max(A, x1) = max(A, K - C + 1), and x_high = min(B, x0 - 1).\n\nBut x_high could be less than x_low, meaning no x's in this case.\n\nSo the total count_gt(K) can be calculated as:\n\ncount_case1 + count_case2.\n\nWhere:\n\ncount_case1 is the number of x's in [x0, B], multiplied by (C - B + 1).\n\ncount_case2 is the sum over x in [x_low, x_high] of (C - (K -x +1) + 1) = sum (x + C - K).\n\nSo let's compute these.\n\nFirst, compute x0 = K - B + 1.\n\nx_low = max(A, K - C + 1)\n\nx_high = min(B, x0 - 1)\n\nif x_low > x_high → count_case2 = 0.\n\nElse, count_case2 is sum_{x=x_low}^{x_high} (x + C - K) = sum x from x_low to x_high + (C - K) * (x_high - x_low + 1).\n\nSimilarly, count_case",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$.
