Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find all the integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars at some point during the file copying process. \n\nSo, first, I need to understand how the progress bars work. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied. The second shows the total percentage across all files. Both are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied. \n\nThe key here is to simulate all possible moments when a byte is copied and check for each moment what the two percentages are. Then collect all the values that are present in both.\n\nBut simulating every byte might be computationally feasible since the maximum total bytes is 100 files * 1000 bytes = 100,000 bytes. For each byte, we can compute the two percentages and track when they are equal. However, even with 10^5 steps, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but how do I track all the possible percentages? Let's think about the steps:\n\nFor each file i (from 0 to n-1), and for each byte x in 1..a_i (since after each byte, the progress is updated). Also, note that the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. So that's a case to consider as well.\n\nWait, the problem says that the progress bars are updated after each byte. So for example, when the first byte is copied, the progress bars update. So the initial state is 0% for both, which counts as a moment. Then, after each byte, we have new values.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Compute the total size of all files, total = sum(a).\n\n- For each byte copied (each step), determine which file it's in, and which byte in that file.\n\n- For that step, calculate the current file's percentage (for the current file) and the total percentage (for the entire process).\n\n- Check if these two percentages are equal. If so, add that value to a set of possible answers.\n\nBut how do I iterate through each byte?\n\nLet me think. For each file i (from 0 to n-1), the bytes are from 1 to a_i. For each byte x in that file, the current file's progress is floor(100 * x / a_i). The total bytes copied up to that point is sum(a[0..i-1]) + x. The total progress is floor(100 * (sum_so_far) / total).\n\nBut also, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. So that's a case where both are 0. So we need to include that.\n\nBut how do I capture all possible moments? Let's think:\n\nThe initial moment is before any bytes are copied. Then, after each byte, there's a new moment. So for each byte in the entire process, we have a moment. Plus the initial moment.\n\nBut the initial moment is when both are zero. So we need to check that.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nInitialize a set to store the valid percentages.\n\nCheck the initial state (both are 0) and add 0 to the set if it's allowed (which it is).\n\nThen, for each byte copied, compute the two percentages and check if they are equal. If yes, add that value to the set.\n\nWait, but for each byte, there's exactly one moment. So for example, if there are multiple bytes that result in the same percentage pair, we only need to record the value once.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the total sum.\n\n- Iterate over each file, and for each byte in the file, compute the current progress for the file and the total progress.\n\n- For each such byte, check if the two percentages are equal. If so, add that value to a set.\n\n- Also, check the initial state (0, 0) which is before any bytes are copied. But wait, according to the problem statement, after copying each byte, the progress bars update. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. Then, after the first byte is copied, the progress bars update. So the initial state is included as a moment.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because when the first byte is copied, the progress is calculated for that byte. But the initial state is before any bytes. So perhaps we need to check that as a separate case.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Add 0 to the set if it is present in both progress bars at the initial moment. Which it is.\n\n2. For each byte in all files, compute the two percentages and check if they are equal. If so, add to the set.\n\nBut then, after the last byte is copied, the progress bars are 100% for both. So that's another case. Wait, when the last byte is copied, the total progress is sum(a) / sum(a) * 100 = 100. So floor(100 * sum_so_far / total) would be 100. Similarly, for the current file's progress, since x is a_i (the last byte of the file), 100 * x / a_i is 100. So the 100% is added. So that's covered.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nAdd 0 to the set (since initial state is 0 for both).\n\nThen for each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n   sum_prev = sum of a_0 to a_{i-1}\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current_file_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = floor(100 * total_bytes / total)\n\n       if current_file_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nOnce all bytes are processed, collect the set, sort it, and output.\n\nBut wait, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. However, when the first byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. So the initial state is a moment, but after that, the first byte's processing is another moment.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the initial state is included. So the code must check that.\n\nBut according to the problem's example, the first test case has output including 0 and 100. For example, in the first example input, which is 1 file of 6 bytes. The output includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Let's see:\n\nAt the initial moment, both are 0. Then after each byte, the current file's percent is (x*100)/6, and the total is same. So for x=6, the percent is 100. So 0 and 100 are included. So the initial state is considered.\n\nBut according to our algorithm, adding 0 as a separate case. Then, during the processing of the first byte, the current percent would be 100*1/6 = 16.666... floored to 16. The total percent is same. So 16 is added. So the initial 0 is added, and then other numbers.\n\nSo the code should include the initial 0. But wait, what about the moment when the last byte is copied? For example, in the first test case, after the 6th byte, the current percent is 100, and the total is 100. So that's added. So the code would capture that.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, read n and the list a.\n\nCompute total = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set called result = set()\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nThen, for each file i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = sum(a[0..i-1])\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n       current_file_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total\n\n       if current_file_percent == total_percent:\n\n           result.add(current_file_percent)\n\nBut how to compute sum_prev? Well, for each file i, sum_prev is the sum of the first i files. So we can precompute a prefix sum array.\n\nFor example:\n\nprefix = [0] * (n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, for the i-th file (0-based), sum_prev is prefix[i].\n\nSo for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum_prev = prefix[i]\n\nThen, for x in 1..a[i], total_bytes is sum_prev + x.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n, then the list a.\n\nCompute prefix sums.\n\ntotal = prefix[-1]\n\nInitialize result as a set containing 0.\n\nThen loop through each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = prefix[i]\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           result.add(current_percent)\n\nOnce all done, collect the sorted list of elements in the result set, and print them.\n\nWait, but what about the final moment when all bytes are copied? For example, when x is the last byte of the last file. The code will process that, because for the last file, x runs up to a[i], and the total_bytes is prefix[i] + x = prefix[n] = total. So (100 * total) // total is 100. So that's added. So the 100 is added to the set. But in the initial code, the 0 is added. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the first example, the output includes 0 and 100. So the code would capture that.\n\nBut let's think about the first example. Input is 1 and 6. The code adds 0 initially. Then, for i=0, sum_prev is 0. For x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x)/6, floored.\n\ntotal_bytes is 0 + x, total is 6. total_percent is (100x)/6, same as current_percent. So for each x, the two percentages are same. So the set will have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is 2 files of 100 and 500. The output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Let's see.\n\nThe total is 600. So for the first file (100 bytes), sum_prev is 0. For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x)/100 = x. So for x from 1 to 100, current_percent is 1 to 100.\n\ntotal_bytes is x, so total_percent is (100x)/600 = x/6. So for x from 1 to 100, the total_percent is floor(x/6). So when is x equal to floor(x/6)?\n\nWell, for x=0, it's 0. For x=0, but that's handled by the initial 0. For x in 1 to 100, when is x equal to floor(x/6)?\n\nLet's see:\n\nLet me take x=0, but that's already handled. For example, when x is 0, but that's not part of the loop.\n\nBut during the first file's processing, for x=1 to 100, current_percent is x. total_percent is floor(100x/600) = floor(x/6). So for current_percent to equal total_percent, x must equal floor(x/6). Which is possible only when x is zero. But x starts from 1. So during the first file, no matches except maybe when x=0, which is already handled. So during the first file, nothing is added except maybe 0.\n\nBut then, during the second file, which is 500 bytes. sum_prev is 100. So for x in 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x)/500 = x/5, floored.\n\ntotal_bytes = 100 + x. So total_percent is (100*(100 +x )) / 600 = (100 + x)*100 / 600 = (100 +x ) / 6, floored.\n\nSo we need x/5 == (100 +x)/6 ?\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\nx/5 = (100 +x)/6 → 6x = 5*(100 +x) → 6x = 500 +5x → x = 500.\n\nSo when x=500, current_percent is 500/5 = 100. total_bytes is 100+500=600. total_percent is (600 * 100)/600 = 100. So that's 100, added. So that's covered.\n\nBut what about other values? For example, when x is 599? Well, during the second file, the code checks for each x. But perhaps during the processing of the second file, there are some x where the two percentages match.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the second test case's output includes 95, 96, etc. So how does that happen?\n\nAh, perhaps during the second file, there are some x where the two percentages are equal. Let's think.\n\nLet me take the second test case. The total is 600. Let's consider during the second file (size 500). sum_prev is 100.\n\nSo for x in 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent = floor(100x / 500) = floor(x/5).\n\ntotal_percent = floor(100*(100 +x)/600) = floor( (100 +x) * 100 / 600 ) = floor( (100 +x) / 6 )\n\nSo we need to find x where floor(x/5) = floor( (100 +x)/6 )\n\nLet me take some examples.\n\nLet's say x is 595. Then:\n\nx is 595. But the second file is 500, so x can't be 595. So maybe during the second file, x ranges up to 500. So for x=500, 100 + 500 = 600. So (600/6) = 100. And x/5 is 500/5=100. So that's 100.\n\nWhat about when x is 599? Well, that's not in the second file. So perhaps during the second file, there are some x where the two percentages are equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the second file, the current_percent is 99. Let's see:\n\ncurrent_percent is 99 → x/5 >= 99 and <100 → x >= 495 and x < 500. So x can be 495, 496, 497, 498, 499.\n\nFor each of those x, the total_percent is floor( (100 + x ) / 6 )\n\nLet's take x=495:\n\ntotal is 100 +495 = 595 → 595 /6 = 99.166..., floor is 99. So current_percent is 495/5=99. So yes, equal. So 99 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x=496: 496/5 is 99.2 → floor 99. total is 596 → 596/6 is 99.333... → floor 99. So 99 is added again.\n\nSame for x=497, 498, 499. So all these x's would add 99 to the set.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 594, but that's not in the second file. So during the second file, x can be up to 500. So for x=495 to 499, the current_percent is 99 and the total_percent is 99. So 99 is added. Then when x=500, 100 is added.\n\nBut how about other values?\n\nLet's take x= 595, but that's not in the second file. So during the second file, the code would capture 99 and 100.\n\nBut according to the sample output for the second test case, the output includes 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 0. So how do those numbers come into play?\n\nHmm, perhaps there are other points where the two percentages are equal. For example, during the first file's processing, maybe when the current_percent is 95, but the total_percent is also 95?\n\nWait, the first file is 100 bytes. So during the first file, for x=95, current_percent is 95. The total_bytes is 95. The total is 600. So total_percent is (95 * 100)/600 = 15.833..., floor to 15. So 95 != 15. So no match here.\n\nSo why is 95 in the sample output?\n\nAh, maybe during the second file's processing. Let's think.\n\nLet me think for some x in the second file. Let's say that current_percent is 95. That would require x/5 = 95 → x=475. So x=475.\n\nThen, total_bytes is 100 +475 = 575. total_percent is (575 * 100)/600 = 57500 / 600 = 95.833..., which floors to 95. So current_percent is 95, total_percent is 95. So 95 is added.\n\nYes! So for x=475 in the second file, the two percentages are 95. So that's why 95 is in the output.\n\nSimilarly, for x=476: current_percent is 476/5=95.2 → floor 95. total is 100+476=576. 576 * 100 /600 = 96 → floor 96. So 95 vs 96, not equal. So no.\n\nBut for x=475, the total is 575 → 575 *100 /600 = 95.833... → floor 95. So yes, equal to current_percent.\n\nSo that's why 95 is in the output.\n\nSo the code would capture that.\n\nThus, the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nRead n from input. Then read the list of a's.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nThen process each file and each x in the file.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead input. The input is given as per the sample, but in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nIn the first line, n. In the second line, the list of a's.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided a list of inputs, but the actual code needs to read from stdin. So for example, for the first sample input, the input is:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nSo the code should read n, then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next line, split into integers, as a list.\n\nCompute the prefix sum array.\n\ntotal = sum(a).\n\nInitialize the result set with 0.\n\nThen for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = prefix[i]\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nOnce all done, collect the sorted list.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to compute the prefix sum? Let's say:\n\nprefix = [0]\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n\nSo prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nThus, for the i-th file (0-based), sum_prev is prefix[i].\n\nSo the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix = [0]\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n\ntotal = prefix[-1]\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    sum_prev = prefix[i]\n\n    file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            result.add(current_p)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nprint('\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the output is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', which is the sorted list of the set. Let's see.\n\nBut for the first sample, the code adds 0, and then for each x from 1 to 6, the current_p and total_p are same. So for x=1, current_p is 100*1//6 = 16. So added. For x=2, 200//6=33. So added. x=3: 300//6=50. x=4: 400//6=66. x=5: 500//6=83. x=6: 600//6=100. So the set has 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about the case when the total is zero? Well, the problem says that a_i is at least 1. So total is sum of a_i, which is at least 1. So division by zero is not possible.\n\nNow, testing the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nThe code would generate the set with 0, and during the first file (100 bytes) and second (500 bytes).\n\nAs discussed earlier, during the first file, the current_p is x (since 100*x//100 = x). The total_p is (100 * x) // 600. So for x from 1 to 100, current_p is x, and total_p is floor( (x * 100) / 600 ) = floor( x / 6 ). So for current_p to equal total_p, x must equal floor(x/6). Which is only possible when x=0. So during the first file, nothing is added except 0.\n\nThen during the second file, sum_prev is 100. For x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x) // 500 = x//5.\n\ntotal_p is (100 * (100 +x )) // 600 = (100 +x ) * 100 // 600 = (100 +x ) * 100 // 600 = (100 +x ) // 6 (since 100* (100 +x) / 600 = (100 +x)/6).\n\nSo for x in 1..500, check if x//5 equals (100 +x )//6.\n\nWe need to find all x where this holds.\n\nFor example, x=475:\n\nx//5 = 475//5=95.\n\n(100 + 475) = 575. 575//6 is 95 (since 6*95=570, 575-570=5, so floor is 95). So yes. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x=476:\n\nx//5 is 476//5 = 95.2 → 95.\n\n(100+476)=576. 576//6=96. So 95 != 96. Not added.\n\nx=474:\n\nx//5 = 474//5 = 94.8 → 94.\n\n100+474 = 574. 574//6 = 95.666... → 95. So 94 !=95. Not added.\n\nx= 575 - 100 = 475? No, that's the same as before.\n\nSo during the second file, for x=475, 95 is added. Also, for x= 570 - 100 = 470?\n\nLet me check x= 570 - 100 = 470?\n\nWait, 100 +x = 570 → x=470. Then x//5 is 470/5=94. total_p is 570//6 = 95. So not equal.\n\nBut for x= 570 - 100 = 470? No, that's not helpful. Let's think of other x values.\n\nAnother example: x= 595? But that's beyond 500. So no.\n\nBut for x= 500:\n\ncurrent_p = 500//5=100.\n\ntotal_p is (100 +500) = 600 → 600//6=100. So added.\n\nSo the code adds 100.\n\nBut during the second file, there are other x's that satisfy the condition. For example, when x= 595-100=495? Let's see:\n\nx=495. current_p is 495//5 = 99.\n\ntotal_p is 100 +495 = 595. 595//6 is 99.166... → 99. So 99 is added. Which is in the sample output.\n\nSo the code would collect 95, 99, 100, and others?\n\nYes, so the code would generate the correct set.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, check for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, a=[1]. Then total is 1. For each x in 1:\n\ncurrent_p is (100 *1)/1 = 100. total_p is (1 * 100)/1 = 100. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nBut the initial state is 0, and after x=1, 100. So output is 0, 100.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a=[1, 1]. Total is 2.\n\nInitial state 0.\n\nFor first file (size 1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_p is 100 *1 /1 = 100.\n\ntotal_p is (1 *100)/2 = 50. So 100 !=50. Not added.\n\nFor second file (sum_prev is 1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_p is 100 *1 /1 = 100.\n\ntotal_p is (1+1)*100 / 2 = 100. So added. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nSo output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[2, 2]. total is 4.\n\nInitial 0.\n\nFirst file: size 2. x=1:\n\ncurrent_p is 50. total_p is (1 *100)/4 = 25. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current_p 100. total_p is (2 *100)/4 = 50. Not equal.\n\nSecond file: sum_prev is 2. x=1:\n\ncurrent_p is 50. total_p is (2+1)*100/4 = 75 → 75. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current_p is 100. total_p is (4*100)/4=100. So added. So set {0, 100}.\n\nBut during the second file, when x=1:\n\ntotal_bytes is 3. total_p is 75. current_p is 50. Not equal.\n\nBut when x= 3? No, the second file is size 2. So x can be 1 or 2.\n\nSo the output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: when during the process, the same percentage is achieved multiple times. But the set ensures it's added once.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code as written should work. Let's test against the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nOutput is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nWhich the code produces.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500 → output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nWait, according to the sample output for the second input, the output is '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100'.\n\nBut according to our code, during the second file, for x=475, 95 is added. Also, for x=476, 476//5 is 95.2 → 95. total_p is (100+476) = 576 → 576/6 = 96 → 96. So not equal. So 95 is added once. What about other x's?\n\nLet me think for x= 570-100 = 470? No. Let's think of when current_p is 96. How can that happen?\n\ncurrent_p is 96 → x//5 =96 → x is between 96*5=480 and 484 (since 480//5=96, 484//5=96.8 → 96). For x in 480-484:\n\ntotal_p is (100 +x)/6.\n\nSo for x=480:\n\ntotal is 580. 580 /6 = 96.666... → floor 96. current_p is 480//5=96 → equal. So 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x=481:\n\ntotal is 581 → 581/6 = 96.833... → floor 96. current_p is 481//5=96. So added.\n\nSame for x=482, 483, 484. So during x=480-484, the current_p is 96, and the total_p is 96. So 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 485: current_p is 485//5 = 97. total_p is 100+485=585. 585/6=97.5 → floor 97. So 97 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 485 to 489 (since 489//5=97.8 → 97). total_p is (100+x)/6. For x=485, 585/6=97.5 → 97. So yes. So 97 is added. For x=486, 586/6=97.666 → 97. So yes. Same for x=487, 488, 489. So 97 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x=490: current_p is 490//5=98. total_p is (100 +490) = 590 → 590/6 = 98.333... → 98. So added.\n\nx=490-494: current_p is 98. total_p is 98. So 98 is added.\n\nx=495: current_p is 99. total_p is 595/6=99.166... → 99. So added.\n\nx=495-499: current_p is 99. total_p is 99. So added.\n\nx=500: current_p is 100, total_p is 600/6=100. So added.\n\nSo the set includes 95 (from x=475), 96 (from x=480-484), 97 (from x=485-489), 98 (from x=490-494), 99 (from x=495-499), 100 (from x=500). So the numbers 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 are added. Also 0. Hence the sample output.\n\nSo the code would generate these numbers. Thus, the code is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the third one:\n\nInput: 4\\n1000 2 2 998 → Output is 0\\n50\\n99\\n100.\n\nLet me think. The total is 1000+2+2+998 = 2002.\n\nLet's see when the two percentages are equal.\n\nAt initial state: 0.\n\nAt the end of the last file, 100% is added.\n\nFor the first file (1000 bytes). sum_prev is 0. For x in 1..1000:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x)/1000 = x/10.\n\ntotal_p is (100 *x ) / 2002 → floor.\n\nWhen is x/10 equal to floor(100x / 2002)?\n\nFor example, when x=1000: current_p is 100. total_p is (100 * 1000)/2002 = 100000 / 2002 ≈ 49.95 → floor 49. So not equal.\n\nBut during the first file, perhaps there are some x where the two percentages match. But maybe not. Let's think about when x= 1000 * 2002 / (100 * 10 + ... ? Not sure. Maybe not. But perhaps during other files.\n\nFor example, during the fourth file (size 998). sum_prev is 1000+2+2= 1004. So during this file, x ranges from 1 to 998. total_bytes is 1004 +x.\n\ncurrent_p is (100x)/998 → floor.\n\ntotal_p is (100*(1004 +x )) / 2002 → floor.\n\nWe need to find x where these are equal.\n\nBut perhaps during the fourth file, when x= 998, total_bytes is 1004 + 998 = 2002. So total_p is 100. current_p is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the file copying process. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Progress Bars**: The first progress bar tracks the percentage of the current file being copied, while the second tracks the total percentage across all files. Both percentages are calculated using floor division.\n2. **Simulate Each Byte Copy**: For each byte copied in each file, compute the current file's progress and the total progress. Check if these two values are equal and collect such values.\n3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the cumulative size of files up to each point, which helps in determining the total progress quickly.\n4. **Set for Unique Values**: Use a set to store the unique values where both progress bars show the same percentage, ensuring no duplicates.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n\ntotal = prefix[-1]\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    sum_prev = prefix[i]\n    file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total\n        if current_p == total_p:\n            result.add(current_p)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nprint('\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: This array helps in quickly determining the cumulative size of files up to any given point, which is essential for calculating the total progress.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, compute the current file's progress and the total progress using floor division. If both values match, add this value to the set of results.\n4. **Result Collection**: The set ensures that each valid percentage is stored only once. Finally, the results are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the copying process and checks for matching progress values, ensuring correctness and optimal performance given the constraints.",
