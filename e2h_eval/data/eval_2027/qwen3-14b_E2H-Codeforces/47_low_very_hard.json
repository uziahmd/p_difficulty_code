    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the problem. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, for x = a +k and y = b +k. But since x and y differ by (a - b) or (b -a), depending on which is larger. Wait, because if a and b are given, then adding the same k to both makes their difference fixed. Let me see: suppose a < b. Then, a +k and b +k have a difference of (b - a). So, the difference between the two numbers is fixed as d = |a - b|. Let me denote d as the absolute difference between a and b. \n\nSo, without loss of generality, let's assume that a ≤ b. Then, d = b - a. Then, the two numbers after adding k are (a +k) and (a +k + d). Let me call them x and x + d. So, the problem reduces to finding x such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized, and x is at least a (since k is non-negative, so x = a +k ≥ a). Wait, but the original a and b could be in any order. So first, I should compute d = |a - b|. Then, the problem becomes finding x such that x ≥ min(a, b), and then LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Then, the minimal k would be x - min(a, b), since x = min(a,b) +k. Wait, let me think again. Suppose a is smaller than b. Then, x = a +k, and x +d = a +k + (b -a) = b +k. So yes. So, the problem is equivalent to finding x ≥ a (if a is the smaller one) such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Then, the minimal k is x - a. But what if a is larger than b? Then, we can swap them. So, first, I can compute d as the absolute difference between a and b. Then, let m = min(a, b), and M = max(a, b). So, the problem becomes find x >= m such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized, and then k is x - m.\n\nSo the key is to find x >= m where x and x +d have the smallest possible LCM. Now, how to find such x?\n\nThe LCM of x and x +d is equal to (x*(x +d)) / gcd(x, x +d). But since x and x +d differ by d, their gcd is the same as gcd(x, d). Because gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d). So, LCM(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/g, where g = gcd(x, d). \n\nSo, the LCM depends on x and the gcd of x and d. So, how can we minimize this value?\n\nLet me think. For fixed d, we need to find x ≥ m such that x*(x +d)/gcd(x, d) is as small as possible.\n\nBut how to find x? Well, maybe the optimal x is such that x divides d? Or perhaps x is a divisor of some value related to d?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is as small as possible. But that's not necessarily true. For example, in the first sample input, a=6 and b=10, so d=4. m is 6. So, x starts at 6. Let's check:\n\nFor x=6, x +d = 10. LCM(6,10) is 30. For x=7, LCM(7,11)=77. For x=8, LCM(8,12) is 24. Which is better than 30. So here, x=8 gives a better LCM. Which is higher than m=6. So, the minimal LCM is achieved at x=8. Then k is 8-6=2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, how to find x?\n\nAnother example: if a=5 and b=10. Then d=5, m=5. So x starts at 5. For x=5, x+d=10. LCM is 10. Which is the minimal possible. So k=0 is correct.\n\nSo, the question is, for given d and m, find x",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `(a + k)` and `(b + k)` is minimized. The solution involves understanding the properties of LCM and how it behaves with respect to the difference between two numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The LCM of two numbers `x` and `y` can be expressed as `(x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. When adding the same value `k` to both `a` and `b`, the difference between the resulting numbers remains constant. Let this difference be `d = |a - b|`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For any `k`, the numbers `a + k` and `b + k` can be represented as `x` and `x + d` where `x` is the smaller of the two values. The LCM of `x` and `x + d` depends on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `d`.\n\n3. **Optimal x**: The optimal value of `x` (starting from the minimum of `a` and `b`) that minimizes the LCM of `x` and `x + d` can be found by checking values of `x` such that `x` divides `d` or is close to a divisor of `d`.\n\n4. **Efficient Search**: We iterate through potential values of `x` starting from the minimum of `a` and `b` and check for the minimal LCM. However, instead of checking every possible value, we focus on divisors of `d` adjusted to ensure they are greater than or equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_min_k(a, b):\n    m = min(a, b)\n    M = max(a, b)\n    d = M - m\n    if d == 0:\n        return 0\n    # We need to find x >= m such that LCM(x, x + d) is minimized\n    # x + d = x + (M - m) = (m + k) + (M - m) = M + k\n    # So x is m + k, and the LCM is LCM(x, x + d)\n    # To find the minimal LCM, we can consider x such that x divides d or x + d divides d?\n    # Alternatively, consider divisors of d and check near them.\n    # Let's find all divisors of d and check around them.\n    # Also check the case when x is m, which gives x = m, x + d = M\n    # So first, check the candidates around the divisors of d\n    # The minimal k is the minimal x - m, where x is chosen to minimize LCM(x, x + d)\n    # Let's generate all divisors of d, then for each divisor g, check x = g - r, where r is such that x >= m\n    # But perhaps a better approach is to check for x such that x divides d, or x + d divides d, but I'm not sure.\n    # Another idea: since LCM(x, x + d) = x*(x + d)/gcd(x, d), and since gcd(x, x + d) = gcd(x, d), we can think that to minimize this, we want gcd(x, d) to be as large as possible.\n    # So for x >= m, we want to maximize gcd(x, d)\n    # Therefore, the optimal x is the one that has the highest possible gcd with d.\n    # So, we can look for the largest divisor of d that is >= m, or something like that.\n    # Let's find all divisors of d, then for each divisor g, check if there is an x such that g divides x, and x >= m.\n    # Then, among those x, the minimal LCM is achieved when x is as small as possible.\n    # Alternatively, for each divisor g of d, we can check x = g, and x = g - (g - m) if that's >= m?

Because then gcd(x, d) would be at least g.\n    # So, to maximize the gcd(x, d), x should be a multiple of a large divisor of d.\n    # So, the plan is:\n    # 1.

For example, if d is 6, and m is 5. Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. For x=5, the candidates would include 6 (from divisor 6). But what about x=6? Which is in the candidates. But maybe x=5 is also considered.\n\n    # But in our code, the candidates include m, which is 5. So we check that.\n\n    # However, there might be cases where the optimal x is not covered by the candidates. For example, suppose d is 5, m is 3. The divisors are 1,5. So candidates include 3 (m), and for g=1, x_candidate is 3 (since 3//1=3, 3*1=3). For g=5, x_candidate is 5 (since 3//5 is 0, so 1*5=5). So candidates are 3 and 5. Suppose the optimal x is 4. How would that be covered?\n\n    # Let's see. For x=4, d=5. Then y=9. LCM(4,9)=36. If m is 3, then x=4 is allowed. However, the code would not consider it unless it is in the candidates. But 4 is not generated by the divisors. So the code may miss this candidate.\n\n    # Therefore, the approach of only checking the candidates generated from the divisors may not be sufficient. Thus, we need another approach.\n\n    # Alternative approach: For the optimal x, since x and x + d have LCM minimized, the optimal x is such that x + d is a multiple of x, or x is a multiple of x + d. But that's only possible if x divides d. Or, more generally, when x and x + d share a large GCD.\n\n    # Another idea: the minimal LCM occurs when the GCD of x and x + d is as large as possible. Since GCD(x, x + d) = GCD(x, d), the maximum possible GCD is the GCD of x and d. So to maximize this, x should be such that x is a multiple of a large divisor of d.\n\n    # However, the previous approach may miss some candidates. Therefore, perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible x in the range [m, m + d], because after that, the LCM will start increasing.\n\n    # Wait, but for large d (up to 1e9), checking all x in [m, m + d] is O(1e9), which is not feasible.\n\n    # So, we need a smarter way. Let's think again.\n\n    # Let me consider that for x >= m, the minimal LCM is achieved when x is the smallest value such that x is congruent to -d mod g for some g. This is getting too vague.\n\n    # Let's think of the following: for x and x + d, the LCM is minimized when x and x + d are as small as possible and their GCD is as large as possible. Hence, the optimal x is likely to be near the smallest possible values, but also such that x shares a large divisor with d.\n\n    # Given that, perhaps we can generate all the divisors of d, and for each divisor g, check x = m + (g - (m % g)) % g. That is, the smallest x >= m that is a multiple of g. Then, check those x values.\n\n    # Also, check x = m, and x = m + (d - (m % d)) % d, which is the next value where x + d is a multiple of d.\n\n    # Let's try to implement this approach again, but also include x = m, and x = m + (d - (m % d)) % d, and check those.\n\n    # Let's proceed with this.\n\n    # Generate all divisors of d\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    candidates = set()\n    candidates.add(m)\n    # Check for each divisor g of d, the minimal x >= m that is a multiple of g\n    for g in divisors:\n        remainder = m % g\n        if remainder == 0:\n            x_candidate = m\n        else:\n            x_candidate = m + (g - remainder)\n        candidates.add(x_candidate)\n        # Also check x_candidate - g if it's >= m\n        if x_candidate - g >= m:\n            candidates.add(x_candidate - g)\n    # Also check x = m + (d - (m % d)) % d\n    remainder = m % d\n    if remainder == 0:\n        x_candidate = m\n    else:\n        x_candidate = m + (d - remainder)\n    candidates.add(x_candidate)\n    # Also check x_candidate -d if it's >= m\n    if x_candidate - d >= m:\n        candidates.add(x_candidate - d)\n\n    # Now evaluate all these candidates\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    for x in candidates:\n        if x < m:\n            continue\n        y = x + d\n        g = math.gcd(x, y)\n        lcm = x * y // g\n        current_k = x - m\n        if lcm < min_lcm or (lcm == min_lcm and current_k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = lcm\n            best_k = current_k\n    # Also check for the case where d is zero (a == b)\n    # But we already handled d = 0 earlier, returning 0\n    return best_k\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    for i in range(0, len(input), 2):\n        a = int(input[i])\n        b = int(input[i+1])\n        print(compute_min_k(a, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, and each pair of integers is processed separately.\n2. **Difference Calculation**: The difference `d` between the two numbers is calculated.\n3. **Divisors Generation**: All divisors of `d` are generated to explore potential values of `x` that could minimize the LCM.\n4. **Candidate Evaluation**: For each divisor, potential values of `x` are checked to find the one that minimizes the LCM.

Hence, the optimal x is likely to be near the smallest possible values, but also such that x shares a large divisor with d.\n\n    # Given that, perhaps we can generate all the divisors of d, and for each divisor g, check x = m + (g - (m % g)) % g. That is, the smallest x >= m that is a multiple of g. Then, check those x values.\n\n    # Also, check x = m, and x = m + (d - (m % d)) % d, which is the next value where x + d is a multiple of d.\n\n    # Let's try to implement this approach again, but also include x = m, and x = m + (d - (m % d)) % d, and check those.\n\n    # Let's proceed with this.\n\n    # Generate all divisors of d\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    candidates = set()\n    candidates.add(m)\n    # Check for each divisor g of d, the minimal x >= m that is a multiple of g\n    for g in divisors:\n        remainder = m % g\n        if remainder == 0:\n            x_candidate = m\n        else:\n            x_candidate = m + (g - remainder)\n        candidates.add(x_candidate)\n        # Also check x_candidate - g if it's >= m\n        if x_candidate - g >= m:\n            candidates.add(x_candidate - g)\n    # Also check x = m + (d - (m % d)) % d\n    remainder = m % d\n    if remainder == 0:\n        x_candidate = m\n    else:\n        x_candidate = m + (d - remainder)\n    candidates.add(x_candidate)\n    # Also check x_candidate -d if it's >= m\n    if x_candidate - d >= m:\n        candidates.add(x_candidate - d)\n\n    # Now evaluate all these candidates\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    for x in candidates:\n        if x < m:\n            continue\n        y = x + d\n        g = math.gcd(x, y)\n        lcm = x * y // g\n        current_k = x - m\n        if lcm < min_lcm or (lcm == min_lcm and current_k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = lcm\n            best_k = current_k\n    # Also check for the case where d is zero (a == b)\n    # But we already handled d = 0 earlier, returning 0\n    return best_k\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    for i in range(0, len(input), 2):\n        a = int(input[i])\n        b = int(input[i+1])\n        print(compute_min_k(a, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
