The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The frog starts at 0, and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't step outside [0, x] during any of its jumps. For each x from 0 to m, we need to compute f(x), which is the number of distinct positions reachable under these constraints. Then sum all those f(x) values.\n\nFirst, let's think about what positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can only jump forward by a or backward by b, but can't go below 0 or above x. But the problem says that the frog can reach a position if there's some way to get there, even if it takes multiple jumps.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about the possible positions. Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b, but with certain constraints. However, since the frog can only add a or subtract b, perhaps the positions are of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But also, the frog must not step outside [0, x] during any of the jumps. Wait, but the problem says that the frog can't jump on an integer outside [0, x]. So during any jump, the frog's position must stay within [0, x]. That complicates things because the path taken to reach a position might involve intermediate steps that are outside the allowed range. So even if a position is reachable via some path that doesn't go outside [0, x], but other paths might require going outside. However, the frog is allowed to take any path as long as it never steps outside [0, x].\n\nWait, but the frog can only make jumps that keep it within [0, x]. So for example, if the frog wants to reach position k, then all the intermediate steps in the path must be between 0 and x. Therefore, the problem is to find all positions that can be reached through some sequence of jumps, where each step remains within [0, x].\n\nBut how do we model this? It feels like a BFS problem, but given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't simulate this for each x. So there must be a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the possible reachable positions. Let's first ignore the constraints of x and see what positions are reachable. The frog starts at 0. Each jump adds a or subtracts b. So the positions are all numbers that can be written as a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers, such that the path to reach them doesn't require stepping outside [0, x]. But without considering x, the set of reachable positions is all numbers that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b), and greater than or equal to some value. Wait, but the frog can only add a or subtract b. Let me think: the set of reachable positions (without any x constraints) is the set of integers that can be expressed as a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers. But since the frog can go back and forth, perhaps the reachable positions are all numbers that are multiples of d = gcd(a, b), and satisfy some condition based on the minimum steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d = gcd(a, b), and is >= 0. But that's not necessarily true. Because for example, if a=5, b=3, then d=1. So any integer can be formed. But the frog can reach 5 (by jumping +5 once), 5-3=2, 2+5=7, etc. But how do you reach 1? Well, maybe not. Wait, the problem is that the frog can't make negative jumps unless it's allowed. Wait, the frog can only jump forward by a or backward by b. So for example, to reach 2, the frog can do 0 +5 (to 5), then 5-3=2. But to reach 1, perhaps you can't. Because from 2, you can't subtract 3 (would be -1) which is invalid. So maybe the reachable positions are not all multiples of d. Hmm.\n\nThis suggests that the problem is more complex. But perhaps when considering the constraints of x, the reachable positions are those that are multiples of d, and can be written as a*k - b*l, and also satisfy some conditions based on the x value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is in the range [0, x], and can be written as a*k - b*l, where during the jumps, the frog never goes beyond 0 or x. But again, how to model that?\n\nWait, but maybe the constraints on x can be handled by considering that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is within [0, x], provided that there exists a way to reach it without stepping out of bounds. However, perhaps for large enough x, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and in [0, x], but for small x, some positions may not be reachable.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find for each x, the number of positions in [0, x] that are multiples of d, and also satisfy some condition based on a and b.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose d = gcd(a, b). Let's denote g = d. Then, since a and b are multiples of g, we can divide everything by g. Let's define a' = a/g, b' = b/g. Now, since a' and b' are coprime.\n\nThe problem now becomes: the frog can jump +a' or -b', but multiplied by g. So the positions reachable are multiples of g. So the positions are of the form k * g, where k is an integer. So for the problem, we can focus on the positions divided by g, and then multiply by g again.\n\nBut since the frog can only move by adding a' or subtracting b', the problem reduces to finding positions in the new coordinate system (divided by g) that are reachable.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to solving the same problem with a' and b' coprime. Let's assume that a and b are coprime for now. Then, the positions that the frog can reach (without considering x) are all integers that can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers. But since a and b are coprime, the set of reachable positions includes all integers >= (some value). Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the classic coin problem. If you have coins of denominations a and b, and you can use any number of them, then the largest amount that cannot be formed is ab - a - b. But that's for when you can use any combination of the coins. But in our case, the frog can add a or subtract b. So the problem is different. But perhaps similar concepts apply.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a position, and edges are the possible jumps. Then, the reachable positions from 0 are those that can be reached via some path. However, the problem is that for large x, this graph could be huge.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern. Let's suppose a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod 1 (which is all integers), but only if there's a way to get there. However, how?\n\nFor example, if a=5, b=3 (coprime). Then:\n\nStart at 0.\n\nFrom 0, can jump to 5 (add a) or -3 (invalid, so can't). So only 5 is reachable. Then from 5, can jump to 5+5=10, or 5-3=2. From 2, can jump to 2+5=7 or 2-3=-1 (invalid). So 7 is added. From 7, can jump to 12 or 4. From 4, can jump to 9 or 1. From 1, can jump to 6 or -2 (invalid). From 6, can jump to 11 or 3. From 3, can jump to 8 or 0. From 0, we already have that. So in this way, the frog can reach positions 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. But wait, how about 1? The frog can't reach 1. Because to get to 1, you need to have some combination of a and b. For example, 5k - 3l =1. Let's see, 5*2 -3*3 = 10-9=1. So yes. But how does the frog reach that? Let's see: starting from 0, jump to 5 (k=1), then to 10 (k=2), then subtract 3 three times. But that would require going from 10 to 7 (subtract 3 once), then 4 (again), then 1 (third time). But each of those steps is allowed. So from 10, subtract 3 once to get to 7 (allowed), then again to 4, then again to 1. So yes, the frog can reach 1. But in the earlier steps, when I was thinking of possible positions, I didn't think of that. So maybe the frog can reach any integer >= (some value) ?\n\nBut how to find the minimal x such that all positions >= x are reachable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for coprime a and b, the set of reachable positions is all integers >= (b - a) ? Not sure. But in the example of a=5 and b=3, the frog can reach 1, which is less than both a and b. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nBut regardless, the problem requires us to find for each x, the number of positions in [0, x] that are reachable under the constraints that during any jump, the frog stays within [0, x].\n\nBut how can we model this for arbitrary x?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let's first find the set of positions that the frog can reach without any constraints on x. Then, for a given x, the frog can reach all positions in that set that are within [0, x], and can be reached via a path that never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to find that set?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constraints on x are only that the frog cannot go beyond x, but during the jumps, the frog can reach positions that are within [0, x], even if they are not reachable in the unconstrained scenario. Wait, no. For example, if x is very small, say x is 2, then the frog can't make any jumps except those that don't go beyond x. So for example, if a is 5, then the frog can't jump to 5 if x is 2. So the reachable positions would be only 0.\n\nBut for larger x, the frog can make more jumps.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is that for a given x, the reachable positions are those that are in the unconstrained set (i.e., can be written as a*k - b*l for non-negative integers k, l), and also lie within [0, x], and also can be reached by a sequence of jumps that never go outside [0, x].\n\nBut how can we determine whether a position can be reached without stepping outside [0, x]?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the constraints of x can be ignored once x is large enough. For example, if x is large enough that the frog can reach any position that is in the unconstrained set and within [0, x], then for such x, f(x) would be the number of such positions.\n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following: The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (gcd(a, b)), and is >= 0, and is <= x, provided that x is large enough. But for small x, some positions may not be reachable even though they are in the unconstrained set.\n\nBut how to find for each x, the count of such positions?\n\nAnother observation: For the frog to reach a position p, there must exist some sequence of jumps that leads from 0 to p, with all intermediate steps between 0 and x. However, since the frog can choose any path, perhaps the minimal requirement is that p is reachable in the unconstrained scenario, and that there exists some way to reach p without stepping beyond x. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any p that is in the unconstrained reachable set and is <=x, the frog can reach p by first moving forward with a steps until it reaches a position >= p, and then moving backward with b steps. But this depends on whether during this process, the frog doesn't go beyond x.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's take the example from the first sample input: m=7, a=5, b=3. The answer for f(7) is 8. The reachable positions are 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8? Wait, but x is 7. So positions up to 7. Let me check the note. The note says f(7)=8, which includes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6. So 8 positions.\n\nSo in this case, the unconstrained reachable positions include all numbers that are multiples of 1 (since a and b are coprime), but for x=7, the frog can reach all of them up to 7.\n\nBut how to ensure that the path to reach them doesn't require stepping beyond x?\n\nFor example, take position 1. To reach 1, the frog can go from 0 to 5 (a=5), then 5 to 2 (subtract 3), then 2 to 5 again, then 5 to 2 again, then 2 to 5 again, then 5 to 2 again, then 2 to 5 again, then 5 to 2 again, then 2 to 5 again... Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, the frog could go 0 → 5 → 2 → 7 (adding 5) → 4 (subtracting 3) → 9 (adding 5, but that's beyond x=7?), but wait, in this case x is 7, so adding 5 to 4 would take it to 9, which is beyond x. So that's not allowed. So how does the frog reach 1 when x=7?\n\nAh, but the frog can reach 1 via a path that doesn't go beyond x=7. Let's think. Let me try to find such a path.\n\nStarting at 0. Jump to 5 (allowed). Then subtract 3 to get 2. Subtract 3 again to get -1, which is invalid. So that's not allowed. So that path is not allowed. So how else can the frog reach 1?\n\nWait, maybe another path. Let's see. Maybe the frog can reach 5, then 5 + 5 = 10 (but x is 7, so that's not allowed). So that's invalid. So how else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frog can reach 5, then subtract 3 to get 2, then add 5 to get 7 (allowed). Then subtract 3 to get 4. Then subtract 3 again to get 1. So that path is allowed. Because during all jumps, the positions are 0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1. All of these are between 0 and 7. So yes! So the frog can reach 1 by that path. So even though during the process, the frog jumps to 7, which is allowed, then subtracts 3 to get 4, then subtracts again to get 1. So that's valid. So in this case, the position 1 is reachable for x=7.\n\nSo this suggests that for positions that are in the unconstrained set (can be written as a*k - b*l), and are within [0, x], the frog can reach them as long as x is large enough to allow for the necessary steps. But how to find this?\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the frog can reach any position that is in the unconstrained set and is within [0, x], provided that x is at least (some value). For example, for a=5 and b=3, the unconstrained reachable positions are all integers >= 0. But for x=7, the frog can reach 1, which is in that set. But for smaller x, like x=0, the frog can't reach anything except 0.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each x, the number of positions in [0, x] that are in the unconstrained reachable set, and also can be reached by a path that doesn't go beyond x. However, how to compute this efficiently?\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find that for x >= some value, all positions in the unconstrained set up to x are reachable. Then, for x below that value, we need to compute the count manually.\n\nSo, let's first find the unconstrained reachable set. Let's assume that a and b are coprime. Then, the unconstrained reachable set is all integers >= (some value). Wait, but earlier example shows that even small numbers can be reached.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the set of reachable positions is all integers that are >= (b - a) or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the frog can add a and subtract b, perhaps the reachable positions are all integers that are >= 0 and congruent to 0 mod d (where d = gcd(a, b)). But since in our case, we have divided by d, so a' and b' are coprime, and the reachable positions are all integers that can be written as a'*k - b'*l for non-negative integers k and l. However, for any integer m, there exists some k and l such that a'*k - b'*l = m. Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, m=1, a'=5, b'=3. As discussed before, 5*2 - 3*3 = 1. So yes, possible. So for any integer m, there's a solution. But how to ensure that k and l are non-negative?\n\nAh, that's the problem. For example, m=1 can be achieved with k=2, l=3. But what about m= -1? Then we can write 5*0 -3*1 = -1. But the frog can't make a jump that subtracts b from 0 (since that would take it to -1, which is invalid). So in the unconstrained scenario, the frog can reach any integer that can be expressed as a*k -b*l where k and l are non-negative. But how to find that set?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, given the problem's constraints, perhaps there's a way to model this with BFS for small values, and find a formula for larger x.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we need an O(1) or O(1) per test case solution.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d = gcd(a, b), and for which there exists some non-negative integers k and l such that position = a*k - b*l. But even this is not sufficient, because the path to reach the position might require steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps for x >= (a + b), the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and within [0, x]. Because the frog can reach them by first moving forward with a steps until it's above the target, then subtracting b steps. For example, if the target is p, then the frog can reach a position p + m*b, then subtract m*b steps. But this requires that p + m*b is reachable by adding a steps, and that during the subtraction steps, the frog doesn't go below 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, let's think of the case when a and b are coprime. Let's assume that the frog can reach any position p >= 0, provided that x is large enough. For example, for x >= a + b, the frog can reach any p in [0, x] that is reachable in the unconstrained scenario. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position p that is >= 0 and is congruent to 0 mod d, and for which p can be written as a*k - b*l, and x >= p. But again, how to find this.\n\nBut given that the problem is to compute the sum from x=0 to m of f(x), perhaps we can find for each x, the value of f(x) as follows:\n\nIf x is less than a, then the frog can't make any forward jumps (since adding a would take it to a which is larger than x if x < a). So the frog can't make any jumps. So f(x) is 1 (only position 0).\n\nBut if x >= a, then the frog can make a forward jump. However, the frog can also make backward jumps, but only if it's possible. For example, if x is at least a, then the frog can reach a. Then, from a, it can jump to a -b (if that is >=0), etc.\n\nBut again, how to find for each x the count of positions.\n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime. Then, the reachable positions (unconstrained) are all integers that can be written as a*k -b*l for non-negative integers k, l. However, for any integer p >= 0, there exists some k and l such that p = a*k -b*l. Because since a and b are coprime, for any integer p, there are integers k and l such that p = a*k -b*l. But k and l need to be non-negative. So this is not always possible.\n\nBut for example, for p=1, a=5, b=3, as discussed, it's possible. For p=2, 5*1 -3*1 = 2. So yes. For p=3, 5*0 -3*(-1) = 3, but l is negative, which is not allowed. So perhaps there's another way. Like 5*3 -3*4 = 15-12=3. Yes, k=3, l=4. So yes, possible.\n\nSo for any p >=0, there exists some k and l >=0 such that p = a*k -b*l. Is this true?\n\nNot sure. For example, take p=1, a=3, b=2. Then, 3k - 2l = 1. Let's see: k=1, l=1 gives 3-2=1. So yes. Another example: p=2. 3*0 -2*(-1) = 2, but l is negative. Or 3*2 -2*2=6-4=2. Yes. So possible.\n\nAnother example: p=1, a=2, b=3. Then 2k -3l =1. Let's see: k=2, l=1: 4-3=1. So yes.\n\nSo perhaps for any p >=0, and a and b coprime, there exists k and l >=0 such that p = a*k -b*l. But how to prove this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any p >= (b -a), assuming that a > b. Not sure.\n\nBut this seems to be the case in the examples. So perhaps for coprime a and b, the frog can reach any p >=0. Which would mean that for x >= p, the frog can reach p. But how?\n\nBut then, for x being large enough, f(x) would be x + 1. Because all positions from 0 to x are reachable. But in the first sample input, when x=7, the answer is 8. Which is 7+1. So that matches. Also, in the second example, the input is m=1e9, a=1, b=2019. Since a and b are coprime (gcd(1,2019)=1), then for any x >=0, the frog can reach any position from 0 to x, so f(x) = x+1. Hence the sum is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2. Which for m=1e9 is 1e9*(1e9+1)*(1e9+2)/2. But the sample output says that the sum is 500000001500000001. Let's see: (1e9+1) * (1e9+2) / 2 = (1e9+1)*(1e9+2)/2. For example, if m=1e9, the sum is (1e9+1)(1e9+2)/2. Let's compute that. But the sample output says 500000001500000001. Let me check. For m=1e9, sum from 1 to m+1 is (m+1)(m+2)/2. But the sample says that for the second input, the sum is 500000001500000001. Let me compute (1e9+1) * (1e9+2) // 2. Let me compute 1e9+1 = 1000000001, 1e9+2 = 1000000002. Multiply them: 1000000001 * 1000000002 = ?\n\nWell, (a)(a+1) = a² +a. Here, a is 1e9+1. So a² +a = (1e18 + 2e9 + 1) + (1e9+1) = 1e18 + 3e9 + 2. Divided by 2 gives 5e17 + 1.5e9 + 1. But the sample output is 500000001500000001. Let's see:\n\n500000001500000001 = 5*1e17 + 1.5*1e9 + 1? Well, 5*1e17 is 500000000000000000. Then adding 1.5e9 is 500000001500000000, plus 1 makes 500000001500000001. Which matches. So that's correct. Hence, the sample suggests that when a=1, b=2019, which are coprime, then for any x, f(x) = x+1. Hence, the sum is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2.\n\nSo this suggests that when a and b are coprime, and the frog can reach all positions in [0, x], then f(x) = x+1. But why is that the case?\n\nBecause for any x, the frog can reach any position between 0 and x. How? For example, to reach position p, the frog can go forward with a steps until it reaches a position >=p, then subtract b steps. But how to ensure that during this process, the frog doesn't go beyond x.\n\nWait, but if x is large enough, say x >= p + b. Then, the frog can reach p by first jumping to a certain position and then subtracting b steps. However, if x is small, like x=p, then the frog can't do that. But in the first sample input, when x=7, the frog can reach 1, which is less than a=5. How?\n\nAh, because the frog can reach it through a series of steps that don't go beyond x. So, in that case, the frog can reach all positions in [0, x], even if x is smaller than a.\n\nSo perhaps the key insight is that if a and b are coprime, then for any x >= 0, f(x) = x+1. But how to prove this?\n\nBut that can't be true. For example, take a=2, b=3. Are all positions reachable?\n\nLet's see for x=1. The frog starts at 0. Can it reach 1? No, because the only possible jumps are +2 (which would take it to 2, which is larger than x=1, so not allowed) or -3 (invalid). So f(1)=1. But according to the hypothesis, x+1=2, which is wrong. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAh, this is a contradiction. So my earlier assumption was wrong. So what's the correct approach here?\n\nIn this case, a=2 and b=3 are coprime. For x=1, the frog can't reach any positions except 0. So f(1) is 1, but according to the previous idea, it would be 2. So the previous reasoning was incorrect.\n\nSo there must be some other condition. So what's the difference between the first example and this new example?\n\nIn the first example, a=5 and b=3. The frog can reach 1 for x=7. But in this new example, a=2 and b=3, for x=1, the frog can't reach 1.\n\nSo what's the general rule here?\n\nPerhaps the frog can reach all positions that are >= (some value) and are in the reachable set. But for small x, some positions may not be reachable.\n\nSo how to find for each x, the number of reachable positions.\n\nLet me think again. The problem seems to require knowing for each x, the number of positions in [0, x] that can be reached by the frog, given that during any jump, the frog remains within [0, x].\n\nThis feels like a dynamic programming problem. For each x, the reachable positions can be determined based on the reachable positions for smaller x. But since m can be up to 1e9, this approach is not feasible for large m.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet's think about the reachable positions for the frog. Let's assume that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d = gcd(a, b), and that is reachable via some sequence of jumps that doesn't go outside [0, x].\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following:\n\nThe frog can reach a position p if and only if p is a multiple of d, and there exists some k and l such that p = k*a - l*b, and during the jumps, the frog never leaves [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this for all p in [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given x, the reachable positions are those that are in the set S = {positions reachable without constraints} and also can be reached without leaving [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this set S for a given x.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving the problem, perhaps we can find that for x >= (a + b), the number of reachable positions is floor(x / d) + 1, where d is the gcd(a, b). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d in [0, x], provided that x is large enough. For example, if x >= max(a, b), then the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nLet's take the previous example where a=2, b=3, d=1. For x=3, can the frog reach 1?\n\nLet's see. Starting at 0, can the frog jump to 2 (allowed). From 2, can it jump to 2-3 = -1 (invalid), or 2+2=4 (which is larger than x=3, so not allowed). So no. So the frog can't reach 1 for x=3. But 1 is a multiple of d=1. So this contradicts the idea that all multiples of d are reachable for x >= a or b.\n\nHmm. So what's the issue here?\n\nMaybe the frog can't reach certain positions even for x >= a and b, depending on the values of a and b.\n\nSo this suggests that there is a more complex condition. Perhaps the reachable positions are those that are multiples of d and >= (some value), and also can be reached by a path that doesn't go out of [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nAnother observation: the frog can move forward by a, or backward by b. So the frog can reach any position that is reachable by a series of forward and backward moves, but during the process, the frog must stay within [0, x].\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where nodes are positions in [0, x], and edges are the allowed jumps. Then, f(x) is the number of nodes reachable from 0 in this graph.\n\nBut for large x (up to 1e9), we can't build this graph for each x. So we need a mathematical way to compute this.\n\nBut perhaps for large x, the graph is connected, allowing the frog to reach all positions that are multiples of d and within [0, x]. However, for small x, it's not.\n\nSo, the plan is to find for each x:\n\n- If x is less than a certain threshold, compute f(x) via BFS or some other method.\n\n- For x >= threshold, f(x) = number of multiples of d in [0, x], which is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find the threshold.\n\nLet me think about the threshold. The threshold is the smallest x such that the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. Once x is larger than this threshold, the number of reachable positions is simply floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this threshold.\n\nLet's consider the case where d=1 (a and b are coprime). For the previous example with a=2, b=3, what is the threshold?\n\nFor x=3: can the frog reach 1?\n\nNo. For x=4: can the frog reach 1?\n\nLet's see. From 0, jump to 2 (allowed). From 2, jump to 4 (allowed). From 4, jump to 4-3=1 (allowed). So yes! So for x=4, the frog can reach 1. So the threshold here is 4.\n\nSo for x >=4, the frog can reach all positions in [0, x] that are multiples of 1 (i.e., all positions). So for x >=4, f(x) = x+1.\n\nBut for x=3, f(x) = 2 (positions 0 and 2).\n\nSo the threshold is 4.\n\nSimilarly, in the first sample input, a=5, b=3. What is the threshold? For x=5, can the frog reach all positions up to x=5?\n\nFor example, can it reach 1? Let's see. For x=5, the frog can go from 0 →5 → 2 → 7 (but x=5, so this is not allowed). So that path is invalid. So how else? Let's see.\n\nFrom 0 →5 (allowed). From 5, subtract 3 to get 2 (allowed). From 2, add 5 to get 7 (not allowed). So no. So can't reach 1 for x=5? But earlier example showed that for x=7, it can reach 1. So what's the threshold here?\n\nHmm. Let's try to find for x=5, can the frog reach 1?\n\nMaybe another path: 0 →5 →2 →5 →2 → ... but that doesn't help. Or is there a way to reach 1 without going beyond x=5?\n\nAnother approach: from 0, jump to 5, then to 2, then to 5 again, then to 2 again, then to 5 again, then to 2 again, then to 5 again, then to 2 again, then to 5 again... No, this doesn't help. How else?\n\nWait, what if the frog can jump backward from 5 to 2, then from 2 to -1, but that's not allowed. So no. So for x=5, the frog cannot reach 1. But for x=7, it can. So the threshold here is 7.\n\nSo for x >=7, the frog can reach all positions in [0,x].\n\nBut how to determine this threshold for general a and b.\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps the threshold is (a + b) or something like that. In the previous example, a=2, b=3, threshold was 4 = a + b - 1. For a=5, b=3, threshold is 7 = a + b - 1 (5+3-1=7). Hmm, that seems to fit.\n\nLet me check another example. Take a=3, b=2. Threshold would be ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these counts for all values from 0 to a given integer $ m $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by $ a $ or backward by $ b $. The key insight is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $ a $ and $ b $.\n2. **Threshold Determination**: For sufficiently large values of $ x $, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of $ d $ (where $ d = \\text{gcd}(a, b) $) within the range $[0, x]$. This threshold is determined based on the values of $ a $ and $ b $.\n3. **Sum Calculation**: For values of $ x $ below this threshold, we use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to determine reachable positions. For values above the threshold, we directly calculate the number of valid positions using arithmetic progression.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a //= d\n    b //= d\n\n    if a == 0 and b == 0:\n        print(m + 1)\n        return\n\n    # Now a and b are coprime\n    # Find the threshold where all multiples of d up to x are reachable\n    # Threshold is (a * b - a - b) + something?
