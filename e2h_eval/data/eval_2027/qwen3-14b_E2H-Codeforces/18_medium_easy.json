The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem statement is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nSo the frog starts at position 0. It can jump either +a or -b. But the catch is that it can't jump outside the interval [0, x] when calculating f(x). And we need to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(x) represents. For each x, f(x) is the number of distinct integers reachable by the frog starting from 0, without ever stepping outside [0, x]. So for each x, we have to find all positions reachable under this constraint.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute each f(x) individually for every x up to m. We need an efficient way to compute the sum.\n\nLet me think about the possible reachable positions. Let's consider the movement possibilities. The frog can make any number of jumps, but each time it can't go beyond 0 or x. However, since the frog can choose different paths, maybe there's a mathematical way to model the reachable positions.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the problem without the restriction of [0, x]. The frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a's and subtracting b's. But since the frog can do this in any order, perhaps the reachable positions are those that can be written as (k*a - l*b), where k and l are non-negative integers. However, this is only if there's no restriction on the positions. But with the restriction of not going outside [0, x], it's more complicated.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the frog can't jump on an integer outside [0, x]. So during any jump, the frog must stay within that interval. So even if a position is reachable via some path that steps outside [0,x], it's not counted. So the reachable positions are those that can be reached through a sequence of jumps that never go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for a given x, the reachable positions are all positions that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b), and lie between 0 and x, and can be reached through some combination of a and b steps. Wait, but that's assuming that the frog can reach any such position, but considering the constraints of not stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the set of positions reachable under the condition that during any step, the frog stays within [0, x]. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for large enough x, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is gcd(a, b), and are in the range [0, x]. But then again, the problem is that for small x, the frog might not be able to reach all those positions because of the constraints of not stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut let's think of the case where a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of their gcd (which is 1). But how?\n\nWait, the frog can move forward by a steps, or backward by b steps. So, for example, if a=5 and b=3 (as in the first sample input), then the frog can reach positions like 0, 5, 5-3=2, 5+5=10 (but if x is 7, then 10 is outside, so it's not allowed). But for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5. Then, from 5, it can jump back to 5-3=2. From 2, can it jump forward to 2+5=7? But if x is 5, then 7 is outside. So in that case, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. So f(5)=3.\n\nIn the first sample, when x=5, the answer is 3. Which matches the note.\n\nSo for each x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by some sequence of +a and -b steps, but during the entire sequence, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nThis seems tricky. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as the frog being able to reach any position that can be expressed as (k*a - l*b), where k and l are non-negative integers, and such that the path to reach that position doesn't go outside [0, x]. But even if such a position exists, the frog might not be able to reach it if during the journey it steps outside the interval.\n\nBut perhaps for sufficiently large x, the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, where d = gcd(a, b), and is in the range [0, x]. But how to determine when x is large enough for that to be true?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be considered in terms of the minimum x where the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (d = gcd(a, b)) in [0, x]. Then, for x >= some value, f(x) would be (x//d + 1) if x is large enough. But how to compute that?\n\nBut first, let's think about the general case where the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and within [0, x], provided that x is large enough. Let's assume that this is the case. Then, for x >= some value, f(x) = floor(x / d) + 1. But how to find that value?\n\nBut for small x, the frog may not be able to reach all positions. For example, in the first sample where a=5, b=3, d = gcd(5,3)=1. So for x >= 5, the frog can reach any integer between 0 and x. But in the sample, when x=5, the frog can reach 0,5,2 (so three positions). But according to the formula, x/d +1 would be 5+1=6. Which is not matching. So clearly, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, that suggests that my assumption is wrong. So perhaps the reachable positions are not all multiples of d. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the frog can only reach positions that are congruent to 0 mod d, because each jump adds a (which is a multiple of d) or subtracts b (which is also a multiple of d). So the total change is a multiple of d. Therefore, the positions reachable are all numbers congruent to 0 mod d. So for example, when a=5 and b=3, d=1. So all positions are possible. But in the first sample, for x=5, the frog can reach 0,5,2. But 0,5,2 are all congruent to 0 mod 1. But why can't it reach other positions like 3? Well, because the frog can't reach them via any sequence of jumps without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nSo the problem is that even though the position is congruent to 0 mod d, the frog can't reach it if the path requires stepping outside the interval [0, x]. So for small x, the frog can't reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d.\n\nTherefore, for each x, f(x) is the number of positions in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d, and can be reached by the frog under the constraints of not stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a certain minimal value of x beyond which all positions congruent to 0 mod d in [0, x] can be reached. Once x is larger than or equal to that value, f(x) becomes (x//d + 1). But how to find that minimal x?\n\nLet me think about the problem again. The frog can make forward jumps of a steps and backward jumps of b steps. So the problem is similar to the classic coin problem where you can use coins of denominations a and b, but in this case, the frog can use any number of a's and b's, but the order matters (since the frog can't go negative or beyond x).\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the minimal x such that the frog can reach all positions in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d. Once that x is found, then for any larger x, the number of positions is x//d + 1.\n\nSo let's suppose that once x is large enough, say x >= max(a, b) * something, then f(x) is (x//d + 1). But how to find this threshold?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d and are >= some value. For example, in the case where a=5, b=3, d=1. So all positions are possible. But the frog can't reach 3, but that's because 3 is congruent to 0 mod 1 (since any integer is congruent to 0 mod 1). Wait, that's not correct. Oh, wait, d is the gcd of a and b. Since a and b are 5 and 3, their gcd is 1. So any integer can be formed as a linear combination of a and b. But the frog can only add a or subtract b. So the frog can reach positions like 5, 5-3=2, 2+5=7, 7-3=4, etc. So for example, to reach 4, the frog can go 0 -> 5 (add a), then 5 -> 2 (subtract b), then 2 -> 7 (add a), then 7 -> 4 (subtract b). But if x is 4, then during the jumps, the frog would have to go to 5 (which is outside [0,4], so that's not allowed. Therefore, the frog can't reach 4 if x is 4.\n\nSo even though 4 is congruent to 0 mod 1, the frog can't reach it if x is 4. But when x is 7, the frog can reach 4 (by the steps 0 → 5 → 2 → 7 → 4). But for x=7, the frog can reach 4 because during the steps, the frog doesn't go outside [0,7].\n\nSo the problem is that for certain positions, the frog needs to make a forward jump that takes it beyond x, but then later steps back. But if x is large enough to allow that, then the position can be reached.\n\nSo the question is, for each x, what is the set of positions reachable?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the reachable positions as follows:\n\nThe frog can reach a position k if there exists some integer t such that k = (number of a jumps) * a - (number of b jumps) * b, and during the process, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d (d = gcd(a,b)), and is in [0, x], provided that x is large enough. Then, for x less than some threshold, the count is less than that.\n\nBut how to find the threshold?\n\nLet me think of the problem when the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d and are in [0, x]. For that to be true, the frog must be able to reach any such position. Let me think of the case where a and b are coprime (d=1). Then, for x ≥ a + b - 1, according to the coin problem, the largest amount that cannot be formed is a*b - a - b. But that's for positive combinations. However, in our case, the frog can subtract steps. So perhaps the problem is different.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is ≥ some minimal value. For example, in the case where a=5, b=3, d=1. Then, for x ≥ 5, the frog can reach all positions from 0 upwards. But in the sample, when x=5, the frog can reach 0,5,2. So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. For x=7, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, 4 (from 7-3=4), 2+5=7 (already counted?), 5-3=2 (already counted), 4+5=9 (but x=7, so not allowed). So for x=7, the positions are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7. Wait, but according to the sample explanation, f(7) is 8. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, the sample says f(7) is 8, which implies that there are 8 distinct positions. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLooking back at the first sample:\n\nSample input: m=7, a=5, b=3. The output is 19, which is the sum of f(0) to f(7). According to the note, f(7)=8. So the positions for x=7 are 8 in total. Let's think:\n\nHow can the frog reach positions:\n\nStart at 0.\n\nFrom 0, can jump to 5 (since 0+5=5, which is ≤7). Also, can't jump to 0-3=-3 (which is <0). So first possible positions are 0 and 5.\n\nFrom 5, can jump to 5+5=10 (invalid) or 5-3=2. So 2 is added. Now positions are 0, 2, 5.\n\nFrom 2, can jump to 2+5=7 (valid) or 2-3=-1 (invalid). So 7 is added. Now positions are 0,2,5,7.\n\nFrom 7, can jump to 7+5=12 (invalid) or 7-3=4. So 4 is added. Positions: 0,2,4,5,7.\n\nFrom 4, can jump to 4+5=9 (invalid) or 4-3=1. So 1 is added. Now positions include 0,1,2,4,5,7.\n\nFrom 1, can jump to 1+5=6 (valid) or 1-3=-2 (invalid). So 6 is added. Now positions: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7.\n\nFrom 6, can jump to 6+5=11 (invalid) or 6-3=3. So 3 is added. Now positions: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. That's 8 positions. So f(7)=8.\n\nAh, okay! So for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. Because even though the frog needed to go to 5, then to 2, then to 7, then to 4, then to 1, then to 6, then to 3. All these steps are allowed as long as they don't go outside [0,7]. So once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d (which is 1 in this case). Hence, for x ≥ some value, the count is x+1 (since all positions are reachable).\n\nSo the key insight here is that once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d (i.e., all integers, since d=1) in the interval [0, x]. So for x ≥ (a + b) * something, the count becomes (x // d + 1). But how to find this threshold?\n\nBut how do we determine for a general a and b, what is the minimal x beyond which all positions congruent to 0 mod d are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x is (a + b) * something. For example, in the first sample, when x=7, which is a + b - 1 = 5 + 3 -1 = 7. So maybe the threshold is a + b - 1. Then, for x ≥ a + b - 1, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nAnother example: let's take a=2, b=2. Then d = 2. The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of 2. Let's see. Starting at 0. From 0, can jump to 2 (since 0+2=2). From 2, can jump to 4 or 0. But for x=2, the reachable positions are 0,2. For x=3, the frog can't reach 2+2=4 (since x=3 <4). So for x=3, the reachable positions are still 0 and 2. So f(3) = 2. For x=4, the frog can reach 0,2,4. So for x=4, which is a + b -1 = 2+2-1=3. But x=4 is larger than 3, and the count is 3 (positions 0,2,4). So perhaps the threshold is higher than a + b -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is related to the maximum of a and b. Let's think of another example.\n\nSuppose a=3, b=2. Then d=1. So for x=3 + 2 -1 =4. Let's see if the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 4.\n\nAt x=4, the positions are 0, 3, 1 (from 3-2), 3+3=6 (invalid), 1+3=4 (valid). So 0,3,1,4. From 4, subtract 2 to get 2. So positions 0,3,1,4,2. So all positions 0-4 are reachable. Hence, for x=4 (which is a + b -1), all positions are reachable.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=3. The threshold was 5+3-1=7. Which matched the first sample.\n\nSo perhaps the threshold is when x is greater than or equal to a + b - 1. Once x is at least that, the frog can reach all positions congruent to 0 mod d (i.e., all positions if d=1) in [0, x].\n\nIf this is the case, then for x ≥ (a + b - 1), f(x) = (x // d + 1) if x is large enough. But wait, for x ≥ (a + b - 1), then the number of reachable positions would be (x // d + 1) ?\n\nWait, in the first example, when x=7, which is a + b -1 = 5+3-1=7. The count is 8, which is 7//1 +1 = 8. Yes. Similarly, when x=4 (a=3, b=2, d=1), then x//1 +1 = 5, which matches the 5 positions (0,1,2,3,4).\n\nSo this seems to hold. So the hypothesis is that for x ≥ (a + b -1), the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d (i.e., all positions if d=1) in [0, x]. Therefore, for x ≥ (a + b -1), f(x) = (x // d + 1).\n\nBut what if x is less than a + b -1?\n\nThen, we need to compute f(x) as the number of positions in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d and can be reached by the frog under the constraints.\n\nBut how to compute this for all x up to m?\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to calculate the sum over all x from 0 to m of f(x).\n\nLet me think about the steps required:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Check if a and b are such that the frog can reach any position in [0, x] congruent to 0 mod d once x is large enough (i.e., x ≥ threshold). The threshold is a + b -1.\n\nBut wait, what if the frog can't reach some positions even when x is large enough? Like in the case where a=2, b=2. Then d=2. The threshold would be 2 + 2 -1 = 3. For x=3, which is the threshold, the frog can reach positions 0, 2. But 0 and 2 are congruent to 0 mod 2. But 3 is not congruent to 0 mod 2. So for x=3, the count is 2. For x=4, which is larger than the threshold, the count is 3 (positions 0, 2, 4). Which is (4//2 +1) = 2 +1 = 3. So yes.\n\nSo in this case, the formula holds. So for x ≥ threshold, the count is (x//d + 1).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each x, f(x) is:\n\nif x < threshold: compute the number of positions in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d and can be reached.\n\nelse: (x//d + 1).\n\nBut how to compute the sum of f(x) for x from 0 to m?\n\nBut for m up to 1e9, we can't compute each x individually. So we need to find the sum for x < threshold and for x >= threshold separately.\n\nSo first, compute threshold = a + b - 1. Then, for x in [0, threshold], compute f(x) and sum them. Then, for x >= threshold and up to m, compute (x//d + 1) and sum them.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for x < threshold?\n\nBut the threshold could be up to 2*1e5 (since a and b are up to 1e5). So if m is up to 1e9, and threshold is up to 2e5, then for x up to threshold, we can precompute f(x) for each x and sum them. Then, for x >= threshold, compute the sum using the formula.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b).\n\nCheck if a and b are such that the frog can reach all positions congruent to 0 mod d once x is large enough. But according to our earlier reasoning, this is the case.\n\nNow, for the sum:\n\nsum_total = sum_{x=0}^m f(x) = sum_{x=0}^{min(m, threshold-1)} f(x) + sum_{x=max(threshold, 0)}^m (x//d + 1) if m >= threshold.\n\nBut how to compute the first part, sum_{x=0}^{t} f(x), where t is min(m, threshold-1).\n\nBut for each x in 0 to t, how to compute f(x)?\n\nBut for x up to threshold (say, up to 2e5), we can simulate the reachable positions for each x. However, for each x, simulating may be time-consuming. But since threshold is up to 2e5, and m is up to 1e9, this is manageable.\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for each x up to threshold?\n\nWe can model this with BFS or dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think. For each x, the frog can reach positions in [0, x]. But for different x's, the reachable positions vary. However, for x up to threshold, we need to compute for each x, the count of positions reachable.\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy if done naively for each x. However, since threshold is up to 2e5, and for each x, the BFS can be done up to x, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for all positions up to threshold, whether they are reachable (without considering the x limit). Then, for each x, f(x) is the count of positions in [0, x] that are reachable and are congruent to 0 mod d.\n\nWait, but the reachable positions for x depend on the x limit. For example, even if a position is reachable in theory (without x limits), if during the path to reach it, the frog steps outside [0, x], then it's not counted. However, if x is large enough (like threshold), then all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d can be reached.\n\nBut for x less than threshold, how can we compute which positions are reachable?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps for x up to threshold, the reachable positions can be computed using BFS, considering the x limit.\n\nWait, but for each x, the frog can't jump beyond [0, x]. So for each x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by sequences of jumps that never go outside [0, x]. However, for x up to threshold, which is a + b -1, perhaps the reachable positions can be determined by BFS for each x.\n\nBut doing this for each x from 0 to threshold is O(threshold * (threshold + a + b))? Which for threshold up to 2e5, that's 2e5 * 2e5 = 4e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible. So this approach is not going to work.\n\nAlternative idea: For each x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by the frog in the unrestricted case (i.e., without x limits) and are less than or equal to x. But this is only true if the frog can reach those positions without stepping outside [0, x]. However, this is not necessarily the case. For example, a position k may be reachable in the unrestricted case, but to reach it, the frog might have to step outside [0, x], making it unreachable for that particular x.\n\nBut perhaps for x >= a and x >= b, the frog can reach any position that is reachable in the unrestricted case and is <=x. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, consider a=5, b=3, and x=5. The position 2 is reachable (0→5→2). But to reach 2, the frog had to jump to 5 (which is allowed for x=5). So it's allowed. So perhaps for x >= a, the frog can reach any position that is reachable in the unrestricted case and is <=x.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose a=3, b=2, and x=3. The frog can reach 0, 3, 1 (3-2). Then, from 1, it can jump to 1+3=4 (but x=3, so invalid). So 4 is not allowed. So the position 1 is reachable. But in the unrestricted case, the frog can reach 1 (0→3→1). However, for x=3, the frog can reach it. So it's allowed. So perhaps for x >= a, the frog can reach any position that is reachable in the unrestricted case and is <=x.\n\nBut how to ensure that the path to reach the position doesn't require stepping outside [0, x]?\n\nMaybe the frog can always find a path to reach the position k (which is reachable in the unrestricted case) without stepping outside [0, x], provided that x is at least the maximum of a and b. Or perhaps some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any position k that is reachable in the unrestricted case, and k <= x, the frog can reach it by using a path that never goes beyond x. If that's true, then for x >= threshold, the number of positions is (x//d + 1), and for x < threshold, the number of positions is the number of positions in [0, x] that are reachable in the unrestricted case.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nTake the first example: x=5. The reachable positions are 0, 5, 2. These are all positions reachable in the unrestricted case. For example, 2 is reachable by 0→5→2. 5 is reachable by 0→5. 0 is trivial. All of them are <=5.\n\nAnother example: x=2. The frog can't jump forward (a=5 > x). So the only reachable position is 0. So for x=2, the count is 1. In the unrestricted case, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, etc. But for x=2, only 0 and 2 are in [0, 2]. But can the frog reach 2? To reach 2, the frog would need to jump from 0 to 5 (but that's outside x=2), then subtract 3 to get 2. But since during the jump from 0 to 5, which is outside [0, 2], it's not allowed. So the frog can't reach 2 for x=2. Hence, the count is 1.\n\nSo this shows that even though 2 is reachable in the unrestricted case (0→5→2), for x=2, the frog can't reach it because the path requires stepping outside [0, x].\n\nSo the assumption that for x >= a, the frog can reach all positions that are reachable in the unrestricted case and are <=x is incorrect.\n\nThus, this complicates things. So for x less than threshold, the count of reachable positions is not simply the number of positions in [0, x] that are reachable in the unrestricted case.\n\nHence, we need another approach.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet's consider that the frog can only move forward by a steps or backward by b steps. The problem resembles a graph where each node is a position, and edges are the possible jumps. The frog starts at 0. For each x, the graph is restricted to nodes in [0, x], and edges that don't go outside this interval.\n\nBut computing this for each x is expensive.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute for all positions up to threshold (a + b - 1) whether they are reachable in the unrestricted case. Then, for each x, the count would be the number of positions in [0, x] that are reachable in the unrestricted case and can be reached without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x >= a, the frog can reach any position that is reachable in the unrestricted case and is <=x. But how to prove this?\n\nLet me think of the following. Suppose that the frog can reach position k in the unrestricted case. Then, there exists a sequence of jumps that leads from 0 to k. But during this sequence, the frog might have gone beyond x. However, perhaps there's another way to reach k that stays within [0, x].\n\nFor example, in the case where k=2, a=5, b=3, x=5. The original path is 0 →5 →2. This is allowed because 5 is within x=5. So it works. But if x=2, then the path is not allowed.\n\nSo, for x >= k, and if during the path to reach k, the frog never goes beyond x, then it's allowed. But how to ensure that such a path exists?\n\nPerhaps we can find a way to reach k without going beyond x. For example, in the case where x >= k, but the original path requires jumping to a higher position, perhaps there's an alternative path that avoids that.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince the frog can make any number of jumps, perhaps for any position k that is reachable in the unrestricted case, there exists a path to reach it that does not exceed k + max(a, b). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the minimal number of steps to reach k. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother Idea: For any position k that is reachable in the unrestricted case, and x >= k, the frog can reach k by first reaching k using a path that may involve going beyond x, but then modifying the path to avoid that.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to precompute for all x up to threshold (a + b -1) the value of f(x) using BFS, and then compute the sum accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for each x up to threshold?\n\nLet's think of it this way: For each x, we can run a BFS that allows the frog to jump to k+a or k-b, but ensuring that the new position is within [0, x].\n\nThis would give us the set of reachable positions for that x.\n\nBut since x can be up to 2e5, and for each x, the BFS would process up to x positions, this would be O(threshold^2) operations. For threshold up to 2e5, this is 4e10 operations, which is way too slow for Python.\n\nThis is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nBut perhaps for all x, the reachable positions are the same as for x = threshold. Because once x reaches threshold, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d. But this is only true if threshold is large enough.\n\nBut this is not helpful for x < threshold.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet's think of the problem in terms of the reachable positions for all x. For example, if we can find all positions that are reachable in the unrestricted case, then for any x, f(x) is the number of such positions that are <=x and can be reached without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut again, how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions for any x are exactly the positions that are reachable in the unrestricted case and are between 0 and x. But this is not true, as shown in the earlier example where x=2 and k=2 is not reachable.\n\nBut maybe for x >= a, this is true. For example, if x >= a, then the frog can make forward jumps. So, for any position k that is reachable in the unrestricted case and is <=x, the frog can reach it by using a path that doesn't go beyond x.\n\nBut how to prove this?\n\nLet's take an example where k is reachable in the unrestricted case. Let's say that k is reachable by a sequence of jumps that involves going to some position higher than x. Can we find another path that reaches k without going beyond x?\n\nFor example, let's say a=5, b=3, x=5, and k=2. The path 0 →5 →2 is valid since 5 is within x=5. So yes.\n\nIf x=4, and k=2. Can the frog reach 2? Let's see. From 0, can jump to 5 (but that's outside x=4, so not allowed). So the frog can't reach 2 for x=4. But in the unrestricted case, it is reachable. So for x=4, it's not counted.\n\nSo the assumption is not valid for x < a.\n\nBut for x >= a, perhaps it is valid.\n\nLet me think of another example. Let's say a=5, b=3, x=5. Any position reachable in the unrestricted case and <=5 can be reached by the frog. For example, 5 is reachable, 2 is reachable, 0 is reachable. What about 7? No, because it's larger than x=5.\n\nAnother example: x=5, k=2. Yes.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=2, x=3. The reachable positions are 0, 3, 1 (0 →3 →1). So for x=3, which is >= a=3, the positions are reachable. For k=1, it is reachable.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=2, x=3. What about k=1? Yes. What about k=2? Can the frog reach it? Let's see. To reach 2, the frog would have to do 0 →3 →1 →4 (invalid for x=3), or 0 →3 →1 → (can't jump to 4). So no. But in the unrestricted case, can the frog reach 2? Yes, for example: 0 →3 →1 →4 → 2. But in this path, the frog goes to 4, which is beyond x=3. So for x=3, it's not allowed. So the position 2 is not reachable for x=3, even though it is reachable in the unrestricted case.\n\nSo this shows that even for x >= a, the assumption is not valid.\n\nHmm. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet's think of the problem differently. For the frog to reach a position k, it must be possible to reach it with some number of a and b steps, such that during the entire sequence of jumps, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with BFS for each x, but with x up to threshold, which is up to 2e5. For each x, we can perform a BFS from 0, and track which positions are reachable within [0, x]. But for x up to 2e5, this would be O(threshold * (threshold + a + b)) operations, which is not feasible for Python.\n\nBut wait, threshold is a + b -1. Given that a and b are up to 1e5, the threshold",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values for all integers from 0 to m. The solution involves understanding the reachable positions using BFS for small values and leveraging mathematical properties for larger values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either +a or -b. The key observation is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: For sufficiently large x (specifically, when x is at least a + b - 1), the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of gcd(a, b) within the range [0, x]. This allows us to compute the sum for larger values efficiently.\n3. **BFS for Small Values**: For values of x below the threshold, we use BFS to determine reachable positions and sum their counts.\n4. **Mathematical Summation**: For values of x beyond the threshold, we use a direct formula to compute the sum efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    # If a == 0 or b == 0, but per problem statement, they are positive integers\n    # So no need to handle that case\n    \n    threshold = a + b - 1\n    \n    # Precompute f(x) for x up to threshold\n    max_x_precompute = min(m, threshold)\n    \n    # We'll precompute reachable positions for each x up to threshold\n    # But for efficiency, we can run BFS once up to threshold, and for each x, track which positions are reachable\n    # However, since for different x, the reachable positions vary, we need to process each x separately\n    # But for the sake of time, let's do it for each x from 0 to max_x_precompute\n    \n    # Initialize an array to store the count of reachable positions for each x\n    # We'll compute for each x in 0 to max_x_precompute\n    # We can precompute for all x up to threshold, and for each x, run BFS\n    # However, this might be too slow for large threshold.
