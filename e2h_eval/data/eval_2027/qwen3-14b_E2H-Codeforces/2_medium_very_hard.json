Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is n lines each with n characters. n is odd. So for example, for n=5, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). The other diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). Wait, but the center cell (2,2) in this case is part of both diagonals. So for each cell in the grid, I need to check if it's on either of the two diagonals.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this diagonal_char.\n- Check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same, and different from diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal characters. For each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. So for all those cells, check that they are all the same. Then for all other cells, check that they are the same and different from the diagonal character.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the two diagonals have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is 'x' and the other diagonal is 'y', then that's invalid. So first, we need to check that all diagonal cells are the same. So first, collect all the diagonal cells and check that they are all the same. Then check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it's on the diagonal. If it is, collect its character. All these characters must be the same.\n\n2. Then, check all non-diagonal cells. All of them must be the same, and not equal to the diagonal character.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal characters? Let's think:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. So for all such cells, collect their characters. Then check if all are the same.\n\nBut for the first step, maybe we can take the first diagonal cell's character as the reference. For example, take the first cell (0,0), which is part of the main diagonal. Then check that all other diagonal cells are equal to this. But what if the first cell is not part of the diagonals? No, since n is at least 3 and odd. For example, n=3, (0,0) is part of the diagonals. So for the first cell, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nWait, for n=3, the diagonals are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) for main, and (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) for the other. So the cell (1,1) is part of both.\n\nSo for the first step, collect all the diagonal cells. Let's collect all of them. Then check if all are the same. If any is different, return NO.\n\nOnce that's done, collect all non-diagonal cells. Check if all are same and different from the diagonal character.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal cells? For each cell (i,j), if it's not on the diagonals, then check if it's same as the non-diagonal character.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Read the grid.\n\n- Check that all diagonal cells are same. Let's call this diag_char.\n\n- Check that all non-diagonal cells are same and not equal to diag_char.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, let's get the grid. For example, for input:\n\nn = 5\n\nrows = [\n'xooox',\n'oxoxo',\n'soxoo',\n'oxoxo',\n'xooox'\n]\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == 4 (since n-1 is 4).\n\nFor example, in row 0, the first cell (0,0) is on the diagonal. The cell (0,4) is also on the diagonal. Then, for row 1, (1,1) and (1,3) are on diagonals. And so on.\n\nSo, for each cell, check if it is on the diagonals.\n\nNow, for the first part: collect all the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal character as the reference. For example, the first cell (0,0) is part of the diagonals. Then, check that all other diagonal cells are equal to it.\n\nBut what if there are no diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3, so there are diagonals.\n\nBut for example, in n=3, the diagonals have 3 elements each, but overlapping at the center. So the total number of diagonal cells is 2n - 1. Because for n=3, 2*3-1=5. Which is correct: 3+3-1=5 (since the center is counted twice).\n\nBut for checking, we need to make sure that all cells on the diagonals are same. So, for each cell (i,j) where i ==j or i +j == n-1, check that it's same as the first diagonal cell (say, (0,0)).\n\nBut what if the first diagonal cell is not part of the diagonals? No, because (0,0) is on the main diagonal.\n\nSo, the steps for the first part:\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n    for each j from 0 to n-1:\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                return NO\n\nBut wait, this would check all diagonal cells. But for the first cell, it's already diag_char. So that's okay.\n\nOnce that's done, then check the non-diagonal cells. For these, collect all of them and check that they are same and not equal to diag_char.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFor the non-diagonal cells, collect their characters. Let's take the first non-diagonal cell (the first cell that is not on the diagonals) and check that all others are same as it. Also, check that this non-diagonal character is different from diag_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=3, the total cells are 9. The diagonals have 5 cells. So non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, for example, in the first row, the first cell is (0,0) which is diagonal. Then (0,1) is not on the diagonals. Because for i=0, j=1: i +j = 1, which is not equal to n-1 (which is 2). So (0,1) is not on the diagonals. So for that cell, check if it's same as the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell? Well, perhaps we can iterate through all cells in order, and find the first cell that is not on the diagonals. Then, collect all the non-diagonal cells and check that they are same as this first one. Also, check that this first non-diagonal cell's character is not equal to diag_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo, steps for the second part:\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal cells are same and different from diag_char.\n\nSo, for example, for the first non-diagonal cell, let's say it's 'a'. Then all other non-diagonal cells must be 'a', and 'a' must not be equal to diag_char.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell?\n\nAlternatively, collect all non-diagonal cells. If there are none, then it's impossible (since n >=3, but for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells). So, for the code:\n\nWe can loop through all cells, and for each cell, check if it is not on the diagonals. Collect all those characters. Then check if all are same and different from diag_char.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nIf the list of non-diagonal characters is empty, then it's impossible. But for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, for example, in n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4 in total. For example, (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nCollect all non-diagonal cells into a list.\n\nIf the list is empty, then it's invalid (but that's not possible for n >=3).\n\nElse, check that all elements in the list are same as the first element. Also, check that this first element is not equal to diag_char.\n\nBut what if the non-diagonal list is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4. So the code can proceed.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. So grid is a list of strings.\n\nCheck for diagonals:\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit\n\nThen, check the non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diag_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            non_diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(non_diag_chars) == 0:\n\n    # impossible, but for n >=3, no.\n\nelse:\n\n    first_non_diag = non_diag_chars[0]\n\n    for c in non_diag_chars:\n\n        if c != first_non_diag:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            exit\n\n    if first_non_diag == diag_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit\n\nIf all checks passed, then print \"YES\".\n\nBut wait, what about the case where all non-diagonal cells are same but same as diag_char? For example, all cells are same. Then, the diagonals are same, but the non-diagonal cells are same as diagonals. So that's invalid.\n\nSo, the code needs to check that the non-diagonal characters are all same and different from diag_char.\n\nSo, the code steps.\n\nNow, let's think about possible test cases.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, the diagonals are:\n\nLooking at each cell (i,j) where i==j or i+j=4.\n\nFor example, first row: (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x. So for the first row, the first and last are x.\n\nSecond row: (1,1) is o, (1,3) is o. So those are o.\n\nThird row: (2,2) is x. Also, (2,2) is part of both diagonals. So the third row's third cell is x. But (2,2) is on both diagonals. So the third row's (2,0) is s? Wait, the third row is 'soxoo'.\n\nSo for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2, which is not equal to 4 (n-1 is 4). So that cell is not on the diagonals. So the third row's first cell is s, which is non-diagonal. So the code will check that all non-diagonal cells are same. But in this case, the non-diagonal cells include s, which is different from the diagonal character (x). So the code will detect that, and output NO. Which matches the sample input's first case.\n\nAnother sample input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw' → output YES.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=3. The diagonals are positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So all these cells must be same. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: w s w → (0,0) is w, (0,2) is w. (1,1) is s. (2,0) is w, (2,2) is w. So the diagonals are w, w, s, w, w. Wait, that's not all same. Wait, but that's a problem. But according to the sample input, this case outputs YES. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait the sample input is:\n\nSample input 2 is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: 'wsw' → positions (0,0) = 'w', (0,1) = 's', (0,2) = 'w'\n\nRow 1: 'sws' → (1,0) = 's', (1,1) = 'w', (1,2) = 's'\n\nRow 2: 'wsw' → (2,0) = 'w', (2,1) = 's', (2,2) = 'w'\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (w) and i=0, j=2 (w). For i=1, j=1 (w). For i=2, j=0 (w) and i=2, j=2 (w). Also, for i=1, j=1 is part of both diagonals. So all the diagonal cells are w. So the diagonals are all 'w'.\n\nThen the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1) → s\n\n(1,0) → s\n\n(1,2) → s\n\n(2,1) → s\n\nSo all non-diagonal cells are 's', which is different from 'w'. So this case should output YES, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code would pass this.\n\nAnother sample input is '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe' → output NO.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=3.\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) = x, (0,2) = x; (1,1) = x; (2,0) = x; (2,2) = e. So the diagonals have x, x, x, x, e. So the code would check that all diagonals are same. But (2,2) is e, which is different from x (the first diagonal cell). So the code would output NO.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle these cases.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the original input is given as a list of strings, but the actual input comes from standard input.\n\nWait, the user provided sample input shows that the first input is something like ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...], but in reality, the input is read from stdin. So for example, the first line is n, then n lines follow.\n\nWait, the input format says: the first line contains integer n. Then each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo, the code needs to read from stdin. For example, in Python, the code can read via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is given as multiple lines, it's better to read all lines first.\n\nBut for code submission, the code must read from stdin. So, for example, in Python:\n\nRead n from input. Then read n lines, each line being a string.\n\nBut sometimes, when the input is given as a list, like in the sample input, but in practice, the code must read from standard input.\n\nSo, for example, for the first sample input, the code would read:\n\nn = 5\n\nthen read 5 lines:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut need to make sure that each line is read properly.\n\nOnce the grid is read, proceed with the checks.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nCheck all diagonal cells are same.\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nBut in Python, to exit early, perhaps use a flag.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nvalid = True\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n    if not valid:\n\n        break\n\nif not valid:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    exit()\n\nWait, but in Python, breaking out of nested loops can be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps use a flag.\n\nBut perhaps better to use a function.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if (i == j or i + j == n -1) and grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            exit()\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function may need to be called with sys.exit(), but perhaps the code can return early.\n\nBut for code submission, perhaps using sys.exit() is okay.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read properly. However, sometimes, when reading with input(), the trailing newlines may be handled automatically.\n\nBut for code submission, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nRead n as int(input()), then read n lines with input().strip().\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nOnce the grid is read, check the diagonals.\n\nSo:\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nBut in Python, exit() is not the same as sys.exit(). So perhaps, after checking, we can return.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nBut in Python, to exit, perhaps use sys.exit().\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\n...\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                sys.exit()\n\nThen, after checking diagonals, check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nNow, collect all non-diagonal cells.\n\nnon_diag_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            non_diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check that all non-diagonal chars are same and different from diag_char.\n\nBut what if non_diag_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, it's not possible. For n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 3*3 - (2*3-1) = 9-5=4.\n\nSo, for non_diag_chars, len is 4.\n\nSo, check:\n\nif len(non_diag_chars) == 0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\nBut that's redundant. So proceed.\n\nThen, check if all elements in non_diag_chars are same as first element.\n\nfirst_non = non_diag_chars[0]\n\nfor c in non_diag_chars:\n\n    if c != first_non:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\nThen check if first_non == diag_char:\n\nif first_non == diag_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\nElse, print \"YES\".\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut code in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\n# Check diagonals\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                sys.exit()\n\n# Check non-diagonal cells\n\nnon_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diag:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\nfirst_non = non_diag[0]\n\nfor c in non_diag:\n\n    if c != first_non:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\nif first_non == diag_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diag list is empty? For n >=3, it's not possible. For example, n=3, the number of cells is 9. The number of diagonal cells is 2*3-1=5. So non-diagonal is 4. So non_diag is not empty.\n\nSo the code can skip checking for empty non_diag.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, like n=1, but the constraints say n is at least 3. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the check is redundant, but including it is safe.\n\nBut in practice, for n >=3, the non_diag list is not empty.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3, grid is:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nFor each cell in diagonals:\n\n(0,0) is 'w', (0,2) is 'w'; (1,1) is 'w'; (2,0) is 'w', (2,2) is 'w'. All are 'w'.\n\nThen non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1) 's', (1,0) 's', (1,2) 's', (2,1) 's'. All same. first_non is 's', which is different from 'w'. So output YES.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=3, grid is:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\n(0,0) is x, (0,2) is x. (1,1) is x. (2,0) is x. (2,2) is e. So during the check, when i=2, j=2: i + j = 4, which is n-1 (n=3, 3-1=2? Wait n=3, n-1=2. So i=2, j=2: i +j =4, which is not equal to 2. Wait no. Wait for n=3, the other diagonal is i + j = n-1 = 2. So for (2,2): i +j is 4, which is not 2. So this cell is not on the diagonal. Wait, but (2,2) is on the main diagonal (i==j). So for (2,2), i ==j is true. So it is part of the diagonals.\n\nWait, for n=3, the main diagonal is i ==j. So (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The other diagonal is i +j = 2. So (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So (2,2) is part of the main diagonal. So in the third row, the third cell is (2,2), which is part of the diagonals. So in the third row, the third cell is 'e'.\n\nSo during the check for diagonals, the code checks for (i ==j or i +j == n-1). So for (2,2), i ==j is true. So the code checks if grid[2][2] equals diag_char (which is grid[0][0] = 'x'). But grid[2][2] is 'e' (from the third row, 'xpe' → third row is 'xpe'? Wait the third row is 'xpe'? Let me recheck the sample input.\n\nSample input 3 is:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the third row is 'xpe' → j=0 is 'x', j=1 is 'p', j=2 is 'e'.\n\nSo (2,2) is 'e'. Which is part of the main diagonal. So during the check, when i=2, j=2, the code checks if grid[i][j] is equal to diag_char (x). But it's e. So the code would print NO.\n\nSo the code would correctly output NO for sample 3.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all cells are same. For example, all 'a's. Then, diagonals are same. Non-diagonal cells are same. But same as diagonals. So the code would check first_non == diag_char → yes. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'b'. Then output YES.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=3, diagonals all 'a', non-diagonal all 'a' → output NO.\n\nEdge case 2: n=3, diagonals all 'a', non-diagonal all 'b' → output YES.\n\nAnother case: n=5, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'b' → YES.\n\nAnother case: n=5, diagonals have some 'a's and one 'b' → NO.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, when checking for the non-diagonal cells, the code is collecting all non-diagonal cells. But perhaps there's a mistake in the condition.\n\nWait, the code uses:\n\nif not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nif (i != j) and (i + j != n-1):\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes, because the condition for being on the diagonals is (i == j) OR (i +j == n-1). So the non-diagonal cells are those that are not on the diagonals. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible error: when checking for i + j == n-1. For example, in n=5, n-1 is 4. So for i=0, j=4 → 0+4=4 → yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin. So for example, when reading the input, sometimes there may be leading or trailing spaces. However, the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the input lines are exactly n characters long, with no leading or trailing spaces. So using .strip() could be problematic if the input has leading/trailing whitespace, but according to the problem statement, the input is correct. So perhaps using .strip() is not needed. However, in some cases, when reading via input(), the trailing newline is stripped. So perhaps it's better to read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut for example, if a line is 'xooox', then input().strip() is same as the original. So perhaps the code can read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut in the code, the code reads:\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. So perhaps using input().strip() is safe.\n\nBut perhaps, better to read as input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps the code can read as input().strip().\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut sometimes, when reading via sys.stdin.readline(), the first line may have a trailing newline, but the code is correct.\n\nBut perhaps using input() instead of sys.stdin.readline() is easier, but for code submission, it's better to use input().\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut then, for cases where the input has leading/trailing spaces, but the problem says that each line is exactly n letters. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is read with input(), the code may have issues with trailing newlines, but for programming competition problems, the input is usually properly formatted.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                sys.exit()\n\nnon_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n\n            non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diag:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\nfirst_non = non_diag[0]\n\nfor c in non_diag:\n\n    if c != first_non:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\nif first_non == diag_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nBut in Python, sys.exit() may not be allowed, but in code submission, it's acceptable.\n\nBut in some cases, the code may not have sys imported. So the code should import sys.\n\nYes, the code starts with import sys.\n\nWait, the code as written starts with import sys?\n\nYes.\n\nBut the code as written in the code block above includes the import.\n\nBut in the code, the first line is import sys.\n\nBut in the code, the code is written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n...\n\nBut in the code, the code uses sys.exit().\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code checks the diagonals. Let's see:\n\nThe first diagonal character is grid[0][0] = 'x'.\n\nCheck all diagonals. For example, in the third row (i=2), j=2 is 'x' (since the third row is 'soxoo' → j=0 is 's', j=1 is 'o', j=2 is 'x', j=3 is 'o', j=4 is 'o'. So (2,2) is 'x' which is correct. However, the third row's (i=2, j=0) is 's', which is not on the diagonals. So during the diagonal check, the code checks all cells on diagonals. But in the third row, (i=2, j=2) is part of the diagonals. So the code checks that.\n\nBut in the first row, (0,0) is 'x', (0,4) is 'x'.\n\nIn the second row, (1,1) is 'o' → which is not same as diag_char 'x' → the code would print NO. Wait, but in the sample input 1, the output is NO. So that's correct.\n\nWait, let's see the sample input 1's grid:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) is x? Or is it o?\n\nWait the second line is 'oxoxo' → indexes 0: o, 1: x, 2: o, 3: x, 4: o. So (1,1) is x. So the code would check that. But diag_char is x. So for (1,1), it's x. So that's okay. What about (1,3)? i=1, j=3. i +j =4, which is n-1 (5-1=4). So (1,3) is x. So that's okay. So in row 1, the diagonals are x and x.\n\nBut then, what about row 2, which is 'soxoo' → (2,2) is x. So that's okay.\n\nBut what about row 3: 'oxoxo' → (3,3) is x. So that's okay. Row 4: xooox → (4,4) is x.\n\nSo why does the sample input 1 output NO?\n\nAh, because the code checks for the diagonals. But wait, what about the other diagonal? For example, row 0, j=4 is x. That's part of the other diagonal. But the code checks all diagonals. So in the sample input 1, why is the output NO?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me recheck the sample input 1.\n\nSample input 1 is:\n\nn=5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → (0,0) x, (0,4) x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) x, (1,3) x.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) x. Also, for other diagonal: (2, 2) is part of both diagonals. So (2, 2) is x.\n\nRow 3: o x o x o → (3,1) x (i=3, j=1: i +j =4). (3,3) x.\n\nRow 4: x o o o x → (4,0) x, (4,4) x.\n\nSo all diagonals are x. So the code passes the first check.\n\nThen, check the non-diagonal cells. For example, in row 2, j=0 is s. Which is non-diagonal. So the non-diagonal cells include s. Then, the code checks that all non-diagonal cells are same. But in this case, the non-diagonal cells include s and o and others. For example, row 0, j=1 is o. Which is non-diagonal. So the code would find that the non-diagonal cells are not all same. Hence, output NO.\n\nAh! Oh right. So the code would check that all non-diagonal cells are same. But in this case, the non-diagonal cells include o and s, etc. So the code would find that and output NO.\n\nSo the code would correctly output NO for sample input 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: sample input 2, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all cells on both diagonals must contain the same letter, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: Ensure all cells on both diagonals are the same. This is done by iterating through each cell and checking if it lies on either of the two diagonals.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Ensure all non-diagonal cells contain the same letter, which is different from the letter used on the diagonals. This involves collecting all non-diagonal cells and verifying they are uniform and distinct from the diagonal letter.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\n# Check all diagonal cells\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                sys.exit()\n\n# Collect non-diagonal characters\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n            non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check non-diagonal characters\nif not non_diag:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    sys.exit()\n\nfirst_non = non_diag[0]\nfor c in non_diag:\n    if c != first_non:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nif first_non == diag_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using standard input functions. The grid is stored as a list of strings.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal where row index equals column index, or anti-diagonal where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`), we check if it matches the character at the top-left corner of the grid (`grid[0][0]`). If any mismatch is found, we immediately print \"NO\" and exit.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: We collect all characters that are not on the diagonals. These characters must all be the same and different from the diagonal character. If they are not uniform or match the diagonal character, we print \"NO\" and exit. If all checks pass, we print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently verify both conditions required for the grid to form the letter \"X\" while handling edge cases appropriately.",
