Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. The problem says that the X is formed when both diagonals have the same letters, and all other squares have the same letter different from the diagonals. So, how do I check this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure. For a square of size n x n where n is odd, the main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left. All the cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same, and that they are different from 'd'.\n\nBut how do I check these conditions?\n\nFirst, for the diagonals. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, it's part of the main diagonal if i == j. It's part of the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for all cells in either of these two diagonals, they must be the same. So first, collect all the characters from the diagonals and check if they are all the same.\n\nWait, but the two diagonals might have different characters. Wait, no. The problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', that's okay. But if the main is 'x' and the anti is 'y', then that's invalid.\n\nSo the first step is to check that all the diagonal elements (both diagonals) are the same. So collect all the elements from both diagonals and check they are all the same.\n\nThen, collect all the non-diagonal elements and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think. For each cell (i,j), if it's on either diagonal, then it's part of the diagonal. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\n- Collect all the characters from the diagonals. Let's say the first diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1), and the second from (0,n-1) to (n-1,0). So for each cell in the grid, check if i == j or i + j == n-1. If yes, then collect that character.\n\nNow, all of these characters must be equal. Let's call this value 'd_char'.\n\nThen, for the non-diagonal cells, collect all their characters. Let's call this 'other_char'. All of these must be equal, and also different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to collect these?\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if it's not on either diagonal, then collect its character.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. Check that all diagonal cells have the same character.\n\n3. Check that all non-diagonal cells have the same character, which is different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, let's get the diagonal characters. Let's take the first cell (0,0) as the reference. Then check that all other diagonal cells match this. Similarly for the anti-diagonal.\n\nWait, but maybe the first cell is part of both diagonals. For example, in a 3x3 grid, (0,0) is on the main diagonal, and (0,2) is on the anti-diagonal. But for the main diagonal, (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). For the anti, (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the center cell (1,1) is part of both diagonals. So when collecting all diagonal cells, we need to make sure that we don't have duplicates. But for checking, even if we check all cells in both diagonals, it's okay. Because if the main diagonal has all same characters, and the anti-diagonal has all same characters, but the two diagonals may have different characters. But the problem says that both diagonals must have same letters. So for example, if the main diagonal is 'x' and the anti is 'x', that's okay. But if the main is 'x' and the anti is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the way to check is that all the diagonal cells (from both diagonals) are the same. So, for example, take the first cell of the main diagonal (0,0) as the reference. Then check that all other cells in the main and anti diagonals are equal to this.\n\nWait, but for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then that's okay. But if the main is 'x' and the anti is 'x', then all diagonal cells are same. So the first step is to collect all the diagonal cells and check that they are all the same.\n\nSo, for the first step, collect all the characters in the diagonals. Let's create a set of those characters. If the length of the set is not 1, then it's invalid.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x' and the anti has all 'x', then the set is {'x'}, which is okay. If the main has 'x' and the anti has 'y', then the set is {'x', 'y'}, which is invalid.\n\nSo that's the first check.\n\nOnce that's passed, then check the non-diagonal cells. Collect all of them into a set. If the set has more than one element, then invalid. Also, the set must be different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal cells?\n\nFor each cell (i,j), check if it's on either diagonal. If not, then add it to the non-diagonal set.\n\nSo, for example, in the 3x3 grid, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nSo, for each of these, collect their characters.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string of length n. So grid is a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1: return NO\n\nElse, d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\nThen, collect all non-diagonal chars:\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1: return NO\n\nElse, other_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\nCheck if other_char != d_char. If not, return NO.\n\nElse, return YES.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where there are no non-diagonal cells? For example, n=1. But according to the input constraints, n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So the code is okay.\n\nBut let's test some examples.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nCheck the diagonals. For each cell (i,j) where i==j or i+j=4 (since n=5, n-1=4).\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (main diagonal), and j=4 (anti). So for row 0, columns 0 and 4 are x and x. So that's okay. For row 1, columns 1 and 3: x and x. Row 2: column 2 (x) and column 2 (since i=2, j=2, and i + j =4? 2+2=4? Yes. So for row 2, column 2 is x. Also, for row 2, j=2 is part of both diagonals. So the diagonals include all the cells in the main and anti.\n\nBut in row 2, the cell (2,2) is x. However, the cell (2,0) is s? Wait, for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2, which is not equal to 4. So that cell is not on the diagonals. Wait, but the cell (2, 0) is in row 2, column 0. For i=2, j=0: i + j = 2. For n=5, n-1 is 4. So that's not part of the anti-diagonal. So the cell (2,0) is not on any diagonal. So in the sample input, the cell (2,0) is 's', which is part of the non-diagonal cells. So the non-diagonal cells would include 's', but the other non-diagonal cells may have other values. Let's see.\n\nSo in the first sample input, the diagonals are all x? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the first row, the first and last elements are x. Second row, first element is o, but the middle is x, and the third element is o. Wait, for row 1, j=1 is x (i==j), and j=3 (i + j = 1 + 3 = 4). So that's x. So row 1's cells (1,1) and (1,3) are x. Row 2, (i=2, j=2) is x. Also, for i=2, j=2: i + j = 4. So that's part of the anti-diagonal. So the diagonals are all x. But in row 2, the cell (2,0) is 's' which is not part of the diagonals. So the non-diagonal cells include 's' and others. So the non-diagonal characters are not all same. So the first sample input returns NO, which matches the example.\n\nSo the code would correctly catch that.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 3, with:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) = w, (0,2) = w. (1,1) is w. (2,0) is w, (2,2) is w. So all diagonals are w. Then the non-diagonal cells are (0,1) = s, (1,0) = s, (1,2) = s, (2,1) = s. So non-diagonal is all s. Which is different from w. So returns YES.\n\nThird sample input is 3:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals: cells (0,0) = x, (0,2) = x; (1,1) = x; (2,0) = x, (2,2) = e. So the diagonals have x and e. So the set of diagonal characters is {x, e}, which has length 2. So the code returns NO, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if all the non-diagonal cells are same as the diagonal? For example, n=3, all cells are x. Then, the diagonals are x, and non-diagonal is x. Then, the code would check that non-diagonal set is {x}, which is same as diagonal. So the code would return NO. Which is correct, because the non-diagonal cells must be different.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are x, non-diagonal are y. Then returns YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are x, non-diagonal are x and y. Then the non-diagonal set has size 2, returns NO.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n from input. Then read n lines. Then process.\n\nBut in the input, the first line is n, then n lines follow. But in the sample input given in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings, but in actual code, the input comes from stdin.\n\nBut for the code, the input is read via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the code, the user will input n, then n lines.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut then, for each row, it's a string. So grid[i][j] gives the character.\n\nThen, collect all the diagonal characters.\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    # collect non-diagonal chars\n\n    non_diagonal_chars = set()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n\n                non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        other_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n        if other_char == d_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal characters? For example, n=1. But according to the problem statement, n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut for example, when n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 9 - 3*2 + 1 (because the center cell is counted in both diagonals). Wait, for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells. So non-diagonal is 9-5=4 cells. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nBut what if the non-diagonal set is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is >=3. So no.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ni=0, j=0 (x), j=4 (x)\n\ni=1, j=1 (x), j=3 (x)\n\ni=2, j=2 (x), j=2 (since i=2, j=2, i + j =4 (n-1=4). So yes.\n\ni=3, j=1 (x?), wait i=3, j=1: i + j = 4. So yes. So for row 3, j=1 is x. And j=3 is x (i=3, j=3? i + j =6? No. For n=5, i=3, j=1: 3+1=4. So yes. So the anti-diagonal for i=3 is j=1. So the cell (3,1) is x. And cell (3,3) is x (i=3, j=3: i + j =6, which is not 4. Wait no. For n=5, n-1 is 4. So i + j must be 4. So for i=3, j=1: 3+1=4. So yes. For i=3, j=1 is part of the anti-diagonal. For i=3, j=3: 3+3=6, which is not 4. So not part of the anti-diagonal. So the cell (3,3) is part of the main diagonal? i=3, j=3: i == j. Yes. So that's part of the main diagonal. So in row 3, j=3 is x. So the diagonals for row 3: (3,3) is x and (3,1) is x. So the diagonal_chars includes x.\n\nBut the cell (2,0) is s. So in the non-diagonal cells, s is present. So the non-diagonal set would have s and others. So the code would check that the non-diagonal set is not same. Hence output is NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ni=0, j=0 (w), j=2 (w)\n\ni=1, j=1 (w)\n\ni=2, j=0 (w), j=2 (w)\n\nSo all diagonals are w. So diagonal_chars is {w}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So non_diagonal_chars is {s}. So other_char is s, which is different from w. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, what about a case where the diagonals are same, but non-diagonal has multiple characters?\n\nLike:\n\nn=3\n\nxxx\n\nxax\n\nxxx\n\nHere, the diagonals are all x. The non-diagonal cells are (0,1) x, (1,0) x, (1,2) x, (2,1) x. So non-diagonal is x. But since it's same as diagonal, output is NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal has two different letters.\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are a, a, a, a, a. So diagonal is a. Non-diagonal cells are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) b, (2,1) a. So non-diagonal set is {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, code seems correct. Now, implement in Python.\n\nBut note that the input may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, since the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the input lines are exactly n characters long. So when reading, we can just read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps better to read as input().strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespace, though the problem says that each line is exactly n letters.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being input().strip().\n\nNow, proceed with the code.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    non_diagonal_chars = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n                non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        other_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n        if other_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal characters? For example, n=1. But n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code would collect the diagonals. For the first row, i=0, j=0 and j=4 (x and x). Then row 1, j=1 and j=3 (x and x). Row 2, j=2 (x) and j=2 (i=2, j=2, i + j =4. So yes. So that's x. Then row 3, j=1 (x) and j=3 (x). Row 4, j=0 and j=4 (x and x). So diagonal_chars is {x}?\n\nWait, but in row 2, j=0 is s. But that's not part of the diagonals. So the code for the first sample input would collect all the diagonal characters as x. But what about the cell (2,2) which is x? So yes. So the diagonal_chars is {x}.\n\nBut then the non-diagonal cells include the s in (2,0). So non_diagonal_chars would have s and others. So len(non_diagonal_chars) is more than 1. So output is NO. Which is correct.\n\nBut why? Let me think again. In the first sample input, the third row is 'soxoo' → row 2 is 's o x o o'.\n\nThe non-diagonal cells for row 2 are (2,0) s, (2,1) o, (2,3) o, (2,4) o. Wait, for row 2, i=2. For j=0: i + j = 2, which is not 4 (n-1=4). So not part of diagonal. So (2,0) is non-diagonal. j=1: i=2, j=1. i != j (2 != 1), and i + j = 3 != 4. So non-diagonal. So (2,1) is o. Similarly for (2,3) and (2,4). So the non-diagonal characters include s, o, etc. So the set will have multiple elements. Thus, len is not 1. So output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input.\n\nn=3, input lines:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ngrid is:\n\n['wsw', 'sws', 'wsw']\n\nfor i=0, j=0 (w), j=2 (w). i=1, j=1 (w). i=2, j=0 (w), j=2 (w). So all diagonals are w. So diagonal_chars is {w}.\n\nnon-diagonal cells are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So non_diagonal_chars is {s}. So other_char is s != w. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=3, lines:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ngrid:\n\nrow 0: x p x\n\nrow 1: p x p\n\nrow 2: x p e\n\ndiagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0 (x), j=2 (x). i=1, j=1 (x). i=2, j=0 (x), j=2 (e). So diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, what about a case where the non-diagonal is empty? Not possible. For n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So code is okay.\n\nAnother case: n=3, all cells are same. Then diagonals are same, non-diagonal same. So the code returns NO, since other_char equals d_char.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'b' → returns YES.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python. Make sure that the code reads from stdin and outputs the correct answers.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from standard input. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code is written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria.

If a cell is on either of the two diagonals, its character is added to a set. If the set has more than one unique character, the grid cannot form an \"X\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, we collect all characters not on the diagonals into another set. If this set has more than one unique character or the same character as the diagonal set, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n\nThis approach ensures that both conditions for forming an \"X\" are checked efficiently with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
