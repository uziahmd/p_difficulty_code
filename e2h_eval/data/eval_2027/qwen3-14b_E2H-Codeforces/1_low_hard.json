The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. The first ring is the edge, then the next is two cells in, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. So for the i-th ring, it's based on a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we calculate the number of cells in each ring?\n\nLet me think. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the border cells) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since each corner is counted twice). Wait, no, maybe better to think as 2*(width + height) - 4. Because for a rectangle, the perimeter in cells would be (width * 2) + (height - 2)*2? No, maybe another way. Let's take a rectangle of m rows and n columns. The number of cells in the border is 2*m + 2*(n-2) = 2*(m + n - 2). Because the top and bottom rows have n cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (m-2) each. So total is 2n + 2(m-2) = 2(n + m - 2). Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each ring i, the dimensions are (w_i, h_i) where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, the i-th ring is based on the inner rectangle. But for the first ring, i=1, so the rectangle is w x h. Then the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. For the second ring, i=2, the rectangle is (w - 4*(1)) x (h - 4*(1)), and then the perimeter of that is the ring. So for each ring, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle, and sum all those perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the rectangles are valid. For example, if the original w and h are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1) for some i, the resulting dimensions are at least 3x3? Or maybe even smaller? Wait, the problem says that k is given such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me check the constraints. The input says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3 +1)/4 is 1, so floor is 1. So for k=1, the first ring is possible. For example, if min(w, h) is 7, then (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So for k=2, the second ring would be possible.\n\nWait, for the i-th ring, the rectangle size is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). So for the i-th ring, the rectangle must have at least 1 cell in each dimension. But since the problem says that k is chosen such that it's allowed, perhaps we don't have to worry about invalid cases. So for each i from 1 to k, we can compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i, h_i), and sum them all.\n\nSo the total number of cells is the sum over i=1 to k of 2*(w_i + h_i - 2), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1).\n\nWait, let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, w_i =3, h_i=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. So i=1, w=7, h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output of 28.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So for",
