    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is the edge, the second is two cells in, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. \n\nHmm. Let me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For the i-th ring, it's based on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we calculate the number of cells in that ring?\n\nWait, the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. So for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, no, maybe better to think as 2*(width + height) - 4. Because for a rectangle, the perimeter in cells would be (width * 2) + (height - 2)*2. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nFor a rectangle with width W and height H, the number of cells in the perimeter (the outer ring) is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (H-2) each. So adding those gives 2W + 2(H-2) = 2(W + H - 2). Alternatively, 2*(W + H) - 4. Yes, because 2W + 2H -4. \n\nSo for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w_i x h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, the i-th ring is the border of that rectangle. So for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). \n\nBut we need to make sure that for each i, the rectangle is valid. For example, when i increases, the dimensions decrease by 4 each time. But the problem says that k is given such that it's possible. So the input ensures that for all i up to k, the dimensions are at least 3? Or maybe not. Wait, the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me check. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for the first ring, the rectangle is 3x3. Then for the next ring, the size would be 3-4*(2-1) = 3-4= -1, which is invalid. So the input constraints ensure that for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to check that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. The first ring is the perimeter of 3x3. Which is 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. The perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 - 2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output of 28.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. First ring is 7x9: 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring is (7-4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1) = 5. So 3x5. The perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct. So the plan is:\n\nLoop for each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h -",
