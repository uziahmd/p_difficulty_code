A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to calculate how many toasts each can make, given the resources they have.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, right. For each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink. So for one toast, all n friends together need n * nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And for salt, each toast requires n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available are:\n\nDrink: k * l ml.\n\nLime slices: c * d slices.\n\nSalt: p grams.\n\nNow, for each possible number of toasts t, we need to ensure that:\n\nTotal drink required is >= t * n * nl. So t can't exceed (k*l) // (n * nl). Wait, no, wait: the total drink is k*l. Each toast requires per friend nl, so per toast, total is n * nl. So maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But since it's possible that the division isn't exact, but we can't have partial toasts. So floor division.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: each toast requires n slices. So total slices needed is t * n. So maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum t is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, yes. Because each of these three constraints limits the maximum possible t. So the answer is the minimum of the three possible maximums.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the maximum possible toasts based on drink: total_drink = k * l. Then max_t_drink = total_drink // (n * nl).\n\nSimilarly, max_t_lime = (c * d) // n.\n\nmax_t_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me check the example given.\n\nFirst example input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl=3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 /3 is 26.666, floor 26. But in the sample explanation, they say that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, wait, what's the calculation here?\n\nWait, the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nAh, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but that's because each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. So for the first example, n=3. So for 80 slices, how many toasts can you make? 80 / 3 = 26.666, which would be 26. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the note says: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. But how? Because each toast requires n slices, right?\n\nWait, in the first sample input, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check. The sample input is n=3 friends. Each toast requires 3 slices. So for 80 slices, you can make 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I got the problem statement wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. Therefore, per toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the maximum t is (c * d) // n.\n\nIn the first example, c=10, d=8. So total slices is 80. n=3. So 80//3 is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's a contradiction. So where is my mistake?\n\nWait the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". But according to my calculation, that would be 80 slices. If each toast requires 3 slices, then 80 slices would allow for 26 toasts (since 26 *3 =78 slices, 27 would need 81). But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that the per toast requirement is 1 slice. But that would be if each toast requires one slice in total, not per friend. So perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So per toast, n slices. So for example, in the first sample, 3 friends, each toast needs 3 slices. So the total slices needed for t toasts is 3t. So with 80 slices, t can be 80//3 = 26.\n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that the calculation is (c*d) divided by 1. So why is that?\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. So that's the total slices. So perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice, not per friend. But that contradicts the problem description.\n\nWait the problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So for each toast, n slices. So the total number of slices required for t toasts is t * n. So the maximum t is (c*d) // (n). So in the first example, 80 // 3 = 26. However, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would only be possible if the required per toast was 1 slice, not n. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nBut according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Wait, why is that?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which is (k*l) / (n * nl). Because 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222... but the note says 6. Wait that's impossible. Wait, what's the problem here?\n\nWait, the note says that the drink is 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends *3 ml per toast. So per toast, 3 *3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. That's a discrepancy. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the note says: the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl, so total per toast is n * nl. So the total amount of drink is k*l. So the maximum number of toasts is (k*l) // (n * nl). But in the first example, 20 / (3 * 3) = 20 /9 = 2.222, so floor 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / (3) = 6.666, so 6. So that suggests that the formula is (k*l) // (nl). Which would be 20//3 =6. But that would be if per toast, each friend needs nl, but the total per toast is nl, not n * nl. That's conflicting.\n\nSo there's a confusion here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, the total drink needed is n * nl. Because all friends are having one toast. So for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts, so total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nSo the total drink available is k * l. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut according to the note, in the first example, the drink is sufficient for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which implies that the total drink is divided by nl, not n * nl. Which suggests that the per toast is nl per friend, but the total per toast is nl. Which would be impossible unless n=1.\n\nSo clearly, there's a misunderstanding here. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the first sample note:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 ml. It is enough to make 20/3 =6 toasts. \n\nBut how? If each toast requires 3 friends *3 ml =9 ml, then 20 /9 is 2.222. But the note says that 20/3 =6. So perhaps the problem statement is different. Maybe each toast requires nl ml per friend, but per toast, each friend has one toast. So for each toast, the total drink is nl. So for example, if there are 3 friends, and they make 1 toast each, then the total drink is 3 * nl. But that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that for each toast, each friend takes nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends takes nl, so total per toast is n * nl. So for t toasts, the total is t * n * nl. \n\nBut according to the note, the sample input has:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, nl=3. \n\nSo total drink is 4*5=20. The note says that it's enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be 20 / (nl) = 6. So that would imply that per toast, the total drink is nl, not n * nl. So this suggests that the problem statement is different than what I thought.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, each friend has one toast. So for one toast, the total drink required is n * nl. For example, if there are 3 friends, each toast requires 3 * nl ml.\n\nBut according to the note, in the first example, the drink is 20 ml. The note says that it is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 20 / (nl) = 6. Since nl is 3, 20 /3 is 6.666, so 6. So that suggests that the per toast is nl, not n * nl. \n\nSo this is conflicting. What's the correct way?\n\nLet me look at the note's explanation again:\n\nIn the first sample, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. \n\nSo the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts, limes for 80, salt for 100. Then the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3, giving 2. \n\nWait, why is that? Because the friends are 3, and the min is 6. So 6 divided by 3 equals 2. So the idea is that the total number of toasts possible is 6, but each friend can make 2 toasts. \n\nWait, but that would suggest that the total number of toasts is 6, but each friend makes 2. So total toasts is 3 * 2 =6. \n\nSo the problem is that the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total drink is t * n * nl. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. So that would mean that t=6. Which would require 6 *3 *3 = 54 ml. But the drink is 20 ml. Which is impossible. \n\nThis is very confusing. There's a contradiction between the note and the calculations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total number of toasts is t, and each toast requires nl ml per friend. But the total per toast is nl ml. So for example, if there are 3 friends, and each makes one toast, the total drink is nl * 1 (per toast) * 3 friends? Or is it that each toast is per friend? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that each toast requires nl ml per person. So for one toast, each person drinks nl, so total is n * nl. But the note says that for the first sample, the drink allows 6 toasts. So 6 * 3 *3 = 54 ml. But the drink is 20 ml. Which is impossible. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the note, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters per person. But the total number of toasts is t, and each person makes exactly t toasts. So the total amount of drink is t * n * nl. \n\nBut in the first sample, the drink is 20 ml. So solving for t:\n\nt * 3 *3 ≤ 20 → t ≤ 20/(9) → 2.222, so 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. \n\nSo this suggests that the note is wrong, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. \n\nLet me read the note again. \n\nThe note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the note is saying that for each toast, the total drink per toast is nl. Not per person. \n\nWait, the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, each friend has one toast, which requires nl. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl. But the note says that 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 20 divided by nl. So this suggests that per toast, the total is nl. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters for each friend. So for one toast, each friend has one toast. So the total drink is n * nl. But the note says that the drink is 20 ml, and that allows for 20/3 =6 toasts. So 20 / (nl) = 6. So that would imply that nl is 3.333, but in the input, nl is 3. \n\nThis is not adding up. \n\nLet me look at the first sample input again. The first input line is:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nWhich corresponds to n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the note says:\n\ndrink is 4*5=20 ml. It is enough to make 20/3 =6 toasts. \n\nBut why 20/3? That would be if per toast, the drink needed is 3 ml. Which would be if each toast requires 3 ml in total. But why? \n\nIf each friend needs 3 ml per toast, and there are 3 friends, then per toast, total is 3 *3 =9 ml. So for 6 toasts, that would be 54 ml. Which is more than 20. \n\nBut according to the note, that's allowed. \n\nSo there's clearly a misunderstanding here. \n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps the problem is that each toast is made by all friends together. So for one toast, each friend drinks nl ml. But the total drink per toast is nl ml. That would be impossible, but perhaps that's the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires nl ml per person, but the total number of toasts is t. So each person makes t toasts, requiring t * nl ml. So total drink needed is n * t * nl. \n\nBut the note says that in the first example, the drink allows for 6 toasts. So:\n\nn * t * nl = 3 * t * 3 =9t ≤ 20 → t ≤ 2.222. So t is 2. But the note says it's 6. \n\nSo this suggests that the note is wrong. But that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is explaining the drink calculation as (total drink) / (nl) per toast. But that would be the case if each toast requires nl ml for all friends. \n\nSo for example, if each toast requires nl ml in total, then the maximum number of toasts is (total drink) // nl. \n\nIn the first sample, that would be 20 /3 =6.666 → 6 toasts. \n\nBut then, for each toast, each friend gets nl / n ml? That would be strange. \n\nBut according to the note, that's what they did. \n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these things. So for one toast, each friend consumes nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend consumes t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut in the note, they say that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which implies that t * nl * n = 20. \n\nSo for t=6, 3 * 6 *3 = 54, which is more than 20. \n\nThis is impossible. So what is the correct approach here? \n\nMaybe the note is wrong? No, that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total number of toasts is t, and each toast is made by all friends. So the total drink per toast is nl. \n\nBut that would be strange. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but each friend can make multiple toasts. So for each toast, each friend uses nl. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl. So total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut the note says that for the first sample, the drink allows 6 toasts. So 3 * 6 * 3 =54 >20. \n\nThis doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 =2. So the min is 6, divided by 3 gives 2. So the 6 represents the total number of toasts that can be made, and then divided by 3 to get per friend. \n\nBut that would mean that the total number of toasts is 6, and each friend makes 2 toasts. \n\nSo the total drink required is 3 friends * 2 toasts * 3 ml per toast per friend = 18 ml, which is within the 20 available. \n\nBut how is the 6 calculated? \n\nIf the total number of toasts is t_total, and each friend makes t_total / n toasts. Wait, no. If each friend makes the same number of toasts, say t, then the total number of toasts is n * t. \n\nWait, no. For example, if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is n * t? Or is it t? \n\nThis is the key confusion. \n\nLet me think: the problem says that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is t per friend, and the total across all friends is n * t. \n\nBut the resources are consumed based on the total number of toasts. \n\nFor example, for drink: each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for t toasts per friend, each friend consumes t * nl ml. Total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nFor the first sample, if each friend makes t toasts, then total drink is 3 * t * 3 =9t. The available is 20, so 9t <=20 → t <= 2.222. So t=2. Which is the sample output. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. So perhaps the note is referring to the total number of toasts across all friends. \n\nIf the total number of toasts is t_total, then each friend makes t_total / n toasts. \n\nSo for the drink, the total required is t_total * nl. Because each toast (regardless of which friend) requires nl ml. \n\nThat would be a different interpretation. \n\nSo if the problem is that for each toast, regardless of who makes it, it requires nl ml. So if there are t_total toasts, then the total drink is t_total * nl. \n\nIn this case, for the first sample, t_total = 6. Drink required is 6 *3 =18 <=20. \n\nThis would fit with the note. \n\nBut how does this fit with the problem statement? \n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for each toast that a friend makes, they need nl ml. So if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is n * t. And the total drink needed is n * t * nl. \n\nBut if the problem is that each toast requires nl ml in total, then the total drink is t_total * nl. \n\nThis is a critical ambiguity. \n\nLooking back at the note: \n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nSo the note says that the total number of toasts is 6. Which would be t_total =6. \n\nIf the drink required for t_total toasts is t_total * nl, then 6 *3 =18 <=20. \n\nBut why would the drink required be t_total * nl? That would mean that each toast requires nl ml total, not per person. \n\nBut the problem statement says that each friend needs nl per toast. \n\nThis suggests that the problem statement is ambiguous, but the note indicates that the correct calculation is:\n\nFor drink: total_drink = k * l. \n\nMaximum toasts (total) is total_drink // nl. \n\nFor lime slices: total_slices = c *d. Maximum toasts is total_slices // 1 (since each toast requires one slice, not per person). \n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Maximum toasts is total_salt // np. \n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values, divided by n. \n\nBecause each friend makes t_total / n toasts. \n\nBut why would the lime slices be per toast, not per person? \n\nLet me recheck the problem statement for the lime slices. \n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So if there are t_total toasts, and each toast is made by all friends, then for each toast, n slices are needed. So total slices needed is t_total * n. \n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be 10 * 8 = 80 slices. So if the total slices needed is t_total * n, then 80 = t_total * n → t_total = 80 / n. For the first sample, n=3, so 80 /3 =26.666. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So this suggests that the total slices needed is t_total, not t_total * n. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices are needed. So the total number of toasts is t_total. Then the total slices needed is t_total * n. \n\nIn the first sample, the total slices available is 10 *8 =80. So t_total *3 <=80 → t_total <=26.666. So 26. \n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that suggests that the total slices needed is t_total. \n\nSo this is conflicting. \n\nBut according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So the 6 comes from the drink, 80 from the limes, 100 from the salt. \n\nIf the drink calculation is total_drink // nl = 20//3 =6, then the drink allows for 6 toasts. \n\nLimes: total_slices // 1 = 80//1 =80. \n\nSalt: p // np =100//1=100. \n\nThen, the minimum is 6. But since each friend can make t_total / n toasts, the answer is 6 /3 =2. \n\nSo this suggests that the t_total is the total number of toasts across all friends, and each friend makes t_total / n toasts. \n\nBut why would the drink calculation be total_drink // nl? That would imply that each toast requires nl ml, regardless of how many friends are making it. \n\nSo for example, if there are 3 friends, and each makes 2 toasts, then the total toasts is 6. Drink required is 6 * nl =6 *3 =18. Which fits with the sample. \n\nBut how does this align with the problem statement?\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So if each friend makes t toasts, then each friend needs t * nl ml. Total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut in this scenario, t_total = n * t. So the total drink is t_total * nl. \n\nYes! Because t_total = n * t. So n * t * nl = t_total * nl. \n\nSo this suggests that the total number of toasts across all friends is t_total. Each friend makes t_total / n toasts. \n\nFor the drink, the total required is t_total * nl. \n\nFor the lime slices: each toast requires n slices (one per friend). So total slices needed is t_total * n. \n\nFor salt: each toast requires n * np grams. So total salt needed is t_total * np. \n\nWait, no. For salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So for t_total toasts, each of which involves n friends, the total salt is t_total * n * np. \n\nBut according to the note, the salt is 100 grams, np=1. So the maximum t_total is 100 / (n * np) = 100 / (3 * 1) =33.333 → 33. But the note says it's 100. \n\nThis is conflicting again. \n\nBut according to the note, the salt is enough for 100 toasts. So if the calculation is total_salt // np = 100 // 1 =100. \n\nThis suggests that the salt required is t_total * np. \n\nSo for the salt, the total required is t_total * np. \n\nSo why is that? \n\nIf each toast requires np grams per friend, then for t_total toasts, the total salt needed is t_total * n * np. \n\nBut according to the note, the calculation is p // np. \n\nSo this is very confusing. \n\nThe note says that the salt is enough for 100 toasts. In the first sample, p=100, np=1. So 100 /1 =100. \n\nBut if the total required is t_total * n * np, then 100 >= t_total * 3 * 1 → t_total <=33.333. \n\nBut the note says it's 100. \n\nSo this suggests that the salt required is t_total * np. \n\nThis implies that for each toast, the total salt required is np grams, not per friend. \n\nThis is very conflicting. \n\nGiven that the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 =2, and the sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1, it seems that the correct approach is to calculate:\n\ndrink: (k*l) // nl → 20//3=6\n\nlimes: (c*d) // 1 → 80//1=80\n\nsalt: p // np → 100//1=100\n\nthen take the minimum of these three (6), divide by n (3) → 2.\n\nSo this suggests that the correct formula for each resource is:\n\n- drink: total_drink = k*l; max_toasts = total_drink // nl\n\n- lime slices: total_slices = c*d; max_toasts = total_slices // 1\n\n- salt: total_salt = p; max_toasts = total_salt // np\n\nThen, the answer is min(drink_max, lime_max, salt_max) // n ?\n\nNo, in the sample it's min(6, 80, 100) =6, then divided by n=3, giving 2. \n\nSo this suggests that the total number of toasts across all friends is the minimum of those three values. And then each friend can make total_toasts / n toasts. \n\nBut why?\n\nLet me try to derive this from the problem statement.\n\nIf each toast requires nl ml of drink for each friend, and each friend makes t toasts, then the total drink needed is n * t * nl. \n\nBut if the total toasts across all friends is t_total = n * t, then the drink needed is t_total * nl. \n\nSo for drink, the maximum t_total is (k*l) // nl. \n\nSimilarly, for lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend, so for t_total toasts, total slices needed is t_total * n. So maximum t_total is (c*d) // n. \n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend, so total salt needed is t_total * n * np. So maximum t_total is p // (n * np). \n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of the three values of t_total, and then each friend can make t_total / n toasts. \n\nBut in this case, for the first sample:\n\ndrink: 20 // 3 =6\n\nlime: (10*8) //3 =80//3=26\n\nsalt: 100 // (3*1) =33\n\nminimum is 6. Then each friend can make 6 /3 =2 toasts. Which matches the sample. \n\nThis aligns with the note. \n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nCompute for each resource the maximum possible t_total (total number of toasts across all friends), and then the answer is the floor of (min(t_total_drink, t_total_lime, t_total_salt)) / n.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me re-calculate the first sample with this approach:\n\ndrink: t_total_drink = (k*l) // nl = (4*5)/3 =20//3=6\n\nlime: t_total_lime = (c*d) // n = (10*8)//3 =80//3=26\n\nsalt: t_total_salt = p // (n * np) =100 // (3*1) =33\n\nminimum is 6. Divide by n=3 → 2. Correct.\n\nIn the note, the explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, which is the t_total_drink. The limes are enough for 80 toasts, but that's not the t_total_lime. Wait, according to this calculation, the t_total_lime is 26. But the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. This suggests a contradiction. \n\nWait, but according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts, but according to our calculation, it's 26. How does this fit?\n\nAh, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts, but that's not the t_total_lime. It's possible that the note is using a different calculation. \n\nBut according to the correct approach, the lime calculation should be (c*d) // n, which is 80 //3=26. \n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Why? \n\nAh! Because in the note, the explanation says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts.\" But according to our calculation, the lime calculation is 80 //3 =26. \n\nThis suggests that the note is not calculating the t_total_lime correctly. \n\nBut the note is part of the problem, so we must find out why. \n\nMaybe the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nLet me recheck the note's explanation. It says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nSo according to the note, the lime calculation is 80 toasts, which is c*d =10*8=80. But according to our calculation, it should be (c*d) //n = 80//3=26. \n\nBut why is the note using c*d as the maximum toasts? \n\nThis suggests that the note is calculating the maximum number of toasts per slice, not considering the number of friends. \n\nThis implies that the correct approach for the lime is (c*d) // 1, and then divided by n. \n\nBut this is conflicting. \n\nLet me think: if the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts, then that would mean that the maximum t_total is 80. But how?\n\nIf each toast requires one slice, then for t_total toasts, you need t_total slices. So the maximum t_total is c*d =80. \n\nBut why would each toast require one slice? That would be if each toast requires one slice in total, not per friend. \n\nSo this suggests that the problem statement has a different requirement for the lime slices. \n\nLet me re-read the problem statement for the lime slices:\n\neach friend needs a slice of lime. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. \n\nSo for t_total toasts, the total slices needed is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available from the bottles.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available from the limes.\n   - **Salt**: Use the given amount of salt directly.\n\n2. **Determine Maximum Possible Toasts**:\n   - **Drink**: Determine how many toasts can be made with the available drink, considering each toast requires `nl` milliliters per friend.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Determine how many toasts can be made with the available lime slices, considering each toast requires one slice per friend.\n   - **Salt**: Determine how many toasts can be made with the available salt, considering each toast requires `np` grams per friend.\n\n3. **Compute Minimum Constraints**:\n   - The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the minimum of the possible toasts calculated from each resource.
