A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible value determined by the available resources divided by the number of friends, right?\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt. But since there are n friends, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend makes one toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs their own portion. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl ml. Because each friend uses nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (one per friend), and n * np grams of salt (each friend uses np grams).\n\nSo the total number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute, and then take the minimum of those.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\nDrink: total available is k * l ml. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the maximum possible toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, if it's not divisible, we take the floor division.\n\nLime slices: total slices is c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So maximum toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: total is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. Drink total is 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. For example, in the first sample, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation where they said 20/3 =6 toasts? Wait, wait, the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is 4*5=20 ml. Then for each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Oh wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". Wait why 20 /3? Because maybe per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml, so total per toast is n * nl ml. So the total number of toasts is (total drink) / (n * nl). But in the first example, total drink is 20. n is 3, nl is 3. So 3 * 3 =9 per toast. 20 /9 is 2.222, which is 2. But the note says 20 /3 =6. That suggests that perhaps I have the formula wrong. So what's the correct way here?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why? Let me recheck the note. The note says that the friends have 20 ml, which is enough for 6 toasts. How?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the per toast per friend is nl ml. So for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total is n * nl ml. But the note says that 20 / 3 = 6. So 20 divided by 3 gives 6.666, which is 6 when floored. But that would mean that the total per toast is 3 ml (for all friends?), but that's conflicting with the problem statement. Wait, maybe I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs their own portion. So, if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. So total drink needed is n * t * nl ml. Because each of the n friends makes t toasts, each requiring nl ml.\n\nBut the total available drink is k * l. So:\n\nn * t * nl <= k * l\n\nSimilarly for the other resources:\n\nt * n <= c * d (because each toast requires n slices, one per friend)\n\nand t * n * np <= p.\n\nSo solving for t:\n\nt <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nt <= (c*d) / n \n\nt <= p/(n * np)\n\nSo the maximum possible t is the minimum of these three values, floored.\n\nSo in the first example:\n\nk*l = 4*5=20, n=3, nl=3.\n\nso 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222... so floor is 2.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would imply that the formula is (k*l) / (nl) divided by n? Or perhaps I have the formula wrong.\n\nWait the note says:\n\nIn the first sample, the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But according to the formula I thought, it's 20/(3*3) = 2.222, which is 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nLet me re-examine the note's explanation.\n\nNote says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100/1=100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\n\nWait, why is the drink enough for 6 toasts? How is that calculated?\n\nAh! Oh! Oh! Because the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But why? Because per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total drink is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 = 2.222. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So that suggests that the per toast is 3 ml total. Which would be if each toast requires nl ml total, not per friend. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So for one toast, total is n * nl ml. But in the note, they say that 20 ml is enough for 6 toasts. So 6 * (n * nl) = 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml, but the total is 20. Which is impossible. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nWait let me re-read the problem statement again:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\nAh! So, perhaps for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So if they make t toasts, then each friend drinks t * nl ml. So total drink needed is n * t * nl ml. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut in the note, the sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n=3, k=4, l=5, so total drink is 20 ml. nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for t toasts, each friend uses 3t ml. Total for all friends is 3 * 3t = 9t ml. Which must be <= 20. So 9t <=20 → t ≤ 2.222. So t=2. Which is what the sample output is. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be 6 * 3 =18 ml. Which is possible. But that would imply that for each toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would mean that per toast, all friends together use 3 ml. Which would be that per toast, each friend uses 1 ml. But that's not the case.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nSo according to the note, the drink is sufficient for 6 toasts. But how? Because 6 toasts would require 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml. Which is way more than 20. So this suggests that there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml, but the total for all toasts is that each friend can have t toasts, so total per friend is t * nl. So the total drink is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is 20 ml, and that's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / 3 = 6.666, but that's 6 when floored. How does that happen? Well, 20 / 3 is 6.666, but that would be the case if the per toast is 3 ml. So for example, if each toast requires 3 ml total, then 20 /3 is 6 toasts. But that would be if each toast requires 3 ml for all friends combined. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. But according to the problem statement, nl is 3, so that's not the case.\n\nSo what's the mistake here? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these things. So for one toast, each of the n friends uses nl ml. So total for one toast is n * nl ml. For t toasts, total is n * t * nl ml. Which must be less than or equal to the total available drink.\n\nBut in the note, the sample input says that the drink is 20 ml, and it is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So that suggests that the total per toast is 3 ml. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend uses 1 ml. But the problem says that nl is 3. So why is the note saying that?\n\nAh! Wait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But that would be if the total per toast is 3 ml. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend needs nl = 1 ml. But in the input, nl is 3. So this seems to be a contradiction.\n\nWait looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample input line 1 is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'.\n\nSo the parameters are:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that for each toast, the total drink required is 3 ml. So for 6 toasts, it's 6 * 3 = 18 ml. Which is under 20. So why is that?\n\nThis suggests that the problem statement may have a different calculation. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nMaybe the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for each toast, the total drink required is nl ml. But that would mean that for one toast, all friends together use nl ml. Which would be impossible unless nl is divided by n. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total drink per friend is t * nl, and for all friends, it's n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut then the sample explanation is wrong. Which is not possible. So I must be missing something here.\n\nWait let's look at the note's explanation again. It says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So 20 is the total drink. So 20 / 3 is 6.666. So the note is taking the total drink divided by nl. Which is 20 / 3 = 6.666. But why?\n\nAh! Maybe the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the number of toasts per friend is t. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml. So for all friends, it's n * t * nl ml. But the total available is k * l. So:\n\nt = (k * l) / (n * nl)\n\nBut in the sample, that's 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 = 2.222. So floor is 2.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if the denominator was nl, not n * nl. So why is that?\n\nThis is a contradiction. How can the sample explanation be correct? Let me check the sample input again.\n\nIn the first sample input, the output is 2. Which is the minimum of 6, 80, 100 divided by 3. So according to the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts, limes for 80, salt for 100. Then the answer is min(6,80,100) / 3 = 2. Which suggests that the drink is sufficient for 6 toasts, but then divided by 3 friends. So why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem is that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts is t. So for each toast, each friend uses their own portion. So the total drink needed is n * t * nl. But the note says that the drink is sufficient for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which implies that t=6. Then n*t*nl =3 *6*3=54. Which is larger than 20. So that can't be.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. How can the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but the actual calculation shows that it's not?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is explaining that the drink is sufficient for 6 toasts, but then because there are 3 friends, the answer is 6 divided by 3 equals 2. But that would imply that the total number of toasts is 6, and each friend makes 2 toasts. So that would be t=2, and the total drink used is 3 * 2 * 3 = 18 ml, which is within 20.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So why is that?\n\nAh! Maybe the note is using the term \"toasts\" incorrectly. Perhaps the note is referring to the total number of toasts across all friends. But the problem requires that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is n*t. But the note may be using \"toasts\" as the number per friend.\n\nBut that's unclear. Let me try to re-express the problem.\n\nLet me think of the sample explanation again. The note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So 20 divided by 3 is 6.666. So the note is taking the total drink divided by nl. Which would be the number of toasts per friend. Because, if each friend makes t toasts, then each needs t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. So solving for t:\n\nt = (k*l) / (n * nl).\n\nBut in the sample, this is 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 = 2.222, so t=2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be if t=6, but that would require 3*6*3=54 ml, which is more than 20. So this is impossible.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So 20/3 is 6.666, which would be the number of toasts per friend if the total drink is divided by nl. So for example, if each friend makes t toasts, then the total drink is n * t * nl. So solving for t:\n\nt = (k*l) / (n * nl) = 20 / (3 * 3) = 2.222.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be if the total drink is divided by nl, and then divided by something else. So why is that?\n\nI think there's a mistake in the note's explanation. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note refers to the number of toasts as the total number of toasts across all friends, and then divides by the number of friends to get the per-friend count.\n\nFor example, suppose that the total number of toasts possible is T, then each friend makes T/n toasts. But that would require that T is divisible by n. But in the sample, the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So if T is 6, then each friend makes 2 toasts (6/3=2), which matches the sample output. So how is T computed?\n\nFor T toasts total, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink. Because for each toast, each of the n friends uses nl ml. So total drink is T * n * nl. Wait no. If T is the total number of toasts across all friends, then for each toast, one friend makes it. So for each toast, the drink is nl ml. So total drink is T * nl. But this would be the case if each toast is made by one friend. But the problem says that all friends make the same number of toasts. So if each friend makes t toasts, then total toasts is n * t. And for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nSo the total drink required is n * t * nl. Which must be <= k*l.\n\nSo for the sample, if t is 2, then total drink is 3*2*3 = 18 <=20. Which is okay.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be if T is 6, then t = T / n = 6 /3=2. So the note is saying that the drink is enough for T=6 total toasts, which would be possible if T * nl <= k*l. So T * nl = 6 *3=18 <=20. Yes. So that makes sense. So the note is calculating T as (k*l) // nl. Which is 20//3=6. Then T is the total number of toasts across all friends. Then, since each friend must make the same number of toasts, the number per friend is T//n. Which is 6//3=2. So that's the answer.\n\nBut then how do we calculate T? T is the minimum between:\n\n- (k*l) // nl → total toasts based on drink\n\n- (c*d) // 1 → total toasts based on lime slices (each toast needs 1 slice per friend, but since T is total toasts, each toast requires one slice. Or wait, no. For each toast, each friend uses one slice. No, that's not right. If each toast requires one slice per friend, then for T total toasts (each friend makes t toasts), then the total number of slices required is T * 1 per toast? Or per toast per friend?\n\nWait, if each friend makes t toasts, then each toast requires one slice per friend. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. For T total toasts (each friend makes t toasts, T = n * t), the total number of slices needed is T * n slices? No. Wait, no. For each toast, you need n slices. Because each of the n friends makes one toast. So for T toasts, which is n*t, the number of toasts is T = n*t. So for each toast, n slices are needed. So total slices needed is T * n slices? Or is it T * 1 slices per toast? No. For each toast, n slices are needed. So for T toasts, the total slices needed is T * n. But that can't be, because for example, if each friend makes t toasts, then for each toast, there are n slices. So for t toasts per friend, each friend makes t toasts, which would require t slices. So total slices is n * t. Which is T slices (since T = n * t). So the total slices needed is T.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.\n\nEach toast requires each friend to have a slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. If there are T total toasts, then the number of slices needed is T * n. Because each toast requires n slices. But that would be if each toast is made by all friends at once. But that's not the case. For example, if there are 3 friends and each makes 2 toasts, then the total number of toasts is 3 * 2 = 6. For each toast, each friend has one slice. So for each of the 6 toasts, there are 3 slices needed. So total slices is 6 * 3 = 18 slices. Which would be the case if the total slices is T * n.\n\nBut that's a lot of slices. However, in the sample input, the total slices available is c*d =10*8=80. So for the sample, T=6 toasts, then slices needed is 6 *3=18, which is less than 80. So that's okay.\n\nBut then, the total slices needed is T * n. So the maximum T allowed by the slices is (c*d) // n.\n\nWait, but in the note, the sample says that the limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts. Which would be if T is 80. Then slices needed is T * n = 80 * 3 = 240. But the available slices are 80. So that's impossible. So this suggests that the note's explanation is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is considering that for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for each toast, n slices are needed. So for T total toasts, the number of slices needed is T * n. But the available slices is c*d. So T can be at most (c*d) // n.\n\nIn the sample, c*d = 80. n=3. So (80) // 3 = 26. So T can be up to 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that T is 80. Which would require 80 * 3 = 240 slices, but available is 80. So that's impossible.\n\nSo this is very confusing. How can the note say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts? Let's check the sample input again.\n\nSample input: c=10, d=8. So total slices is 10*8=80. For each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. So for T toasts, total slices needed is T * n. So the maximum T allowed by the slices is (c*d) // n = 80 // 3 = 26. So the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That would mean that the T is 80, which would require 80 * 3 = 240 slices. But the available is 80. This doesn't add up.\n\nBut the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts\". So how is that possible?\n\nAh! Oh! Maybe I have the formula wrong. Maybe for each toast, each friend needs a slice, but the total number of toasts per friend is t. So for each friend, they need t slices. So total slices is n * t. And the total slices available is c*d. So t can be up to (c*d) // n.\n\nIn the sample, c*d=80, n=3. So t can be up to 80//3=26. Which is 26. So the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But that would be if the total slices is 80, and each toast requires one slice. So t is 80. But that would require n * t = 3 * 80 = 240 slices, which is way more than available. So this doesn't make sense.\n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So how?\n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Which is the total number of slices. So if each toast requires one slice, then the maximum number of toasts is 80. But that would be if each toast requires one slice. But that would mean that each toast is made by one friend. But the problem states that all friends make the same number of toasts. So if each toast is made by one friend, then each friend makes t toasts, and the total number of toasts is n * t. But the total number of slices needed is n * t, since each toast requires one slice. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut in the sample, c*d=80, n=3. So t = 80//3 = 26. So the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be if each toast requires one slice, and there are 80 slices. So the maximum number of toasts is 80. But that would be if each toast is made by one person, and each person makes 80/n toasts. But that would require that the total number of toasts is 80, which would be n * t = 80 → t = 80 /n. So for n=3, t=26.666, floor to 26.\n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts, which is the total number of toasts. So that would imply that the maximum T is 80, and then t = T / n = 80 /3 = 26.666, floor to 26.\n\nSo in the note's explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts (T=80), and the drink is enough for 6 toasts (T=6), and the salt is enough for 100 toasts (T=100). Then the minimum of these is 6, and dividing by n=3 gives 2 toasts per friend.\n\nSo this suggests that for each resource, the maximum T is calculated as:\n\nFor drink: T_drink = (k*l) // nl\n\nFor limes: T_lime = (c*d) // 1\n\nFor salt: T_salt = p // np\n\nThen the overall T is min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt), and then the number of toasts per friend is T // n.\n\nWait, this would explain the sample. Let's check:\n\nSample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nT_drink = (4*5) // 3 = 20 //3 =6.\n\nT_lime = (10*8) // 1 = 80.\n\nT_salt = 100 // 1 = 100.\n\nT = min(6, 80, 100) =6.\n\nThen toasts per friend is 6 //3 =2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAh! So this is the correct approach. So the key is that for each resource, the maximum total number of toasts (T) that can be made is determined by:\n\n- Drink: total drink is k*l. Each toast requires nl ml. So T_drink = (k*l) // nl.\n\n- Limes: total slices is c*d. Each toast requires 1 slice. So T_lime = (c*d) // 1.\n\n- Salt: total salt is p. Each toast requires np grams. So T_salt = p // np.\n\nThen, the overall T is min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt). Then, since each friend must make the same number of toasts, the number per friend is T // n.\n\nBecause T is the total number of toasts across all friends, and each friend makes T/n toasts. But since T must be divisible by n? No, because T is the minimum of the three values, which may not be divisible by n. So the number of toasts per friend is floor(T / n).\n\nWait in the sample, T is 6, n is 3. 6/3=2, which is integer. But if T was 7, then 7//3=2.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nCalculate T_drink = (k*l) // nl\n\nT_lime = (c*d) // 1\n\nT_salt = p // np\n\nT = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n\nresult = T // n\n\nSo this explains the sample. Let's verify:\n\nFor the first sample:\n\nT_drink = 20//3=6\n\nT_lime = 80//1=80\n\nT_salt = 100//1=100\n\nT =6\n\nresult =6//3=2 → correct.\n\nNow, for the limes: why is T_lime = c*d // 1? Because each toast requires one slice. So total number of toasts T can't exceed the total number of slices. So T_lime = c*d.\n\nYes. Because each toast requires one slice. So for T toasts, you need T slices. So T can be up to c*d.\n\nAh! That's the key. Earlier I was thinking that each toast requires n slices, but now it seems that each toast requires one slice. But how?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. So for T total toasts, the number of slices needed is T * n.\n\nBut then, the T_lime would be (c*d) // n. But in the sample, c*d is 80, n=3, so T_lime =80//3=26. But the note says that T_lime is 80. So this is conflicting.\n\nSo what's the correct way? According to the note, T_lime is 80. Which implies that for T toasts, the number of slices needed is T. So each toast requires one slice. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nThis is very confusing. But according to the note, the T_lime is 80, which is c*d. So the calculation for T_lime is c*d.\n\nWhich would imply that each toast requires one slice. So how does that align with the problem statement?\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime per toast. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. For T toasts, n*T slices are needed. So T_lime = (c*d) // n.\n\nBut in the sample, that would be 80//3=26. But the note says that T_lime is 80. So this suggests that the note is wrong, or the problem statement is different.\n\nBut according to the note, the sample explanation is correct. So we have to follow the logic that leads to the sample being correct.\n\nSo according to the sample explanation, the T_lime is c*d. So the number of toasts is limited by the total number of slices. So each toast requires one slice. But how does that fit with the problem statement?\n\nMaybe the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice per friend. But that's not what the note says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice per friend, but the note is wrong. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice per friend, but the note is explaining that the limes are enough for 80 toasts, which would mean that each toast requires one slice. But that would imply that the number of slices is sufficient for T toasts, where T is the number of toasts. But then, each toast requires n slices. So T must be such that T * n <= c*d. So T <= (c*d)/n.\n\nBut in the sample, that would be 80/3=26.666, so 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts, which would imply that T is 80. So this is a contradiction.\n\nThis is very confusing. But the only way to get the sample to work is to assume that for each resource, the calculation is:\n\nDrink: total_ml = k*l, per toast is nl → T_drink = total_ml // nl\n\nLimes: total_slices = c*d, per toast is 1 → T_lime = total_slices // 1 = total_slices\n\nSalt: total_salt = p, per toast is np → T_salt = total_salt // np\n\nThen T = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt), and result is T // n.\n\nBut why would the limes require 1 slice per toast? According to the problem statement, each friend needs a slice per toast. So for one toast, n slices are needed. So for T toasts, n*T slices are needed. So T_lime = (c*d) // n.\n\nBut in the sample, that would be 80//3=26. So T would be min(6, 26, 100) =6. Result is 6//3=2. Which matches the sample. So this would also work.\n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would suggest that T_lime is 80. But according to this calculation, it's 26. So why is the note saying 80?\n\nThis is a problem. How to resolve this.\n\nLet me re-examine the note's explanation again:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt for each friend. The goal is to ensure that all friends make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available from the bottles.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available from the limes cut.\n   - **Salt**: Use the given grams of salt directly.\n\n2. **Determine Maximum Possible Toasts**:\n   - **Drink**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the drink available. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters per friend, so for `n` friends, it's `n * nl` milliliters per toast.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Each toast requires one slice per friend, so for `n` friends, it's `n` slices per toast.\n   - **Salt**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the salt available. Each toast requires `np` grams per friend, so for `n` friends, it's `n * np` grams per toast.\n\n3. **Compute Minimum Possible Toasts**:\n   - The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Thus, we compute the minimum possible toasts from each resource and then divide by the number of friends to ensure each friend makes the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    values = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = values\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Maximum toasts based on drink: total_drink // (n * nl)\n    toast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Maximum toasts based on lime slices: total_lime_slices // n\n    toast_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    \n    # Calculate maximum toasts based on salt\n    total_salt = p\n    toast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n    \n    # Find the minimum of the three\n    min_toast = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n    \n    # Output the result\n    print(min_toast)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. This is divided by the total milliliters required per toast for all friends.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime. This is divided by the number of friends since each toast requires one slice per friend.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total amount of salt is divided by the total grams required per toast for all friends.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum value from the three resource constraints is taken, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts, which is then printed as the result.",
