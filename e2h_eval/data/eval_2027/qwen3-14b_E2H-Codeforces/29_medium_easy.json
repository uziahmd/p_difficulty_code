Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. But directly applying each substitution step by step would be computationally expensive, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If each substitution replaces a digit with a longer string, the string could become huge, which would be impossible to handle directly.\n\nSo, I need a smarter way to track the substitutions without actually building the entire string each time. Hmm. Let me think about this. \n\nThe key observation here is that each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can track how each original digit contributes to the final value. Wait, but the substitutions are applied in order. For example, if there's a query \"2→00\" followed by \"0→1\", then the original 2 would first become 00, then each 0 becomes 1, resulting in 11. So the order of processing is important. \n\nWait, but if I model each digit's transformation as a function, then for each digit, I can track what it gets replaced with. However, since substitutions can overwrite previous ones, I need to process the queries in order and keep track of the current replacement for each digit. But the problem is that when a substitution is done, all occurrences of a digit in the current string are replaced. However, if we have multiple substitutions for the same digit, only the latest one matters. \n\nBut here's the thing: when processing the queries, each substitution affects the current state of the string. However, directly replacing the digits in the string would be too slow if done naively. So, perhaps we can model the substitutions using some kind of dynamic programming approach, where for each digit, we track what it represents in terms of the final value. \n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have a mapping for each digit (from 0-9) that represents what it will be replaced with. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each query, we update the mapping for di to ti. But how does this help us compute the final value?\n\nWait, but the problem is that when you replace a digit with a string, that string may contain digits that have their own mappings. So, if we process the queries in reverse order, maybe we can compute the value for each digit. Wait, no. Because substitutions are applied in order. For example, if a query replaces '2' with '00', then later a query replaces '0' with '1', then the '2' would be replaced with '00' first, and then each '0' is replaced with '1'. So the final result for '2' would be '11'. Therefore, the order of processing is important. \n\nSo, perhaps we can model for each digit, what it expands to after all substitutions. However, if during substitution, a digit is replaced by another string, which may contain digits that are later substituted. So, the substitution process is not straightforward. \n\nWait, but the substitutions are applied in sequence. Each query replaces all instances of di in the current string with ti. So, if we process the queries in order, and for each query, we can track the current representation of each digit. \n\nBut how can we model this? Let me think of it as a tree. Each digit can be replaced by some other string. For example, suppose initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when we process a query like 'd -> t', we need to update the mapping for d to t. However, when t contains digits, those digits might themselves have mappings. But since the substitution is applied in order, when we replace d with t, we need to make sure that any subsequent substitutions on digits in t are handled correctly. \n\nWait, but once a substitution is done, the current string is modified. So, for example, if we first replace '2' with '00', then later replace '0' with '1', then the initial '2's are replaced with '00's, and then the '0's are replaced with '1's. So, the final expansion of '2' is '11'. \n\nThis suggests that the substitution for a digit depends on the substitutions that happen after it. So, if we process the queries in reverse order, and for each digit, track what it expands to. Wait, maybe that's a way. Let me think: \n\nSuppose we start from the end of the queries and work backwards. For each digit, we can compute its final expansion. For example, suppose the last query is 'd -> t'. Then, any occurrence of d in the original string would be replaced with t. But if t contains digits that are later processed (i.e., after this query), then those digits would have already been processed. Wait, no. Because if we process queries in reverse order, then the first query we process (in reverse) is the last original query. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the queries are:\n\n1. 2 → 00\n\n2. 0 → 1\n\nProcessing them in reverse order would be first processing 0 → 1, then 2 → 00. \n\nBut in reality, the substitution order is first 2 → 00, then 0 → 1. So, the 0s in the first substitution are replaced by 1s. \n\nIf we process in reverse order, how can we model this? \n\nFor each digit, we need to know what it expands to. Let's say we have a map for each digit, which gives the expansion. Initially, each digit's expansion is itself. Then, for each query in reverse order, if the query is di → ti, then we need to replace di's expansion with ti's expansion. Wait, but ti's expansion would be the expansion of ti's digits. \n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose that we process the queries in reverse order, and for each query, we update the expansion of di. For example, suppose that after processing all queries, the expansion of a digit d is the string that it would be replaced with. But when processing a query di → ti, which comes before other queries in the original order, but we're processing in reverse, so this query comes after others. \n\nWait, maybe the idea is that for each query, when we process it, we need to make sure that the ti is expanded according to the substitutions that were made after this query. Because when we apply the substitution, the ti is processed in the current state. So, if we process queries in reverse order, then when we handle a query di → ti, the ti's digits have already been processed (since the queries are processed in reverse). Therefore, we can compute the expansion of ti as the expansion of each of its digits. \n\nSo, for example, let's take the example where the queries are first 2 → 00, then 0 → 1. Processing in reverse order, first we process 0 → 1. Then, we process 2 → 00. For the 2's expansion, we need to replace 00 with the expansion of 0, which is 1. So 00 would expand to 11. So the expansion of 2 is 11. \n\nYes! That seems right. So, the idea is that when processing a query di → ti, the ti is already expanded according to all the substitutions that come after this query. Therefore, for each query, we can compute the expansion of di as the ti string with each of its characters replaced by their current expansions. \n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Initialize a dictionary (let's call it expand) where expand[d] is the string that digit d will be expanded into. Initially, for each digit d, expand[d] = d.\n\n- Process the queries in reverse order. For each query, which is di → ti, we need to set expand[di] to the expansion of ti. But how to compute the expansion of ti? Well, ti is a string of digits. For each character in ti, we replace it with expand[char], and concatenate them. So, for example, if ti is '00' and expand['0'] is '1', then the expansion of ti is '11'.\n\n- Once all queries are processed, the original string s is processed by replacing each of its digits with their expand values, then compute the number mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the substitutions are applied in the order of the queries. So, for example, if a query replaces di with ti, and then another query replaces a digit in ti with something else, that would affect the expansion. But by processing the queries in reverse order, we can build up the expansion for each digit. Because when we process a query, the ti has already been expanded according to all later substitutions. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, for example, in the original example where the first query is 2 → 00, then 0 → 1. Processing in reverse, first process 0 → 1, which sets expand['0'] to '1'. Then, process 2 → 00. The ti is '00', which is replaced with expand['0'] + expand['0'] = '1' + '1' = '11'. So expand['2'] is now '11'. Thus, the original string's 2s would expand to '11'.\n\nThis approach seems correct. \n\nOnce we have the expand map, we can process the original string s by replacing each character with their expand values. However, the problem is that the original string can be up to 1e5 characters, and each expansion can be up to ... well, if each substitution replaces a digit with a long string, the total length could be very large. However, since we need to compute the number mod 1e9+7, we can't process the entire string as a string. Instead, we need to compute the value as we go, using modular arithmetic. \n\nBut how? Let's think. For example, if the expanded string is '123', the value is 123 mod MOD. But if the expanded string is built by concatenating different parts, we can compute the value incrementally. For example, if we have a current value V, and we append a new string S, then the new value is (V * 10^len(S) + value_of_S) mod MOD. \n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently? Because for each digit in the original string, we have to expand it into a string, and then compute the contribution of that expansion to the overall value. However, if we can precompute for each digit's expansion, two things:\n\n- The value of the expansion mod MOD.\n\n- The length of the expansion (number of digits), because when appending, we need to multiply the current value by 10^length_of_new_part.\n\nBut wait, the expansion of each digit is a string. So, for example, if a digit 'd' expands to a string S, then the value of S is val[d], and the length is len[d]. \n\nSo, when processing the original string s, for each character c in s, we can take the current value, multiply it by 10^len[c], add val[c], and take mod MOD. \n\nBut how to compute 10^len[c] mod MOD? Well, we can precompute for each digit's expansion, the length and the value. \n\nBut how do we compute val and len for each digit's expansion? Because the expansion of a digit is built from the expansions of other digits. \n\nLet me think. For example, when processing a query di → ti, we need to compute the expansion of ti. Which is the concatenation of the expansions of each character in ti. So, the value of ti's expansion is (value of first character's expansion) * 10^{length of rest} + ... etc. \n\nBut this can be computed incrementally. For example, for the expansion of ti, which is the concatenation of t1, t2, ..., tn, where each ti is the expansion of a character. The value of the entire expansion is:\n\nvalue = 0\n\nfor each char in ti:\n\n    value = value * 10 + (value of char's expansion)\n\nBut since we need to compute this mod MOD, we can do that. Also, the length is the sum of the lengths of each char's expansion. \n\nSo, for each digit, we can track two things:\n\n- The value of the expansion mod MOD.\n\n- The length of the expansion (number of digits).\n\nTherefore, during the processing of the queries (in reverse order), for each query di → ti, we can compute the value and length of ti's expansion as follows:\n\n- For each character in ti, we look up its current value and length. \n\n- Then, we compute the value of ti's expansion as the concatenation of these characters' expansions. \n\nSo, for example, if ti is 'ab', and a's expansion has value v_a and length l_a, and b's expansion has value v_b and length l_b, then the value of 'ab' is (v_a * 10^{l_b} + v_b) mod MOD. The length is l_a + l_b.\n\nBut how do we compute 10^{l_b} mod MOD? Well, we can precompute powers of 10 mod MOD up to the maximum possible length. However, since the maximum possible length can be very large (like 1e5 * 1e5?), but given that the sum of lengths of ti across queries is 1e5, maybe we can compute the necessary exponents on the fly using modular exponentiation. \n\nWait, but for each step, when building the value of ti's expansion, which is the concatenation of the expansions of each character in ti, we can compute it incrementally. Let's see:\n\nInitialize current_value = 0 and current_length = 0.\n\nFor each character in ti:\n\n    current_value = (current_value * pow(10, len[char], MOD) + val[char]) % MOD\n\n    current_length += len[char]\n\nSo, for example, for the first character, current_value is val[char], current_length is len[char]. For the second character, multiply the current_value by 10^len[char], add val[char], etc. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for each ti, we can compute the value and length of its expansion by processing each character in ti and using the existing val and len of each character. \n\nTherefore, during the reverse processing of the queries, for each query, we can compute the new value and length for the di's expansion. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each digit (0-9) their current value and length. Initially, value is the digit itself, length is 1.\n\n2. Process each query in reverse order. For each query (di → ti):\n\n   a. Compute the value and length of ti's expansion. This is done by iterating through each character in ti, and using the current value and length of that character.\n\n   b. Update the value and length for di to be the computed value and length from ti's expansion.\n\n3. Once all queries are processed, process the original string s. For each character in s, we take its value and length, and compute the overall value of the entire string.\n\nBut how to compute the overall value of the entire string? Again, we can do it incrementally. \n\nInitialize total_value = 0 and total_length = 0.\n\nFor each character c in s:\n\n    total_value = (total_value * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n\n    total_length += len[c]\n\nBut wait, the total_length isn't needed anymore, except for the calculation of the exponents. However, since we are processing each character in s, and for each character, we use the current value and length of that character. \n\nBut the way we compute the total_value is similar to how we compute ti's expansion. \n\nSo, for example, if the original string is '123', and each character's expansion is '1', '2', '3', then the total value is 123 mod MOD. If the expansion of '1' is '11', '2' is '22', '3' is '33', then the total value is 112233 mod MOD. \n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nInitialize for each digit d in 0-9:\n\nval[d] = int(d)\n\nlen[d] = 1\n\nProcess queries in reverse order:\n\nfor each query in reversed(queries):\n\n    di, ti = parse the query\n\n    compute the value and length of ti by processing each character in ti:\n\n        temp_val = 0\n\n        temp_len = 0\n\n        for c in ti:\n\n            temp_val = (temp_val * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n\n            temp_len += len[c]\n\n        set val[di] = temp_val\n\n        len[di] = temp_len\n\nOnce all queries are processed, process the original string s:\n\nres = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    res = (res * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n\nreturn res\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? The problem says that leading zeros are ignored. However, the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string. Wait, the note says:\n\n\"Note that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\"\n\nWait, but when computing the number, leading zeros are ignored. For example, if the string is '00123', then the number is 123. However, the problem says that when you represent s as a decimal number, you ignore leading zeros. However, the problem also says that if the string is empty, the number is zero.\n\nBut how to handle leading zeros in our approach? Because our code computes the value of the entire string as a number, including leading zeros. However, the actual value is that leading zeros are not considered. So, for example, the string '00123' would be treated as 123, but our code would compute 00123 mod MOD as 123 mod MOD. Which is correct. Wait, but 00123 is 123, so the code would compute it correctly. Because when we compute the value as (res * 10^len + val) mod MOD, the leading zeros are part of the string, but the actual numeric value is the same as the number formed by the digits. \n\nWait, for example, if the string is '00', then the value is 0. If the string is '0', it's 0. So the code would compute the correct value. Because the code treats the entire string as a number, including leading zeros. However, the problem says that leading zeros are ignored. But in reality, when you convert a string to a number, leading zeros are ignored. However, the code's approach of calculating the value as the numeric value of the string (including leading zeros) is equivalent to the problem's requirement. Because the numeric value of '00123' is 123, and the code would compute that. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the code's approach is to compute the numeric value of the entire string. For example, if the string is '00123', the code would compute 00123 mod MOD, which is 123 mod MOD. Which is correct. So the code would correctly handle leading zeros. Because the way we compute the value is exactly the same as converting the string to a number. So, even if the string has leading zeros, the code would compute the correct value. \n\nTherefore, the code doesn't need to handle leading zeros specially. Because the way of building the value is the same as the numeric value of the string. \n\nSo, the code is correct. \n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this in Python. \n\nBut how to handle the pow(10, len[c], MOD) part? Because for each character in ti, we need to calculate 10^len[c] mod MOD. However, len[c] can be up to ... Well, for each substitution, the length can be up to ... Well, the sum of the lengths of all ti is 1e5, but during processing, the len for each digit can be up to that. So, for each step, when we compute temp_val, we need to calculate 10^len[c], where len[c] is the length of the expansion of the current character. \n\nBut calculating pow(10, len[c], MOD) each time could be expensive if done naively. However, in Python, pow(10, exponent, MOD) is optimized. \n\nBut in our code, for each character in ti, we need to compute 10^len[c] mod MOD. However, len[c] is the length of the expansion of that character. \n\nSo, during the processing of the queries, for each query, when building the temp_val for ti, we need to compute for each character in ti:\n\npow(10, len[c], MOD). \n\nBut how can we compute that? Well, for each character in ti, we can get the len[c] and compute the exponent. \n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nMOD = 10**9+7\n\ns = input string\n\nn = number of queries\n\nqueries = list of queries\n\nWe can preinitialize val and len for each digit. \n\nBut digits are 0-9. So:\n\nval = [0]*10\n\nlen_ = [0]*10\n\nfor d in 0..9:\n\n    val[d] = d\n\n    len_[d] = 1\n\nThen, process each query in reverse order. \n\nBut how to parse the queries? Each query is a string like \"2->00\". We can split it into di and ti. For example, split on '->', which would give di and ti. \n\nBut in Python, for each query string, we can split it into parts. \n\nOnce we have the di and ti, for the current query, we process ti as follows. \n\nBut for each character in ti, we need to get the current val and len_ of that character. \n\nSo, for example, ti is a string. For each character in ti, say c, which is a digit, we look up val[int(c)] and len_[int(c)]. \n\nThen, compute temp_val and temp_len as described. \n\nOnce that is done, we set val[int(di)] = temp_val and len_[int(di)] = temp_len. \n\nOnce all queries are processed, process the original string s. \n\nFor each character in s, we get the current val and len_ of that character, and compute the total value. \n\nBut again, for each character in s, we need to compute pow(10, len[c], MOD) for the previous total. \n\nSo, the code for processing the original string is:\n\nres = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    digit = int(c)\n\n    res = (res * pow(10, len_[digit], MOD) + val[digit]) % MOD\n\nreturn res\n\nBut wait, the initial res is 0. For example, if the first character is '1', then res = 0 * 10^len_1 + val_1. Which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, let's test this approach against the examples. \n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: '123123', n=1, query '2->00'\n\nProcessing queries in reverse order: only one query. \n\nInitially, val is [0,1,2,...9], len_ is [1,1,...1].\n\nProcessing the query 2->00. \n\nti is '00'. For each character in ti (0 and 0):\n\nFirst character is 0. len_[0] is 1. val[0] is 0. \n\ntemp_val starts at 0. \n\nFirst character: temp_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. temp_len = 1.\n\nSecond character: 0. temp_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. temp_len = 2. \n\nSo, val[2] is set to 0, len_[2] is 2. \n\nThen, processing the original string '123123':\n\nEach character is processed:\n\nOriginal s is '1','2','3','1','2','3'.\n\nFor each character:\n\nFor '1' (digit 1): val[1] is 1, len is 1. \n\nres starts at 0. \n\nres = 0 * 10^1 + 1 = 1. \n\nNext '2': val is 0, len is 2. \n\nres = 1 * 10^2 + 0 = 100. \n\nNext '3': val is 3, len is 1. \n\nres = 100 * 10^1 + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003. \n\nNext '1': res = 1003 * 10^1 + 1 = 10030 + 1 = 10031. \n\nNext '2': res = 10031 * 10^2 + 0 = 10031 * 100 = 1003100. \n\nNext '3': res = 1003100 * 10^1 + 3 = 10031000 +3 = 10031003. \n\nWhich matches the first example's output of 10031003. \n\nSo, the code works for that. \n\nAnother example: the third sample input. \n\nSample input: '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'\n\nOriginal s is '222', queries are 2->0 and 0->7. \n\nProcessing queries in reverse order: first process 0->7, then 2->0. \n\nInitially, for each digit, val is d, len is 1. \n\nProcessing 0->7. \n\nti is '7'. For each character in ti (only '7'):\n\nval[7] is 7, len is 1. \n\nSo, temp_val is 7, temp_len is 1. \n\nSet val[0] = 7, len[0] = 1. \n\nThen, process the query 2->0. ti is '0', which is processed as follows. \n\nFor each character in ti (0), which has val 7 and len 1. \n\ntemp_val = 0 * 10^1 + 7 = 7. temp_len = 1. \n\nSo, val[2] is 7, len[2] is 1. \n\nNow, processing the original string '222':\n\nEach '2' has val 7 and len 1. \n\nres starts as 0. \n\nFirst '2': 0 * 10^1 +7 =7. \n\nSecond '2': 7 * 10^1 +7 = 77. \n\nThird '2': 77 * 10^1 +7 = 777. \n\nWhich matches the sample output of 777. \n\nAnother example: the second sample input. \n\nInput: '123123', n=1, query '3->'. \n\nProcessing the query in reverse. \n\nThe query is 3-> empty string. \n\nProcessing ti as empty string. So, temp_val is 0 (since empty string represents 0?), temp_len is 0. \n\nWait, but how to handle ti being empty. \n\nWait, in the problem statement, when ti is empty, the replacement is to remove all instances of di. \n\nSo, for example, in the case of ti being empty, the expansion of di is the empty string. \n\nBut how to model that in our code. \n\nIn the code, when ti is empty, the temp_val is 0 (because the empty string represents zero?), and temp_len is 0. \n\nBut what about the value of the empty string? According to the problem statement, if the string is empty, the number is zero. \n\nSo, when processing ti as empty, the value of that expansion is zero, and the length is zero. \n\nSo, for example, in the query '3->', ti is empty. \n\nProcessing ti as empty: temp_val = 0, temp_len = 0. \n\nThus, for the digit 3, val[3] = 0, len[3] = 0. \n\nThen, processing the original string '123123':\n\neach character is processed. \n\nFor '1', '2', '3', '1', '2', '3'. \n\nThe '3's have val 0 and len 0. \n\nSo, during processing:\n\nres starts at 0. \n\nFirst '1': res = 0 * 10^1 + 1 = 1. \n\nThen '2': res = 1 * 10^1 + 2 = 12. \n\nThen '3': res = 12 * 10^0 + 0 = 12 + 0 = 12. \n\nThen '1': res = 12 * 10^1 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121. \n\nThen '2': res = 121 * 10^1 + 2 = 1210 + 2 = 1212. \n\nThen '3': res = 1212 * 10^0 + 0 = 1212 + 0 = 1212. \n\nWhich matches the sample output. \n\nBut wait, the empty string has len 0. So, when we process a character whose expansion is empty, the code would multiply the current res by 10^0 (which is 1), and add 0. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo, the code handles empty strings correctly. \n\nNow, what about when ti is empty. How to compute temp_val and temp_len. \n\nFor ti being empty, the temp_val is 0 and temp_len is 0. \n\nSo, during the processing of ti, if ti is empty, then:\n\ntemp_val = 0 \n\ntemp_len = 0 \n\nSo, in code, for each query, when ti is empty, the code would generate temp_val and temp_len accordingly. \n\nThus, the code needs to handle ti being empty. \n\nNow, implementing this in Python. \n\nSo, for each query, we split into di and ti. \n\nFor example, for a query string like '2->00', we can split it into parts by splitting on '->'. \n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nfor query in queries:\n\n    parts = query.split('->')\n\n    di = parts[0]\n\n    ti = parts[1]\n\nBut need to make sure that the split is correct. \n\nNow, for the initial processing of the queries. \n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the input. However, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the user provided an example input as a list of inputs and outputs. However, the actual problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains string s.\n\nThe second line contains integer n.\n\nThen n lines of queries. \n\nBut the sample input given in the problem seems to be multiple test cases. However, the actual problem says that the program should read from stdin. \n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of test cases. However, the user's note says that the code should read from standard input and output to standard output. \n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains string s.\n\nThe second line contains n.\n\nThen n lines of queries. \n\nBut the sample input given in the problem seems to be multiple test cases, but perhaps that's just for the example. \n\nBut the code needs to process a single test case. \n\nSo, the code should read from stdin. \n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided a list of inputs and outputs. However, the actual problem is that the code must process one input. \n\nSo, the code must read s, then n, then n lines of queries. \n\nBut in the sample input, perhaps the user is showing multiple test cases. However, the code must process one test case. \n\nSo, the code will be written as:\n\nRead the first line as s. \n\nRead the second line as n. \n\nThen read n lines as queries. \n\nBut in the sample input given by the user, for example, the first input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', ...]\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, the actual problem says that the code must read from stdin. \n\nTherefore, the code should read from stdin, not from a list. \n\nBut for the purposes of writing the code, the code should read from stdin. \n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nImplement the steps:\n\nRead s from input. \n\nRead n from input. \n\nRead n lines of queries. \n\nProcess the queries in reverse order. \n\nInitialize val and len_ arrays. \n\nThen process the original string. \n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, process queries in reverse. \n\nBut for each query in reversed(queries):\n\n    di, ti = parts. \n\nBut how to split the query into di and ti. \n\nEach query is of the form \"d->t\", where d is a single character, and t is the string. \n\nSo, splitting on '->' gives two parts. \n\nSo, for example, for query_str = '2->00', parts = ['2', '00']\n\nBut for the case where ti is empty, like '3->', then parts would be ['3', ''].\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor query in reversed(queries):\n\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n\n    di = di.strip()\n\n    ti = ti.strip()\n\nBut since the input is properly formatted, perhaps no need for stripping. \n\nOnce we have di and ti, we need to compute the temp_val and temp_len for ti. \n\nSo, for ti, we process each character in ti:\n\ntemp_val = 0 \n\ntemp_len = 0 \n\nfor c in ti:\n\n    digit = int(c)\n\n    power = pow(10, len_[digit], MOD)\n\n    temp_val = (temp_val * power + val[digit]) % MOD \n\n    temp_len += len_[digit]\n\nThen, set val[int(di)] = temp_val, len_[int(di)] = temp_len \n\nBut wait, the initial val and len_ for each digit is as follows:\n\nInitially, for each digit d in 0-9, val[d] = d, len[d] = 1. \n\nSo, in code:\n\nval = [i for i in range(10)]\n\nlen_ = [1]*10\n\nBut in Python, we can initialize as:\n\nval = list(range(10))\n\nlen_ = [1]*10\n\nThen, for each query in reversed(queries):\n\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n\n    di = int(di)\n\n    ti_str = ti\n\n    # compute temp_val and temp_len for ti_str\n\n    temp_val = 0\n\n    temp_len = 0\n\n    for c in ti_str:\n\n        digit = int(c)\n\n        # compute 10^len_[digit] mod MOD\n\n        power = pow(10, len_[digit], MOD)\n\n        temp_val = (temp_val * power + val[digit]) % MOD\n\n        temp_len += len_[digit]\n\n    # assign to di\n\n    val[di] = temp_val\n\n    len_[di] = temp_len\n\nOnce that is done, process the original string s:\n\nres = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    digit = int(c)\n\n    power = pow(10, len_[digit], MOD)\n\n    res = (res * power + val[digit]) % MOD\n\nprint(res)\n\nBut wait, what if the final string is empty? According to the problem statement, the number is considered zero. However, in our code, if the original string is empty (but according to the problem, the original string has length at least 1). But during substitution, if all digits are replaced with empty strings, then the final string is empty. \n\nBut in the code, if s is empty, then res is 0. However, according to the problem statement, the original s has length >=1. However, during substitution, the string could become empty. For example, if s is '3', and the query is '3->', then the final string is empty. \n\nBut according to the code, for the original string s, which is '3', during processing, the code would process the '3' as follows. \n\nval[3] would be 0, len[3] is 0. \n\nSo, during processing:\n\nres starts at 0. \n\ndigit is 3: \n\npower = pow(10, 0, MOD) = 1. \n\nres = 0 * 1 + 0 = 0. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo the code handles this case. \n\nAnother edge case: when the final string is empty. \n\nBut the code returns 0. \n\nNow, let's check the fourth example in the sample input. \n\nSample input: '1000000008\\n0' \n\nSo, s is '1000000008', n=0. \n\nNo queries. \n\nSo, the code processes the original string. \n\nEach digit is mapped to itself",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly applying each substitution step-by-step would be computationally expensive, so we use a more efficient approach by tracking the transformations using dynamic programming.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with each digit (0-9) mapping to itself. This means each digit's value is the digit itself, and its length is 1.\n2. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Process each query in reverse order. For each query, update the transformation for the specified digit based on the current transformations of the digits in the replacement string.\n3. **Dynamic Programming for Transformations**: For each query, compute the value and length of the replacement string using the current transformations of its constituent digits. This allows us to handle nested substitutions efficiently.\n4. **Final Computation**: After processing all queries, compute the final value of the original string using the transformations derived from the queries, taking into account modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    ptr = 0\n    s = input[ptr].strip()\n    ptr += 1\n    n = int(input[ptr].strip())\n    ptr += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if ptr >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[ptr].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        ptr += 1\n    \n    # Initialize val and len_\n    val = list(range(10))\n    len_ = [1] * 10\n    \n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for query in reversed(queries):\n        parts = query.split('->')\n        di = int(parts[0])\n        ti = parts[1]\n        \n        temp_val = 0\n        temp_len = 0\n        for c in ti:\n            digit = int(c)\n            power = pow(10, len_[digit], MOD)\n            temp_val = (temp_val * power + val[digit]) % MOD\n            temp_len += len_[digit]\n        val[di] = temp_val\n        len_[di] = temp_len\n    \n    # Compute the result from the original string s\n    res = 0\n    for c in s:\n        digit = int(c)\n        power = pow(10, len_[digit], MOD)\n        res = (res * power + val[digit]) % MOD\n    \n    print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into the initial string and the list of queries.\n2. **Initialization of Transformations**: Each digit initially maps to itself with a length of 1.\n3. **Reverse Query Processing**: By processing queries in reverse, we ensure that each substitution is built upon the most recent transformations of the digits involved.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using modular exponentiation, we efficiently compute powers of 10 modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers without overflow.\n5. **Final Result Calculation**: The final result is computed by iterating over the original string and applying the transformations, using modular arithmetic to maintain correctness with large numbers.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle up to the maximum constraints efficiently, avoiding direct manipulation of potentially extremely large strings.",
