They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the given GCD and LCM values on the edges. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Each edge between two lawns (let's say u and v) has a GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts on those two nodes. So for each edge, if the mushroom counts are a and b, then GCD(a, b) = g and LCM(a, b) = l. And we know that a * b = g * l. Also, since GCD(a,b) is g, both a and b must be multiples of g. Let me think: So for each edge, a and b can be written as a = g * x, b = g * y, where GCD(x, y) = 1. Because if there was a common divisor between x and y, then the GCD of a and b would be higher than g. Then, the LCM of a and b is g * x * y. But since LCM(a,b) is given as l, then g * x * y = l. So x * y = l / g. And since x and y are coprime, this gives us that x and y are factors of l/g, and their product is exactly that value. Therefore, for each edge, the possible pairs (x, y) are coprime pairs whose product is l/g. But since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can assign x and y in some way, but how does that translate into assigning values to the nodes?\n\nBut the problem is that each node is connected via multiple edges, so the assignments need to be consistent across all edges connected to a node. So this seems like a graph problem where each node's value must satisfy all the edges connected to it.\n\nHmm. How can I model this? It feels similar to a system of constraints. For example, each edge between u and v imposes that the value of u and v must be such that their GCD is g and LCM is l. Which implies that their ratio is such that when divided by their GCD, the resulting numbers are coprime and their product is l/g. \n\nBut how do I assign these values to the nodes? One approach is to model this as a graph where each node's value is determined by some variables, and the edges impose constraints between them. However, since the values are integers, and the constraints are multiplicative, maybe we can model this with a union-find structure or some kind of graph traversal where we assign values based on relations.\n\nWait, but each edge between u and v gives a relationship between the values of u and v. For example, suppose for an edge between u and v, the GCD is g and LCM is l. Then, the values of u and v must be multiples of g. Also, the product of u and v is g*l. So, u and v can be expressed as u = g * x, v = g * y, where x and y are coprime and x*y = l/g. So for each edge, the pair (x, y) must be coprime and multiply to l/g. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can choose x and y for each edge, but ensuring that the assignments are consistent across the entire graph.\n\nBut how do we ensure consistency? For example, if two edges share a node, their assignments must agree on the value of that node.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. For example, if we can assign a value to a node, then for each adjacent edge, we can compute the value of the other node based on that. However, this requires that the assignments are consistent across the entire connected component.\n\nLet me think of this as building a graph where each node's value is connected to others through equations. For example, if u and v are connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l, then u = g * x, v = g * y, with x*y = l/g and GCD(x,y)=1. But x and y could be any pair of coprimes that multiply to l/g. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can choose x and y in a way that allows the rest of the graph to be consistent.\n\nBut how do we choose x and y? Let's think of the problem as building a graph where each node's value is determined by a base value multiplied by some factors. For example, if we can assign a base value to a node, then for each edge, the other node's value is determined based on that.\n\nAlternatively, since the product u * v = g * l, and the GCD(u, v) = g, then u and v must be multiples of g. So, for each node, its value must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if a node is connected to two edges with different GCDs, then the node's value must be a multiple of both of those GCDs. Therefore, the value of the node must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of its edges. Hmm, but that's only if the edges are connected. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIf a node u is connected to another node v via an edge with GCD g1 and LCM l1, and also connected to node w via GCD g2 and LCM l2. Then u must be a multiple of g1 and a multiple of g2. Therefore, u must be a multiple of the LCM(g1, g2). But how can we ensure that?\n\nBut this might not be the case. For example, suppose u is connected to v with GCD 2, and to w with GCD 3. Then u must be a multiple of 2 and of 3, hence a multiple of 6. However, if the actual value of u is 6, then that's okay. But if there's no such constraints from other edges, then that's acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps the first step is to check for each connected component whether there's a way to assign values to the nodes such that all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to model this. Let me think of the problem as building a graph where each node's value is determined by a variable, and for each edge, we have constraints between two variables.\n\nBut solving such constraints may be challenging. However, since the constraints are multiplicative and involve GCD and LCM, perhaps we can model the variables in terms of their prime factors. But that might be too complicated.\n\nAnother approach: Since for each edge, u and v must be multiples of the GCD. Let's denote that for each edge between u and v, the GCD is g, and LCM is l. Then, u and v must be multiples of g, and their product is g*l. Also, since LCM(u, v) is l, which is equal to (u*v)/GCD(u, v) = (g*x * g*y)/g = g*x*y. So l = g*x*y. Therefore, x*y = l/g. And since GCD(x, y) = 1, x and y are coprime.\n\nSo, for each edge, the pair (x, y) must be coprime and multiply to l/g. Therefore, the possible pairs (x, y) are such that x divides l/g, y divides l/g, and x*y = l/g, and GCD(x, y) = 1.\n\nBut how do we choose x and y for each edge? Well, for each edge, we can choose either (x, y) or (y, x), but once chosen, they must be consistent with the rest of the graph.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a graph with variables and constraints. For example, if we have a connected component, we can pick a starting node and assign it a value, then propagate the constraints to other nodes. However, during propagation, we need to ensure that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to another. For example, if we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, then u and v must be such that u = g * a, v = g * b, where a*b = l/g and GCD(a, b) = 1. Let's say that for this edge, we assign a and b as (a, b) = (k, (l/g)/k), where k is a divisor of l/g, and GCD(k, (l/g)/k) = 1. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can choose a specific way to assign a and b for each edge, but ensuring that the assignments are consistent across the entire graph.\n\nWait, but how can we ensure consistency? For example, if u is connected to v and also to w, then the value of u must be compatible with both edges.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a BFS or DFS approach. For example, we can start with a node, assign it a value, then for each adjacent edge, compute the value of the connected node based on the current node's value. However, this requires that the computed value is consistent with the edge's constraints and also with any previous assignments.\n\nBut how to compute the value of the adjacent node? Let's take an example. Suppose we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. Let's assume that we have assigned a value to u. Then, the value of v can be determined as follows:\n\nWe know that u * v = g * l. So v = (g * l) / u. But this requires that u divides (g * l). However, since u must be a multiple of g, because the GCD(u, v) is g. Therefore, u is a multiple of g, and thus (g*l) is divisible by u?\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. If u is a multiple of g, then u = g * x, and v = g * y. Then, x * y = l/g. So v = g * y = (g * l) / (g * x) ) * g * x ? No, wait:\n\nu * v = (g x) * (g y) = g² x y = g² * (l/g) = g l. So yes, u * v = g l. Therefore, given u, v can be calculated as (g l) / u. But since u is a multiple of g, then (g l) must be divisible by u. But how do we know that?\n\nWell, since u is a multiple of g, then u = g * k, where k is some integer. Then, (g l) / u = (g l) / (g k) ) = l/k. But since x * y = l/g and x = k, then y = (l/g) / k. Therefore, v = g * y = g * (l/g) /k = l/k. Which must be an integer. So l must be divisible by k. But since k is x, which is part of the pair (x, y) where x * y = l/g, and GCD(x, y) = 1. Therefore, x must divide l/g. Thus, k divides l/g, so l/g must be divisible by x. Therefore, l must be divisible by x * g. Wait, not sure. But perhaps this suggests that if we have assigned u as a multiple of g, then v is (g*l)/u, which is an integer.\n\nSo, the idea is that once we assign a value to u, then v can be determined as (g*l)/u. However, this depends on u being a multiple of g, which is required by the GCD condition. Therefore, if during the BFS/DFS traversal, when we assign a value to a node, we must ensure that it's a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. Wait, but how do we know what that is? Because the edges connected to a node may have different GCDs. For example, a node u may be connected to v with GCD g1 and to w with GCD g2. Therefore, u must be a multiple of both g1 and g2, hence a multiple of LCM(g1, g2). But how can we ensure that?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps the approach is as follows:\n\nFor each connected component of the graph, we can perform a BFS or DFS. We start by choosing a node and assigning it a value. Then, for each adjacent edge, we compute the value of the neighboring node based on the current node's value and the edge's parameters. However, this requires that the computed value for the neighbor is consistent with all the constraints of that node. For example, when we assign a value to a neighbor, we have to make sure that for all edges connected to that neighbor, the value is compatible.\n\nBut how can we proceed? Let's take an example. Suppose we have a connected component with nodes A and B connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l. We can assign A any value that is a multiple of g. Then B is determined as (g*l)/A. However, B must also be a multiple of g. Let's see: since A is a multiple of g, then A = g * x, and B = (g*l)/A = (g*l)/(g x) = l/(x). But since x * y = l/g (from earlier), then x * y = l/g => y = (l/g)/x. Therefore, B = g * y = g * (l/g)/x = l/x. But since x divides l/g (because x and y are coprime and their product is l/g), then l/g must be divisible by x. Therefore, l must be divisible by x * g. So l/x is an integer. Hence, B is indeed an integer and a multiple of g? Wait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose g is 2, l is 6. Then l/g = 3. So x*y=3. Possible pairs (x,y) are (1,3) and (3,1). So if A is assigned as 2*1 = 2, then B is 6/2 = 3. Which is 3, which is a multiple of 2? No. Wait, but the GCD of A and B is 2. But if A is 2 and B is 3, their GCD is 1, not 2. That's a problem. Oh no! What's wrong here?\n\nAh, here's a mistake. Earlier reasoning said that u and v are multiples of g. But in this case, if u is 2 and v is 3, their GCD is 1, not 2. Which contradicts the edge's given GCD. So there's a flaw in my reasoning. Where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me re-examine the earlier steps. The edge between u and v has GCD g and LCM l. Then, the GCD(u, v) = g. So u and v must be multiples of g. Therefore, u = g * x, v = g * y. Then, GCD(x, y) = 1. Also, LCM(u, v) = g * x * y = l. Therefore, x * y = l/g. So, in the example where g=2, l=6, then l/g=3. So x*y=3. The possible pairs (x, y) are (1,3) and (3,1). Therefore, u = 2*1 = 2, v = 2*3=6. Then, GCD(2,6) is 2, and LCM is 6. Correct. Alternatively, if u is 2*3=6 and v is 2*1=2, same thing. So earlier mistake was in assuming that B would be l/x. But in reality, B is g*y, where y is l/g divided by x. So B is g*(l/g)/x = l/x. Wait, but in this case, l/x is 6/1 = 6. Which is correct. So in the example, if u is 2, then v is 6. Which is correct. So why was my previous calculation of B as l/x leading to 3? Because I made a mistake. Oh right, because u is g*x. So when I compute v = (g*l)/u = (g*l)/(g*x) = l/x. But l/x is (g * x * y)/x = g*y. Which is correct. So in the example, l/x is 6/1 = 6, which is g*y = 2*3 = 6. Correct. So the earlier mistake was in thinking that B is 3, but that's incorrect. So the formula for B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the key point is that when you assign a value to a node, the value must be such that it's a multiple of g (the GCD of the edge). But how to ensure that?\n\nIn the BFS/DFS approach, when we assign a value to a node, we must choose it such that it is compatible with all edges connected to it. However, for the initial node, how do we choose its value?\n\nThis seems challenging. Because for a node connected to multiple edges, each with their own GCDs, the value must be a multiple of all those GCDs. So for example, if a node is connected via two edges, one with GCD g1 and another with GCD g2, then the node's value must be a multiple of LCM(g1, g2).\n\nBut how do we find such a value?\n\nPerhaps the approach is to model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined by a base value multiplied by some factors. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model this as a graph where each edge imposes a relationship between two nodes. For each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we can represent that u and v must be such that u = g * x, v = g * y, with x*y = l/g, and GCD(x, y) = 1. Now, since x and y are coprime, and x*y = l/g, then x and y are uniquely determined up to swapping (since they are coprime). Therefore, for each edge, there are two possibilities for (x, y): (a, b) or (b, a), where a*b = l/g and GCD(a, b) = 1. \n\nBut how to choose between these possibilities? This seems like a problem of assigning directions to the edges. However, the problem requires that the entire graph is consistent. So for example, if u is connected to v with (x, y) and also to w with (x', y'), then the assignments must be compatible.\n\nBut this seems complex. Perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined by a base value, and for each edge, we can assign the ratio between the nodes. However, since the ratio is constrained by the edge's parameters, this might require checking for consistency.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each connected component, assign a base value to a starting node. Then, for each edge, determine the value of the adjacent node based on the current node's value. However, the problem is that the value of the adjacent node is determined by the formula v = (g*l) / u. But this requires that u is a multiple of g, which is the GCD of the edge.\n\nBut how can we ensure that when we assign u, it is compatible with all edges connected to it? Because for example, if a node u is connected to two edges, each with different GCDs, then u must be a multiple of both GCDs. Therefore, the base value assigned to u must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. However, how do we determine that?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each node, we need to find a value that satisfies all the constraints from its edges. But how can we do that?\n\nAlternative idea: For each connected component, we can build a system of equations where the product of the two nodes connected by an edge equals g*l. Then, the problem becomes solving for variables (the node values) under these constraints. However, this is a system of equations that can be solved using BFS/DFS traversal, as long as the constraints are consistent.\n\nLet me try to think of this as a graph where each edge between u and v enforces that u * v = g * l. Then, if we can assign values to the nodes such that this holds for all edges, then it's a valid solution. However, this is only possible if the product constraints are consistent across the entire graph.\n\nFor example, consider a triangle of nodes u-v-w-u. Suppose each edge has certain g and l. Then, the product constraints would be u*v = g1*l1, v*w = g2*l2, w*u = g3*l3. These equations must be compatible. For example, multiplying all three equations: (u*v)*(v*w)*(w*u) = (g1*l1)(g2*l2)(g3*l3). Which simplifies to u² v² w² = ... So (u v w)^2 = ... etc. But this may not directly help unless there's a way to check for consistency.\n\nHowever, during BFS/DFS traversal, if we assign a value to a node and compute the value of adjacent nodes, we can check for consistency when we reach a node that's already been visited. For example, if during traversal, we assign a value to a node that was previously assigned a different value, then the assignment is invalid.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n- For each connected component in the graph:\n\n   - Choose a starting node. Assign it a value. However, what value? Since the value must be compatible with all edges connected to it, perhaps the value must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. However, how to choose this value?\n\n   - Wait, but the value is determined by the edges. For example, if the node is connected to multiple edges, the value must be compatible with all of them. So perhaps the starting node's value can be chosen as the GCD of all edges' GCDs multiplied by some factor. But this is unclear.\n\n   - Alternatively, since the product of u and v is fixed for each edge, perhaps we can assign arbitrary values as long as they are consistent. But how?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we start with a node u. We can assign it a value, say, a. Then for each edge connected to u, we can compute the value of the other node. However, the problem is that for each edge, the value of u must be compatible with the edge's GCD and LCM. For example, the value of u must be a multiple of the edge's GCD. But if we assign u a value that is not a multiple of that edge's GCD, then the constraints will be violated.\n\nTherefore, during the BFS/DFS, when we assign a value to a node, we must ensure that it is a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. However, how can we do that?\n\nThis seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. The value of the node depends on the edges connected to it, but the edges require the value to be a multiple of their GCDs.\n\nWait, but for a node u connected to an edge with GCD g, the value of u must be a multiple of g. So, during the BFS/DFS, whenever we assign a value to a node, we must ensure that it is a multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. However, how can we ensure that?\n\nMaybe the way to handle this is to first process all edges and for each node, collect all the GCDs of edges connected to it. Then, the value of the node must be a multiple of the LCM of all these GCDs. Let's call this value 'base'. So for each node, the value must be a multiple of 'base'.\n\nBut how to compute 'base'? For example, if a node is connected to edges with GCDs g1, g2, ..., then base is LCM(g1, g2, ...). However, this is only possible if the assignments are consistent across the edges. But how do we know that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the base is determined by the edges. For example, when processing the edges, for each edge between u and v, the GCD of the edge is g. Therefore, both u and v must be multiples of g. Hence, for each node u, the value must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. Therefore, the value of u must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of its edges.\n\nSo, for example, if a node u is connected to edges with GCDs 2 and 3, then the value of u must be a multiple of 6. Therefore, during the BFS/DFS traversal, the starting node's value must be a multiple of its base (LCM of all GCDs of its edges). Then, for each adjacent node, the value is determined as (g*l)/current_value. But this new value must also be a multiple of the GCDs of its edges.\n\nBut how do we ensure that?\n\nThis seems very complex. However, perhaps there's a way to model this by first checking for each edge whether l is divisible by g. Because for any edge, since LCM(a, b) is at least as big as GCD(a, b), but also, since LCM(a, b) = (a*b)/GCD(a, b), then for the given g and l, we must have that l is divisible by g. Otherwise, there's no solution. Wait, no. Because LCM(a, b) is (a*b)/gcd(a, b). So, for the given edge, l must be equal to (a*b)/g, which implies that l must be divisible by g? No, because a and b are multiples of g. Let me think. Let's say a = g * x, b = g * y. Then LCM(a, b) = g * LCM(x, y). But since x and y are coprime (because GCD(a, b) = g), then LCM(x, y) = x * y. Therefore, LCM(a, b) = g * x * y. Which equals l. Therefore, l must be equal to g * x * y. So, since x and y are integers, l must be divisible by g. Therefore, for any edge, if the input has l < g, then it's impossible. So first, for each edge, we can check if l % g != 0. If so, output NO.\n\nThat's an important check. So, the first step is to check for all edges whether l is divisible by g. If not, then it's impossible. Also, since the GCD and LCM must satisfy that GCD divides LCM. Because LCM is a multiple of both a and b, and GCD is a divisor of both. So for example, if the given GCD is 2 and LCM is 3, then it's impossible. So, for each edge, we must have that l % g == 0. So that's a preliminary check.\n\nSo first, for each edge, check if l % g != 0. If any edge fails this, output NO.\n\nOnce that is done, for each edge, we can compute k = l / g. Then, x * y = k, and GCD(x, y) = 1.\n\nNow, for each edge, the pair (x, y) must be coprime and multiply to k. But since x and y are coprime, they must be divisors of k and their product is k. So for each edge, we can find the pair (x, y) as any pair of coprime factors of k whose product is k. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose any such pair, but the choice affects the rest of the graph.\n\nBut how to choose them? Well, perhaps during the BFS/DFS traversal, we can assign x and y in a way that allows the rest of the graph to be consistent.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose I have a connected component. I can pick a starting node and assign it a value. Let's say the starting node is u. Then, for each edge connected to u, I can assign the value of the adjacent node based on the value of u and the edge's parameters.\n\nBut what value should I assign to u? Well, for the first node, the value must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. However, since the edges connected to u have various GCDs, the value must be a multiple of the LCM of all those GCDs. Let's call this value 'base_u'.\n\nBut how do I compute base_u? For example, if u is connected to edges with GCDs g1, g2, etc., then base_u = LCM(g1, g2, ...). However, during the traversal, this base_u could be determined by the edges. For example, if u is connected to an edge with GCD g, then the value of u must be a multiple of g. So, during the traversal, when we assign a value to u, it must be a multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it.\n\nBut how can I ensure that? Because for a node u connected to multiple edges, the value must be compatible with all of them. For example, if u is connected to an edge with GCD g1 and another with GCD g2, then the value of u must be a multiple of LCM(g1, g2). So, perhaps the minimal value for u is LCM(g1, g2), but since the problem allows any valid value, we can choose any multiple of this LCM.\n\nBut how to choose this value? Well, during the BFS/DFS, for the starting node, we can choose the base value as the LCM of all the GCDs of its edges. Then, for each edge, the adjacent node's value is determined as (g*l)/u_value. However, this adjacent node's value must also be a multiple of the GCDs of its edges. But how can we ensure that?\n\nThis seems like a recursive problem, but perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   - Check if there are any edges. If not (like when m=0), then each node can have any value (but since there are no constraints, we can assign 1 to all nodes).\n\n   - Else, for each node in the component, compute the LCM of all the GCDs of its edges. Let's call this 'base' for the node.\n\n   - Then, perform a BFS/DFS traversal, starting with a node. Assign it a value of 'base' of that node. Then, for each adjacent edge, compute the value of the adjacent node as (g * l) / current_value. But this adjacent node's value must be a multiple of its own 'base' (the LCM of its edges' GCDs). If it is not, then it's impossible. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nBut how to compute the 'base' for each node?\n\nFor example, for each node u, collect all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. Then compute their LCM. Let's call this 'base_u'.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nFor each node u:\n\n   base_u = LCM of all the GCDs of edges connected to u.\n\nOnce that is computed, during BFS/DFS:\n\nStart with a node u. Assign it a value of base_u. Then, for each edge connected to u, compute the value of the other node as (g * l) / u_val. Then, check if this new value is a multiple of the other node's base. If not, return NO. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nBut why would this work?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose we have a node u connected to an edge with GCD g. Its base_u is g. Assign u_val = g. Then, for the adjacent node v, compute v_val = (g * l) / u_val. Since l = g * k (from earlier), and u_val = g, then v_val = (g * g * k) / g = g*k. Now, for node v, its base is the LCM of all its edges' GCDs. Let's say that edge has GCD g. Then, base_v is g. So v_val must be a multiple of g. Which it is, since v_val is g*k. So it's valid.\n\nAnother example: suppose node u is connected to two edges with GCDs g1 and g2. So base_u = LCM(g1, g2). Assign u_val = base_u. Then, for each edge, compute the adjacent node's value. For the first edge (g1, l1), v_val = (g1 * l1) / u_val. Since u_val is a multiple of g1 (because base_u is LCM(g1, g2)), then (g1 * l1) is divisible by u_val? Not sure. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nu_val is LCM(g1, g2). Let's say g1 and g2 are 2 and 3, so LCM is 6. Suppose the edge has GCD g1 = 2, and LCM l1 = 6. Then, l1/g1 = 3. So x*y = 3. So x and y are 1 and 3. So u_val is 6 (which is g1 * x?), no. Wait, u_val is the value of the node u. For the edge between u and v, the value of u must be a multiple of g1. Since u_val is 6, which is a multiple of 2, it's okay. Then, v_val = (g1 * l1) / u_val = (2 * 6) / 6 = 2. Now, for node v, which is connected via this edge (with GCD 2), its base is LCM of all its edges' GCDs. Suppose node v is connected to only this edge, so base_v is 2. The computed v_val is 2, which is a multiple of 2. So it's okay.\n\nAnother example: suppose node u has base 6 (from two edges with GCDs 2 and 3). Suppose it's connected to an edge with GCD 2, LCM 6. Then, u_val = 6. v_val = (2*6)/6 = 2. Which is a multiple of 2 (its base). So okay.\n\nBut what if the edge has LCM such that (g * l) / u_val is not a multiple of the adjacent node's base?\n\nFor example, suppose node u has base 6 (connected to GCDs 2 and 3). It is connected to an edge with GCD 2 and LCM 4. Then, l/g = 4/2 = 2. So x*y=2, with x and y coprime. So possible pairs are (1, 2) or (2, 1). Then, u_val is 6. So v_val = (2 * 4) / 6 = 8/6 = 4/3, which is not an integer. This is invalid. Therefore, this scenario would be impossible, and the answer would be NO.\n\nBut how can this happen? Because in this case, the edge's parameters are invalid. Because for the edge, the GCD is 2 and LCM is 4. So, for this edge, l must be divisible by g (yes, 4 is divisible by 2). But when we compute the value of v, it's not an integer. Why?\n\nBecause the way we assigned u_val is base_u. However, in this case, the edge's parameters are such that (g*l) is not divisible by u_val. Which suggests that our approach is flawed.\n\nWait, but earlier reasoning said that u_val must be a multiple of the GCD of the edge (which is 2 in this case). So u_val is 6, which is a multiple of 2. Then, (g*l) is 2*4=8. Divided by u_val (6) gives 8/6 = 4/3. Which is not an integer. Which suggests that this assignment is invalid, hence the entire problem is impossible.\n\nBut why is this happening? Because the edge's parameters are such that the product (g*l) is not divisible by u_val. But according to the earlier reasoning, this should not happen. What's wrong here?\n\nLet me re-express the problem. For an edge between u and v, the product u * v must be equal to g * l. So, given that u is a multiple of g (as required by the GCD), then v = (g*l)/u. But for this to be an integer, g*l must be divisible by u. However, in this example, u is 6, and g*l is 8, which is not divisible by 6. Hence, the assignment is invalid. But why is this happening?\n\nBecause the way we chose u's value (base_u) is not compatible with the edge's parameters. So, even though u's value is a multiple of the GCD of the edge, it may not be compatible with the edge's LCM.\n\nThis suggests that our approach of setting u's value to base_u is not sufficient. Therefore, there's a flaw in this reasoning.\n\nWhat's the correct way to assign the value of u?\n\nThe value of u must satisfy that for every edge connected to it, the product of u and the adjacent node",
