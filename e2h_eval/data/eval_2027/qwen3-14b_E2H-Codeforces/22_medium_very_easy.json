After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, first, I need to read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters, each representing the marks. Oh right, each line is a string of digits, like '223' for example.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (columns), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if in any of the subjects they have the maximum mark for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, but how to process the data? Let's think about the data structure. Let's parse the input into a 2D list. Each row is a student, each column is a subject.\n\nFor example, for the first sample input:\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe data would be:\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nThen for each column (subject), find the max value. For subject 0 (first column), the values are 2, 2, 1. Max is 2. So any student with 2 in that column is considered best for that subject. But wait, the problem says \"best at some subject\" if there's no student with a higher mark. So if multiple students have the max, then all of them are considered best for that subject. So for example, in the first sample, subject 0 has max 2, and students 0 and 1 have 2. So both are considered best in that subject. Then, for each student, if they have at least one subject where they are the max in that subject, they are successful.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nFirst, for each subject (column), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if in any of the columns they have the maximum value for that column. If yes, count them.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next n lines as a list of strings. Then convert each string into a list of integers. So, for example, the first line '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have the data as a 2D list, then:\n\n- For each column j in 0..m-1:\n   - Find the maximum value in that column.\n\nOnce we have the max values for each column, then for each student (row), check if in any of the columns they have the value equal to the max of that column. If at least one such column exists, the student is successful.\n\nSo, how to compute the max for each column?\n\nLet's think: For each column j, iterate through all rows and collect the values in that column, then take max.\n\nFor example, for the first sample:\n\ncolumns are:\n\ncol0: [2,2,1] → max 2\n\ncol1: [2,3,1] → max 3\n\ncol2: [3,2,2] → max 3\n\nSo for each student:\n\nstudent 0: has 2 in col0 (which is max), so he is successful.\n\nstudent 1: has 3 in col1 (max), so successful.\n\nstudent 2: none of his marks are max in any column. So not successful.\n\nHence total 2 successful students.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the data as a list of lists of integers.\n\nCompute for each column, the maximum value.\n\nThen for each row (student), check if any of the elements in the row is equal to the maximum of that column. If yes, count it.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines, each line is a string, then convert each character to int.\n\nThen for each column j, compute max of [row[j] for row in data].\n\nOnce we have that, for each student (row), check for any j where row[j] == max_col[j].\n\nNow, code:\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nSample input:\n\nn, m = 3,3\n\ndata = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\nmax_cols = [2,3,3]\n\nThen, for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2,2,3 → check if 2 == max_cols[0] (yes), so successful.\n\nstudent 1: 2,3,2 → 3 is equal to max_cols[1] (3) → yes.\n\nstudent 2: 1,1,2 → none of them equal to 2,3,3 → no.\n\nSo total 2.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the data.\n\nCompute max_cols as a list where max_cols[j] is the maximum of column j.\n\nThen, for each row in data, check if any element in the row is equal to the corresponding max_cols[j]. If yes, increment count.\n\nNow, how to compute max_cols:\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n   column_values = [data[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n\n   max_col_j = max(column_values)\n\nSo, for each j, compute that.\n\nOnce that is done, for each row, check if any of the elements in that row is equal to max_col[j] for that column.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor row in data:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if row[j] == max_cols[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nThe input comes from stdin. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings, but in actual code, we need to read from stdin.\n\nWait, the user provided an example where the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo in code, read the first line as n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string, then convert each into a list of integers.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ndata = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    data.append(row)\n\nOnce that is done, compute max_cols as discussed.\n\nThen, for each row in data, check if any of the elements is equal to the max in that column.\n\nNow, code for max_cols:\n\nmax_cols = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if data[i][j] > max_val:\n\n            max_val = data[i][j]\n\n    max_cols.append(max_val)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_cols = [max(data[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nBut for code clarity, perhaps the first way is better.\n\nOnce max_cols is computed, then for each student, check if any of their marks in a column is equal to the max of that column.\n\nNow, for each row in data:\n\nfor row in data:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if row[j] == max_cols[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nSo, the code for counting.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ndata is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_cols for j=0: 2, j=1: 3, j=2:3.\n\nFor first row, check each column:\n\nj=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nSecond row: j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nThird row: check j=0: 1 < 2. j=1: 1 <3. j=2: 2 <3. So no.\n\nTotal count is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo data:\n\nrow0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nrow1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nrow2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_cols for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9, 1, 1 → max 9.\n\ncolumn1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\ncolumn2: 7,8,1 → max 8.\n\ncolumn3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nSo for each student:\n\nrow0: has 9 in column0 (max), so yes.\n\nrow1: has 8 in column2 (max), and also 8 in column4 (max). So yes.\n\nrow2: check each column. column0 is 1 <9. column1 is 1 (max). So yes. So row2 is successful.\n\nThus total 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if all students have same marks in all subjects? For example, n=2, m=1, and both have 5. Then max_cols is [5]. Both students have 5, so both are successful. So output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=5. All marks are 5. Then the student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [1, 2], student 2 has [2, 1]. max_cols are 2 and 2. So each student has a max in one column. So both are successful. So output 2.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing in Python.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each as a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_cols.\n\nThen count the number of students who have at least one column where their value is equal to max_cols[j].\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ndata = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    data.append(row)\n\nmax_cols = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if data[i][j] > max_val:\n\n            max_val = data[i][j]\n\n    max_cols.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor row in data:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if row[j] == max_cols[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nLet me test the first sample.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ndata is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_cols:\n\nfor j=0:\n\ni=0: 2, i=1:2, i=2:1 → max is 2.\n\nj=1: 2,3,1 → max 3.\n\nj=2: 3,2,2 → max 3.\n\nso max_cols = [2,3,3]\n\nfor each row:\n\nrow 0: 2 == 2 → count +=1.\n\nrow1: 2 ==2 → count +=1.\n\nrow2: none of the columns match. So total 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → [9,1,7,2,8]\n\n11828 → [1,1,8,2,8]\n\n11111 → [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_cols:\n\ncolumn0: 9,1,1 →9.\n\ncolumn1: 1,1,1 →1.\n\ncolumn2:7,8,1 →8.\n\ncolumn3:2,2,1 →2.\n\ncolumn4:8,8,1 →8.\n\nso max_cols is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nfor row0:\n\nhas 9 in column0 → yes.\n\nrow1: has 8 in column2 (8) → yes.\n\nrow2: has 1 in column1 (max is 1) → yes. So all three are counted. Output 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 and 5. Output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1, then 5 and 5. So max is 5. Both students have 5. So count is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m digits representing the grades of students.\n2. **Determine Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject (column), compute the maximum grade achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum grade in at least one subject. If they do, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ndata = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    data.append(row)\n\nmax_cols = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if data[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = data[i][j]\n    max_cols.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor row in data:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if row[j] == max_cols[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is parsed into integers `n` and `m`. The subsequent `n` lines are read as strings and converted into lists of integers representing the grades of each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Grades**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest grade. This is stored in the `max_cols` list where each entry corresponds to the maximum grade of the respective subject.\n3. **Counting Successful Students**: For each student, check if their grade in any subject matches the maximum grade for that subject. If a match is found, the student is counted as successful and we move to the next student.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the successful students by leveraging column-wise maximum checks, ensuring an optimal solution within the given constraints.",
