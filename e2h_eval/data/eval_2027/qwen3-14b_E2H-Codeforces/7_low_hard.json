The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake as defined. Let's think about the structure of the snowflake.\n\nThe snowflake is built in a certain way. Let me try to understand the construction steps again. \n\nInitially, there's one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must have k new vertices connected to them. And this process is done at least once. Wait, the description says that each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. And this step should be done at least once. So the initial step is adding k vertices to the root. Then, each of those k vertices (which are leaves) must have k new vertices added. But this step (the expansion) must be done at least once. \n\nSo the snowflake's structure is a tree. Let me model the number of vertices based on the depth of expansion.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's say that the process is done for m levels. Let's think recursively. \n\nThe root node (level 0) has 1 node. Then, level 1 has k nodes. Each of these nodes then has k children. So level 2 has k * k nodes. But wait, the process requires that each time we expand, all the leaves (nodes with degree 1) get expanded. So the expansion steps are done in layers. \n\nWait, let's think about the construction steps:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then, add k children to it. Now, the root has degree k, and each of the k children has degree 1. Then, the next step is to add k children to each of these k nodes. So after this step, each of the original k nodes now has degree k+1? No, wait: each of those nodes was connected to the root (degree 1) and then connected to k new nodes. So their degree is 1 + k. But the new nodes added here are leaves again. \n\nBut the process says that each time, the step is to take all the current leaves (those with degree 1) and add k children to them. This step must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children to the root) is the first step. Then, the second step is adding k children to each of the leaves (the first level nodes). And this step must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do the initial step (adding k children) and then do the expansion step once (adding k children to each of the first level nodes). \n\nSo for example, with k=4, the minimal snowflake would have:\n\nLevel 0: 1 node (root)\nLevel 1: 4 nodes (each connected to root)\nLevel 2: 4 * 4 = 16 nodes (each of level 1 nodes has 4 children)\nTotal nodes: 1 + 4 + 16 = 21. But the sample input says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm, maybe my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait the sample input includes n=13 as a YES. Let me think again. Let me check the example given. The sample input for n=13 outputs YES. How can that be?\n\nWait perhaps the expansion steps can be done for different numbers of times. Let me think of the possible total number of nodes.\n\nLet me think of the structure as a tree where each node (except the root) has exactly one parent. The root has k children. Each of those children has k children. But the expansion steps are done for some number of times. Wait, but the expansion steps are done once. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that the initial step is to connect the root to k new nodes. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k new nodes. This step should be done at least once. So the expansion steps can be done multiple times. For example, after expanding once (adding k children to each of the first level nodes), we can do another expansion (adding k children to each of the second level nodes), etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes depends on how many times we perform the expansion steps. Let me model this.\n\nLet me denote that the expansion is done m times. Wait, perhaps the initial step (adding the first level) is considered as one expansion. Then, the expansion steps are done m times. Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the expansion step is done once (adding k children to each of the leaves). So for the minimal case, m=1. Then, for m=2,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake as defined by the problem's construction rules. The snowflake is constructed in such a way that each expansion step adds `k` new vertices to every leaf node (nodes with only one connection), and this expansion must be done at least once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake structure is a tree where the root has `k` children. Each subsequent level of nodes is formed by adding `k` children to each leaf node from the previous level. This process must be repeated at least once after the initial step.\n2. **Mathematical Model**: The total number of nodes after `m` levels of expansion can be represented using a geometric series. For a given `k`, the total number of nodes after `m` levels is:\n   $$\n   n = 1 + k \\cdot \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1}\n   $$\n   Here, the first term `1` is the root node, and the rest of the terms represent the sum of nodes added in each expansion step.\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each test case, we check if there exists a `k > 1` such that the given `n` can be expressed in the form above for some integer `m ≥ 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Try all possible m >= 1 and check if there's a k > 1\n    for m in range(1, 60):  # since 2^60 is larger than 1e18\n        # For each m, compute the total number of nodes\n        # n = 1 + k*(k^m - 1)/(k - 1)\n        # Let's rearrange to find if there's integer k > 1\n        # Let's denote S = k*(k^m - 1)/(k - 1)\n        # So n - 1 = S\n        target = n - 1\n        # We need to find k > 1 such that k * (k^m - 1) / (k - 1) = target\n        # Let's iterate k from 2 up to some limit\n        # For each k, compute the value\n        # However, for large m, even small k can make the value exceed target\n        # So we can binary search k for each m\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        while True:\n            val = k_value(m, high)\n            if val < target:\n                high *= 2\n            else:\n                break\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        left = 2\n        right = high\n        found = False\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            s = k_value(m, mid)\n            if s == target:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif s < target:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef k_value(m, k):\n    # Compute k*(k^m - 1) / (k - 1)\n    # This is the sum of k^i from i=0 to m\n    # Which is (k^{m+1} - 1) / (k - 1) - 1 ?
