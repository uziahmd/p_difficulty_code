You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number with some given digits from a sequence to make the maximum possible number. Hmm. Let me think about the approach.\n\nSo, the problem says that each element in the sequence s can be used at most once. And I can choose any subset of them. The goal is to maximize the number a. So how do I do that?\n\nFirst, the key idea is to replace the digits in a from left to right, replacing each digit with the largest possible digit available in s. But wait, since we want the maximum number, we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits first with the largest possible digits. Because changing a digit in a more significant position (like the first digit) has a bigger impact on the overall value than changing a digit in a less significant position.\n\nSo here's the plan: Sort the sequence s in descending order. Then, iterate through each digit of a from left to right. For each digit, if there's a digit in the sorted s that's larger than the current digit, replace it with the largest possible available digit from s. Otherwise, leave it as is. And once a digit from s is used, it can't be used again.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently check for the largest available digit in s? Let me think. If I sort s in descending order, then for each position in a, I can check if the current digit can be replaced by the next available digit in the sorted list.\n\nFor example, suppose a is '1024' and s is '010'. Sorting s in descending order gives ['1', '0', '0']. Then, for the first digit of a, which is '1', we check if there's a digit in the sorted s that's larger than '1'. The first element is '1', which is not larger. So we can't replace it. Wait, but maybe we can replace it with a larger digit? Wait no, the sorted s is ['1', '0', '0'] here. So the first digit is 1, same as the original. So we can't replace it. Then move to the next digit.\n\nThe second digit is '0'. The next available digit in s is '1' (the first element). Since 1 is larger than 0, we replace it. Then, we remove that element from the sorted list. Then, proceed.\n\nThen the third digit is '2'. The next available in s is '0' (since after using '1', the remaining are '0's). 0 is smaller than 2, so no replacement. Then the fourth digit is '4', same as before. So the result would be 1124, which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Sort the s digits in descending order.\n2. Iterate over each digit in a from left to right.\n3. For each digit in a, check if the first element in the sorted s is larger than the current digit. If yes, replace it with that element, and remove that element from s. Else, leave it as is.\n4. Continue until all digits in a are processed or all elements in s are used.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nSince the length of a and s can be up to 1e5, we need an efficient way. Sorting s in O(m log m) time is acceptable. Then, for each digit in a, we check the first element of the sorted list. But if we use a priority queue (max heap), perhaps that's better. However, in Python, the easiest way is to sort the list and then process it greedily.\n\nWait, but if we sort s in descending order, and then for each digit in a, we check if the next available digit in s is larger than the current digit. Let's think of the sorted s as a list, and we have a pointer starting at 0. For each digit in a, if the current s[pointer] is larger than the current digit, we replace it and increment the pointer. Otherwise, we leave it. But this is only correct if we process the digits in a in order, and for each, take the largest possible available digit.\n\nYes. Because once we have sorted s in descending order, the first element is the largest. So for the first digit of a, if we can replace it with the largest possible digit (if it's larger than the current digit), then we should do that. Then for the next digit, take the next largest available, etc.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Convert the string s into a list of characters (digits), then sort them in descending order. So for example, s = '010' becomes ['1', '0', '0'].\n\n- Then, iterate through each character in the original number a. For each position i:\n\n   - If there are remaining digits in the sorted",
