The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Nikephoros and Polycarpus play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. Each character is R, S, or P.\n\nThe challenge is that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about how the sequences work. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo for each round, we need to determine who wins. But with n up to 2e9, checking each round one by one is impossible. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, compute the number of wins in one full cycle, then multiply by the number of cycles and add the remainder.\n\nBut what's the cycle here? The combined sequences of A and B. The total possible combinations of their moves would repeat after LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the pattern of their moves repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length.\n2. For each round in 0 to period_length-1, compute who wins (if anyone), and count the number of wins for each player in this period.\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period_length.\n4. The remaining rounds are remainder = n % period_length.\n5. The total wins for each player is total_periods * (wins in one period) + wins in the first 'remainder' rounds of the period.\n\nBut how do I compute the wins in one period?\n\nFirst, compute the LCM of m and k. To compute LCM, I can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but it returns the absolute value. However, since m and k are positive, that's okay.\n\nOnce I have the period_length, I can loop through each of the period_length rounds. For each round i (from 0 to period_length-1), get A's move and B's move. Then determine who wins.\n\nBut for each i, the move for A is A[i % m], and for B is B[i % k]. So for each i in 0..period_length-1, compute that.\n\nBut period_length could be up to m*k. Since m and k are up to 1000, m*k is up to 1e6, which is manageable. Because even if m and k are 1000 each, the period_length is 1e6, and for each of those, we can compute the outcome. Then, for n up to 2e9, the total computation is O(1e6) which is acceptable.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the period_length rounds, the outcome. For each round, check if A's move beats B's move, or vice versa. Count the number of times Nikephoros loses (which adds to his red spots) and Polycarpus loses (adds to his).\n\nOnce we have the counts for one period, multiply by total_periods = n // period_length. Then, for the remaining rounds (remainder = n % period_length), compute how many wins in the first 'remainder' rounds of the period.\n\nSo, for example, if n is 7, and period_length is 6, then total_periods is 1 (7//6=1), remainder is 1. So we add the first 1 rounds of the period.\n\nNow, how to compute the outcome between two moves.\n\nLet's make a helper function: given a and b (each being 'R', 'S', or 'P'), return who wins. For example:\n\nIf a is 'R' and b is 'S', then A wins, so B gets a pinch (so Nikephoros's loss count increases by 1? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a pinch. If Nikephoros loses, then he gets a pinch.\n\nSo",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently computing the results over a potentially enormous number of rounds (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cycles**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The combined sequence of moves will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their individual sequences. This LCM determines the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n2. **Efficient Simulation**: Instead of simulating each round individually, we simulate one full period of moves (determined by the LCM of the sequence lengths). We then compute how many full periods fit into the total number of rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n3. **Outcome Calculation**: For each round in the period, determine the winner and count the losses for each player. Multiply the counts by the number of full periods and add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    lcm = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the results for one full period\n    nikephoros_losses = 0\n    polycarpus_losses = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        \n        # Determine who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a pinch\n            polycarpus_losses += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a pinch\n            nikephoros_losses += 1\n    \n    total_periods = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nike = total_periods * nikephoros_losses\n    total_poly = total_periods * polycarpus_losses\n    \n    # Now compute the remainder part\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        \n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            polycarpus_losses += 1\n        else:\n            nikephoros_losses += 1\n    \n    total_nike += nikephoros_losses\n    total_poly += polycarpus_losses\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the move sequences is calculated to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within one period, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome of each round is recorded.\n4. **Handling Full Periods and Remainder**: The total number of full periods and the remaining rounds are computed. The results from full periods are multiplied by their counts, and the remaining rounds are processed individually.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses for each player is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the potentially very large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating pattern of moves, thus avoiding a direct simulation of each round.",
