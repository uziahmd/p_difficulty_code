The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly is impossible. We need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Nikephoros uses sequence A, which repeats cyclically. Similarly for Polycarpus with B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find what move each makes, determine the winner, and count the losses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't loop through all rounds. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be calculated once and then multiplied.\n\nLet me think: The moves for each player repeat every len(A) and len(B) rounds respectively. So the combined pattern of their moves would repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds, where m and k are the lengths of A and B. Because LCM is the least common multiple. So if we can compute the number of wins for each player in one LCM cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the remaining rounds.\n\nYes. That seems like the way to go. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length. Then, in each cycle of cycle_length rounds, the same pattern of moves repeats.\n\n2. For each round in the cycle (from 0 to cycle_length-1), determine which move each player makes, check who wins, and accumulate the counts of Nikephoros's losses and Polycarpus's losses.\n\n3. Then, calculate how many full cycles there are in n rounds: total_cycles = n // cycle_length. And the remaining rounds: remainder = n % cycle_length.\n\n4. Multiply the counts from one cycle by total_cycles, then add the counts from the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how do I compute the moves for each round? For a given round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k]. Right.\n\nSo the first thing is to compute the LCM of m and k. How to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive here, no problem.\n\nSo first, compute m and k, then compute LCM(m, k). Let's call that lcm_val.\n\nOnce I have that, I can simulate for each of the lcm_val rounds, compute the moves, determine who wins, and count the number of times each loses. Then multiply by the number of full cycles.\n\nBut wait, for n up to 2e9, and m and k up to 1000, the LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000=1e6). So for each cycle, we can simulate up to 1e6 rounds. Which is manageable, because even 1e6 operations are acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the plan is feasible.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute for each round in the cycle (from 0 to lcm_val-1):\n\nFor each i in 0..lcm_val-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine who wins. For each such pair, increment the counts for Nikephoros's loss or Polycarpus's loss.\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds (remainder), we need to simulate each of them (up to lcm_val-1 rounds, which is up to 1e6 steps). Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute lcm_val = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute the number of full cycles: total_cycles = n // lcm_val\n\nremainder = n % lcm_val\n\nNow, for the full cycles, we need to calculate the number of losses in one cycle, multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remainder, calculate the losses in the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle.\n\nSo the problem reduces to two parts: calculating the counts for one cycle, and for the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nNow, how to calculate the counts for one cycle?\n\nWe can loop for i in 0 to lcm_val-1:\n\nget a_move and b_move, then check who wins.\n\nBut how to check who wins? Let's think about the rules.\n\nEach",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a large number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player follows a cyclic strategy. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use an efficient approach leveraging the periodic nature of the players' strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Cyclic Nature**: Each player's moves repeat cyclically based on their respective sequences. The combined cycle length for both players is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **Cycle Simulation**: Calculate the number of wins and losses for each player over one full cycle of the LCM length. This allows us to avoid simulating each round individually.\n3. **Full and Remaining Cycles**: Compute the number of full cycles within the given number of rounds and handle any remaining rounds separately. Multiply the results from one cycle by the number of full cycles and add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef count_losses_in_rounds(rounds, A, B, m, k):\n    nikephoros_losses = 0\n    polycarpus_losses = 0\n    for i in range(rounds):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_move = A[a_idx]\n        b_move = B[b_idx]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine winner\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            polycarpus_losses += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nikephoros_losses += 1\n    return nikephoros_losses, polycarpus_losses\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    lcm_val = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of full cycles and remainder\n    total_cycles = n // lcm_val\n    remainder = n % lcm_val\n    \n    # Calculate losses in one LCM cycle\n    cycle_nike, cycle_poly = count_losses_in_rounds(lcm_val, A, B, m, k)\n    \n    # Calculate losses for full cycles\n    total_nike = cycle_nike * total_cycles\n    total_poly = cycle_poly * total_cycles\n    \n    # Calculate losses for the remainder\n    if remainder > 0:\n        rem_nike, rem_poly = count_losses_in_rounds(remainder, A, B, m, k)\n        total_nike += rem_nike\n        total_poly += rem_poly\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is computed to determine the cycle length.\n3. **Loss Counting Function**: This function calculates the number of losses for each player over a given number of rounds by iterating through each round and checking the outcome based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors.\n4. **Full Cycle Calculation**: The number of full cycles within `n` rounds is determined, and the losses from one cycle are multiplied by this count.\n5. **Remaining Rounds Handling**: Any remaining rounds after accounting for full cycles are processed separately to accumulate the final loss counts.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles up to 2 billion rounds by leveraging the periodicity of the players' strategies, ensuring optimal performance.",
