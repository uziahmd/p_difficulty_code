Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that we have an undirected graph with given flow values on each edge, and we need to assign directions to these edges such that the flow is valid. The conditions are that for each vertex except the source (1) and sink (n), the incoming flow equals outgoing flow. Also, the source has no incoming edges, the sink has no outgoing edges, and the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are ensuring flow conservation and acyclicity. But how do we approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that in a maximum flow problem, the flow conservation holds for all vertices except the source and sink. Since the problem states that the given flows are part of a maximum flow, we need to assign directions such that these flows satisfy the conservation laws.\n\nBut how do we assign the directions? One approach is to model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation is maintained. However, since the original graph is undirected, we need to find a way to direct edges properly.\n\nWait, but the problem also requires that the directed graph has no cycles. That's an important condition. How can we ensure that? Maybe by building a DAG (directed acyclic graph) structure. One common way to make a DAG is to arrange the nodes in a topological order and direct edges accordingly. For example, if we can assign a topological order where all edges go from earlier nodes to later ones, then there's no cycle.\n\nSo perhaps we can perform a topological sort on some structure. But how to determine the direction of edges based on that?\n\nAlternatively, think about the flow conservation. For each node except source and sink, the sum of flows entering must equal the sum leaving. Let's consider each edge's flow as a value. For each node v (not 1 or n), the total flow going into it must equal the total flow going out. But since each edge's flow is fixed, the direction determines whether it contributes to incoming or outgoing.\n\nLet me think: For each node v (excluding 1 and n), the sum of ci for edges directed into v must equal the sum of ci for edges directed out of v. Which implies that the total sum of all edges connected to v must be even? Wait, no. Because each edge contributes once to either in or out. So for each node, the sum of all edges connected to it is (in + out). But since in = out, the total sum must be 2*in. Therefore, the sum of all ci for edges connected to v must be even. Wait, but the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. So maybe that's guaranteed. But the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists, so we don't have to check that.\n\nBut how do we assign the directions?\n\nAnother thought: The problem is similar to finding an orientation of the edges such that the flow conservation holds. This is equivalent to finding an Euler tour or something else? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering the flow as a directed graph. The flow must form a DAG. So maybe we can model this as building a directed graph where all edges are directed from parent to child in a tree structure. But the graph may not be a tree.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any DAG. So perhaps we can construct a DAG by assigning directions in a way that ensures that the flow conservation holds.\n\nAnother approach: Think of the flow as a directed graph, and we need to find a way to assign directions to edges so that the flow conservation is satisfied. Since the graph is connected, perhaps we can perform some kind of traversal and assign directions based on that.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node except source and sink, the net flow is zero. So, the sum of flows on edges directed away from the node must equal the sum of flows directed towards the node.\n\nThis is similar to finding a directed graph where the in-degree (summing the flows) equals the out-degree for all nodes except source and sink. For the source, the outflow is equal to the total flow (since no inflow), and for the sink, the inflow is equal to the total flow.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nMaybe we can model this as a flow network and find an orientation. However, since the flows are already given, the direction assignment is just about choosing which direction each edge takes.\n\nAnother idea: Treat this as an Eulerian trail problem. For each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges connected to it must be even. Because the sum of in-flow and out-flow is equal, so total is twice the in-flow. So the sum of flows for each node (except source and sink) must be even. However, the problem says that a solution exists, so this is guaranteed.\n\nBut again, how to assign directions?\n\nWait, here's a possible approach. Let's imagine that the flow is a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds. Then, the problem reduces to finding such a direction. However, the problem also requires that the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nSo, perhaps we can build a DAG by using a topological order. Let's say we arrange the nodes in a topological order, and for each edge, we direct it from the node that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. However, how to choose the order such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG and satisfies flow conservation. How?\n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, there must be a topological order. Let's assign a topological order to the nodes, say, from 1 to n. Then, for each edge, we direct it from the node that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. However, this might not satisfy the flow conservation. So how can we choose the order to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow conservation as a system of equations. For each node v (except 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v minus the sum of flows directed into v equals zero. Which is equivalent to the sum of flows on edges directed out of v equals the sum of flows directed into v. But since each edge is either in or out, the total for each node is sum_{edges} c_i = (outflow + inflow) = 2 * outflow. Therefore, sum_{edges} c_i must be even. Which is guaranteed by the problem's input.\n\nBut how to assign directions?\n\nAnother approach: Let's model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed such that the flow conservation is satisfied. To do this, perhaps we can construct a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal in and out flow. This is similar to finding an Eulerian trail, but for the entire graph.\n\nWait, for each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges connected to it must be even. Because the sum of in and out is twice the outflow. So, for example, if a node has sum of flows S, then S must be even. But the problem says that the input is valid, so we don't need to check this.\n\nNow, perhaps we can model this as a problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it minus the sum directed towards it equals the required value. For the source, it's the total flow (since all flows are outgoing). For the sink, it's the negative of the total flow. For other nodes, it's zero.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a flow network where we have to assign directions to edges such that the flow conservation is met. But since the flows are already given, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph and find the direction of edges such that the flow is valid.\n\nWait, but how can we find that? It seems like a problem of finding an Eulerian orientation. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: The problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles. So, perhaps the directed graph is a DAG. In a DAG, there is a topological order. Let's imagine that we have a topological order, and for each edge, we direct it from the earlier node to the later node. Then, the DAG is acyclic. Now, how can we choose the topological order such that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source and assign directions based on the traversal. For example, during the traversal, when visiting a node, we can direct the edges towards unvisited nodes. But how does that relate to the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow as a directed graph where each edge's direction is determined by the difference between the flows. For example, for each node, we can calculate the excess flow. The excess flow for a node is the total flow of edges connected to it. For the source, the excess is the total outflow (since no inflow), and for the sink, it's the total inflow. For other nodes, the excess must be zero.\n\nWait, but how to compute that? Let's take an example. Suppose we have a node v. Let's say the sum of flows on edges connected to v is S. For the flow conservation, the sum of flows directed out of v must be S/2. Because in = out, so in + out = S => 2*out = S => out = S/2. So, for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows directed out of it must be S/2.\n\nBut how to compute this? It seems like a problem of finding an orientation where each node has a certain outflow.\n\nThis seems similar to finding a directed graph where each node has a specified outflow. But how?\n\nThis looks like a problem of finding a flow decomposition. However, I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nWait, here's another idea. Let's model this as a directed graph where the direction of each edge is determined by the flow. We can think of the flow as a directed graph, and we need to ensure that the flow conservation holds. However, since the flows are given, the direction is determined by how much flow is passing through each edge.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be solved by constructing a directed spanning tree. For example, building a directed tree where the edges are directed away from the root (source), and then assigning directions to other edges accordingly. However, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can assign a topological order. Let's say we have a topological order where the source is first, and the sink is last. Then, all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes. Now, for each node except the source and sink, the sum of flows on edges directed out of it must equal the sum of flows directed into it. How can we ensure that?\n\nWait, but if all edges are directed from earlier to later in the topological order, then for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges going into v (from earlier nodes) plus the sum of flows on edges going out of v (to later nodes) equals the total sum of flows connected to v. For flow conservation, the sum of flows going out of v must equal the sum of flows going into v. So, the total sum of flows connected to v must be even, and the outflow is half of that.\n\nBut how can we choose the topological order such that this condition holds?\n\nThis seems like a chicken and egg problem. How can we choose the topological order based on the flows?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge is directed from u to v if we decide so. The flow conservation for each node (except source and sink) requires that the sum of flows on edges directed out of the node equals the sum of flows directed into the node. Let's denote for each node v, the required outflow as O_v. For the source, O_1 is the total flow (since all flow starts there). For the sink, O_n is zero (since all flow ends there). For other nodes, O_v is (sum of flows connected to v)/2.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges to achieve this?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is O_v. How to compute this?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding an orientation of edges such that each node has a specified out-degree. However, in our case, the out-degree is weighted (each edge contributes its flow value to the out-degree).\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a flow network. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model this as a directed graph and use some kind of greedy approach. For example, starting from the source, we can assign directions to edges in a way that balances the outflow and inflow.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node has a certain \"balance\" that needs to be achieved. For instance, for node v, the balance is O_v. Then, for each edge between u and v, we can decide whether to direct it from u to v or vice versa, adjusting the balance of u and v accordingly.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy algorithm. For example, we can process the edges and for each edge, decide the direction based on the current balance of the nodes.\n\nLet me think: For each node, we track the remaining outflow that needs to be achieved. Initially, for the source, the required outflow is the total flow (sum of all flows connected to it divided by ... no, wait. Wait, for the source, the outflow must be equal to the total flow. Because the source has no incoming edges. So, the sum of flows on edges directed out of the source must equal the total flow. Similarly, for the sink, the sum of flows directed into it must equal the total flow.\n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nLet me re-calculate the required outflow for each node. For node v:\n\nIf v is the source (v=1), then the outflow is equal to the total flow of the maximum flow. But since the given flows are part of the maximum flow, perhaps the sum of all flows on edges connected to the source is equal to the maximum flow. Wait, but the maximum flow is the flow from source to sink. So, the sum of all flows on edges leaving the source would be equal to the maximum flow. Similarly, the sum of flows on edges entering the sink is equal to the maximum flow.\n\nBut how can we compute that? Well, the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. So, the sum of all flows on edges connected to the source (but only those directed away from the source) must be equal to the maximum flow. But how do we know what the maximum flow is?\n\nActually, the maximum flow can be computed as the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. However, since the problem doesn't give us the actual flow values, but rather the flow values for each edge (which are part of a maximum flow), perhaps the maximum flow is equal to the sum of flows on edges connected to the source (directed out of it) and also to the sum of flows on edges connected to the sink (directed into it). But since the directions are not known yet, we can't compute this directly.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me look back at the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3\n\nEdges:\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nThe output is 1, 0, 1. Let's see:\n\nThe edges are directed as:\n\nEdge 1 (3-2): direction is 1, so bi is 2, so direction is bi→ai? Or wait, the output is 0 or 1. The problem says di is 0 if direction is ai→bi, else 1. So for the first edge, which is between 3 and 2, output is 1 means direction is bi→ai, i.e., 2→3.\n\nSo the directed edges are:\n\n2 →3 (10), 1→2 (10), 3→1 (5). Wait, no. The third edge is 3-1 with ci=5. Output is 1, meaning direction is bi→ai. The original edge was ai=3, bi=1. So direction is 1 →3? No, because di=1 means direction is bi→ai. So original ai is 3, bi is 1. So direction is 1 →3? No, wait: the edge is between ai and bi. If di is 0, direction is ai→bi. If di is 1, direction is bi→ai.\n\nSo for the third edge (ai=3, bi=1, ci=5), di is 1, so direction is bi→ai, which is 1 →3. So the edges are:\n\nEdge 1: 2→3 (10)\n\nEdge 2: 1→2 (10)\n\nEdge 3: 1→3 (5)\n\nNow, checking the flow conservation:\n\nFor node 2 (which is not source or sink):\n\nIncoming edges: edge 2 (from 1→2, 10), and edge 1 (from 2→3, but that's outgoing from node 2. So incoming is 10, outgoing is 10. So yes, conserved.\n\nFor node 1 (source), no incoming edges. Outgoing is 10+5=15. Which is the max flow. For node 3 (sink), incoming is 10 (from edge 1) and 5 (from edge 3). Total 15. Which matches the max flow.\n\nSo the directed graph is a DAG. Indeed, the edges are 1→2, 1→3, 2→3. So the topological order could be 1, 2, 3. No cycles.\n\nSo how was this direction chosen?\n\nIt seems that the direction is chosen such that the flow goes from source to sink, and the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG. But how to generalize this?\n\nAnother observation: The directed graph must be a DAG. So, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order, and direct all edges from earlier nodes to later nodes. This ensures acyclicity. Then, the problem reduces to finding a topological order where for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed out of it equals the sum of flows directed into it.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order?\n\nAlternatively, since the directed graph is a DAG, we can assign a topological order, and then for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed out of it must be equal to the sum of flows directed into it.\n\nBut how to find this order?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds. To ensure that the graph is acyclic, we can build a directed tree rooted at the source, and direct all edges in the tree away from the root. Then, for other edges, we can direct them in a way that maintains the flow conservation and acyclicity.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles, we can assign a topological order. Let's imagine that we have a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and other nodes are in between. For each node, the sum of flows on edges directed out of it must be equal to the sum of flows directed into it. How to compute this?\n\nLet me think about the flow for each node. For node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges connected to it is S. The required outflow is S/2. So, during the topological order processing, for each node, we need to have exactly S/2 of the flow directed out of it.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nPerhaps, we can perform a BFS-like traversal starting from the source. For each node, we direct edges to unvisited nodes, and adjust the required outflow accordingly.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute for each node v, the required outflow O_v. For the source, O_1 is the total flow (sum of flows on edges connected to it?), but no. Wait, the source's outflow must be equal to the total flow, which is the same as the sink's inflow. But how to calculate that?\n\nActually, the total flow is the sum of all flows on edges leaving the source. However, since we don't know the directions yet, this is unknown. But perhaps the sum of all flows on edges connected to the source must be equal to the total flow, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the total flow from the source is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out of the source. Similarly, the total flow into the sink is the sum of flows on edges directed into the sink. Since the flow is maximum, these two must be equal. However, since the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow, this is ensured by the input.\n\nBut how can we compute the required outflow for the source and sink?\n\nMaybe the required outflow for the source is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it minus the required inflow. But the source has no inflow, so the outflow must be equal to the sum of flows on edges connected to it minus the inflow (which is zero). Wait, no. The sum of flows on edges connected to the source is the sum of flows on edges directed out of it plus the flows directed into it. But since the source has no incoming edges, all flows on edges connected to it are directed out of it. So the required outflow for the source is the sum of flows on edges connected to it. Similarly for the sink: the required inflow is the sum of flows on edges connected to it.\n\nBut this is only true if the directions are chosen such that the source has no incoming edges and the sink has no outgoing edges. Which is part of the problem's requirements.\n\nSo for each node:\n\n- For the source (v=1), the outflow is the sum of flows on all edges connected to it. Because all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it.\n\n- For the sink (v=n), the inflow is the sum of flows on all edges connected to it. Because all edges connected to the sink must be directed towards it.\n\n- For other nodes, the outflow must be (sum of flows on edges connected to it) / 2.\n\nBut how to ensure this?\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where the source has all edges directed away from it, and the sink has all edges directed towards it. For other nodes, we need to direct edges such that their outflow is exactly half of the sum of flows on their edges.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis sounds like a problem where we can perform a traversal, and for each node, we direct edges to balance the outflow.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can construct a directed graph where each node has a certain \"balance\" of flow that needs to be satisfied. Initially, for the source, the balance is the sum of all flows on its edges (since all must be outgoing). For the sink, the balance is the sum of flows on its edges (all must be incoming). For other nodes, the balance is (sum of flows on edges connected to it) / 2.\n\nThen, for each edge, we can decide its direction based on the balance of the nodes.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nPerhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal, and for each node, we process its edges to adjust the balance. For example, when visiting a node u, we look at all adjacent edges. For each edge between u and v, if the balance of u is positive, we direct the edge from u to v, subtracting the flow from u's balance and adding it to v's balance. Otherwise, we direct it from v to u, adding the flow to u's balance and subtracting from v's balance. But this seems a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the balance as the amount of flow that needs to be sent out from the node. For example, initially, for the source, balance is the sum of flows on its edges. For other nodes, balance is (sum of flows on edges) / 2. For the sink, balance is zero (since all flows are incoming).\n\nWait, no. For the sink, the required inflow is the sum of flows on its edges. But since the inflow is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed into it, and since the sink has no outgoing edges, the balance for the sink should be zero. Wait, no. For the sink, the outflow is zero. So the inflow must be equal to the total flow. But how does this fit into the balance concept?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be a DAG, we can assign a topological order and direct all edges from earlier to later. For the topological order, we can choose it such that the source is first and the sink is last. Then, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed out of it (i.e., to nodes after it in the order) must be equal to the required outflow.\n\nSo, how can we find such a topological order?\n\nLet's think recursively. Start with the source. For each node, we can process it, and direct edges to nodes that come later in the order. But how to choose the order so that the required outflow is achieved?\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, process the nodes in an order where each node's required outflow is satisfied by directing edges to unprocessed nodes.\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\n- The source is processed first. All edges connected to it are directed away from it (since it's first in the order). This contributes to the outflow of the source.\n\n- For other nodes, when they are processed, we direct edges to nodes that have not been processed yet (so they are later in the order), and adjust the required outflow.\n\nBut how to compute which edges to direct and which not?\n\nLet's think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute for each node v, the required outflow O_v.\n\n   - O_1 = sum of flows on edges connected to 1.\n\n   - O_n = 0 (since all edges connected to n must be directed into it).\n\n   - For other nodes v, O_v = (sum of flows on edges connected to v) / 2.\n\n2. Construct a directed graph by assigning a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and for each node v (processed in order), we direct edges to unprocessed nodes in a way that the outflow of v is satisfied.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\n- We'll maintain a priority queue or some structure that allows us to select the next node to process. For example, nodes with zero remaining required outflow can be processed first.\n\n- When processing a node v, we look at all its adjacent edges. For each edge connecting v to u, if u hasn't been processed yet, we direct the edge from v to u. This adds the flow ci to v's outflow and subtracts it from u's required outflow. Wait, no. The required outflow for v is O_v. By directing the edge from v to u, we contribute ci to v's outflow. So, we need to ensure that the total contribution of all such edges is O_v.\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be handled with a greedy algorithm. Here's an idea:\n\nWe can start with the source node. We process it first. All edges connected to it are directed away from it (since the source is first in the topological order). This contributes to the outflow of the source, which must be equal to O_1. Since O_1 is the sum of flows on edges connected to it, this is satisfied.\n\nNext, we process other nodes. For each node v (not source or sink), we need to direct edges to unprocessed nodes (those that come after it in the topological order) such that the sum of flows on directed edges from v is O_v.\n\nBut how to choose which nodes to process next?\n\nMaybe we can use a priority queue or some other method to select nodes that have their required outflow already satisfied by the edges directed away from them. For example, once a node's outflow is fully satisfied, we can process it next.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitialize for all nodes:\n\n- For each node v, compute O_v as described.\n\n- For the sink, O_n is zero. All edges connected to it must be directed towards it. So, when processing other nodes, any edge between a processed node and the sink is directed towards the sink.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me try to outline the algorithm:\n\n1. Compute O_v for all nodes.\n\n2. Create a queue of nodes to process. Initially, the source is added to the queue.\n\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n\n   a. Dequeue a node u.\n\n   b. For each edge (u, v) in the original undirected graph:\n\n      i. If v has not been processed yet:\n\n         - Direct the edge from u to v.\n\n         - Subtract ci from O_v (since this ci contributes to the outflow of u, and O_v is the required outflow of v. Wait, no. The outflow of u increases by ci, and the outflow of v is determined by its own O_v. Hmm, this part is confusing.)\n\n         - Subtract ci from O_u (since we are using this ci to contribute to the outflow of u). Wait, O_u is the required outflow for u. Once we direct an edge from u to v, this contributes ci to u's outflow. So we need to subtract this from the remaining outflow that u needs to achieve.\n\n         - So, for example, O_u starts as the required outflow. Each time we direct an edge from u to another node, we subtract ci from O_u. Once O_u reaches zero, we can process the node u and add it to the queue.\n\n         - But what about v? When we direct an edge from u to v, this contributes ci to the outflow of u. But for v, this edge is incoming. So, for v, this contributes ci to its inflow. But since v's required outflow is O_v, we need to account for this. However, since v is not yet processed, we can't do anything about it now.\n\n   c. After processing all edges of u, if O_u is zero, then we add all adjacent nodes that haven't been processed yet to the queue? Or wait, no. We need to process nodes whose outflow has been fully satisfied.\n\nThis seems like a possible approach. Let me try to think of an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nNodes 1, 2, 3.\n\nO_1 is sum of flows on edges connected to 1: edges are (1-2:10) and (3-1:5). So O_1 = 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nO_2 is sum of flows on edges connected to 2: 10 (from 1-2) and 10 (from 3-2). Sum is 20, so O_2 = 10.\n\nO_3 is sum of flows on edges connected to 3: 10 (from 3-2) and 5 (from 3-1). Sum is 15. Since it's the sink, O_3 is 0.\n\nInitially, the queue contains node 1.\n\nProcess node 1:\n\nLook at edges connected to 1:\n\nEdge 1-2 (ci=10). Node 2 is not processed. Direct from 1→2. Subtract 10 from O_1 (now 15-10=5). Add this edge to the output as direction 0.\n\nEdge 3-1 (ci=5). Node 3 is not processed. Direct from 1→3. Subtract 5 from O_1 (now 5-5=0). Add this edge to output as direction 0.\n\nNow, O_1 is zero. So, we can add node 1 to the processed set.\n\nNow, we need to process nodes whose O is zero? Or perhaps add their adjacent nodes to the queue? Or wait, the queue is for nodes that have their O fulfilled and can be processed to direct their edges.\n\nWait, in this case, after processing node 1, we have directed two edges. Now, what about node 2 and node 3?\n\nNode 2 has O_2 = 10. Node 3 has O_3 = 0.\n\nBut node 3 is the sink, and its O is zero. So we can process it next. However, node 3 has edges to 2 and 1. But node 1 is already processed. So when processing node 3, we look at its edges. But since it's the sink, all edges must be directed towards it. However, the edge between 3 and 2 is undirected. So for this edge, since node 2 is not processed yet, and node 3 is being processed, we need to direct it towards node 3. But how?\n\nWait, the algorithm above would process node 3, but node 3's O is zero. So, during processing node 3, for each edge connected to it, if the other end hasn't been processed, we direct the edge towards node 3. Because node 3 is the sink, all edges must be directed into it.\n\nSo, for the edge between 3 and 2, which hasn't been processed yet (node 2 is not processed), we direct it from 2 to 3. But according to the algorithm, when processing node 3, we look at edges connected to it. For each edge (u, v) where v is node 3 and u is unprocessed, we direct the edge from u to v. But wait, no. If we are processing node 3, and looking at its edges, then for each edge between 3 and u, if u is unprocessed, we need to direct the edge from u to 3 (since 3 is the sink and must receive all flows). But in the current algorithm, when processing node 3, we would look at its edges. For example, the edge between 3 and 2. u is 2, which is unprocessed. So we direct it from 2 to 3. This contributes ci=10 to the outflow of node 2. But node 2's O is 10. So, after this, O_2 becomes 10 - 10 = 0. Then, node 2 can be added to the queue.\n\nBut how does this fit into the algorithm?\n\nMaybe the algorithm should be:\n\nFor each node u processed, we look at all its edges. For each edge (u, v), if v is not processed, we direct the edge from u to v. This contributes ci to the outflow of u, and thus subtracts ci from O_u. If O_u becomes zero, we add it to the queue.\n\nBut when we process node 3 (sink), we look at its edges. For each edge (u, 3), if u is not processed, we direct the edge from u to 3. This contributes ci to the outflow of u, subtracting ci from O_u. For example, in the sample input, when processing node 3, the edge between 3 and 2 is directed from 2 to 3. This contributes 10 to the outflow of node 2, which was O_2 = 10. So O_2 becomes 0, and node 2 is added to the queue.\n\nThen, when processing node 2, we look at its edges. The edges are 1-2 (already processed), 3-2 (processed), and possibly others. But since all edges have been processed, nothing happens.\n\nThis seems to work for the sample input. Let's see:\n\nSteps:\n\nInitial queue: [1]\n\nProcess 1:\n\n- Edge to 2: direct 1→2. O_1 becomes 15-10=5.\n\n- Edge to 3: direct 1→3. O_1 becomes 5-5=0. Add 1 to processed.\n\nNow, O_1 is zero. So, what next? The queue is empty. But node 3 has O_3 = 0. How to process it?\n\nAh, perhaps the initial queue should include all nodes with O_v = 0. But for the sink, O is zero. So in this case, after processing node 1, we add node 3 to the queue.\n\nWait, but how do we know which nodes to add to the queue? Maybe during processing, whenever a node's O becomes zero, it is added to the queue. But initially, only the source has O_v = sum of flows (unless it's zero, which is unlikely).\n\nSo, after processing node 1, O_1 becomes zero. So we add it to the queue? Or wait, the queue is for nodes that are ready to be processed. Wait, maybe the initial queue is for nodes that can be processed, like the source. And when processing a node, after directing edges, if the O of that node becomes zero, it is added to the queue.\n\nWait, no. The initial queue contains the source. When processing the source, we direct all edges from it to unprocessed nodes. This uses up its O, which becomes zero. Then, we add the source to the queue (or perhaps the queue is for nodes that are being processed). This part is unclear.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is:\n\n- Initialize a queue with the source.\n\n- While the queue is not empty:\n\n   - Take a node u from the queue.\n\n   - For each edge (u, v) in the original graph:\n\n      - If v is not processed yet:\n\n         - Direct the edge from u to v.\n\n         - Subtract ci from",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the direction of each edge in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies the conditions of a valid maximum flow. Specifically, the directed graph must ensure flow conservation at all vertices except the source and sink, have no incoming edges at the source, and no outgoing edges at the sink, while also being acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Flow Conservation**: For each vertex (except the source and sink), the sum of the flows on incoming edges must equal the sum of the flows on outgoing edges.\n2. **Acyclic Graph**: The directed graph must be acyclic. This can be achieved by using a topological order where edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order.\n3. **Greedy Algorithm with BFS**: We use a BFS approach starting from the source.
