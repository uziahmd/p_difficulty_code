Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The flow has to be a maximum flow, and the directed graph must not have cycles. Also, the source (vertex 1) should have no incoming edges, and all intermediate vertices must have equal in-flow and out-flow.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the constraints again. For each vertex except the source and sink (vertex n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. The source has no incoming edges, so all its edges must be outgoing. The sink has no outgoing edges, I guess? Or maybe it's allowed to have outgoing edges but the flow is accounted for.\n\nBut how do we model this? Well, the given flows are already fixed. We just need to assign directions to the edges such that the flow conservation holds and the graph is acyclic.\n\nWait, the problem says that the given ci values are the flow volumes. So the direction of each edge determines whether the flow is from ai to bi or the other way around. But the total flow must be a maximum flow. However, since the problem says that the solution exists, perhaps we don't have to worry about the actual maximum flow value, but just assign directions correctly.\n\nThe key is to find a direction for each edge such that the flow conservation holds, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, how to approach this. Let's think about the flow conservation. For each vertex v (not source or sink), the sum of flows going into v must equal the sum going out. Which implies that the net flow (outgoing - incoming) is zero. But since each edge contributes either +ci or -ci to the net flow of a vertex, depending on direction.\n\nWait, for each vertex v (except source and sink), the sum of the flows going out must equal the sum coming in. So, for each such vertex, the total flow leaving is equal to the total entering. Which means that the net flow (outflow - inflow) is zero. \n\nBut the source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. So all edges connected to it must be directed away from it. Similarly, the sink (vertex n) must have all edges directed towards it? Or not necessarily. Wait, the sink can have outgoing edges, but in the maximum flow, the sink's outflow would be zero. But since the flow is a maximum flow, perhaps the sink's outflow is zero. But how does that translate into the direction assignments?\n\nBut maybe we can model this as a directed graph where the flow conservation holds for all vertices except the source and sink. And the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nSo how to model this. One idea is to model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds. But how?\n\nAnother thought: Since the graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can arrange the vertices in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the earlier vertex in the order to the later one. However, how to ensure flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where for each vertex except the source and sink, the inflow equals outflow. Also, the source has all edges directed away, and the sink has all edges directed towards it (but maybe not, but the flow conservation for the sink isn't required).\n\nWait, the problem says that the resulting flow must be a correct maximum flow. So the flow must satisfy that the source's outflow is equal to the sink's inflow. Also, for all other vertices, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nSo the problem reduces to directing the edges such that:\n\n- For all vertices except source and sink, inflow = outflow.\n\n- Source has no incoming edges.\n\n- The directed graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, how to model this. Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that allows us to compute the flow conservation. But how?\n\nAnother approach: think of the flow as a circulation with some modifications. But since the source and sink are special, perhaps we can model this by considering the flow conservation for the intermediate nodes.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation for each node. For node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows going out must equal the sum going in. That is, the total flow through the edges adjacent to v must be balanced. Since each edge contributes exactly its ci value to either the outflow or inflow of v.\n\nSo, for each node v, the sum of ci for edges directed away from v minus the sum of ci for edges directed towards v must equal zero. Which implies that the total sum of ci for edges adjacent to v must be even? No, wait. Because for each edge, it's either contributing +ci to the outflow or -ci. So for the entire node, the sum of (outflow - inflow) is zero. Which implies that the sum of outflow equals inflow. Therefore, the total sum of all flows adjacent to the node is twice the outflow (since outflow = inflow). But that's not possible unless the sum of all ci for edges adjacent to v is even? Or maybe not. Wait, the sum of all flows adjacent to v is (inflow + outflow) = 2 * inflow. So the sum of all ci for edges adjacent to v must be even? Because 2*inflow is even. But the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists, so perhaps that's guaranteed.\n\nBut how to use this. Maybe this is not directly helpful.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph where each edge's direction is determined, and the flow conservation holds. How can we assign directions?\n\nAnother idea: the directed graph must be acyclic. So, perhaps we can arrange the vertices in a topological order, and then direct each edge from lower to higher in the order. However, how to ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, since the directed graph is acyclic, there's a topological order. Let's suppose we arrange the vertices in such an order, and then for each edge, direct it from the earlier vertex in the order to the later one. Then, the graph is acyclic. Now, how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to find such an order. Maybe we can model this as a flow problem where we need to find a direction for each edge, and then check the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where each node except the source and sink has equal inflow and outflow. Let me consider the following approach: construct a directed tree structure where each node's parent is in the direction of the flow. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can perform a topological sort. Suppose we arrange the vertices in a topological order, starting with the source (vertex 1), then others, ending with the sink (vertex n). Then, for each edge between two vertices u and v, if u comes before v in the topological order, direct the edge from u to v. Otherwise, direct it from v to u. But how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to find such an order. Maybe the topological order can be determined by some property related to the flow.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed acyclic graph where each node (except source and sink) has inflow equal to outflow. This is similar to a flow network where the flow is conserved at every node except the source and sink. However, in this case, the flow is fixed (given by the ci values), and the direction is what needs to be determined.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow conservation holds. Let's think of each edge as contributing to the flow. For each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows going into it must equal the sum of flows going out of it. So, for each such node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of it.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations. However, solving this for large n and m (up to 2e5) is impossible with standard methods.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a way to model this as a graph and find directions based on some traversal.\n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can perform a DFS or BFS traversal, and assign directions based on the traversal order. For example, during a BFS traversal, when visiting a node, we can direct edges from the current node to its neighbors that haven't been visited yet. This would create a DAG with edges directed away from the source. However, this might not ensure flow conservation.\n\nBut how can we ensure that the flow conservation holds? Maybe we can model this as a directed tree, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the example given. In the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n\nEdges:\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nThe output directions are 1, 0, 1. Which corresponds to:\n\nEdge 3-2 is directed as 2→3 (since output is 1, which means original ai=3, bi=2, so direction is bi→ai, i.e., 2→3)\n\nEdge 1-2 is directed as 1→2 (output 0).\n\nEdge 3-1 is directed as 1→3 (output 1, meaning original ai=3, bi=1, direction is bi→ai, which is 1→3).\n\nThen the flow for each node:\n\nNode 1 (source) has edges directed away. Its outflow is 10 (from 1→2) and 5 (from 1→3). Total outflow is 15.\n\nNode 2: incoming is 10 (from 1→2), outgoing is 10 (to 3). So inflow equals outflow.\n\nNode 3 (sink): incoming is 10 (from 2→3) and 5 (from 1→3). Total is 15, which matches the outflow of the source.\n\nSo the directed graph is acyclic. The edges are directed as 1→2, 2→3, 1→3. Which forms a DAG with topological order 1, 2, 3.\n\nSo, in this case, the topological order is source, then node 2, then sink. The edges are directed according to this order.\n\nAnother example: in the second sample input, the output directions are 0, 0, 1, 1, 0. Let's see:\n\nThe edges are:\n\n1-2 (10) → direction 0 → 1→2.\n\n1-3 (10) → direction 0 → 1→3.\n\n2-3 (5) → direction 1 → original is 2→3, but direction is 1 → so 3→2.\n\n4-2 (15) → direction 1 → original is 4→2, direction 1 → 2→4.\n\n3-4 (5) → direction 0 → original is 3→4, direction 0 → 3→4.\n\nThe directed edges are 1→2, 1→3, 3→2, 2→4, 3→4.\n\nNow, checking flow conservation:\n\nFor node 2 (not source or sink?), no. The sink is node 4. So node 2 is intermediate. Let's check:\n\nIncoming edges: 1→2 (10) and 3→2 (5). Total 15.\n\nOutgoing edges: 2→4 (15). So 15 equals 15. Correct.\n\nFor node 3: incoming is 1→3 (10). Outgoing is 3→2 (5) and 3→4 (5). Total 10. Correct.\n\nFor node 4 (sink), no need to check.\n\nThe directed graph has edges arranged in a way that the topological order could be 1, 3, 2, 4. So, no cycles.\n\nSo, the idea seems to be that the directed edges are arranged in a DAG, and the topological order ensures that for each edge, it's directed from earlier to later in the order. Then, the flow conservation can be achieved by ensuring that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of the flows from incoming edges equals the sum of flows from outgoing edges.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order and assign directions accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed from parent to child in a tree-like structure. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the flow conservation holds. Since the DAG has no cycles, there exists a topological order. For each node in the topological order, except the source, there must be some incoming flow. But how to ensure that the sum of the flows into the node equals the sum of flows out of it.\n\nHere's an idea: the flow conservation condition for each node (except source and sink) implies that the sum of flows on edges incident to the node is even. Wait, no. Because for a node v, the sum of all flows (inflow + outflow) is equal to twice the outflow (since inflow equals outflow). Therefore, the sum of all flows on edges incident to v must be even. However, the problem states that a solution exists, so this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to use this.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as building a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds. For this, perhaps we can model the problem as a directed graph where for each node except source and sink, the net flow is zero. This is similar to a flow network where the flow is conserved. But how to assign directions to edges.\n\nLet me think of the flow as a directed graph. For each edge, we can assign a direction. The flow on the edge is ci, and the direction determines whether it contributes to the outflow or inflow of the nodes.\n\nNow, the problem is equivalent to finding a directed graph with these edges and flows that satisfies the flow conservation for all nodes except source and sink. And the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nBut how to find such a direction.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to build a directed tree structure where the source is the root, and each node's edges are directed away from the root. However, this may not account for the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero. This is similar to a flow network with no excess except for the source and sink. But since the flows are already given, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flows are assigned to edges, and the directions are chosen to make the balance zero.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the sample solutions. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the vertices in a topological order. Then, for each edge between u and v, we direct it from the one that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. This ensures the graph is acyclic. Now, how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nLet's imagine that we perform a BFS or DFS starting from the source. For each node, we process it and assign directions to edges from it to unprocessed nodes. Then, for each node, the inflow would be the sum of flows from edges directed towards it, and the outflow would be the sum of flows from edges directed away. However, how to ensure that the inflow equals outflow for intermediate nodes.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has inflow equal to outflow. This is similar to having a circulation. But the source and sink have excess flow. However, since the flow is a maximum flow, the excess of the source is equal to the deficit of the sink.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: For each node except the source and sink, the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even. Because, as discussed earlier, inflow equals outflow, which implies that the total sum is twice the inflow. So, for each such node, the sum of ci of its edges must be even. But the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists, so this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to use this.\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero. This is similar to a flow problem where each node has a demand of zero, and the source and sink have demands of -F and F respectively, where F is the total flow. But since the flows are already fixed, perhaps this is not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it minus the sum of flows directed towards it must equal zero for intermediate nodes. For the source, it must be equal to the total flow (since all edges are directed away). For the sink, it must be equal to negative the total flow (since all edges are directed towards it).\n\nBut how to find such directions.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. Let's build a directed graph where we arrange the vertices in a certain order, and for each edge, direct it from the earlier vertex to the later one. Then, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it minus the sum of flows directed towards it is equal to the difference between the sum of flows on edges where the node is the start (u) and the sum of flows where it's the end (v). \n\nBut how to ensure that for intermediate nodes, this difference is zero.\n\nLet me think of this as a system of equations. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v (i.e., edges where v is the start) minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards v (edges where v is the end) equals zero. \n\nLet me denote for each edge (u, v), if we direct it from u to v, then it contributes +ci to u's outflow and -ci to v's inflow. Or perhaps, for node u, the outflow increases by ci, and for node v, the inflow increases by ci. But for flow conservation, the outflow must equal inflow. So for node v, the sum of outflow (edges directed away from v) minus inflow (edges directed towards v) must be zero.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a directed graph and for each node v (not source or sink), the net flow is zero. So, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum on edges directed towards v equals zero. Which implies that the total sum of flows on edges incident to v is twice the outflow (which is same as inflow). \n\nBut how to find such directions.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph with certain constraints, but solving it directly is difficult. So perhaps there's a clever way to assign directions based on a traversal.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: construct a directed graph where we perform a BFS or DFS starting from the source. For each edge, when we visit a node, we direct the edge from the current node to the unvisited neighbor. This ensures that the graph is a tree plus some extra edges, but since the graph is undirected and connected, this would form a spanning tree. However, this might not account for flow conservation.\n\nBut perhaps, if we arrange the directions based on a BFS traversal, and then for the remaining edges (non-tree edges), direct them in a way that maintains the acyclic property and flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node's flow is balanced. For this, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nWe need to assign directions to edges such that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. \n\nThis can be rephrased as: for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is equal to half of the total sum of flows on all edges incident to v. Because the total sum is (sum_away + sum_towards) = sum_away + (sum_away) = 2 * sum_away. So sum_away = total_sum / 2. \n\nAh! This is important. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must be exactly half of the total sum of flows on its incident edges. \n\nThis gives us a way to determine the direction of edges. For example, if we can find for each node v, a subset of its edges whose sum is exactly half of the total sum of its edges, then directing those edges away from v and the rest towards v would satisfy the flow conservation. \n\nBut how to find such subsets for all nodes.\n\nBut this seems like a complex problem. However, since the graph is connected and the solution exists, maybe there's a way to assign directions based on a tree structure.\n\nWait, here's an idea: construct a directed tree where the source is the root, and for each node, the edges are directed from parent to child. Then, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away (children) must be equal to the sum of flows on edges directed towards (parent). \n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero. This can be modeled as a directed graph where the flow conservation holds, and the graph is acyclic. \n\nBut how to find such a graph.\n\nAnother thought: the directed graph must be a DAG, so there's a topological order. Let's assume that the topological order starts with the source, then other nodes, then the sink. For each node in this order, the edges to nodes that come later are directed away, and edges to earlier nodes are directed towards. \n\nNow, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v (to nodes that come after it in the order) must be equal to the sum of flows on edges directed towards v (from nodes that come before it in the order). \n\nThis seems like a system of equations, but again, solving this for large n is challenging.\n\nBut perhaps, we can construct the topological order in such a way that this condition is automatically satisfied. For example, if we can find a topological order where for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges to nodes after it is equal to the sum of flows on edges from nodes before it.\n\nBut how to find such an order.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where the edges are directed from parents to children in a way that the flow conservation holds. This sounds like a dynamic programming approach. For example, during a traversal, when processing a node, we can direct the edges from the node to its children, and adjust the flow accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can perform a BFS or DFS traversal of the graph, and for each node, we direct the edges from the parent to the child. For each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it (to children) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards it (from parent). \n\nWait, for the root (source), there's no parent, so all edges are directed away. For other nodes, the flow from the parent to the node is part of the inflow. The sum of flows directed away (to children) must equal the inflow. \n\nThis way, for each node, the inflow (from parent) equals the sum of flows directed away (to children). Thus, the flow conservation is satisfied. \n\nBut how to ensure that this is possible. For example, when processing a node, we need to have the sum of flows on edges to its children equal to the inflow from the parent. \n\nLet me elaborate. Suppose we have a tree structure. For the root (source), all edges are directed away. For each child, the inflow is the flow from the parent. Then, for that child, the sum of flows directed away to its children must be equal to the inflow. \n\nThis would imply that the sum of flows on the edges from the child to its children is equal to the inflow. \n\nBut how to choose which edges to direct as children. \n\nThis seems like a way to model the problem as a directed tree, where each node's inflow equals the sum of flows on its outgoing edges. \n\nBut how to construct such a tree.\n\nLet me take the first sample input again. The source is node 1. It has edges to node 2 (10) and node 3 (5). The total flow from the source is 15. \n\nIn the sample solution, node 2 has an inflow of 10 (from node 1), and it directs the edge to node 3 (10). So the sum of outgoing flows (10) equals the inflow (10). Node 3 has inflow of 10 (from node 2) and 5 (from node 1), totaling 15. Since it's the sink, no need for conservation. \n\nBut how to build this tree. For node 1, the children are node 2 and node 3. But for node 2, the inflow is 10. To satisfy flow conservation, the sum of flows directed away from node 2 must be 10. It has an edge to node 3 with flow 10, so that works.\n\nBut how to choose which edges to include as children. \n\nThis suggests that during a traversal, when visiting a node, we need to select edges to direct away from it such that their total flow equals the inflow of the node. \n\nBut how to do that. Let's think recursively. For the root node, the inflow is zero (since it's the source). The sum of flows directed away from it must equal the total flow of the source. But since the source's outflow is the total flow, which is the sum of flows on all edges directed away from it. \n\nBut how to choose which edges to direct away from the source. \n\nWait, perhaps this approach is possible if the graph is a tree. But the graph may not be a tree. However, the problem allows for any DAG as long as the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nBut how to handle non-tree edges.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire graph as a directed tree with additional edges directed in a way that maintains the acyclic property and flow conservation. \n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's think of another angle. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, there's a topological order. Let's say we have such an order. For each node v in the topological order, we can calculate the required flow that must be passed through it. \n\nFor example, the source is first. All its edges are directed away. For each subsequent node, the sum of flows directed into it from previous nodes must equal the sum of flows directed out to later nodes. \n\nThis seems like a way to model it. Let's imagine that we have a topological order. For each node v, the sum of flows on edges from earlier nodes to v is equal to the sum of flows on edges from v to later nodes. \n\nIf we can find such a topological order, then directing the edges accordingly would satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to find such an order.\n\nMaybe we can build this order greedily. Start with the source. Then, for each node in the order, we add nodes that have their inflow already determined by the previous nodes. \n\nBut this is vague. \n\nAnother idea: the flow conservation implies that for each node v (not source or sink), the total sum of flows on its edges must be even. So, for each node v, we can compute the total sum of flows on its edges, and divide by 2. This would be the amount of flow that must leave the node (equal to the amount that enters). \n\nNow, during a traversal, for each node, we need to ensure that the sum of flows on edges directed away from it is equal to this value. \n\nLet me think of this as a directed graph where each node has a \"required outflow\" of S_v = total_flow_v / 2. \n\nFor the source, S_1 is the total flow out, which is equal to the total flow of the maximum flow. For the sink, it's not required. \n\nBut how to assign directions to achieve this.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph where each node has a required outflow, and edges are directed to meet this requirement. \n\nBut how to do this.\n\nLet me think of this as a directed graph where we want to assign directions to edges such that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is equal to S_v. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using a greedy approach. For example, during a traversal of the graph, we can process nodes in a certain order and direct edges to meet the required outflow.\n\nLet's consider a BFS approach. Start with the source. For the source, all edges are directed away. For each edge from the source to a neighboring node u, we add the flow to the required inflow of u. Then, for node u, its required outflow is S_u, which is (total_flow_u) / 2. The inflow from the source is part of this. The remaining required outflow must be met by directing other edges away from u.\n\nWait, this is getting somewhere. Let's formalize:\n\nFor each node v, let's compute S_v = total_flow_v / 2. This is the required outflow from v.\n\nInitially, the source's outflow is the sum of flows on its edges. But the source's outflow is the total flow of the maximum flow. But how to determine S_v for other nodes.\n\nBut for the intermediate nodes, the required outflow is S_v = total_flow_v / 2. \n\nLet me think of this as a flow problem where each node v (not source or sink) has a required outflow of S_v. \n\nFor the source, the required outflow is the total flow, which is the sum of all flows on edges directed away from it. For the sink, it's not required.\n\nBut how to ensure that for each node, the sum of flows directed away from it is S_v.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Compute for each node v, the total_flow_v, which is the sum of ci for all edges incident to v.\n\n- For each node v (not source or sink), compute S_v = total_flow_v / 2. This must be an integer since the problem guarantees a solution.\n\n- Perform a BFS or DFS starting from the source. For each node, when we visit it, we direct edges to unvisited nodes in such a way that the sum of flows on these edges is equal to the remaining outflow required for the node.\n\nWait, for example, when processing a node u, we have already received some inflow from previous edges. The outflow required for u is S_u. We need to direct edges from u to unvisited nodes such that the sum of their flows is equal to the remaining outflow needed. \n\nBut how to manage this. \n\nLet me take the first sample input again. For node 2:\n\ntotal_flow_v = 10 (edge to 1) + 10 (edge to 3) = 20. S_v = 10.\n\nWhen we process node 2, we have already received inflow of 10 from node 1. So the required outflow is 10. We have an edge to node 3 with flow 10. Directing it away from node 2 will contribute 10 to the outflow, which meets the requirement. \n\nThis suggests that during the traversal, when visiting a node, we can direct edges to unvisited nodes until the required outflow is met.\n\nThis seems promising. Here's a possible algorithm:\n\n1. Compute for each node v, total_flow_v = sum of ci for edges incident to v.\n\n2. For each node v (not source or sink), compute S_v = total_flow_v / 2.\n\n3. For the source, S_1 is the total_flow_1 / 2. But wait, the source's inflow is zero, and all its edges are directed away. So the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source is total_flow_1. But according to the earlier formula, S_1 would be total_flow_1 / 2. This seems conflicting. \n\nWait, this suggests that the earlier approach may not work for the source. Let me think again. The source's outflow is equal to the total_flow_1, because all its edges are directed away. But according to the earlier formula, S_1 would be total_flow_1 / 2. This is only possible if total_flow_1 is zero, which it's not. So there's a mistake in the earlier reasoning.\n\nAh, right! The earlier formula applies to nodes other than source and sink. For the source, the outflow is equal to the total_flow_1, and there's no requirement for it to be equal to anything else. Similarly, the sink has inflow equal to total_flow_sink, and no requirement for outflow.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nFor each node v not source or sink, the sum of flows directed away from v must be equal to S_v = total_flow_v / 2.\n\nThe source's outflow is the sum of flows directed away from it, which is equal to the total_flow_1. But since the source has no incoming edges, this is allowed.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- For each node v (not source or sink), compute S_v = total_flow_v / 2.\n\n- Perform a BFS/DFS traversal, starting from the source. For each node, when we visit it, we direct edges to unvisited nodes such that the sum of flows on these edges is equal to the required outflow for the node.\n\nBut how to ensure this.\n\nLet me think of the traversal as follows:\n\n- Maintain for each node, the amount of outflow that still needs to be directed away from it. Initially, for the source, this is total_flow_1 (since all edges must be directed away from it). For other nodes, initially it's S_v.\n\n- When visiting a node u, for each edge incident to u that connects to an unvisited node v, we can direct the edge from u to v. This contributes ci to the outflow of u and adds ci to the inflow of v. We subtract ci from the remaining outflow of u. Once the remaining outflow of u is zero, we stop processing u's edges.\n\nThis way, for each node u (not source or sink), the sum of flows directed away from u is exactly S_u. \n\nFor the source, the sum of flows directed away is total_flow_1, which is the required outflow. \n\nLet's test this idea with the first sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nNodes:\n\nNode 1: edges to 2 (10), 3 (5). total_flow_1 = 15. S_1 is not computed (source).\n\nNode 2: edges to 1 (10), 3 (10). total_flow_2 = 20 → S_2 = 10.\n\nNode 3: edges to 2 (10), 1 (5). total_flow_3 = 15. S_3 is not computed (sink).\n\nTraversal starts at node 1. Its remaining outflow is 15.\n\nProcess node 1's edges. For each edge, if the other node is unvisited, direct it away from node 1.\n\nAssume we process edges in some order. Let's say first process edge 1-2 (10). Direct it from 1 to 2. This contributes 10 to node 1's outflow. Remaining outflow for node 1 is 5. Next, process edge 1-3 (5). Direct it from 1 to 3. Remaining outflow for node 1 is 0. Now, node 1 is done.\n\nNext, visit node 2 (since it was processed via the edge from 1). Its required outflow is 10. Current remaining outflow is 10.\n\nCheck its edges. Edge to 1 is already directed from 1 to 2, so no action. Edge to 3 is unvisited. Direct from 2 to 3. This contributes 10 to node 2's outflow, which meets the required 10. Now, node 2 is done.\n\nNext, visit node 3 (via edge from 1). Its required outflow is 0 (since it's the sink). So no further processing.\n\nThus, the directions are:\n\nEdge 1-2 → 1→2 (0).\n\nEdge 3-2 → 2→3 (original is 3-2, direction is 1 → so output 1 for this edge? Wait, the original input for edge 3-2 is ai=3, bi=2, ci=10. If we direct it from 2→3, then the direction is bi→ai? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the original edge is undirected between ai and bi. When we direct it from u to v, then for the original input edge (ai, bi), if u is ai and v is bi, then direction is 0. If u is bi and v is ai, then direction is 1.\n\nSo for the edge between 3 and 2, which was originally given as ai=3, bi=2, ci=10. If we direct it from 2 to 3, then the direction is bi (2) to ai (3)? No, the original edge is between ai and bi. So if the edge is directed from 2 to 3, then the original ai is ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions and is acyclic.
