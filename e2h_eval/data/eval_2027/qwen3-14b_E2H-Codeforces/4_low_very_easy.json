The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about simulating a game of rock-paper-scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each of n rounds, we need to determine who wins each round and count the number of times each player gets pinched (i.e., loses a round). The output is two numbers: the count for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nConstraints are that n can be up to 2e9, which is a huge number. So simulating each round step by step is impossible because that would take O(n) time, which is way too slow for n up to 2 billion. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how the sequences work. Both players have their own sequences that repeat cyclically. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is A of length m, then in round i (starting from 0?), his move is A[i % m]. Similarly for Polycarpus's sequence B of length k.\n\nThe key is to find for each round, what moves each player makes, determine the winner, and accumulate the counts. But with n up to 2e9, we can't process each round individually. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, compute the number of wins in one full cycle, and then multiply by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nFirst, let's think about the total number of possible unique pairs of moves. Since each player's sequence repeats, the combination of their moves will also repeat after some period. The period would be the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences, m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, and the same moves will be repeated again.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call this period_length. For example, if m=3 and k=4, LCM(3,4)=12. So every 12 rounds, the pattern of moves repeats.\n\n2. Compute for each round in the period (from 0 to period_length-1), what the moves are for each player, determine the outcome, and count how many times each player loses in this period. Let's say in one period, Nikephoros loses x times and Polycarpus loses y times.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period_length. The remaining rounds are remainder = n % period_length.\n\n4. So the total losses would be total_periods * x + losses_in_remainder_rounds for Nikephoros, and similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nBut how to compute x and y for one period?\n\nBut wait, the period_length could be very large. For example, if m and k are both 1000, then LCM(m,k) could be up to 1e6. But since m and k are up to 1000, LCM(m,k) is up to 1e6. So even for the worst case, processing each of the period_length rounds is manageable, since 1e6 is acceptable for a loop.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the LCM of m and k. Then simulate each round for the period_length rounds. For each round, compute the moves of both players, determine who wins, and accumulate the counts for the period.\n\nThen multiply by the number of full periods and add the counts from the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the main challenge is to compute the LCM, and then simulate the period.\n\nBut first, let's think about how to compute LCM. The formula is LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nWait, but for Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists. So we can compute GCD of m and k, then compute LCM.\n\nOnce we have the period_length, we can loop for each of the period_length rounds, compute the move of A and B for that round, check who wins, and count.\n\nNow, for each round i (from 0 to period_length-1):\n\nA's move is A[i % m], and B's move is B[i % k].\n\nSo for each i in 0 to period_length-1, we can compute the moves.\n\nOnce we have that, we can compute for each round in the period, how many times each player loses.\n\nOnce we have the counts per period (say, per_period_nik, per_period_poly), then:\n\ntotal_periods = n //",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results without simulating each round individually due to the potentially enormous number of rounds.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The key insight is that the combination of moves from both players will repeat after a certain period, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This gives the period after which the sequence of moves repeats.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period, determine the moves of both players and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Calculate Full Periods and Remainder**: Determine how many full periods fit into the total number of rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef count_rounds(period_length, a_seq, b_seq, m, k):\n    nik = 0\n    poly = 0\n    for i in range(period_length):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Check who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            poly += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            nik += 1\n    return nik, poly\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a_seq = input[1]\n    b_seq = input[2]\n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    period_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Compute the number of losses in one period\n    nik_per, poly_per = count_rounds(period_length, a_seq, b_seq, m, k)\n    \n    total_periods = n // period_length\n    remainder = n % period_length\n    \n    # Compute total from full periods\n    total_nik = total_periods * nik_per\n    total_poly = total_periods * poly_per\n    \n    # Compute from the remainder rounds\n    if remainder > 0:\n        nik_remain, poly_remain = count_rounds(remainder, a_seq, b_seq, m, k)\n        total_nik += nik_remain\n        total_poly += poly_remain\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences of moves for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within the period, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome of each round is checked to count the losses.\n4. **Handling Full Periods and Remainder**: The total number of full periods and the remaining rounds are computed separately. The results from these are combined to get the final counts of losses for each player.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating pattern of moves, ensuring that the solution is computed in a time-efficient manner.",
