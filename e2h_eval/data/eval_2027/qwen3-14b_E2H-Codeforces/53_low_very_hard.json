Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. The output is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and see if they appear more than once. But since the maximum length is 100, maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFor each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. Because we want the maximum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate L from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1.\n- For each L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears at least twice.\n- If found, return L as the answer.\n- If no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nBut how do I generate all substrings of a certain length and check for duplicates?\n\nFor example, for a string of length N, for each L, there are N-L+1 substrings. For each of these, we can collect them in a set, and if any substring occurs more than once, then we can return L.\n\nWait, but how to check if a substring occurs at least twice. For example, for each L, collect all substrings of that length, and check if there's at least one duplicate.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently? Well, for each L, we can loop through all possible starting indices, collect all substrings, and track their counts. If any count is >=2, then return L.\n\nBut since the maximum length is 100, even for L=50, there are 51 substrings. So for each L, the time is O(N) for checking. And since L can be up to N, the total time is O(N^2) which is acceptable for N=100.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nStart with the maximum possible L, which is len(s) // 2? Or maybe len(s) - 1? Because for example, a substring of length len(s) can't appear twice. So the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1. For example, for a string of length 3, the maximum possible L where a substring can appear twice is 2 (like 'aaa' has 'aa' appearing twice).\n\nSo for L in range from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   For each possible starting index i (from 0 to len(s) - L), take substring s[i:i+L].\n\n   Collect all these substrings in a list, then check if there are duplicates.\n\n   If there are duplicates, return L.\n\nIf after checking all possible L down to 1, none are found, return 0.\n\nWait, but how to check for duplicates? For example, for each L, collect all substrings of that length and check if any of them appears at least two times.\n\nSo for each L, we can create a set. As we iterate through the substrings, if a substring is already in the set, then we can return True for that L. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nWait, but even if there are multiple occurrences, we just need to know if there's at least two. So for example, for each substring in the current L, we can track if it's been seen before. Once any duplicate is found, we can immediately return that L as the answer.\n\nSo for each L, starting from the maximum possible, check all substrings of that length. For each substring, check if it's already been seen. If yes, return L. Else, add to the set.\n\nBut for the same L, there could be multiple substrings that have duplicates. But we just need to find if at least one exists.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            return L\n\n        else:\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but this would miss cases where a substring appears more than once but not in consecutive positions. Wait no, because for each substring, when you check if it's in the set, if it's already present, then return. So for example, if the first occurrence is at i=0, then later at i=2, the same substring is found. Then during the second check, substr is in the set, so returns.\n\nThis should work. But what about overlapping occurrences?\n\nLike for 'ababa', when L=3. The substr",
