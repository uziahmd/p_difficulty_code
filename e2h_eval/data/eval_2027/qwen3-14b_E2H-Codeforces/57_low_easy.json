His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher has the first and second tour points, but they are not paired. So, for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but the actual pairing between a and b isn't known. Wait, no—each participant has a first tour score and a second tour score. But the problem says that the input gives the first tour points as a list and the second tour as another list. But the participants' scores are given in arbitrary order. So, for example, the first participant's first tour score is a1, but their second tour score could be any of the b's. Oh right, because the problem says that the teacher has the results of both tours but not the names. So the pairing between a_i and b_j is unknown. However, the actual participants are all there, so each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa. So the problem is to consider all possible pairings of the a and b arrays (permutations of b's) and find the best and worst possible positions Vasya can have, given that there exists at least one pairing where his total is at least x.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So we have to find the best and worst possible positions he can have, considering that in the actual pairing, his total is at least x. But how do we model this?\n\nLet me think. For the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total, so that he is as high as possible. For the worst possible rank, we want to minimize his total (but still ensuring it's at least x), so that he is as low as possible.\n\nBut how do we model the possible pairings?\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe can assume that Vasya's total is as high as possible. So, to get the best possible rank, we can pair his a_i with the maximum possible b_j. But how do we find that?\n\nWait, but since the problem allows any pairing, but we need to find the best possible scenario for Vasya. So, for the best possible rank, we can choose the pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible. Then, in that case, his rank would be the best possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we need to arrange the pairings such that Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others are arranged to make his rank as bad as possible.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFirst, find the maximum possible total Vasya can have (so that he is ranked as high as possible). Then, compute how many people have a higher total than him, and how many have the same. Then, the best possible rank is 1 (if he has the max total), or depends on how others are arranged.\n\nWait, but since the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily when there are ties, the best possible rank is the minimum possible. For example, if there are k people with higher totals than him, then his best possible rank is k+1. But if there are some people with the same total, the jury can put him first among them. So, for best rank, we need to find the number of people who have a strictly higher total than him in the best scenario. Then the best rank is that count plus 1.\n\nSimilarly, for worst possible rank, we need to find the number of people who have a strictly higher total than him in the worst scenario, plus the number of people who have the same total as him (since in that case, the jury can put him last among them). So the worst possible rank is (number of people with higher total) + (number of people with same total) + 1? Or wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf there are m people with a total higher than Vasya's, and s people with same total as Vasya. Then, in the worst case, the jury can arrange all those m people to be before him, and then put him after all the s people. So his rank would be m + s + 1? No, because the m people are higher, so he is after them. Then, the s people are tied with him. The worst possible rank would be m + s + 1? Or m + 1? Because the jury can arrange the tied people in any way. For example, if there are m people higher, and s people same, then the worst possible rank is m + s + 1? Or m + 1?\n\nNo. Let's think: if there are m people with higher total than Vasya. Then, in the worst case, all those m people are placed",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours. The scores from each tour are given as separate lists, and we need to consider all possible pairings of these scores to find the optimal rankings for Vasya.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank, we assume Vasya's total score is maximized. This is done by pairing the highest score from the first tour with the highest score from the second tour, then the next highest, and so on. We then count how many participants have a higher total score than Vasya's maximum possible score.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank, we assume Vasya's total score is minimized while still being at least `x`. This is done by pairing the lowest score from the first tour with the highest score from the second tour, and vice versa. We then count how many participants have a higher total score than Vasya's minimum possible score and add the number of participants with the same score as Vasya.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort a and b for best and worst scenarios\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Best case: maximize Vasya's score\n    # Pair a_sorted and b_sorted in descending order\n    max_vasya = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_vasya += a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[n - 1 - i]\n    # Now count how many people can have a sum > max_vasya\n    # For that, we need to find the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j > max_vasya\n    # But since in best case, we have already used the max possible pairing, others can't exceed it\n    # Wait, no. Actually, the max_vasya is the maximum possible total for any participant.\n    # So in the best scenario, Vasya has the maximum possible total. So others can't have more than that.\n    # Thus, the best rank is 1.\n    best_rank = 1\n    \n    # For worst case: minimize Vasya's score but >=x\n    # Pair a_sorted with b_sorted in ascending order\n    min_vasya = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        min_vasya += a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[i]\n    # However, we need to ensure that min_vasya >= x. If not, we need to find the minimal possible total that is >=x.\n    # Wait, no. Because the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where a_i + b_j >=x. So we need to find the minimal possible total that is >=x.\n    # But how? Let's think again.\n    # For the worst case, we want Vasya's total to be as small as possible (but still >=x). To achieve this, we need to pair a_i with b_j such that their sum is minimized, but still >=x.\n    # However, this is tricky. Instead, we can find the minimal possible total that is >=x. But how?\n    # Actually, the way to get the minimal possible total for Vasya (but >=x) is to pair the smallest a with the largest b, then next smallest a with next largest b, etc. Wait, no. That would maximize the total. Wait, no. To minimize the total, we should pair the smallest a with the smallest b, etc. But that may not meet x. So perhaps the approach is to find the minimal possible total that is >=x by considering all possible pairings.\n    # However, since the problem states that there exists at least one pairing where the total is >=x, we can find the minimal possible total that is >=x.\n    # But how to compute that? It's complex. However, the note in the problem gives an example where the worst case is when Vasya's total is as low as possible but still meets x. So perhaps we can find the minimal possible total for Vasya that is >=x, and then count how many other participants have a total >= that value.\n    # Alternatively, for the worst case, we can pair a and b in such a way that Vasya's total is the minimal possible that is >=x. Then, we need to count how many other participants have a total >= that value.\n    # However, how do we find this minimal possible total? It might not be straightforward.\n    # Let's think differently. For the worst case, we want to have Vasya's total as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other participants' totals to be as high as possible. So that he is ranked as low as possible.\n    # To get the minimal possible total for Vasya that is >=x, we can take the minimal possible sum that is >=x. How?\n    # For example, if we sort a in ascending order, and b in descending order, then pair them. This would give the minimal possible sum for each participant. But how to ensure that the sum is >=x?\n    # Alternatively, we can find the minimal possible sum that is >=x by trying different pairings. But this is computationally expensive.\n    # However, given the constraints, perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n    # For the worst case, we can pair a in ascending order with b in ascending order. Then, the sum for each participant is as small as possible. But this may not be sufficient to meet x. But the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where the total is >=x. So perhaps we can find the minimal sum that is >=x.\n    # Wait, but this seems complicated. Let's refer back to the example provided in the problem statement.\n    # In the second example, the input is:\n    # 6 7\n    # 4 3 5 6 4 4\n    # 8 6 0 4 3 4\n    # For the worst case, Vasya's total is 4+3=7, which is exactly x. Then, other participants have higher totals.\n    # How was that pairing achieved? By pairing a's with b's such that the sum for Vasya is as low as possible but still meets x. But how to find that.\n    # This seems complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to find the minimal possible sum that is >=x by using a greedy approach. For example, to find the minimal sum that is >=x, we can pair the smallest a with the largest b, next smallest a with next largest b, etc. Wait, no. That would maximize the sum. Hmm.\n    # Alternatively, to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x, we can use the following approach:\n    # Sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then, for each i, pair a[i] with b[i], giving the minimal possible sum. However, this may not be sufficient. But given that there exists a pairing where the sum is >=x, we can proceed with this approach.\n    # But this is not necessarily the case. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal sum that is >=x, and then compute the worst rank based on that.\n    # However, given time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed as follows:\n    # For the worst case, we need to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya (>=x), and then count how many other participants have sum >= that value.\n    # However, how to find that minimal possible sum. Let's think about the following:\n    # To find the minimal sum that is >=x, we can sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order. Then, pair a[i] with b[n-1-i] (i.e., a's smallest with b's largest, etc.). This way, the sum for each participant is as small as possible. But this may not be the correct approach.\n    # Alternatively, for the worst case, we can pair a and b in a way that Vasya's sum is as small as possible but still >=x. To do that, we need to find the minimal sum for Vasya that is >=x, and then arrange other participants to have sums as high as possible.\n    # This seems too vague. Perhaps the correct way is to consider all possible pairs and find the minimal sum for Vasya that is >=x. However, this would be computationally expensive.\n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use the following:\n    # For the worst case, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then pair them. This way, the sum for each participant is as small as possible. Then, we can find the minimal sum for Vasya (which is the sum of the first pair, assuming that the pairing is sorted in a way that minimizes the sum for each participant).\n    # Wait, but how to ensure that the sum is >=x. This seems tricky.\n    # Let's look back at the sample input.\n    # In the first sample, all a and b are 1. So any pairing gives sum 2. So best rank is 1, worst is 5.\n    # In the second sample, the worst case for Vasya is when his sum is 7. How to get that? By pairing a=4 with b=3 (from the input: a is [4,3,5,6,4,4], b is [8,6,0,4,3,4]. So for the worst case, Vasya's sum is 4+3=7. Other participants have higher sums.\n    # So how to find that pairing? Well, in this case, the minimal possible sum that is >=x is 7.\n    # But how to find that minimal possible sum for Vasya. This seems like a problem of finding the minimal possible sum that is >=x, given that we can pair the a and b arrays in any way.\n    # This sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. To find the minimal possible sum >=x for Vasya, we can sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order, and then for each a_i, pair it with the smallest possible b_j that makes the sum >=x. But I'm not sure.\n    # Alternatively, for the worst case, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then pair them. This would give the minimal possible sum for each participant. However, this may not ensure that the sum is >=x. But the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where the sum is >=x.\n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps we can proceed with the following approach:\n    # For the best rank, we sort a and b in descending order, pair them, and calculate the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Then, count how many other participants have a sum greater than this.\n    # For the worst rank, we sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order, pair them, and calculate the minimal possible sum for Vasya (assuming it's >=x). Then, count how many other participants have a sum greater than or equal to this.\n    # However, this may not always work, but given the examples, let's try this approach.\n    \n    # Best rank calculation\n    a_desc = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    max_vasya = sum(a_desc[i] + b_desc[i] for i in range(n))\n    # Now, count how many pairs have sum > max_vasya\n    # Since max_vasya is the maximum possible sum for any participant, no one can have more than that. Hence, best rank is 1.\n    best_rank = 1\n    \n    # Worst rank calculation\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_asc = sorted(b)\n    min_vasya = sum(a_asc[i] + b_asc[i] for i in range(n))\n    # Check if min_vasya >=x. If not, we need to find another way.\n    # However, the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where the sum is >=x. So the minimal possible sum for Vasya may be less than x, but we need to choose a pairing where it is at least x.\n    # So this approach is incorrect.\n    \n    # Alternative approach for worst case:\n    # Find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x.\n    # To find this, we need to find the minimal sum s >=x such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s, and others are arranged to make him have the worst rank.\n    # However, this seems difficult.\n    \n    # Let's think differently. For the worst case, we want to minimize Vasya's total (but >=x), and maximize the number of people who have a total >= Vasya's total.\n    # So to find the worst possible rank, we can:\n    # 1. Find the minimal possible sum s >=x that Vasya can have.\n    # 2. Count how many participants have a total >=s.\n    \n    # To find s, we can use a greedy approach. Sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, pair the smallest a with the largest b, next smallest a with next largest b, etc. This way, we get the minimal possible sum for each participant, but we need to ensure that at least one of the pairs has sum >=x.\n    # However, this is not straightforward. Another approach is to find the minimal sum s >=x by checking all possible pairs.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use the following method:\n    # For the worst case, we want to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x. To find this, we can pair a in ascending order with b in ascending order, but this might not be sufficient. Alternatively, we can pair a in ascending order with b in descending order to get the minimal possible sum.\n    # However, this is unclear. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code based on the examples and the note provided.\n    \n    # For the worst case, we can sort a in ascending and b in descending, and then for each participant, their total is a[i] + b[i]. This gives the minimal possible sum for each participant.\n    # Then, we can find the minimal s >=x among these sums. But this may not be correct.\n    \n    # Alternatively, the worst case for Vasya is when his total is exactly x, and as many other participants as possible have a total >=x.\n    # So, we can assume that Vasya's total is x, and then count how many other participants have a total >=x.\n    \n    # But how to ensure that there's a pairing where Vasya's total is x. Well, the problem says that there is at least one pairing where his total is >=x. So, for the worst case, we can assume that Vasya's total is x, and then count how many participants have a total >=x.\n    \n    # However, this may not be accurate. For example, if x is 7, and some participants have a total of 7, but others have higher totals. But how to compute the number of participants with total >=x.\n    \n    # Another idea: For the worst case, the number of participants that can have a total >=x is the maximum possible. So, we can find the maximum number of participants that can have a total >=x, and then Vasya's worst rank is that number plus 1.\n    \n    # To find the maximum number of participants that can have a total >=x, we can use the following approach:\n    # Sort a in ascending order, b in descending order. Then, for each participant, their total is a[i] + b[i]. Count how many of these totals are >=x.\n    # This is because pairing a's smallest with b's largest gives the highest possible total for each participant, thereby maximizing the number of participants with total >=x.\n    \n    # Wait, no. If we want to maximize the number of participants with total >=x, we should pair a and b in a way that as many as possible a_i + b_j >=x. This can be done by sorting a in ascending and b in descending, then pairing them. This way, for each a_i, we are pairing it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been paired yet. This maximizes the number of pairs where a_i + b_j >=x.\n    \n    # So, the steps are:\n    # Sort a in ascending order, b in descending order. For each i, compute a[i] + b[i]. Count how many of these are >=x. This will give the maximum number of participants that can have a total >=x. Then, Vasya's worst possible rank is this count + 1.\n    \n    # But wait, this is for the scenario where Vasya's total is also >=x. But how does this relate to Vasya's rank?\n    \n    # For the worst case, we want to maximize the number of participants who have a total >= Vasya's total. Assuming that Vasya's total is x, the maximum number of participants with total >=x is the count we get from the above approach. Then, Vasya's worst possible rank is count + 1.\n    \n    # Let's test this with the first example:\n    # n=5, x=2\n    # a = [1,1,1,1,1], b = [1,1,1,1,1]\n    # a sorted ascending: [1,1,1,1,1]\n    # b sorted descending: [1,1,1,1,1]\n    # Each sum is 2. Count of >=2 is 5. So worst rank is 5+1? No, wait. If all 5 have total >=x, then Vasya's rank can be as bad as 5. So the count is 5, and rank is 5.\n    \n    # So the formula is: count of participants with sum >=x (including Vasya) is 'count'. Then, Vasya's worst rank is count.\n    \n    # But how to compute 'count'? Let's proceed.\n    \n    # So the plan is:\n    # For the worst case, we sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then for each i, compute a[i] + b[i]. Count how many of these sums are >=x. This count is the maximum number of participants that can have a total >=x. Hence, Vasya's worst possible rank is this count.\n    \n    # Let's test the first example:\n    # All sums are 2, which is >=x=2. count is 5. So worst rank is 5.\n    \n    # For the second example:\n    # Input:\n    # 6 7\n    # a: [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n    # b: [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n    # After sorting a ascending: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n    # b descending: [8,6,4,4,3,0]\n    # Pairing:\n    # 3+8=11 >=7\n    # 4+6=10 >=7\n    # 4+4=8 >=7\n    # 4+4=8 >=7\n    # 5+3=8 >=7\n    # 6+0=6 <7\n    # So count is 5. Hence, worst rank is 5.\n    # Which matches the sample output.\n    \n    # So this seems to work.\n    \n    # Therefore, the approach for worst rank is:\n    # Sort a in ascending order, b in descending order, compute the sum for each pair, count how many are >=x. This count is the worst rank.\n    \n    # For the best rank, since we can have Vasya's total as the maximum possible, and others can't have more than that, the best rank is 1.\n    \n    # Now, implement this:\n    \n    # Sort a in ascending, b in descending\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    count_worst = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a_asc[i] + b_desc[i] >= x:\n            count_worst += 1\n    worst_rank = count_worst\n    \n    print(best_rank, worst_rank)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: We sort both the first and second tour scores in descending order and pair them to maximize Vasya's total score. Since this is the highest possible score, Vasya's best rank is 1.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: We sort the first tour scores in ascending order and the second tour scores in descending order. This pairing ensures that we maximize the number of participants who could have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's minimum possible score (which is at least `x`).

It's complex. However, the note in the problem gives an example where the worst case is when Vasya's total is as low as possible but still meets x.

For the worst case, we want to have Vasya's total as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other participants' totals to be as high as possible. So that he is ranked as low as possible.\n    # To get the minimal possible total for Vasya that is >=x, we can take the minimal possible sum that is >=x. How?\n    # For example, if we sort a in ascending order, and b in descending order, then pair them. This would give the minimal possible sum for each participant.

Let's refer back to the example provided in the problem statement.\n    # In the second example, the input is:\n    # 6 7\n    # 4 3 5 6 4 4\n    # 8 6 0 4 3 4\n    # For the worst case, Vasya's total is 4+3=7, which is exactly x. Then, other participants have higher totals.\n    # How was that pairing achieved? By pairing a's with b's such that the sum for Vasya is as low as possible but still meets x. But how to find that.\n    # This seems complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to find the minimal possible sum that is >=x by using a greedy approach. For example, to find the minimal sum that is >=x, we can pair the smallest a with the largest b, next smallest a with next largest b, etc. Wait, no. That would maximize the sum. Hmm.\n    # Alternatively, to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x, we can use the following approach:\n    # Sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then, for each i, pair a[i] with b[i], giving the minimal possible sum. However, this may not be sufficient. But given that there exists a pairing where the sum is >=x, we can proceed with this approach.\n    # But this is not necessarily the case. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal sum that is >=x, and then compute the worst rank based on that.\n    # However, given time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed as follows:\n    # For the worst case, we need to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya (>=x), and then count how many other participants have sum >= that value.\n    # However, how to find that minimal possible sum. Let's think about the following:\n    # To find the minimal sum that is >=x, we can sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order. Then, pair a[i] with b[n-1-i] (i.e., a's smallest with b's largest, etc.). This way, the sum for each participant is as small as possible. But this may not be the correct approach.\n    # Alternatively, for the worst case, we can pair a and b in a way that Vasya's sum is as small as possible but still >=x. To do that, we need to find the minimal sum for Vasya that is >=x, and then arrange other participants to have sums as high as possible.\n    # This seems too vague.

Then, we can find the minimal sum for Vasya (which is the sum of the first pair, assuming that the pairing is sorted in a way that minimizes the sum for each participant).\n    # Wait, but how to ensure that the sum is >=x. This seems tricky.\n    # Let's look back at the sample input.\n    # In the first sample, all a and b are 1. So any pairing gives sum 2. So best rank is 1, worst is 5.\n    # In the second sample, the worst case for Vasya is when his sum is 7. How to get that? By pairing a=4 with b=3 (from the input: a is [4,3,5,6,4,4], b is [8,6,0,4,3,4]. So for the worst case, Vasya's sum is 4+3=7. Other participants have higher sums.\n    # So how to find that pairing? Well, in this case, the minimal possible sum that is >=x is 7.\n    # But how to find that minimal possible sum for Vasya. This seems like a problem of finding the minimal possible sum that is >=x, given that we can pair the a and b arrays in any way.\n    # This sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. To find the minimal possible sum >=x for Vasya, we can sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order, and then for each a_i, pair it with the smallest possible b_j that makes the sum >=x. But I'm not sure.\n    # Alternatively, for the worst case, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then pair them. This would give the minimal possible sum for each participant. However, this may not ensure that the sum is >=x. But the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where the sum is >=x.\n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps we can proceed with the following approach:\n    # For the best rank, we sort a and b in descending order, pair them, and calculate the maximum possible sum for Vasya.

Hence, best rank is 1.\n    best_rank = 1\n    \n    # Worst rank calculation\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_asc = sorted(b)\n    min_vasya = sum(a_asc[i] + b_asc[i] for i in range(n))\n    # Check if min_vasya >=x. If not, we need to find another way.\n    # However, the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where the sum is >=x. So the minimal possible sum for Vasya may be less than x, but we need to choose a pairing where it is at least x.\n    # So this approach is incorrect.\n    \n    # Alternative approach for worst case:\n    # Find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x.\n    # To find this, we need to find the minimal sum s >=x such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s, and others are arranged to make him have the worst rank.\n    # However, this seems difficult.\n    \n    # Let's think differently. For the worst case, we want to minimize Vasya's total (but >=x), and maximize the number of people who have a total >= Vasya's total.\n    # So to find the worst possible rank, we can:\n    # 1. Find the minimal possible sum s >=x that Vasya can have.\n    # 2. Count how many participants have a total >=s.\n    \n    # To find s, we can use a greedy approach. Sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, pair the smallest a with the largest b, next smallest a with next largest b, etc. This way, we get the minimal possible sum for each participant, but we need to ensure that at least one of the pairs has sum >=x.\n    # However, this is not straightforward. Another approach is to find the minimal sum s >=x by checking all possible pairs.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use the following method:\n    # For the worst case, we want to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x. To find this, we can pair a in ascending order with b in ascending order, but this might not be sufficient. Alternatively, we can pair a in ascending order with b in descending order to get the minimal possible sum.\n    # However, this is unclear. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code based on the examples and the note provided.\n    \n    # For the worst case, we can sort a in ascending and b in descending, and then for each participant, their total is a[i] + b[i]. This gives the minimal possible sum for each participant.\n    # Then, we can find the minimal s >=x among these sums. But this may not be correct.\n    \n    # Alternatively, the worst case for Vasya is when his total is exactly x, and as many other participants as possible have a total >=x.\n    # So, we can assume that Vasya's total is x, and then count how many other participants have a total >=x.\n    \n    # But how to ensure that there's a pairing where Vasya's total is x. Well, the problem says that there is at least one pairing where his total is >=x. So, for the worst case, we can assume that Vasya's total is x, and then count how many participants have a total >=x.\n    \n    # However, this may not be accurate. For example, if x is 7, and some participants have a total of 7, but others have higher totals. But how to compute the number of participants with total >=x.\n    \n    # Another idea: For the worst case, the number of participants that can have a total >=x is the maximum possible. So, we can find the maximum number of participants that can have a total >=x, and then Vasya's worst rank is that number plus 1.\n    \n    # To find the maximum number of participants that can have a total >=x, we can use the following approach:\n    # Sort a in ascending order, b in descending order. Then, for each participant, their total is a[i] + b[i]. Count how many of these totals are >=x.\n    # This is because pairing a's smallest with b's largest gives the highest possible total for each participant, thereby maximizing the number of participants with total >=x.\n    \n    # Wait, no. If we want to maximize the number of participants with total >=x, we should pair a and b in a way that as many as possible a_i + b_j >=x. This can be done by sorting a in ascending and b in descending, then pairing them. This way, for each a_i, we are pairing it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been paired yet. This maximizes the number of pairs where a_i + b_j >=x.\n    \n    # So, the steps are:\n    # Sort a in ascending order, b in descending order. For each i, compute a[i] + b[i]. Count how many of these are >=x. This will give the maximum number of participants that can have a total >=x. Then, Vasya's worst possible rank is this count + 1.\n    \n    # But wait, this is for the scenario where Vasya's total is also >=x. But how does this relate to Vasya's rank?\n    \n    # For the worst case, we want to maximize the number of participants who have a total >= Vasya's total. Assuming that Vasya's total is x, the maximum number of participants with total >=x is the count we get from the above approach. Then, Vasya's worst possible rank is count + 1.\n    \n    # Let's test this with the first example:\n    # n=5, x=2\n    # a = [1,1,1,1,1], b = [1,1,1,1,1]\n    # a sorted ascending: [1,1,1,1,1]\n    # b sorted descending: [1,1,1,1,1]\n    # Each sum is 2. Count of >=2 is 5. So worst rank is 5+1? No, wait. If all 5 have total >=x, then Vasya's rank can be as bad as 5. So the count is 5, and rank is 5.\n    \n    # So the formula is: count of participants with sum >=x (including Vasya) is 'count'. Then, Vasya's worst rank is count.\n    \n    # But how to compute 'count'? Let's proceed.\n    \n    # So the plan is:\n    # For the worst case, we sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then for each i, compute a[i] + b[i]. Count how many of these sums are >=x. This count is the maximum number of participants that can have a total >=x. Hence, Vasya's worst possible rank is this count.\n    \n    # Let's test the first example:\n    # All sums are 2, which is >=x=2. count is 5. So worst rank is 5.\n    \n    # For the second example:\n    # Input:\n    # 6 7\n    # a: [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n    # b: [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n    # After sorting a ascending: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n    # b descending: [8,6,4,4,3,0]\n    # Pairing:\n    # 3+8=11 >=7\n    # 4+6=10 >=7\n    # 4+4=8 >=7\n    # 4+4=8 >=7\n    # 5+3=8 >=7\n    # 6+0=6 <7\n    # So count is 5. Hence, worst rank is 5.\n    # Which matches the sample output.\n    \n    # So this seems to work.\n    \n    # Therefore, the approach for worst rank is:\n    # Sort a in ascending order, b in descending order, compute the sum for each pair, count how many are >=x. This count is the worst rank.\n    \n    # For the best rank, since we can have Vasya's total as the maximum possible, and others can't have more than that, the best rank is 1.\n    \n    # Now, implement this:\n    \n    # Sort a in ascending, b in descending\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    count_worst = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a_asc[i] + b_desc[i] >= x:\n            count_worst += 1\n    worst_rank = count_worst\n    \n    print(best_rank, worst_rank)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
