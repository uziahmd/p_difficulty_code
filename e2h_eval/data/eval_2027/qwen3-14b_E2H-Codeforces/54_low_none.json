Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me think about the properties of regular polygons. In a regular n-gon, each interior angle is (n-2)*180/(n) degrees. Wait, but that's for the internal angles of the polygon itself. However, here we're talking about angles formed by selecting three vertices. So maybe I need to find the measure of the angle formed when choosing three points.\n\nLet me recall that in a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. But when you pick three points, the angle at the middle point depends on how many steps apart the other points are.\n\nFor example, in a square (n=4), if you take vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at vertex 2 is 90 degrees. But if you take vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 would be 45 degrees? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe there's a formula for the angle formed by three vertices. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's say we pick three vertices v1, v2, v3, where v2 is the vertex where the angle is measured. Then, the angle depends on how many edges are between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. But since the polygon is regular, the positions are symmetric.\n\nLet me consider that the angle at v2 depends on the number of sides between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. But since the polygon is regular, the angle will depend on the number of steps between the points. Let me think: suppose we fix v2 as a vertex, and then v1 and v3 are k steps away from v2 in either direction. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, the angle formed would be determined by the arc between v1 and v3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the number of sides between v1 and v3. For example, in a regular polygon, if you pick three vertices such that there are m vertices between v1 and v3 along one side of the polygon, then the angle at v2 is determined by that m. Wait, perhaps I need to find a formula for that angle.\n\nLet me look for some references. Oh right! In a regular polygon, if you have three vertices A, B, C, with B being the vertex where the angle is measured. Then, the angle ABC depends on the number of sides between A and B and between B and C. But since the polygon is regular, the angle depends on how many steps apart A and C are from B.\n\nWait, here's a way to think about it. Let me imagine that the polygon is inscribed in a circle. Then, the angle at B is an inscribed angle. The measure of angle ABC would be half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. Wait, no. Wait, in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended at the center is twice that of the angle subtended at the circumference. So if the arc AC (not containing B) has measure θ degrees, then the angle ABC would be θ/2.\n\nBut in a regular polygon, the arc between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. So, if between A and C there are k steps (i.e., k edges), then the arc length would be k*(360/n) degrees. However, since the polygon is regular and convex, the arc AC that doesn't contain B must be less than 180 degrees. Wait, but if the polygon is regular, then for three points A, B, C arranged in order around the polygon, the arc AC that doesn't contain B would be (number of steps between A and C) * (360/n). But the angle ABC would be half of that arc?\n\nWait, maybe not. Because in the case of a square (n=4), if you take points A=1, B=2, C=3. The arc AC that does not contain B is 2 steps (from 1 to 3), which is 180 degrees. The angle ABC is 90 degrees, which is half of that. That works. Another example: in a square, if you take points A=1, B=2, C=4. Then the arc AC that doesn't contain B is 1 step (from 1 to 4, which is 90 degrees?), but wait, the arc",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and leveraging these properties to efficiently compute the closest possible angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360}{n} $ degrees. For any three vertices $ v1, v2, v3 $ where $ v2 $ is the vertex forming the angle, the angle at $ v2 $ depends on the number of steps between $ v1 $ and $ v3 $ around the polygon.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle at $ v2 $ can be calculated using the formula derived from the inscribed angle theorem. If there are $ k $ steps between $ v1 $ and $ v3 $, the angle at $ v2 $ is $ \\frac{(k-1) \\times 180}{n} $ degrees.\n3. **Optimal Angle Search**: Iterate through possible values of $ k $ (number of steps between $ v1 $ and $ v3 $) to find the angle closest to the given angle `a`. The optimal value of $ k $ is determined by minimizing the absolute difference between the computed angle and `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n    \n    # Calculate the angle for each possible k\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    for k in range(1, n // 2):\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    \n    # Now, find the vertices\n    # For best_k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 is best_k + 1?\n    # Wait, let me think again: for k steps between v1 and v3, the angle is (k-1)*180/n ?\n    # Wait earlier analysis said that the angle is (k-1)*180/n. So for k=1, it's 0 degrees? That can't be.\n    # Let me re-express the angle calculation correctly.\n    # The correct formula for angle at v2 when there are m edges between v1 and v3 is:\n    # angle = (m * 180) / n - 180 / n ? No, perhaps I need to rederive it.\n    # Let me think again: for a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle, the angle at v2 when v1 and v3 are m steps apart (in one direction) is (m * 180) / n - 180 / n ? Or maybe (m-1)*180 / n ?\n\n    # Let's take the example of square (n=4). For angle of 90 degrees, which is when v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2. That is, m=1 step between v1 and v3. Then the angle is 90 degrees. According to formula (m * 180)/n = (1 * 180)/4 = 45. Which is not right. So my previous approach was wrong.\n\n    # Alternative approach: For a regular n-gon, the angle formed at v2 by choosing v1 and v3 such that there are k vertices between v1 and v2 and k vertices between v2 and v3 (i.e., total of k steps from v1 to v2 and k steps from v2 to v3), then the angle is ( (n - 2*k - 2) * 180 ) / n ? No, this seems unclear.\n\n    # Correct formula for the angle at v2 when there are k steps between v1 and v2 and k steps between v2 and v3 (so total of k steps from v1 to v2 and k steps from v2 to v3, meaning v1 and v3 are 2k steps apart along the perimeter). However, since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 is given by:\n    # angle = ( (k) * 180 ) / n \n    # Wait, but in the case of square (n=4), if k=1, then angle is 180/4 = 45 degrees, which matches the example where selecting vertices 1,2,4 gives angle 45 degrees. But when selecting 1,2,3, the angle is 90 degrees. How does that fit?\n\n    # Let me think of another way. The angle at v2 is equal to ( (number of sides between v1 and v3) - 1 ) * (180 / n ). For example, in square, if v1 and v3 are adjacent (like 1 and 2), then number of sides between them is 1, so (1-1) * 180 / 4 = 0. That's not right. So this formula is incorrect.\n\n    # Let me refer back to the problem statement examples. For the square (n=4), the possible angles are 45 and 90. Let me think how they come about.\n\n    # When selecting vertices 1,2,3: angle at 2 is 90 degrees. How many steps between 1 and 3? It's 2 steps (since 1 to 2 to 3). So the arc AC (not containing B) is 2 steps, which is 2*(360/4) = 180 degrees. The inscribed angle is half that, 90 degrees. That's correct.\n\n    # When selecting vertices 1,2,4: the arc AC (not containing B) is 1 step (from 1 to 4), which is 90 degrees. Inscribed angle is 45 degrees. So the formula is angle = (arc AC) / 2, where arc AC is k * (360/n), where k is the number of steps between A and C along the arc not containing B.\n\n    # So the number of steps between A and C is m, which must be less than n/2 (since otherwise, the other arc would be shorter). So for a given m, the angle is (m * 360 / n) / 2 = m * 180 / n.\n\n    # So for the square, m=2 gives 2*180/4 = 90 degrees, m=1 gives 1*180/4 = 45 degrees.\n\n    # Therefore, the angle is m * 180 / n, where m is the number of steps between A and C along the arc not containing B. And m must be between 1 and (n-2)/2, because if m exceeds that, the other arc is shorter.\n\n    # So to find the closest angle to a, we need to find m such that m*180/n is as close as possible to a. And m can range from 1 to (n-2)//2.\n\n    # So the correct approach is to iterate m from 1 to (n-2)//2, compute angle = m * 180 / n, and find the m that minimizes |angle - a|.\n\n    # So the previous code had an error in the range of k. Let me fix that.\n\n    # Let's redo the code with this understanding.\n\n    # So for each m in 1 to floor((n-2)/2), compute angle = m * 180 / n.\n\n    # Now, find the m that gives the angle closest to a.\n\n    # Once we find the best m, then we can choose the vertices.\n\n    # How to choose the vertices? For example, if m is the number of steps between A and C, then we can pick v2 as any vertex, and then v1 and v3 are m steps apart around the polygon, with v2 between them.\n\n    # Let's choose v2 as 1, then v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + m. But need to make sure that the steps between v1 and v3 is m.\n\n    # Wait, if we fix v2 as vertex 1, then v1 could be vertex 2, and v3 would be vertex 2 + m, but considering the polygon wraps around. For example, in n=4, m=1, then v1=2, v2=1, v3= (2 + m) mod n? Not sure.\n\n    # Alternatively, for a given m, we can choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as m+2. Because between v1 and v3 there are m steps. Let me see:\n\n    # For example, in n=4, m=1: v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+1=3. Then the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 step (from 2 to 3), which is m=1. So angle is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees, which is correct.\n\n    # Another example: m=2, v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+2=4. The arc between v1 and v3 is 2 steps (2 to 3 to 4), which is m=2. So angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees, correct.\n\n    # So for general m, the vertices can be chosen as v1 = 2, v2 = 1, v3 = m+2. But need to ensure that m+2 <=n. If m+2 >n, then wrap around. But since m ranges up to (n-2)/2, for n >=3, m+2 <= (n-2)/2 + 2. For example, if n is even, say n=4, m=1, m+2=3 <=4. For n=5, m can be up to (5-2)/2 = 1.5 → floor to 1. m+2=3 <=5.\n\n    # Thus, for the general case, the vertices can be chosen as 2, 1, m+2. However, for some m, this may not be possible. For example, when m+2 exceeds n, but since m is at most (n-2)//2, m+2 <= (n-2)//2 + 2. Let's check for n=5: (n-2)//2 = 1, m+2 = 3 <=5. For n=6: (6-2)/2=2, m+2=4 <=6. So it's safe.\n\n    # Therefore, once we find the best m, we can output vertices 2, 1, m+2. However, the problem allows any valid triplet, so we can choose any such triplet.\n\n    # Now, let's adjust the code to find the best m, and then select the vertices accordingly.\n\n    # Let's recompute the code.\n\n    # Read n and a\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n\n    # Find best m\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_m = 1\n    max_m = (n - 2) // 2\n    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):\n        angle = m * 180.0 / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_m = m\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            if m < best_m:\n                best_m = m\n\n    # Now, select the vertices\n    # Choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 2 + best_m\n    v1 = 2\n    v2 = 1\n    v3 = 2 + best_m\n\n    # But if v3 exceeds n, wrap around? No, since m is at most (n-2)//2, 2 + m <= 2 + (n-2)/2. For example, if n is even, n=4: 2 + 1 =3 <=4. If n=5: 2 + 1=3 <=5.

However, the problem allows any valid triplet, so we can choose any such triplet.\n\n    # Now, let's adjust the code to find the best m, and then select the vertices accordingly.\n\n    # Let's recompute the code.\n\n    # Read n and a\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n\n    # Find best m\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_m = 1\n    max_m = (n - 2) // 2\n    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):\n        angle = m * 180.0 / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_m = m\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            if m < best_m:\n                best_m = m\n\n    # Now, select the vertices\n    # Choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 2 + best_m\n    v1 = 2\n    v2 = 1\n    v3 = 2 + best_m\n\n    # But if v3 exceeds n, wrap around? No, since m is at most (n-2)//2, 2 + m <= 2 + (n-2)/2. For example, if n is even, n=4: 2 + 1 =3 <=4. If n=5: 2 + 1=3 <=5. So no wrap needed.\n\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
