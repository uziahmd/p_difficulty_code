The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake graph as defined. Let's think about the structure of such a graph.\n\nThe snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me re-read the description. \n\nThe initial step is a single vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must have k new vertices connected to them. And this process is done at least once. Wait, the step says that each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. And this step should be done at least once. So the process is:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then, add k nodes connected to it. Now, each of those k nodes has degree 1. Then, for each of those, we add k new nodes. So after that, each of the original k nodes has k children, and the new nodes are leaves. But this step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimum steps would be two steps: the initial expansion, then expanding again.\n\nLet me try to model the number of nodes for different steps. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me consider that the snowflake is built in layers. The root is layer 0. Then, layer 1 has k nodes connected to the root. Then, each node in layer 1 has k children in layer 2. Then, each node in layer 2 has k children in layer 3, etc. However, the process requires that after the initial step (layer 1), the step of adding children to leaves is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have layers 0, 1, and 2. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k*k = 1 + k + k². For example, when k=4, the minimal is 1+4+16=21? But the example given in the problem says that the minimal for k=4 is something else. Wait, the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Let me check that.\n\nWait, maybe my model is wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that the snowflake is constructed as follows:\n\nInitially, there's one vertex. Then, add k new vertices connected to it. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., those added in the previous step) are connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So the initial step is adding the first level. Then, the second step is adding another level. So the minimal case is when you have two levels. Let's compute the number of nodes for that.\n\nOriginal node (1). Then, add k nodes (total 1 +k). Then, each of those k nodes gets k new nodes. So adding k * k nodes. So total is 1 +k +k². For example, when k=2, that's 1+2+4=7. But the sample input includes n=6 which outputs NO, and n=13 outputs YES. Let's see: 13 could be 1 +k +k². Let's see for k=3: 1+3+9=13. Yes! So that's why n=13 is YES. So that's the minimal case.\n\nBut then, what about more steps? For example, if after adding the second level, we add another level. So the process is: each time, all the leaves (those added in the previous step) get k children. So for example, if we have three levels, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² +k³. But wait, the problem says that the step of adding children to leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first level) is required. Then, the step of adding another level (second level) is required. So the minimal is two steps. But perhaps there are more steps. So the snowflake can have any number of steps, as long as there are at least two steps. So the total number of nodes can be written as 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >= 2? Or is that not correct?\n\nWait, no. Because the process is that each time you add a new level. Let me think again. The initial step is creating the root and adding k children. Then, each of those children (which are leaves) must have k children added. So that's the second step. Then, those new nodes (the second level) are leaves, so they can be expanded again. So each time you perform the step, you add another level. So the total number of nodes depends on how many times you",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number $ n $ can be the number of vertices in a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake graph is constructed by starting with a single vertex and iteratively adding new vertices in layers, where each vertex in the current layer is connected to $ k $ new vertices in the next layer. The process must be performed at least once after the initial step.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex. Then, each vertex added in a layer connects to $ k $ new vertices in the next layer. This process continues for at least two layers (initial and one more).\n2. **Mathematical Representation**: The total number of vertices in such a graph can be represented as a geometric series. For $ m $ layers, the total number of vertices is $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m $, which simplifies to $ \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} $.\n3. **Constraints Check**: For a given $ n $, we need to check if there exists some $ k > 1 $ such that $ n $ can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with at least two layers. This involves iterating over possible values of $ k $ and checking if $ n $ fits the series sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Try all possible k > 1\n    # We need to find if there exists k > 1 and m >= 2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n\n    # Which is (k^(m+1) - 1)/(k - 1) = n\n    # So for each possible k, check if there's an m >= 1 such that sum from 0 to m of k^i = n\n    # But since m can be up to log_k(n), we can iterate k up to sqrt(n)\n    # Also, note that sum from i=0 to m is 1 + k + ... + k^m\n    # So for m >= 1, the minimum sum is 1 + k + k^2 (when m=2)\n    # So for each possible k, we can check if there exists m >= 1 such that sum equals n\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        # Check if there's m >= 1 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n\n        # sum = (k^(m+1) - 1) // (k - 1)\n        # We need to find m such that this equals n\n        # Let's compute the sum incrementally until it exceeds n\n        total = 1  # sum for m = 0\n        m = 0\n        while True:\n            m += 1\n            total += k ** m\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            elif total > n:\n                break\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **is_snowflake Function**: This function checks if a number $ n $ can be represented as a sum of a geometric series starting from 1 with a common ratio $ k > 1 $, and at least two layers (i.e., $ m \\geq 1 $).\n- **Main Function**: Reads input values, processes each test case, and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on whether the number can form a valid snowflake graph.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible values of $ k $ up to the square root of $ n $, ensuring we handle very large values up to $ 10^{18} $ efficiently.",
