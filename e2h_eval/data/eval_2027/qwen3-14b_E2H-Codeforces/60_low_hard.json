Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code after each modification. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Each time a character (0 or 1) is added to S, I have to compute the answer. The answer is the total number of valid substrings that correspond to actual letters. But since each such substring can represent a letter, and sequences of letters are formed by concatenating these substrings, but I think the problem is counting all possible ways to split the string into valid Morse code letters. Wait, no. Wait, the question says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. Oh right, so each such sequence is a collection of letters, and each letter's Morse code is a substring of S. But the way they are represented is that each letter's Morse code is a substring of S, and the entire sequence is formed by concatenating these Morse codes. However, the problem is not about splitting the entire S into letters, but rather considering all possible substrings of S that are valid Morse code letters, and then considering all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by any combination of these substrings. Wait, no. Wait, the wording says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as: for each possible substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of the four forbidden ones), count how many times it appears as a substring. But then the problem says sequences of letters. For example, if there are two different valid Morse code substrings, say \"1\" and \"11\", then the sequences could be \"T\", \"M\", \"TM\", \"MT\", etc. But how do we count all possible sequences?\n\nWait no, maybe the problem is that each sequence of letters corresponds to a concatenation of their Morse code representations. So for example, if the Morse code of T is '1', and M is '11', then the sequence TM would correspond to the string '1' followed by '11', which is '111'. But this string '111' is a substring of S (assuming S is long enough). However, the problem says that each such sequence is represented by a substring of S. Wait, that seems confusing. Because the sequence of letters would be represented by the concatenation of their Morse codes. So the entire concatenated string must be a substring of S. But that's not possible unless the concatenated string is exactly a substring of S.\n\nBut the problem says that the sequences are represented with some substring of S. So for example, if S is \"111\", then the substring \"1\" represents T, \"11\" represents M, \"111\" represents O. Also, the substring \"11\" (from positions 1-2) is M again. Then sequences like TM would correspond to the concatenation of T's code (1) and M's code (11), which is 111. Which is a substring of S. So in this case, the sequence TM is counted once. Similarly, MT would also be counted once. And TT would be counted once (since 1+1=11, which is M, but wait no. Wait, the sequence TT would be two Ts, whose Morse codes are each \"1\". So the concatenation is \"11\", which is M. So the sequence TT is represented by the substring \"11\" (which is M's code). But how does that count? Because the sequence of letters is TT, which is a different sequence than M. But according to the problem statement, the count is the number of sequences of letters that are represented by some substring of S. So each such sequence is uniquely determined by the concatenation of their Morse codes. Therefore, each valid substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., not forbidden) contributes to the count as a single-letter sequence. Additionally, any concatenation of multiple valid Morse code substrings that form a longer substring of S would contribute as a multi-letter sequence.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because for example, if the entire S is \"111\", then the substrings are:\n\nAll possible substrings of S:\n\nLength 1: \"1\" (positions 1, 2, 3) → 3 occurrences.\n\nLength 2: \"11\" (positions 1-2, 2-3) → 2 occurrences.\n\nLength 3: \"111\" (positions 1-3) → 1 occurrence.\n\nEach of these substrings is a valid Morse code except for the forbidden ones. Let's check which of them are allowed.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code after each modification. The key challenge is efficiently determining valid Morse code substrings and counting all possible sequences formed by these substrings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: First, identify which Morse code strings (of lengths 1 to 4) are valid. We exclude the four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic String Update**: Maintain the string `S` as it grows with each modification.\n3. **Substring Counting**: After each modification, check all possible substrings of `S` to determine if they are valid Morse code representations.\n4. **Efficient Counting**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of valid substrings and their contributions to the total count of sequences. This helps avoid recalculating from scratch after each modification.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    S = []\n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case for empty string\n\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(c)\n        current_len = i\n        new_dp = [0] * (current_len + 1)\n        new_dp[0] = 1\n        for j in range(1, current_len + 1):\n            new_dp[j] = dp[j]\n            for k in range(1, 5):\n                if j - k >= 0:\n                    substr = ''.join(S[j - k:j])\n                    if len(substr) < 1 or len(substr) > 4:\n                        continue\n                    if substr not in forbidden:\n                        new_dp[j] = (new_dp[j] + dp[j - k]) % MOD\n        dp = new_dp\n        print(dp[current_len] - 1)  # subtract the empty sequence\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, where each line represents a modification to the string `S`.\n2. **Forbidden Strings**: A set of forbidden Morse code strings is maintained for quick lookup.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of valid sequences up to each position in the string `S`. `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences for the first `i` characters of `S`.\n4. **Updating DP Array**: For each new character added to `S`, the DP array is updated by checking all possible substrings ending at the current position. If a substring is valid, its contribution to the total count is added using previously computed values from the DP array.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, all operations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required counts after each modification while adhering to the constraints of the problem.",
