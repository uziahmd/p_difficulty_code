After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the first student's marks for the three subjects.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. For each subject (column in the gradebook), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, but how do I process the data? Let's think about the structure.\n\nLet me think: the gradebook is a list of strings. Each string represents a student's marks. For example, for the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe students are:\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nFor each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: marks are 2,2,1 → max is 2. So any student with 2 in subject 0 is considered best here. So students 0 and 1 are best in subject 0?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"best at some subject\" if there's no student with a higher mark. So if two students have the same maximum, then both are considered best in that subject. So for example, in subject 0, students 0 and 1 have 2, which is the max. So both are considered best in that subject. So each of them would be successful because they have at least one subject where they are the best.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n- Then, for each student, check if in any of the columns, their value in that column is equal to the maximum of that column. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the input into a 2D array. Then for each column, compute the max. Then for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max of that column.\n\nNow, how to process the columns. Let's think about the data structure. Suppose we have a list of lists. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nstudents = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\nThen, for each column j (from 0 to m-1), find the max of all students' j-th element.\n\nSo for column 0: 2,2,1 → max is 2.\n\nColumn 1: 2,3,1 → max is 3.\n\nColumn 2: 3,2,2 → max is 3.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their elements in the columns is equal to the max of that column.\n\nFor student 0: his marks are 2 (col0 max is 2 → yes), 2 (col1 max is 3 → no), 3 (col2 max is 3 → yes). So he has at least one, so successful.\n\nStudent 1: 2 (col0 yes), 3 (col1 yes), 2 (no). So yes.\n\nStudent 2: 1 (no), 1 (no), 2 (no). So no. So total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the next n lines, each as a string, then convert each into a list of integers. So for each row in the input, split into individual digits and convert to int.\n\n- For each column j (from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum value in that column.\n\n- Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max of that column. If yes, count them.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read n lines, each as a string. Then for each string, convert into a list of integers. So for example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have the data as a list of lists, then for each column j, compute the max",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark than them in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** First, read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read the subsequent lines which represent the marks of each student in each subject.\n2. **Convert Marks to Integers:** Convert each string of marks into a list of integers for easier processing.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject:** For each subject (column), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Check Successful Students:** For each student, check if they have at least one mark that matches the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    gradebook.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\n# Find the maximum for each subject (column)\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = gradebook[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\n# Check each student\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if gradebook[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read as integers for the number of students and subjects, followed by the gradebook entries.\n2. **Convert Marks:** Each line of the gradebook is converted into a list of integers to facilitate numerical comparisons.\n3. **Maximum Marks Calculation:** For each subject (column), we iterate through all students to find the highest mark achieved.\n4. **Successful Students Check:** For each student, we check if they have at least one mark that matches the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging column-wise maximum values and checking each student against these values. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of students and subjects, making it efficient for the given constraints.",
