He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, Polycarp has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He wants to practice for exactly k days. Each day he solves at least one problem, and he must solve all problems in exactly k days. The way he does this is by splitting the list into k contiguous parts. Each day's profit is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The total profit is the sum of these daily profits. My task is to find the maximum possible total profit and the corresponding split.\n\nHmm. So the problem is about splitting the array into k contiguous parts, each part non-empty, such that the sum of maxima of each part is maximized.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since n can be up to 2000 and k up to 2000, a dynamic programming approach might be feasible here.\n\nFirst, let's consider the dynamic programming approach. Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days.\n\nThe base case would be dp[0][0] = 0, but maybe we need to adjust indices. For example, dp[i][j] represents the maximum profit for the first i problems divided into j days.\n\nTo compute dp[i][j], we need to consider where the j-th day starts. For example, for the j-th day, we can take some m < i, and split the first m problems into j-1 days, then take the problems from m+1 to i as the j-th day. The profit for that would be dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut calculating this directly for each possible m and each possible i and j could be O(n^3) time, which for n=2000 would be 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWait, but n is 2000 and k is up to 2000. So even O(n^2 *k) is 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10 operations. That's definitely not feasible.\n\nSo we need a better approach. Let's think about the constraints. What's the maximum value of k? It's n. So when k equals n, each day has exactly one problem. Then the total profit is the sum of all elements. But for other cases?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to optimize the DP transitions. Let's think about the DP recurrence again.\n\nFor dp[i][j], we need to find m from j-1 to i-1 (since each day must have at least one problem), and compute dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nThe problem is the max(a[m+1..i]) part. How can we compute that efficiently?\n\nIf we can precompute the max for any interval [m+1, i], that would help. But for each i and j, we need to consider m varying from j-1 to i-1. However, even with that, the time complexity is O(n^2 *k) in the worst case.\n\nWait, but for n=2000 and k=2000, that's O(2000^3) which is 8e10. That's way too slow. So this approach may not work for the given constraints.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the problem again. Since each day's split is contiguous and must cover the entire array, perhaps the optimal way is to have the splits where the maxima are as large as possible. For example, if there's a very large element in the array, it's better to have it as a single day's maximum, so that it's counted once. But when you have multiple large elements, you need to balance between splitting them into different days or grouping them.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe the key is that the maximum element in the entire array must be in one of the days. Since it's the maximum, it will contribute to the sum. But if you split the array into k days, the maximum element will be in one day, and that day's profit is at least that maximum. But how to maximize the sum.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem when k is small. For example, if k is 1, the answer is the max of the entire array. If k is 2, we need to split the array into two parts. The best way is to split between two positions where the sum of the maxima is maximum. For example, find the split point where the max of left part plus max of right part is maximum.\n\nSo for general k, perhaps the dynamic programming approach is necessary, but with optimizations.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach. Let's try to see if we can compute the max for ranges quickly.\n\nFor example, for each i, we can precompute for all possible m < i the max from m+1 to i. But how?\n\nWe can precompute a 2D array max_range where max_range[m][i] is the maximum of a[m+1 ... i]. Wait, but for m ranging from 0 to i-1.\n\nBut how to compute that. Well, for each i, we can compute max_range[m][i] for m from 0 to i-1. However, for each i, we can compute the max from m+1 to i by keeping track of the maximum as we go from m to i.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed i, when m increases from 0 to i-1, the range [m+1, i] shrinks from [1, i] to [i, i]. So for each i, we can compute the max_range[m][i] as follows: starting from m = i-1 (which is the max of a[i], then for m = i-2, the max is max(a[i-1], max_range[m+1][i]), etc. So for each i, we can compute all max_range[m][i] in O(n) time. So overall, the precomputation would take O(n^2) time and space.\n\nOnce we have that, the DP transition can be done as follows:\n\ndp[i][j] = max over m from j-1 to i-1 of (dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i])\n\nBut even with this precomputation, the DP is O(n^2 *k) time.\n\nFor n=2000 and k=2000, this is O(2000^3) which is 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nBut wait, what's the maximum possible value of k? It's n. So for example, when k =n, the answer is the sum of all elements. Because each day is one problem, so the sum is sum(a). But for the DP approach, when k is large, perhaps there's a way to optimize.\n\nBut given that n is 2000, perhaps the O(n^2 *k) approach is not feasible. Let's think about the constraints again. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, the constraints say that n and k are up to 2000. So O(n^2 *k) would be 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e10 operations. That's way too much for Python, which can handle roughly 1e8 operations per second. So 8e10 is 800 seconds, which is way beyond the time limit.\n\nThus, we need a better approach. Let me think again.\n\nAnother observation: since the splits are contiguous and must cover the entire array, the problem resembles the problem of partitioning the array into k segments to maximize the sum of the maxima of each segment.\n\nThis is similar to some classic DP problems, but the challenge is to find an efficient way.\n\nAlternative idea: For each position i and number of days j, the maximum sum can be found by considering that when adding the j-th day, the last segment can start at some position m. But how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother thought: For the DP approach, perhaps for each j, we can compute the DP[j] based on DP[j-1], and for each i, compute the best m for the current j.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the recurrence again. For dp[i][j], it's the maximum of dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) for m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nNow, for each j, and for each i, we need to find the best m.\n\nBut the max(a[m+1..i]) is not easy to handle. However, perhaps for each i, when considering j, we can compute the max in a smart way.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each j, and for each i, we can keep track of the maximum value in the current segment as we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1.\n\nFor example, for a fixed i and j, when considering m from i-1 down to j-1, we can track the current maximum. Because as m decreases, the segment [m+1, i] increases in length. So for example, when m is i-1, the segment is [i], which is a[i]. When m decreases by 1, the segment becomes [m+1, i] = [i-1+1, i] = [i-1, i], whose max is max(a[i-1], a[i]).\n\nSo for each i and j, we can iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, and keep track of the current maximum. Then for each m, we can compute dp[m][j-1] + current_max, and keep track of the maximum value.\n\nThis would reduce the time complexity. Let's see:\n\nFor each j from 1 to k:\n\n   for each i from j to n:\n\n      current_max = 0\n\n      for m from i-1 downto j-1:\n\n          current_max = max(current_max, a[m+1])\n\n          dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n\nThis way, for each i and j, the inner loop runs O(i) steps, but perhaps the total time is O(n^2 *k). Wait, but for each j, for each i, the inner loop runs O(i) steps. So for each j, the total steps are O(n^2). And with k steps, it's O(k * n^2). Which is same as before.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, for some cases, this is manageable. For example, for n=2000 and k=2000, it's O(2000^3) = 8e10 operations. Which is way too big. However, perhaps the actual constraints are not that tight, but given that the problem says n is up to 2000, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the problem can be optimized for the fact that when k is large, the optimal solution is to split the array into as many segments as possible where each segment's maximum is as large as possible. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem differently. Let's consider that the maximum sum will be achieved by taking the k largest elements in the array. But this is not necessarily true. For example, if two large elements are adjacent, splitting between them would allow both to be maxima of their respective segments. However, if they are not adjacent, splitting might not be possible. So this is not straightforward.\n\nWait, but for example, the maximum sum is the sum of the maximums of each segment. So each segment contributes its maximum. Therefore, the total sum is the sum of the maximums of each segment. So to maximize this sum, we want to have as many as possible of the high values in the array to be the maximum of their own segments.\n\nBut how to achieve that. For example, if there are multiple peaks in the array, splitting between them would allow each peak to be a maximum of a segment.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother thought: Since the segments are contiguous and must cover the entire array, the maximum sum is determined by the positions where we split. The key is that each split must be made in such a way that the maximums of the segments are as large as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with that.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach. Let's try to see if there's a way to optimize it. For example, for the DP[i][j], when j is fixed, perhaps we can find a way to compute it more efficiently.\n\nLet's take the case when j=1. Then dp[i][1] = max(a[0..i-1]) for i from 1 to n.\n\nWhen j=2, for each i, dp[i][2] = max over m from 1 to i-1 of (max(a[0..m-1]) + max(a[m..i-1])).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for the general case, for each j and i, the inner loop can be optimized by using the current_max variable as I thought before. Let's try to compute the time complexity with this optimization.\n\nSuppose for each j from 1 to k, and for each i from j to n, the inner loop runs (i - (j-1)) times. So for each j, the total number of operations is sum_{i=j}^n (i - j + 1) ) ?\n\nWait, no. For each i, the inner loop runs (i - (j-1)) steps? Or for each i, m ranges from j-1 to i-1, which is i - (j-1) steps. So for each j, the total steps are sum_{i=j}^n (i - j + 1) ) ?\n\nWait, for i from j to n, the number of m's is i - (j-1) steps? Let me think for i and j fixed. m ranges from j-1 to i-1, inclusive. The number of m's is (i-1) - (j-1) + 1 = i - j + 1 steps. So for each j, the total steps are sum_{i=j}^n (i-j+1) ) = sum_{d=1}^{n-j+1} d} = O(n²) per j. Thus, for k j's, the total steps are O(k n²). Which is same as before.\n\nBut for n=2000, and k=2000, that's 2000 * 2000² = 8e10 steps. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize further. Let's think about the constraints again. Let's look at the sample input.\n\nIn the third example, input is 4 2, array [1, 2000, 2000, 2]. The best split is [1,2000], [2000,2], sum is 2000 + 2000 = 4000. Another option is [1,2000,2000], [2], which gives 2000 + 2 = 2002. So clearly, splitting between the two 2000s gives a better sum.\n\nSo the key is to split between high values. But how to model that.\n\nAlternative idea: For each j, the maximum sum for j days can be computed by considering that the j-th day's segment is the last one. So for the j-th day, the last segment starts at some position m+1 and ends at i. The maximum of that segment is the max of a[m+1 ... i]. So for each i and j, the DP[i][j] depends on the previous DP[m][j-1] plus the max of a[m+1 ... i].\n\nBut again, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the problem can be transformed into a problem where we can use some greedy approach. For example, if we have to make k splits, then the optimal way is to split after the k-1 largest elements. However, this is not always correct. For example, if the array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and k=2. The best split is [5], [4,3,2,1], sum 5+4=9. Alternatively, splitting [5,4], [3,2,1] gives 5+3=8. So the best is to split after the first element. The largest elements are 5,4,3,2,1. The k-1=1 largest elements are 5. So splitting after the first element is indeed the optimal choice.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 2000, 2000, 2], k=2. The two largest elements are 2000 and 2000. So splitting between them gives the best sum.\n\nSo perhaps the greedy approach is to split after the positions where the elements are among the top (k) elements. But how to formalize this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as needing to select k-1 split points. Each split point divides the array into segments. The sum of maxima of the segments is to be maximized. The maximum sum is achieved when each split is made in such a way that the maxima of the segments are as large as possible.\n\nBut how to choose those splits.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements in the array, provided that they can be placed as the maximum of their respective segments. However, this is not always possible. For example, if the array is [3, 1, 2], and k=2. The two largest elements are 3 and 2. To have them as maxima, the split would be [3], [1,2], sum 3+2=5. Which is correct. But if the array is [3, 2, 1, 4], and k=2. The two largest elements are 4 and 3. To have both as maxima, the split would be [3,2,1], [4], sum 3+4=7. Which is better than splitting [3,2,1,4] into [3], [2,1,4], which gives 3+4=7 as well. So it works.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 4, 6, 3, 2], k=2. The two largest elements are 6 and 5. Splitting into [5,4,6] and [3,2] gives sum 6 +3=9. But if you split into [5,4] and [6,3,2], sum is 5 +6=11, which is better. So the two largest elements are 6 and 5. But splitting between 4 and 6 allows both 5 and 6 to be maxima. So the greedy approach of selecting the k largest elements may work, but only if they are in positions that can be split into separate segments.\n\nBut how to ensure that. This seems complicated.\n\nSo perhaps the DP approach is still the way to go, but with some optimizations.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For n=2000 and k=2000, the DP approach would require O(k*n^2) time, which is 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow. However, perhaps in practice, the test cases do not have the worst-case scenario. Or maybe there's a way to optimize further.\n\nWait, but when k is larger than some value, say, when k is larger than the number of distinct elements, but I don't think that helps.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that when k is large, the minimal possible value for the sum is the sum of the array (when k=n), but the maximum is when we have as many high elements as possible.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's think of the DP approach again. Maybe there's a way to optimize the DP transitions.\n\nLet me think for the case when j is small. For example, j=2. Then for each i, we need to find the best m between 1 and i-1. But for each i, the max of a[m+1...i] can be precomputed as I thought before. However, even with that, the DP approach is O(n^2*k).\n\nBut let's think about the actual values of k. For example, in practice, for n=2000, and k=2000, the code would have to process all possible splits. But for this case, the answer is simply the sum of all elements, since each day has exactly one problem. So perhaps the code can handle this case separately.\n\nSimilarly, for k=1, the answer is the maximum of the entire array.\n\nBut for general cases, perhaps the code can proceed with the DP approach, but with some optimizations.\n\nLet me try to implement the DP approach with the current_max idea, and see if it passes for n=2000 and k=2000. Well, even if the code is O(n^2 *k), but in practice, for n=2000 and k=2000, it's impossible. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize the code for certain cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find that for j >= some value, the optimal solution is to split into segments where each segment has one element except for the first few segments. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think again. For the DP approach, the time complexity is O(n²k). Let's calculate the actual number of operations for n=2000 and k=2000. 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8,000,000,000 operations. Even if each operation is a simple addition and comparison, in Python, which is relatively slow, this would take way longer than the allowed time. So this approach is not feasible for the given constraints.\n\nSo what else can I do?\n\nAlternative idea: For each position i and j, the maximum of the last segment can be calculated as the maximum of a[m+1..i]. But when we are trying to find the best m for dp[i][j], perhaps we can find that for some ranges of m, the maximum is increasing or decreasing, and thus find the optimal m quickly.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Since the array is processed in order, and the segments are contiguous, maybe we can find that for a given j, the dp[i][j] can be calculated based on dp[i-1][j], but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following: the maximum sum for k segments is equal to the sum of the maximums of the segments. So, for each segment, the maximum is at least the maximum of the elements in that segment. But how to maximize the sum.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the problem as a variation of the maximum sum of k non-overlapping subarrays. But in this case, the subarrays are contiguous and cover the entire array.\n\nBut I'm not aware of any standard algorithm for this problem.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's imagine that we have to choose k-1 split points. Each split point is between two elements. The total number of split points is k-1. The goal is to choose these split points such that the sum of the maxima of each segment is maximized.\n\nNow, the key is that each segment's maximum is the maximum of its elements. So, for example, if there is a very large element in the array, it's better to have it in a segment by itself, so that it contributes its full value to the sum. However, if there are multiple large elements, we need to split between them.\n\nBut how to decide where to split.\n\nFor example, if there are two large elements, A and B, and they are separated by some smaller elements. We can split between them, so that each contributes their maximum. But if we don't split between them, then the segment containing both will have maximum max(A,B), which is the same as if we split them. So in this case, it doesn't matter. However, if there are three large elements, C, D, E, and we can split between them, then splitting into three segments would give us C + D + E, which is better than splitting into two segments, which would give max(C,D,E) + something.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to split the array in such a way that as many of the largest elements are isolated into their own segments.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about the following approach: find the positions of the k largest elements in the array. Then, split the array so that each of these elements is in its own segment. However, this may not always be possible, because the elements may be consecutive.\n\nFor example, if the array is [5, 5, 5], and k=2. The two largest elements are both 5. Splitting between the first and second element gives [5], [5,5], sum 5 +5 =10. Or splitting between the second and third gives [5,5], [5], sum 5 +5=10. So it's possible.\n\nBut if the array is [5, 5, 5], and k=3, then each element is a segment, sum 15.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal way is to select the k largest elements and split the array such that each of them is in its own segment. However, this requires that the positions of these elements are such that they can be split into separate segments.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nBut how to find the positions of the k largest elements. For example, if the array has multiple elements with the same value, like in the third example.\n\nLet's think about the third example again: array is [1, 2000, 2000, 2], k=2. The two largest elements are 2000 and 2000. To split the array into two segments, we can split between the two 2000s. This gives two segments, each with a maximum of 2000, sum 4000.\n\nBut how to find this split.\n\nSo the idea is to find the positions of the k largest elements, and split the array such that each of these elements is in a separate segment. But how to do this.\n\nBut how to find the split points.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the optimal way is to have the k segments' maxima be the k largest elements in the array. But this is only possible if these elements are in positions that allow for such splits.\n\nSo, for example, if the array has elements [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], sorted in non-decreasing order, and we have to choose k segments, then the best way is to split between the elements so that the k largest elements are each in their own segment.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut this seems like a greedy approach. However, I'm not sure how to implement it, especially since there may be multiple elements with the same value.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Find the k largest elements in the array. Let's call this set S.\n\n2. Split the array into segments such that each element in S is in its own segment. The number of splits required is (number of elements in S) - 1. But if there are more than k elements in S, this is not possible.\n\nWait, but S contains exactly k elements. So, for example, if the array has multiple elements with the same value, but we need to choose k of them.\n\nBut how to choose which ones to include.\n\nFor example, in the third example, the two largest elements are both 2000. We need to choose both of them, and split the array into two segments, each containing one of them.\n\nBut how to find the split points.\n\nPerhaps the way to do this is to find the positions of the k largest elements, and then split between them. For example, if the positions are p_1, p_2, ..., p_k, then the split points are between p_1 and p_2, p_2 and p_3, etc.\n\nBut how to find the positions.\n\nBut this approach may not work in all cases. For example, consider the array [5, 4, 6, 3, 2], and k=2. The two largest elements are 6 and 5. To split the array into two segments, we can split after index 0 (segment [5], [4,6,3,2] with sum 5+6=11), or after index 2 (segments [5,4,6], [3,2] sum 6+3=9). Or split after index 1 (segments [5,4], [6,3,2] sum 5+6=11). So the optimal is to split between the 5 and the 6. So the two largest elements are 6 and 5. But the split is between them.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nBut this approach would require finding the positions of the k largest elements and then splitting between them.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother example: array [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2], k=3. The three largest elements are 9, 6, 5 (or 9,6,5,5). So the optimal split is to have 9 as a segment, 6 as a segment, and 5 as a segment. But in the example given in the problem statement, the split is [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2]. The maxima are 5,6,9, sum 20. Which includes the three largest elements: 9,6,5.\n\nBut how to find the split points.\n\nThis suggests that the greedy approach of selecting the k largest elements and splitting between them may work, but it's unclear how to implement it.\n\nBut perhaps this is the way to go. Let's think about the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the positions of the k largest elements in the array.\n\n2. Split the array such that each of these elements is in a separate segment. The rest of the array is filled into the segments.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements, provided that it's possible to split the array into k segments such that each of these elements is in its own segment.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nFor example, in the third example, the sum of the two largest elements is 2000 + 2000 = 4000, which is the correct answer.\n\nIn the first example, the three largest elements are 9, 6, 5 (assuming the array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]. The largest three are 9, 6, 5. Sum is 20, which matches the example.\n\nBut what about when the k largest elements are not all in separate segments?\n\nFor example, array [5, 5, 5], k=2. The two largest elements are 5 and 5. The maximum sum is 5+5=10. Which can be achieved by splitting between the first and second elements.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 3, 5], k=2. The two largest elements are 5 and 5. Splitting between the first and second elements gives [5], [3,5], sum 5+5=10. Or between the second and third elements, [5,3], [5], sum 5+5=10.\n\nSo this works.\n\nAnother example: array [5, 1, 5], k=2. The two largest elements are 5 and 5. Split between them.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 1, 5, 1, 5], k=3. The three largest elements are 5,5,5. Splitting between each pair of 5s.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 5, 5, 5], k=3. The sum is 5+5+5=15.\n\nSo it seems that this approach works.\n\nBut how to implement it.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n- Find the k largest elements in the array. Let's say they are at positions p_1, p_2, ..., p_k. Note that these positions are in increasing order.\n\n- Split the array into k segments such that each segment contains one of these elements. The split points are between p_i and p_{i+1}.\n\nBut how to find the positions.\n\nFor example, in the third example, the array is [1, 2000, 2000, 2]. The two largest elements are at positions 1 and 2 (assuming zero-based or one-based? Well, let's assume zero-based for now). So the split is between position 1 and 2, giving [1, 2000] and [2000, 2].\n\nSo the idea is to find the positions of the k largest elements, and split between them.\n\nBut how to find these positions.\n\nBut what if there are multiple elements with the same value, and we need to choose k of them. For example, if the array has m elements with value x, and m >=k, then we need to select k of them to be in separate segments.\n\nBut how to choose which ones.\n\nThe optimal way is to choose the first k occurrences, or the last k occurrences, or some other way. For example, in the third example, choosing the first two 2000s or the last two would give the same result.\n\nBut how to ensure that the segments can be formed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find the k largest elements in the array. Let's say the value of the k-th largest element is v.\n\n2. Find all positions where the element is greater than v, and then select the positions where the element is equal to v, until we have k positions.\n\n3. Once we have these positions, we split the array into k segments, each containing one of these positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut how to find these positions. Let's think of the following approach:\n\n- Create a list of tuples (value, index) for all elements.\n\n- Sort this list in descending order of value, then ascending order of index.\n\n- Take the first k elements from this list. These are the positions we need to include in separate segments.\n\nOnce we have these k positions, we can sort them in increasing order of index. Let's call them pos_1, pos_2, ..., pos_k.\n\nThen, the split points are between pos_1 and pos_2, pos_2 and pos_3, etc.\n\nFor example, in the third example, the sorted list of (value, index) would be (2000, 1), (2000, 2), (2, 3), (1, 0). Taking the first two gives positions 1 and 2. Sorted in increasing order, they are 1 and 2. So the split points are after position 1 (split between 1 and 2), resulting in segments [0-1], [2-3].\n\nBut how to construct the segments from these positions.\n\nOnce we have the positions, we can create the segments as follows:\n\n- The first segment starts at 0 and ends at pos_1.\n\n- The second segment starts at pos_1 + 1 and ends at pos_2.\n\n- ...\n\n- The k-th segment starts at pos_{k-1} + 1 and ends at n-1.\n\nWait, no. Because the segments are contiguous and must cover the entire array. So the first segment is from 0 to pos_1, the second segment is from pos_1 + 1 to pos_2, and so on. But this assumes that the positions are in increasing order.\n\nYes, since we sorted the positions in increasing order.\n\nBut this approach may not work in all cases. Let's test it with the first example.\n\nFirst example: n=8, k=3, a=[5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]. The three largest elements are 9, 6, 5. Let's see:\n\nThe sorted list of (value, index) in descending order would be:\n\n(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,7), (2,2), (1,5).\n\nTaking the first three gives positions 6, 3, 0. Sorting them in increasing order: 0, 3, 6.\n\nThen, the segments would be:\n\nSegment 1: 0 to 0 (length 1), segment 2: 1 to 3 (positions 1-3?), wait:\n\nWait, the first segment starts at 0 and ends at pos_1 (which is 0). So length 1. Then the second segment starts at pos_1 + 1 = 0+1=1, and ends at pos_2 (3). So from 1 to 3: that's 3-1+1 = 3 elements. Then the third segment starts at pos_2 + 1 = 4, and ends at pos_3 (6). So from 4 to 6: 3 elements. Then the remaining elements after pos_3 is 7 (element 2). But according to this, the third segment ends at 6, and the fourth element is 7, which is not covered. So this",
