Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine all the letters from the guest and host, the pile should have exactly those letters, no more, no less.\n\nSo the steps I need to do are:\n\n1. Take the three input lines: guest, host, and pile.\n2. Concatenate the guest and host names into one string.\n3. Check if the concatenated string has the same characters in the same counts as the pile.\n4. If yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nHow to check the character counts? Well, in Python, one way is to use the Counter class from the collections module. Because Counter will count the occurrences of each character.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Combine guest and host into a single string, say combined = guest + host.\n- Create a Counter for combined and a Counter for the pile.\n- Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both have the same counts for all characters, then it's a match.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases.\n\nFor example, if the combined length of guest and host is different from the pile's length. Then immediately return NO. Because even if the counts are same, but if lengths differ, then it's impossible. Wait, no. Because if the combined length is different, then the pile can't have the same letters. For example, if combined is length 5 and pile is length 6, then there's an extra letter. So checking the lengths first might be a quick way to return NO.\n\nSo maybe first check if len(guest) + len(host) equals len(pile). If not, output NO. Otherwise, proceed to compare the counts.\n\nThat's a good optimization. Because if the lengths are different, there's no way the counts can match. So adding that check first can save some processing time.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCheck if len(guest + host) == len(pile). If not, return NO.\n\nElse, check if the Counter of (guest + host) equals Counter of pile. If yes, return YES else NO.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead three lines from input. But wait, the input is given as three lines. So in Python, perhaps read via input().strip() three times. However, sometimes when reading from standard input, there might be issues with trailing newlines. But according to the problem statement, each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters. So perhaps:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host.\n\nIf len(combined) != len(pile), then print 'NO'.\n\nElse, check if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile). Alternatively, using Counter.\n\nWait, another way is to sort both strings and compare. Because if the sorted combined and sorted pile are the same, then they have the same letters.\n\nWhich is more efficient? For small strings (up to 200 characters, since each line is up to 100), both methods are acceptable. But for Python, sorting is straightforward.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nif sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile): print YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the length check? Because if the lengths are different, the sorted lists would be different. So perhaps the length check is redundant. Because if the lengths are different, then sorted(combined) and sorted(pile) would have different lengths, so the comparison would return False.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nif sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile): print YES else NO.\n\nBut in that case, the code would automatically handle the length check. Because if the lengths are different, the sorted lists would be different.\n\nSo for example, if combined is length 5 and pile is 6, then sorted(combined) is a list of 5 elements, sorted(pile) is 6. So comparing them would return False.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nif sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the sample input?\n\nLet's check the first example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". Let's see the length.\n\nLet me count:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters",
