There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key constraint here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nLet me think about the examples given. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How does that work? Like, maybe the first game is between player 1 and 2, then the winner (player 1) plays against player 3. But wait, in the second game, player 1 has already played once, and player 3 hasn't played any. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's why the answer is 2. \n\nFor n=4, the answer is 2. The example says that the optimal way is to have two initial matches (like 1 vs 2 and 3 vs 4), then the winners play. So the winner plays two games. But why can't the winner play three games? Well, maybe because to get to three games, you need to have more players. Let's think: for the winner to play three games, he must have played three matches. Each time, he must have opponents who have played either the same number of games or one less. \n\nSo perhaps this problem relates to the Fibonacci sequence? Because when you think about building up the maximum number of games, each time you need to have enough players to allow for the next step. Let me think. Suppose the maximum number of games the winner can play is k. Then, for each game the winner plays, he must have an opponent. But each of those opponents must have been able to reach their respective number of games. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say the winner plays k games. Then, in each of those games, the opponent must have played either (k-1) or (k-2) games. Wait, but since the winner is playing the game, the opponent must have played some number of games that is within one of the winner's current count. \n\nBut how do we model the minimum number of players required to allow the winner to play k games? Let's think about it. For the winner to play k games, each game requires that the opponent has a certain number of games. Let's think of this as building a tree. The winner's path is a chain of k games. For each game, the opponent must have a certain number of games. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have played k games. Let's call this number f(k). For example, f(1) = 2 (the winner plays once, needs one opponent). For k=2, the winner plays two games. The first game requires an opponent (player A). Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played either 1 or 0 games. But since the winner has played 1 game already, the opponent must have played 0 or 1. But the opponent can't have played 0 games (since they would be a new player, but the winner has to have played one game before that). Wait, maybe the second game's opponent is someone who has played one game. How?\n\nWait, for the second game, the winner has already played one game. So the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. If the opponent has played 1 game, then that opponent must have had their own path. So for the winner to have two games, the total players would be the sum of the players required for the first game (which is 2) and the players required for the second game's opponent. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, to have a player reach k games, they must have played a game against someone who has played k-1 games, and that someone must have come from a subtree that requires f(k-1) players. But also, the opponent in the previous game must have been able to reach k-1 games, which would require f(k-1) players. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. Let's denote this as f(k). For the winner to play k games, he must have played in the k-th game. In that game, his opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. Because the difference can be at most one. But since the winner has already played k-1 games before this match (since he's about to play the k-th game), the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. \n\nBut for the opponent to have played k-1 games, they must have a path of k-1 games. So the minimal number of players would be f(k-1) + f(k-2) ? Because the winner's path requires that he has played against someone who has played k-1 games (so that requires f(k-1) players) and someone who has played k-2 games (so that requires f(k-2) players). Wait, maybe not. Let me think. \n\nWait, the winner's first game is against someone. For the winner to play k games, he must have played in each round. Let's model this as a tree. The winner's path is a chain of k games. For each of those games, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let's think recursively. \n\nSuppose the winner plays k games. Then, in the first game, he plays against someone. That person must have played 0 games (since the winner has 0 games before the first game). Then, after winning, he plays his second game. The opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. To maximize the number of games, the winner would need to have opponents that have played as many games as possible. So, for the second game, the opponent must have played 1 game. How can that happen? That opponent must have played one game before, which would require that they had a previous match. \n\nThis seems like a Fibonacci-like recurrence. For example, to have the winner play k games, the minimal number of players required is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because for the winner to have a game where he plays against someone who has played k-1 games (which requires f(k-1) players) and someone who has played k-2 games (which requires f(k-2) players). Wait, but how does that add up?\n\nLet me think of the base cases. For k=1, the minimal players is 2. For k=2, the minimal players is 3. Because the winner plays two games. First, he plays against someone (player A). Then, he plays against someone else (player B) who has played one game. But how does player B get that one game? Player B must have played against someone else. So for the second game, the opponent must have played one game, which requires that there are 2 players in that subtree. So total players is 2 (for the first game) + 1 (player B) ? No, maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nIf the winner needs to play two games, then the first game is between him and player A. Then, for the second game, he needs to play against someone who has played one game. That someone must have a history of one game. So that someone must have played against another player. So that's two players (the opponent and their opponent). So the total players is 2 (for the first game) plus 2 (for the second game's opponent's subtree) minus 1? Or maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is equal to the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Let me think of some examples. \n\nLet me consider the minimal number of players for k=1: 2. For k=2, the minimal players is 3. For k=3, it's 5. Because the winner plays three games. For the third game, the opponent must have played 2 games (so that the difference is one). To get that, the opponent's subtree requires 3 players (from k=2). So the total players is f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. \n\nSimilarly, for k=4, the minimal players would be f(3)+f(2) = 5+3=8. And so on. So the pattern is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2), with f(1)=2, f(2)=3. \n\nThis looks exactly like the Fibonacci sequence, but shifted. Let's see:\n\nFibonacci numbers (assuming F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, etc.):\n\nF(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13, etc. \n\nOur f(k) seems to be F(k+2). Because for k=1, f(1)=2=F(3)=2. For k=2, f(2)=3=F(4)=3. For k=3, f(3)=5=F(5)=5. Yes. So f(k) = F(k+2), where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1) = 1, F(2)=1, etc. \n\nSo the minimal number of players required for the winner to have played k games is F(k+2). \n\nNow, the problem is given n players, find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤ n. \n\nBut wait, let's check the examples. \n\nIn the sample input where n=3, the output is 2. For k=2, F(2+2)=F(4)=3. So yes, 3 ≤ 3. So the maximum k is 2. \n\nAnother example: n=4. What is the maximum k? Let's see. F(5) is 5, which is larger than 4. So the maximum k is 2, since F(4)=3 ≤4. Which matches the sample output. \n\nAnother example: n=10. What's the maximum k? Let's compute F(k+2) for various k:\n\nk=3: F(5)=5 <=10\n\nk=4: F(6)=8 <=10\n\nk=5: F(7)=13>10. So maximum k is 4. Which matches the sample output of 4. \n\nYes! So the problem reduces to finding the largest k such that F(k+2) ≤n. \n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Precompute Fibonacci numbers until we exceed 1e18 (since n can be up to 1e18). Then, for a given n, find the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, generate all Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. Let's see how many terms that would take. The Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. Let's compute:\n\nF(1)=1\n\nF(2)=1\n\nF(3)=2\n\nF(4)=3\n\nF(5)=5\n\nF(6)=8\n\nF(7)=13\n\nF(8)=21\n\n...\n\nF(85) is around 2.1e17, F(86) is 3.4e17, F(87)=5.5e17, F(88)= 8.9e17, F(89)=1.44e18, F(90)=2.33e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum k+2 is up to 89, which gives F(89)=1.44e18. So for n=1e18, the maximum k would be 89-2=87? Wait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nWe need to find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤n. So for example, if F(m) ≤n, then m is k+2. So k = m-2. \n\nSo the process is:\n\nFind the maximum m where F(m) ≤n. Then the answer is m-2. \n\nBut for example, when n=3, F(4)=3. So m=4, answer is 4-2=2, which is correct.\n\nSo the problem becomes, for given n, find the maximum m where F(m) ≤n, then subtract 2 from m. \n\nBut how to compute m?\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18, then for a given n, perform a binary search on the list of Fibonacci numbers to find the largest m where F(m) ≤n. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the list of Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. Let's generate them in a list. \n\nLet me generate them:\n\nStart with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc. \n\nOnce we have this list, for a given n, we can find the maximum m where F(m) ≤n. Then the answer is m-2. \n\nBut what if n is not exactly a Fibonacci number? For example, n=4. The largest F(m) ≤4 is F(4)=3, F(5)=5>4. So m=4, answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example, n=5. F(5)=5, so m=5, answer 5-2=3. So the maximum number of games is 3. Let's see if that's possible. \n\nFor k=3, the minimal players is F(3+2)=F(5)=5. So for n=5, the answer is 3. \n\nYes. So the logic holds. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. \n\n- For input n, find the maximum m where F(m) <=n. \n\n- The answer is m-2. \n\nBut how to handle cases where n is less than F(3)=2? Wait, the constraints say n >=2. \n\nFor example, n=2: F(3)=2. So m=3, answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct. \n\nSo the code can proceed as follows. \n\nNow, the challenge is to generate the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. Let's generate them in a list. \n\nLet me code this part:\n\nInitialize a list fibs = [1, 1] (for m=1 and m=2). Then, generate next terms until it exceeds 1e18. \n\nBut wait, for m=1, F(1)=1; m=2, F(2)=1; m=3, F(3)=2; m=4, F(4)=3; etc. \n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n, we can perform a binary search on the list to find the largest value <=n. \n\nBut what if n is larger than the maximum Fibonacci number in the list? Well, since the list stops when the next term exceeds 1e18, but the maximum n is 1e18. So for example, if the last term in the list is F(m) which is <=1e18, and the next term is F(m+1) which is >1e18. \n\nSo for example, the list can be generated as follows:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_fib)\n\nBut in Python, we can generate this list. \n\nOnce that's done, for a given n, we can do a binary search on the list to find the largest element <=n. Then, the answer is m-2, where m is the index (but need to adjust for the list indices). \n\nWait, the list starts with m=1, m=2, etc. Let's think:\n\nfibs[0] = 1 (m=1)\n\nfibs[1] = 1 (m=2)\n\nfibs[2] = 2 (m=3)\n\nfibs[3] = 3 (m=4)\n\netc. \n\nSo for the list, the index i corresponds to m = i+1. \n\nWait, for example, for the list [1,1,2,3,5,...], the index 0 is m=1, index 1 is m=2, index 2 is m=3, etc. \n\nSo if we find that the largest element in the list <=n is at index i, then m is i+1. \n\nThen the answer is (i+1) -2 = i-1. \n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nIf the maximum m is such that F(m) <=n, then the answer is m-2. \n\nSo for example, if the list is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5], and n is 3, then the largest F(m) is 3 (m=4). So answer is 4-2=2. \n\nSo for the list, the index of 3 is 3. So m = index +1 = 3+1=4. \n\nThus, the code would need to find the maximum index i where fib[i] <=n. Then m = i+1. Answer is (i+1) -2 = i-1. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nIf the list is [F(1), F(2), F(3), ...], then for each element in the list, the index is i, and the value is F(i+1). \n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe list is built as follows:\n\nInitially, fib = [1, 1]. These are F(1) and F(2). \n\nThen, next term is 2 (F(3)), then 3 (F(4)), etc. So for the list, the index is i, and the value is F(i+1). \n\nSo for example, index 0 is F(1)=1, index 1 is F(2)=1, index 2 is F(3)=2, index 3 is F(4)=3, etc. \n\nSo given that, if I find the largest value in the list that is <=n, say that value is F(m) where m is the corresponding m. Then, the answer is m-2. \n\nBut how to find m? For example, if the value is found at index i, then m is i+1. \n\nBecause F(m) = fib[i], and m = i+1. \n\nSo the answer is (i+1) -2 = i-1. \n\nBut wait, let's take the example where n=3. The list has [1,1,2,3,5...]. The largest value <=3 is 3, which is at index 3. So i=3. m = i+1 =4. answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=2. The largest value is 2 at index 2. i=2. m=3. answer is 3-2=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5. The largest value is 5 at index 4. i=4. m=5. answer is 5-2=3. Which is correct. \n\nSo the formula is correct. \n\nSo the code steps are:\n\n- Precompute the list of F(m) values, starting from m=1, m=2, etc. \n\n- For input n, find the largest element in the list that is <=n. Let's say it's at index i. Then the answer is i-1. \n\nBut how to find the index i? \n\nWe can perform a binary search on the list. \n\nBut in Python, for a list, we can use bisect module. For example, using bisect_right. \n\nFor example, the bisect module's bisect_right function returns the insertion point for the given value. So for a sorted list, if we have a value x, bisect_right returns the index where x would be inserted to maintain order. So for example, if the list is [1,1,2,3,5], and x=3, bisect_right returns 4 (since inserting after the existing 3). \n\nSo the largest element <=x is at index bisect_right(list, x) -1. \n\nSo in code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) -1\n\nif index <0: # n is less than the first element? Not possible since n >=2.\n\nBut for n=2, the list has 1,1,2,3,... so bisect_right would return 3 (since 2 is at index 2, and bisect_right returns insertion point after existing elements). So index is 3-1=2. Which is correct. \n\nSo once we get index, then answer is index -1. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nindex = bisect_right(fibs, n) -1. \n\nThen, answer is (i+1) -2 = i-1. \n\nWait, i is the index in the list. So the answer is (i+1) -2 = i-1. \n\nYes. \n\nSo for example, index is 3 (as in the case of n=3). Then answer is 3-1=2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example, index=2 (for n=2). answer is 2-1=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5. index is 4. answer is 4-1=3. Correct. \n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nGenerate the list of fibs as described. \n\nRead n. \n\nUse bisect to find the index. \n\nIf the index is -1 (unlikely, since n >=2 and the list starts with 1,1,2, etc.), but for n=2, the index will be 2. \n\nOnce index is found, answer is index-1. \n\nBut wait, what if n is larger than all elements in the list? For example, if n is 1e18, but the list's last element is less than that. \n\nWait, during the generation of the list, we generate until the next term exceeds 1e18. So the list contains all F(m) up to the largest one that is <=1e18. \n\nBut suppose n is larger than all elements in the list. For example, if the last element is F(m) = something less than 1e18. Then, for n=1e18, the code would find the index as the last index of the list. \n\nBut how to handle that? \n\nWait, during the generation of the list, the code adds numbers until the next term exceeds 1e18. So the list contains all F(m) up to the maximum possible. \n\nFor example, let's generate the list. Let me think:\n\nStart with [1, 1]. \n\nnext term is 2, added. \n\nthen 3, added. \n\nthen 5, added. \n\nand so on. \n\nSo for example, the list will contain F(1) to F(k), where F(k) is the largest Fibonacci number <=1e18. \n\nThus, for any n up to 1e18, the code will find the correct index. \n\nSo, in code:\n\nGenerate the list of fibs as follows:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float. It's better to use integers. So perhaps:\n\nmax_n = 10**18\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > max_n:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nBut then, for n=1e18, if the next_fib is larger than that, the loop breaks. \n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n, the code uses bisect_right to find the index. \n\nBut what if n is larger than all elements in the list? For example, suppose the last element is F(k) which is less than n. Then, the code would find that index is len(fibs)-1, and answer is len(fibs)-1 -1 = len(fibs)-2. \n\nBut in reality, the maximum possible m is the index of the last element. \n\nBut in that case, the code would return that. \n\nBut how to handle cases where n is larger than the last element of the list? \n\nWell, the code will not generate the next_fib if it's larger than 1e18. So for example, if the last element is F(k) <=1e18, and the next term is F(k+1) = F(k) + F(k-1) >1e18. So, for n=1e18, if F(k) is the last element, then the code would find the index of F(k), which is len(fibs)-1. \n\nBut what if n is larger than F(k), but less than F(k+1)? \n\nFor example, say F(k) is 1e18-1, and F(k+1) is 1e18+1. Then, for n=1e18, the code would find that the largest F(m) <=n is F(k), which is the last element of the list. \n\nSo the code would correctly return that. \n\nThus, the code should handle all cases. \n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs. \n\nSample Input 2: n=3. The list fibs is [1,1,2,3,5,...]. For n=3, bisect_right returns 4 (since the insertion point is after the 3). index is 4-1=3. answer is 3-1=2. Correct. \n\nSample Input 4: n=4. The largest F(m) <=4 is 3 (F(4)=3). index is 3. answer 3-1=2. Correct. \n\nSample Input 10: n=10. The fibs list includes 1,1,2,3,5,8,13. So for 10, the largest is 8 (F(6)=8). index is 5 (since the list is [1,1,2,3,5,8], indexes 0-5). bisect_right returns 6 (since 8 is at index 5, and 10 is larger than 8. So insertion point is 6. index =6-1=5. answer is 5-1=4. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo the code seems correct. \n\nNow, let's code this in Python. \n\nBut first, generate the list of fibs. \n\nBut note that the initial list is [1,1], then we generate next terms. \n\nNow, in code:\n\nWe can generate the list as follows:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_f > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_f)\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float. For big integers, we should use integers. So 10**18. \n\nSo:\n\nmax_n = 10**18\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_f > max_n:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_f)\n\nOnce this is done, for each input n, we can do:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn = int(input())\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) -1\n\nif index <0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(index -1)\n\nWait, but for n=2, the fibs list has 1,1,2. So bisect_right(fibs, 2) returns 3, index is 3-1=2. answer is 2-1=1. Correct. \n\nBut what if the input is n=1? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So we don't need to handle that. \n\nBut for n=2, the code works. \n\nTesting sample input 2: n=3. \n\nbisect_right([1,1,2,3,5], 3) returns 4, index is 3. answer 3-1=2. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: n=4. The fibs list is [1,1,2,3,5]. bisect_right returns 4 (since 3 <4 <5). index is 3. answer 3-1=2. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: n=5. bisect_right returns 5 (since 5 is in the list). index=5-1=4. answer 4-1=3. \n\nSo the code seems correct. \n\nBut wait, the list may have more elements. Let's think about the generated list. \n\nBut what about when the next_f is exactly equal to 1e18? The code would append it. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut note that the list may be empty? No, since the initial list is [1,1]. \n\nBut in code, for n=2, the list has [1,1,2]. \n\nSo the code for the problem is:\n\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18\n\n    max_n = 10**18\n\n    fibs = [1, 1]\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n        if next_f > max_n:\n\n            break\n\n        fibs.append(next_f)\n\n    # Now find the index\n\n    index = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) -1\n\n    print(index -1)\n\nBut wait, what if the index is 0? For example, if n is 1. But n is at least 2. \n\nBut for n=2, the fibs list has 1,1,2. bisect_right returns 3, index is 2. answer is 2-1=1. Correct. \n\nBut let's test for n=2. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: n=1 is invalid, but the code would have index=0 (if n=1, bisect_right returns 1 (since 1 is in the list, and the insertion point after the first occurrence?), but for the code, the input is n>=2. \n\nSo the code should handle all cases. \n\nWait, but for n=2, the code returns index-1 = 2-1=1. Which is correct. \n\nBut what if the list doesn't have 2? For example, if the code breaks before adding 2? No, because the initial list is [1,1], next_f is 2, which is <=1e18, so it is added. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nBut let's check the sample input:\n\nSample input 2 is 3, output is 2. \n\nSample input 4 is 4, output 2. \n\nSample input 10 is 10, output 4. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother test case: n=5, output is 3. \n\nAnother test case: n=8, output is 4-1=3? Wait, let's see. \n\nFor n=8, the fibs list includes 8. \n\nThe index is bisect_right(fibs, 8) -1. \n\nAssuming the list has 1,1,2,3,5,8. So bisect_right returns 6 (since 8 is at index 5, and the insertion point after that). index is 5. answer is 5-1=4. \n\nWhich is correct. Because F(6) is 8. m=6. answer is 6-2=4. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nThus, the Python code should be as written. \n\nBut wait, the code is generating the list inside the main function. But for very large numbers, this is efficient? Since the list is generated once, and the number of elements is about 85 or so. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the code can be written. \n\nBut note that in the problem statement, the input is a single integer n. So the code reads from stdin, processes it, and outputs the answer. \n\nNow, let's code it. \n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin. Also, for n=1, but according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. \n\nBut the code is written for n >=2. \n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport bisect\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    max_n = 10**18\n    fibs = [1, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n        if next_f > max_n:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_f)\n    index = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n    print(index - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, let's test for n=2. \n\nThe fibs list is [1,1,2,3,5,...]. bisect_right([1,1,2,3,5], 2) returns 3. index is 3-1=2. 2-1=1. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother test case: n=3. index is 3 (bisect_right returns 4-1=3). 3-1=2. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: n=4. index is 3 (bisect_right returns 4, index is 3). 3-1=2. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: n=5. index is 4. 4-1=3. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: n=8. index is 5. 5-1=4. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: n=13. index is 6 (since fibs is [1,1,2,3,5,8,13], bisect_right returns 7-1=6. 6-1=5. Which is 5. For m=7, 7-2=5. Which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nBut let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2: 3 → Output 2. \n\nSample Input 4: 4 → Output 2. \n\nSample Input 10: 10 → Output 4. \n\nFor n=10, the fibs list includes 1,1,2,3,5,8,13. So bisect_right(fibs, 10) is 6 (since 8 is at index 5, and 10 is larger than 8 but smaller than 13). So index is 6-1=5. 5-1=4. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, this code should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given the constraint that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. The solution involves leveraging the properties of Fibonacci numbers to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraint**: The key insight is recognizing that the problem can be modeled using Fibonacci numbers. The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci sequence pattern.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. This is derived from the observation that each game the winner plays requires an opponent who has played a number of games differing by at most one.\n3. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to $10^{18}$ since the maximum possible value for `n` is $10^{18}$.\n4. **Binary Search**: For a given `n`, use binary search to find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`. This helps in determining the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    max_n = 10**18\n    fibs = [1, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n        if next_f > max_n:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_f)\n    index = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n    print(index - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: The code generates all Fibonacci numbers up to $10^{18}$. This is done in a loop where each subsequent Fibonacci number is calculated until it exceeds $10^{18}$.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: Using the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, the code efficiently finds the position where `n` would fit in the list of precomputed Fibonacci numbers. This position helps determine the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`.\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: The result is derived by adjusting the index found using binary search. The maximum number of games the winner can play is calculated as the index of the found Fibonacci number minus 1, adjusted for the offset in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct, leveraging mathematical properties and binary search for optimal performance.",
