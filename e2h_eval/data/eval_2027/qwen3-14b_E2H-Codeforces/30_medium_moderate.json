Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. Each takes turns, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of moves (H for Homer, M for Marge) that gives the maximum total.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to decide, at each step, whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit. But since both have to take exactly n digits each, the choice isn't just greedy. Because the decision now affects future choices.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. The total possible sequences would be combinations of choosing n H's and n M's, which is C(36, 18), which is way too big for brute force. So we need a dynamic programming approach here.\n\nWhat's the state here? Well, the state depends on how many digits each player has taken so far. Let's say, for example, that Homer has taken h moves and Marge has taken m moves. Since the total number of moves is 2n, and h + m = current step. Also, since each player must make exactly n moves, the state can be represented by (h, m). But since h + m = current step, maybe we can represent it with just one variable, like the number of steps taken so far, and then h and m can be derived based on that. Wait, but for each step, the number of steps taken is h + m. For example, after k steps, h + m = k. And since each player can't take more than n steps, h can range from max(0, k - (n)) to min(n, k). Wait, maybe not. Let me think: For a given step k (from 0 to 2n-1), the number of steps taken is k. So, for the state, we can track how many times Homer has taken a move so far (h) and Marge (m). But since h + m = k, we can represent the state as (h, m) where h + m = k. However, since h and m are determined by k and the other, perhaps we can represent the state as (h, m) where h is the number of Homer's moves so far, and m is the number of Marge's moves. But since h + m = current step, we can track h and m as h and (current step - h). Wait, maybe it's better to track h and m as h and m, with h + m = steps taken so far. But for the DP, the state would be (h, m), and the current position in the string A.\n\nWait, but the digits are being taken from the left. So the current position in A depends on how many digits have been taken so far. For example, if we have taken k digits, the next digit is at position k (assuming zero-based or one-based? Well, the initial A is 2n digits. So if we have taken k digits, the next digit is the (k)th index in the original string (if we start from 0). So for the DP state, we need to know how many digits have been taken so far. Which is equal to h + m. So the state can be represented by (h, m) where h is the number of Homer's moves and m is the number of Marge's moves. Then, the current digit is the (h + m)th digit in the original string. Wait, no. Because each move takes one digit. So after h + m moves, the next digit is the (h + m)th index (assuming that the original string is 0-based). For example, initially, h=0, m=0, so the first digit is index 0. Then, after taking one digit, the next is index 1, etc.\n\nSo the DP state can be (h, m), which implies that the next digit to take is at position (h + m) in the original A string.\n\nNow, for the DP transition. At each state (h, m), we can decide whether the next move is H or M. However, we have to make sure that Homer can't take more than n moves, and same for Marge.\n\nSo, for the state (h, m), the next move can be H if h < n, and M if m < n. Then, for each possible choice, we can compute the maximum total sum.\n\nBut what's the value we're trying to maximize? The sum of S1 and S2. Each time a player takes a digit, that digit contributes to their own number. So the total sum is the sum of all digits in S1 multiplied by their respective place values plus the same for S2. Wait, no. Wait, S1 is the number formed by the digits taken by Homer. For example, if he takes digits d1, d2, ..., dn, then his number is d1 * 10^{n-1} + d2 * 10^{n-2} + ... + dn * 10^0. Similarly for S2. The total prize is S1 + S2. So the problem is to maximize this sum.\n\nBut how do we model this in DP? Because the value of each digit depends on when it's taken. For example, the first digit taken by Homer is the most significant digit in his number. So, for Homer, the first digit he takes contributes 10^{n-1} to his total, the second contributes 10^{n-2}, etc. Similarly for Marge.\n\nTherefore, the DP state needs to track not only how many digits each has taken, but also the positions in their numbers. Wait, but that's going to complicate things. For example, for Homer, if he has taken h digits so far, then the next digit he takes will be the (h+1)th digit in his number. So, the value contributed by that digit is digit * 10^{n - h - 1}. Similarly for Marge.\n\nSo the DP state can be (h, m), and for each state, we can calculate the maximum total sum possible from that state onwards. The transitions would be:\n\nAt state (h, m), the current digit is A[k], where k = h + m. Now, if we choose to take H, then Homer adds this digit to his number. The contribution to the total is digit * 10^{n - h - 1} (since he has taken h digits before, and this is the (h+1)th digit, which is multiplied by 10^{n - (h+1)} ? Wait, let's think: suppose n is 2. If Homer takes a digit now as his first move, then that's the first digit of his number. So for n=2, the first digit contributes 10^(2-1) = 10^1 = 10. The second digit contributes 10^0 = 1. So yes, when he has h digits already, taking the next digit contributes digit * 10^{n - h - 1} ?\n\nYes. So for each choice (H or M), we can calculate the immediate contribution to the total sum, and then add the result of the DP for the next state.\n\nSo the DP recurrence would be:\n\ndp[h][m] = max(\n    (digit * 10^{n - h - 1} ) + dp[h+1][m], \n    (digit * 10^{n - m - 1} ) + dp[h][m+1]\n)\n\nBut wait, the digit is the same for both options. So, when choosing H, the current digit is added to Homer's number, contributing digit * 10^{n - h - 1} (because he has h digits already, and this is his (h+1)th digit, which is in the position of 10^{n - (h+1)}? Wait, no. Wait, for example, if Homer is to take his h-th digit (assuming he has taken h digits before), then the new digit is his (h+1)th digit. So the number of digits he will have is h+1. The total number of digits in his number is n. So the place value is 10^{n - (h+1)}. For example, if n is 2, and he takes the first digit (h=0), then the place value is 10^{2-1} = 10^1. Then, when he takes the second digit (h=1), the place value is 10^{2-2} = 10^0.\n\nSo yes, the contribution for H is digit * 10^{n - h - 1} and for M is digit * 10^{n - m - 1}.\n\nSo the DP approach is feasible. However, the problem is that for n=18, the maximum h and m can be up to 18. So the DP table is (19 x 19) states. For each state, we can compute the maximum total sum. And for each state, we can also track the choice made (H or M) to reconstruct the path.\n\nBut wait, the DP state is (h, m). The maximum h is n, and same for m. So for n=18, the DP table is 19x19=361 states. That's very manageable. So the DP is feasible.\n\nBut how do we compute the 10^... terms? Since n can be up to 18, the exponents can be up to 17. So 10^17 is manageable as an integer. However, for Python, even 10^18 is okay.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the powers of 10 for each possible exponent (from 0 to n-1). For example, for Homer's contribution when he takes the (h)th digit (h starts from 0?), no. Wait, when he takes the (h+1)th digit, the exponent is n - h - 1. So for h ranging from 0 to n-1, the exponent ranges from n-1 down to 0.\n\nSo precompute pow10[i] = 10^i. For i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut for each state (h, m), when considering taking H, the exponent is (n - h - 1). So for example, if h is the current count of Homer's digits, then the next digit would be his (h+1)th digit, which contributes digit * 10^{n - (h+1)} = digit * 10^{n - h - 1}.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n- Read n and A. A is a string of 2n digits.\n\n- Precompute pow10 array. pow10[i] = 10^i. For i from 0 to n-1.\n\n- Create a memoization table for DP. Since n is small, we can use memoization with recursion or a bottom-up approach.\n\n- The DP function will take h and m as parameters and return the maximum total sum possible from that state.\n\n- For the base case, when h == n and m == n, the sum is 0 (no more digits to take).\n\n- For each state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m], since h + m digits have been taken so far, so the next digit is at index h + m.\n\n- Then, for the current digit, we can choose to take H or M, provided that h < n and m < n respectively.\n\n- For each possible choice, compute the contribution and add the result of the next state.\n\n- The DP will choose the maximum between the two options.\n\nBut since the problem requires not only the maximum sum but also the sequence of choices, we need to track the path. So during the DP, for each state, we can store the choice (H or M) that leads to the optimal solution.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nImplement a memoization-based DP with memo for the maximum sum, and another memo (or a separate structure) for the choice made at each state.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, for each state, we can compute the best choice, and then reconstruct the path once the DP is filled.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nLet's think of using memoization with recursion. For each state (h, m), we can compute the maximum sum. Once that is computed, we can track which choice (H or M) was better. Then, when reconstructing the path, we can check for each state what choice was made.\n\nBut for Python, recursion with memoization may be acceptable here. However, since n is up to 18, and h and m up to 18, the number of possible states is (19 * 19) = 361. So recursion is feasible.\n\nLet me outline the code steps:\n\nFirst, parse input. For example, n is given as input, and then A as a string. For example, in the first sample input, n is 2, A is '1234'.\n\nThen, precompute pow10. For example, for n=2, pow10[0] = 1, pow10[1] = 10. Wait, but for Homer's contribution when he takes the first digit (h=0), the exponent is n - h - 1 = 2 - 0 - 1 = 1. So 10^1. Which is pow10[1]. So for general, pow10[i] = 10^i. So for exponent e, we can get pow10[e].\n\nSo, for the pow10 array, we need to generate 10^e for e from 0 to n-1. So for e in 0 to n-1.\n\nSo, pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)].\n\nBut wait, when n is 18, the maximum exponent is 17. So 10^17 is manageable.\n\nOnce that's done, the DP can proceed.\n\nThe DP can be implemented as a memoized function. Let's think of using memoization with lru_cache. However, since the parameters h and m are integers, and for n up to 18, it's manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, we can use a decorator like @lru_cache(maxsize=None). However, since the function is recursive, we can write it as follows.\n\nBut first, we need to convert the string A into a list of integers. For example, A_str = '1234' becomes [1,2,3,4].\n\nNow, for the DP function:\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    if h == n and m == n:\n        return 0\n\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n\n    # check if we can take H or M\n\n    options = []\n\n    if h < n:\n        # take H\n        contribution = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1]\n        next_sum = dp(h + 1, m)\n        total = contribution + next_sum\n        options.append( (total, 'H') )\n\n    if m < n:\n        # take M\n        contribution = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1]\n        next_sum = dp(h, m + 1)\n        total = contribution + next_sum\n        options.append( (total, 'M') )\n\n    # choose the option with maximum total\n    # if there are multiple options with same total, choose any (the problem says output any)\n    max_total, choice = max(options)\n    return max_total\n\nWait, but this is a simplified version. However, the problem is that in the code, the function dp returns the maximum total sum. But in order to reconstruct the path, we need to track which choice was made at each state.\n\nSo, perhaps during the DP, we can have another memoization table that stores the choice made for each (h, m) state. Alternatively, once the DP is computed, we can reconstruct the path by checking for each state which choice (H or M) gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut the problem is that the DP function as written above would need to be called recursively. However, for memoization, it's easier to compute the maximum sum first, then reconstruct the path.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternative approach: first compute the DP table using memoization, storing the maximum sum for each (h, m) state. Then, reconstruct the path by starting from (0, 0) and at each step choosing H or M based on which option gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to compute the DP table? Let's think of using memoization with a memo dictionary, and then for each state, compute the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the code could be structured as follows:\n\nWe can precompute the pow10 array.\n\nThen, memoize the dp function, which returns the maximum sum possible from state (h, m).\n\nOnce that's done, we can reconstruct the path by starting at h=0, m=0, and for each step, check which choice (H or M) leads to the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to check that? For example, at state (h, m), the current digit is A[k], where k = h + m. Then, for the choice of H, the contribution is current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] plus dp(h+1, m). For the choice of M, it's current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] plus dp(h, m+1). So, during the reconstruction phase, for each (h, m), we can check which of these two options gives the maximum sum.\n\nSo, during the reconstruction phase, for each (h, m), we check:\n\ncurrent_digit = A[h + m]\n\nif h < n and m < n:\n\n   option_h = current_digit * ... + dp(h+1, m)\n\n   option_m = current_digit * ... + dp(h, m+1)\n\n   compare and choose the one with higher value.\n\nBut since we have already computed the dp table, we can compute this during the reconstruction.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the dp table (using memoization) for all (h, m) states.\n\n2. Reconstruct the path by starting at (0, 0), and at each step, decide whether to take H or M based on which choice gives the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the code would need to compute the dp table, and then reconstruct the path.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut for the DP function, since the parameters h and m can be up to 18, and n is up to 18, we can use memoization via lru_cache.\n\nBut the problem is that the current_digit depends on the position h + m. So, in the DP function, we need to access the original A string. However, in Python, when using memoization with a function, the function can't have side effects, but here the function is dependent on the global A string.\n\nWait, but in the code, the DP function is part of the code that processes the input. So during the processing of the input, the A string is fixed. So, for example, during the DP computation, the function can refer to the A string as a global variable.\n\nBut in Python, if we use memoization (like lru_cache), the function must be pure. However, the A string is fixed for a particular run of the code, so it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, the DP function can take the A string as a parameter. But that would complicate memoization, because the A string is different for different test cases. However, since the code is handling one test case at a time, the DP function can be redefined for each test case.\n\nBut in the code, the function will be written for a specific A and n. So, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and A.\n\nConvert A into a list of integers (digits).\n\nPrecompute pow10.\n\nImplement a memoized DP function that uses the digits and pow10.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, functions can't be nested if using lru_cache. Or can they? Well, perhaps it's easier to use memoization via a memo dictionary.\n\nAlternatively, use memoization with functools.lru_cache, but for that, the parameters of the function must be hashable. So, the function can take h and m as parameters, and the digits and pow10 are global variables.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's easier to use memoization with lru_cache.\n\nLet me try to outline the code.\n\nSample code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nA_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A_str]\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h + m == 2*n:\n        return 0\n    current_digit = digits[h + m]\n    options = []\n    if h < n:\n        contribution = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1]\n        next_val = dp(h+1, m)\n        options.append( (contribution + next_val, 'H') )\n    if m < n:\n        contribution = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1]\n        next_val = dp(h, m+1)\n        options.append( (contribution + next_val, 'M') )\n    # choose the maximum option\n    return max(options)[0]\n\nBut wait, the code above returns the maximum value, but how to reconstruct the path?\n\nOnce the DP is computed, the code needs to reconstruct the path. So, for that, perhaps during the DP, we can also track the choice made. However, the above code doesn't track that. So, perhaps we need to create another function or a memoization table that stores the choice made for each (h, m) state.\n\nAlternative approach: after computing the DP table, we can reconstruct the path by checking for each (h, m) state which choice (H or M) gives the maximum value.\n\nSo, during reconstruction, we can start with h=0, m=0. For each step, we check which option (H or M) gives the maximum sum. Let's see.\n\nFor example:\n\ncurrent_h = 0, current_m = 0.\n\nAt each step, we check if choosing H or M is possible, and compute the value of choosing that option.\n\nBut how to compute the value? Because the DP function already returns the maximum value for (h, m). So for (h, m), the value of choosing H is (current_digit * ...) + dp(h+1, m). Similarly for M.\n\nBut since the DP function already returns the maximum value for (h, m), then for the choice of H, the value is current_digit * ... + dp(h+1, m), and for M, it's current_digit * ... + dp(h, m+1). However, the DP function returns the maximum of these two. So during reconstruction, we can compare these two values and choose the one that matches the DP value.\n\nSo during reconstruction, for each (h, m) state, we check:\n\ncurrent_digit = digits[h + m]\n\noption_h_val = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] + dp(h+1, m)\noption_m_val = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] + dp(h, m+1)\n\nif option_h_val > option_m_val:\n    choose H\nelse:\n    choose M\n\nBut since dp(h, m) is the maximum of these two, then the choice is the one that gives the maximum.\n\nSo during reconstruction, we can do this.\n\nBut how to compute this? Because in the code, the dp function returns the maximum value. So during reconstruction, for each state, we can compute the two options and choose accordingly.\n\nBut this requires that the dp function is already computed. So the steps are:\n\nCompute the DP table (memoized) for all possible (h, m) states.\n\nThen, start from (0, 0), and for each step, decide whether to take H or M based on which option gives the maximum value.\n\nSo the code for reconstruction would be something like:\n\nresult = []\nh = 0\nm = 0\nwhile h + m < 2*n:\n    current_pos = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n    # check possible choices\n    option_h_possible = h < n\n    option_m_possible = m < n\n\n    # compute the two options\n    if option_h_possible and option_m_possible:\n        val_h = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] + dp(h+1, m)\n        val_m = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] + dp(h, m+1)\n        if val_h > val_m:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    elif option_h_possible:\n        result.append('H')\n        h += 1\n    else:\n        result.append('M')\n        m += 1\n\nreturn ''.join(result)\n\nBut this seems feasible.\n\nBut in the code, the dp function is already memoized. However, when we call dp(h+1, m) and dp(h, m+1), those values are already computed.\n\nSo, putting this together, the code would be:\n\nBut in Python, for the dp function, when using lru_cache, the parameters h and m are passed as integers, and the function is memoized.\n\nBut for the pow10 array, the code uses the global variable pow10, which is precomputed.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the pow10 array is of length n. However, when n is 18, and the exponent is n - h - 1. For example, when h is 0, n - h -1 = 17, which is within the pow10 array (since pow10 is [10^0, 10^1, ..., 10^{n-1} ]). So yes.\n\nBut for n=18, the pow10 array has indices from 0 to 17. So when h is 0, n - h -1 = 17, which is valid. When h is 17, n - h -1 = 18 - 17 -1 = 0. Which is valid. So yes, the pow10 array is correctly precomputed.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nSo, n=2, A is '1234', digits [1,2,3,4].\n\npow10 is [1, 10] (for exponents 0 and 1).\n\nThe DP function for (0, 0):\n\ncurrent_digit is digits[0] = 1.\n\nPossible choices:\n\nH: contribution is 1 * 10^{2 - 0 -1} = 1 * 10^1 = 10. Then dp(1, 0).\n\nM: contribution is 1 * 10^{2 - 0 -1} = 1*10^1 = 10. Then dp(0, 1).\n\nSo, need to compute dp(1, 0) and dp(0, 1).\n\nLet's compute dp(1, 0):\n\nh=1, m=0. current digit is at position 1+0 = 1, which is 2.\n\nPossible choices:\n\nH: h=1 is already 1, which is n=2? No, n is 2. h can be up to 2. So h < n (1 < 2) is true. So H is possible.\n\ncontribution for H is 2 * 10^{2 - 1 -1} = 2 * 10^0 = 2. Then dp(2, 0).\n\ndp(2, 0): h=2, m=0. current digit is at 2+0=2, which is 3.\n\nNow, h=2 is equal to n=2, so can't take H. So only M is possible. So contribution is 3 * 10^{2 - 0 -1} = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then dp(2, 1).\n\ndp(2, 1): h=2, m=1. current digit is 3 (h+m=3). Now, h=2 is n, m=1 < 2. So take M. contribution is 4 * 10^{2 - 1 -1} = 4 * 10^0 = 4. Then dp(2, 2) which is 0. So total is 4. So dp(2, 1) returns 4. So back to dp(2, 0): 30 + 4 = 34. So dp(2, 0) returns 34.\n\nSo back to dp(1, 0) for H choice: 2 + 34 = 36.\n\nFor M choice in dp(1, 0): m is 0. So contribution is 2 * 10^{2 - 0 -1} = 2 * 10^1 = 20. Then dp(1, 1).\n\nLet's compute dp(1, 1). current digit is at position 1+1=2 (digit 3). Possible choices: h=1 < 2 and m=1 < 2.\n\nH choice: contribution is 3 * 10^{2 - 1 -1} = 3 * 1 = 3. Then dp(2, 1) which is 4. Total 3 +4 =7.\n\nM choice: contribution is 3 * 10^{2 - 1 -1} = 3 * 1 = 3. Then dp(1, 2). For dp(1, 2): current digit is 3 (h+m=3). Now, m=2, which is n. So can't take M. Only H is possible. h is 1 < 2. Take H: contribution is 4 * 10^{2 - 1 -1} = 4 * 1 =4. Then dp(2, 2) which is 0. So total 4. So dp(1, 2) returns 4. So for M choice in dp(1, 1): 3 +4=7. So both options give 7. So dp(1, 1) returns 7. So back to the M choice for dp(1, 0): 20 +7 = 27. Which is less than 36. So dp(1, 0) returns 36.\n\nSo back to the initial (0, 0) choice for H: 10 + 36 = 46.\n\nNow, let's look at the M choice for (0, 0): contribution is 1 * 10^{2 - 0 -1} = 1 * 10^1 = 10. Then dp(0, 1).\n\nLet's compute dp(0, 1). current digit is at 0+1=1 (digit 2). Possible choices: h=0 < 2, m=1 < 2.\n\nH choice: contribution is 2 * 10^{2 - 0 -1} = 2 * 10^1 = 20. Then dp(1, 1) which is 7. Total 20 +7 = 27.\n\nM choice: contribution is 2 * 10^{2 - 1 -1} = 2 * 1 = 2. Then dp(0, 2). dp(0, 2) has current digit at 0+2=2 (digit 3). Now, m=2 is n. So can't take M. Only H is allowed. So take H: contribution is 3 * 10^{2 - 0 -1} = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then dp(1, 2) which returns 4. Total 30 +4 =34. So dp(0, 2) returns 34. So M choice for dp(0, 1) gives 2 + 34 = 36. So comparing 27 and 36, the maximum is 36. So dp(0, 1) returns 36. So the M choice for (0, 0) gives 10 + 36 = 46. So both options (H and M) for (0, 0) give 46. So the code would choose either. Which explains why in the sample input, there are two possible outputs, such as 'HHMM' and 'HMHM'.\n\nBut according to the sample input, the output for the first case is 'HHMM' and for the second input it's 'HMHM'.\n\nBut in our code, during reconstruction, when there are multiple options with the same value, which one is chosen depends on the code's comparison. For example, in the case where both options give the same value, the code would choose 'H' if the val_h >= val_m, or 'M' otherwise.\n\nIn the sample input, for (0, 0), the two options are equal. So during reconstruction, the code would choose H or M based on which one is considered first. For example, in the code as written, when comparing val_h and val_m, if they are equal, the code would choose 'M' since in the max function, if the tuples are (46, 'H') and (46, 'M'), then the max would pick the first one (since 'H' comes before 'M' lex order?), but no, the code in the DP function returns the maximum value, but in the code for the DP function, the options are stored as tuples (value, choice), and the max is taken. However, in the code I outlined earlier, the DP function returns the maximum value, not the choice. Therefore, during reconstruction, when the two options are equal, the code would have to decide which one to take based on the code's logic.\n\nIn the code for reconstruction, when val_h equals val_m, the code would choose 'H' if the code checks if val_h >= val_m. For example, in the code:\n\nif val_h > val_m:\n    choose H\nelse:\n    choose M\n\nSo, in the case of equality, it chooses M. Which would lead to the sample output 'HMHM' in some cases. However, the sample input for the first case has output 'HHMM' which suggests that when there's a tie, the code can choose either.\n\nBut the problem says that if there are multiple solutions, output any of them. So the code can choose either option in case of a tie.\n\nBut in the code's reconstruction phase, when val_h and val_m are equal, the code will choose M. However, in the sample input, the correct output is 'HHMM' and 'HMHM'. So in the first case, the code's choice would depend on how the options are evaluated.\n\nBut perhaps the code's logic for the reconstruction is correct, and the sample output is just one of the possible correct answers.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python.\n\nBut let's think about the pow10 array. For example, when n=2, pow10 is [1, 10]. So when h=0, the exponent is 2 - 0 -1 = 1, which is 10^1 = 10. Which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: when the code computes pow10, it's for exponents from 0 to n-1. So for n=2, exponents are 0 and 1. For the case when h is 1, the exponent is 2 - 1 -1 = 0, which is 10^0 = 1. Correct.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n, read A string.\n\ndigits = list of integers of A.\n\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)].\n\nImplement the dp function with memoization.\n\nThen, reconstruct the path.\n\nBut in Python, the lru_cache decorator can be used for memoization. However, the function dp must be inside the code that reads the input. So perhaps the code can be structured as follows.\n\nBut the problem is that the code must handle multiple test cases? No, the problem says that the input is one case. So the code reads one n and one A string.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A_str]\n    pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n        options = []\n        if h < n:\n            contribution = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1]\n            next_val = dp(h+1, m)\n            options.append( (contribution + next_val, 'H') )\n        if m < n:\n            contribution = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1]\n            next_val = dp(h, m+1)\n            options.append( (contribution + next_val, 'M') )\n        # return the maximum value\n        return max(options)[0]\n\n    # Now reconstruct the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a number A, with each player making exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers formed by the digits they take.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach to keep track of the maximum possible total prize money starting from any given state (number of moves made by Homer and Marge).\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: Since the contribution of each digit depends on its position in the number formed, we precompute powers of 10 to efficiently calculate the value of each digit when it is taken.\n3. **Reconstruct the Path**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the sequence of moves by checking at each step whether taking the next digit for Homer or Marge leads to the higher total prize.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A_str]\n    pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n        options = []\n        if h < n:\n            contribution = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1]\n            next_val = dp(h + 1, m)\n            options.append((contribution + next_val, 'H'))\n        if m < n:\n            contribution = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1]\n            next_val = dp(h, m + 1)\n            options.append((contribution + next_val, 'M'))\n        return max(options)[0]\n\n    # Reconstruct the path\n    result = []\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n        option_h = option_m = None\n        if h < n:\n            val_h = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] + dp(h + 1, m)\n            option_h = ('H', val_h)\n        if m < n:\n            val_m = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] + dp(h, m + 1)\n            option_m = ('M', val_m)\n        \n        if h < n and m < n:\n            if option_h[1] > option_m[1]:\n                result.append('H')\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                result.append('M')\n                m += 1\n        elif h < n:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('M')\n            m += 1\n\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an integer `n` and a string `A_str`.\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: This helps in quickly calculating the value of each digit based on its position in the number formed by each player.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function uses memoization to store results of subproblems. It calculates the maximum total prize money from the current state (h, m) by considering both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit).\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the sequence of moves by comparing the potential values of taking the next digit for Homer or Marge at each step, ensuring the optimal choice is made at each decision point.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal sequence of moves using dynamic programming and memoization, leading to an optimal solution in polynomial time.",
