During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let me think. Let's first understand what's going on here. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, for x = a +k and y = b +k. But since both x and y are being increased by the same k, perhaps there's a way to express this in terms of their difference.\n\nLet me see. Let's assume that a and b are such that a < b. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that. So maybe I should first compute the difference between a and b. Let me think: suppose we have a and b. Let me denote d = |a - b|. Then, when we add k to both, the difference between the two numbers remains the same. Because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So the difference between x and y is fixed as (a - b), regardless of k. So, the difference between the two numbers is fixed. Let me denote x and y as the two numbers after adding k. Let's say x = a +k, y = b +k. Then, x - y = a - b. Let me call this difference d. Without loss of generality, let's assume that a ≤ b. Then, d = b - a. So, y = x + d. Then, the LCM of x and x + d. Hmm.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x such that LCM(x, x + d) is minimized, where d is fixed (d = |a - b|). Then, once we find the optimal x, we can compute k as x - a (since x = a +k → k = x -a). But since x must be positive, because a and b are positive integers, and k is non-negative. So x is at least a (since k ≥0). But if a is larger than b, then d would be a -b, but the same logic applies.\n\nSo the key idea here is to find x such that x and x + d have the smallest possible LCM. Then, the minimal k is x - a (assuming a is the smaller one). Wait, but how do we find x?\n\nLet me think. For x and x +d, their GCD is gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d). Because gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d). So the LCM is (x*(x +d))/gcd(x, d). So the problem becomes minimizing this value.\n\nSo the LCM is (x*(x +d)) / g, where g is gcd(x, d). Let me think about how to minimize this. Since d is fixed, perhaps we can find x such that x is as small as possible, but also that the gcd(x, d) is as large as possible. Because the denominator increases with larger g, which reduces the overall value.\n\nBut how to find x? Let me think about the possible values of x. Since x can be any number greater than or equal to min(a, b) (since k is non-negative). Wait, no. Because if a is smaller than b, then x = a +k, and since k is non-negative, x can be as small as a. But if a is larger than b, then the same applies. So x can be any value starting from the minimum of a and b. However, the problem is to find the x that minimizes the LCM of x and x +d, where d is the absolute difference between a and b.\n\nSo, let's suppose that d is fixed. Let me take the example given in the problem. First input is 6 and 10. Then d is 4. So x is a +k = 6 +k, and x +d = 6 +k +4 = 10 +k. Which is correct. So the problem is to find x such that LCM(x, x +4) is minimized. The minimal occurs when x is 8 (k=2), which gives LCM(8, 12) = 24. Let's see why. For x=6, LCM(6, 10) is 30. For x=7, LCM(7, 11) is 77. For x=8, 8 and 12 → LCM is 24. For x=9, 9 and 13 → 117. So yes, 8 is better.\n\nSo, how to find x? Well, since d is fixed,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. The key insight here is that the difference between $ a $ and $ b $ remains constant regardless of $ k $, which allows us to reduce the problem to finding an optimal value based on this fixed difference.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Difference Calculation**: Calculate the absolute difference $ d $ between $ a $ and $ b $.\n2. **Optimal Value Determination**: For the LCM of $ x $ and $ x + d $ to be minimized, we need to consider values of $ x $ such that $ x $ is as small as possible while maximizing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $ x $ and $ d $. This helps in reducing the LCM value significantly.\n3. **Iterative Search**: We iterate over potential values of $ x $ starting from the minimum of $ a $ and $ b $, checking for the optimal $ x $ that minimizes the LCM. The optimal $ x $ will be found by checking values around the divisors of $ d $, as these are likely candidates for minimizing the LCM.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(x, y):\n    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)\n\ndef find_min_k(a, b):\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        return 0\n    min_k = 0\n    min_lcm = compute_lcm(a, b)\n    \n    # We need to check possible candidates for x\n    # The optimal x is such that x is as small as possible and gcd(x, d) is large\n    # So we check all divisors of d, and also check some nearby values\n    \n    # First, check the case where x = min(a, b)\n    # Then, check for possible candidates around the divisors of d\n    # Let's generate all divisors of d\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    \n    candidates = []\n    for g in divisors:\n        # We want x such that x is divisible by g, and x >= min(a, b)\n        # Also, since x and x + d have GCD g, we can try x = m * g\n        # Where m is such that x >= min_val\n        min_val = min(a, b)\n        # Try x = m * g - (some offset)\n        # Let's find m such that x is close to min_val\n        m = (min_val + g - 1) // g  # ceiling division\n        x_candidate = m * g\n        candidates.append(x_candidate)\n        # Also check x_candidate - g (if it's >= min_val)\n        if x_candidate - g >= min_val:\n            candidates.append(x_candidate - g)\n    \n    # Also include the original min_val\n    candidates.append(min_val)\n    \n    # Now evaluate all candidates and find the best one\n    best_k = 0\n    best_lcm = min_lcm\n    for x in candidates:\n        k = x - min(a, b)\n        if k < 0:\n            continue\n        val1 = a + k\n        val2 = b + k\n        current_lcm = compute_lcm(val1, val2)\n        if current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k < best_k):\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n    \n    return best_k\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    for i in range(0, len(input), 2):\n        a = int(input[i])\n        b = int(input[i+1])\n        print(find_min_k(a, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and processed in pairs of integers.\n2. **Difference Calculation**: The absolute difference $ d $ between $ a $ and $ b $ is calculated.\n3. **Divisor Generation**: All divisors of $ d $ are generated to identify potential candidates for minimizing the LCM.\n4. **Candidate Evaluation**: Each candidate value of $ x $ is evaluated to determine the corresponding $ k $ that minimizes the LCM of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $.
