And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I need to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those weeks.\n\nHmm. So the input is n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output is the average of all the averages of the consecutive k-day periods.\n\nWait, but how do I compute this efficiently? Because if I do it naively, for each window of size k, sum all the elements and then divide by k, then divide by the number of windows. But with n up to 2e5, that's O(n*k) time, which would be way too slow. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 1e5, then n-k+1 is about 1e5, and each sum would take O(k) time, leading to 1e10 operations. That's definitely not going to work.\n\nSo I need a more efficient approach. Oh right! Sliding window technique. Let me think. The sum for each consecutive window can be computed in O(1) time if I have the previous sum. For example, the first window is sum of a[0] to a[k-1]. Then the next window is sum minus a[0] plus a[k], and so on. That way, the total time for all the sums is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Then for each subsequent window, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new element entering.\n3. Keep track of all these sums, then compute the average of all those sums divided by k (since each window's average is sum/k, and then the overall average is the average of all those averages).\n\nWait, but the overall average can be calculated as (sum of all window sums) / (number of windows * k). Because each window's average is sum_window / k, and the average of all averages is (sum of (sum_window /k )) / (number of windows). Which equals (sum of sum_window) / (number of windows * k).\n\nSo maybe I can compute the total sum of all window sums, then divide by (number of windows * k) to get the final result.\n\nYes. So the key is to compute the total sum of all the window sums.\n\nSo how to compute that?\n\nThe sliding window approach allows me to compute each window sum in O(1) time. So for each window, I add its sum to a total. Then, after processing all windows, divide by (number_of_windows * k) to get the answer.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nCalculate the number of windows: m = n - k + 1.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements. Then, for each next window, subtract the element that's leaving (a[i]) and add the new element (a[i + k]). Each time, add the current sum to the total.\n\nSo for example, for the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=2. The windows are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11. Total sum is 18. Then divide by (2 * 2) = 4. 18/4 = 4.5. Wait but the sample output is 9.000... Wait wait no, the sample input says the output is 9.000... Wait wait what's the example?\n\nWait in the first example, the input is 3 2 and the array [3,4,7]. The weeks are two weeks: first two days (3+4)/2 = 3.5, and the next two days (4+7)/2 = 5.5. The average of these two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? But the sample output is 9.000... Wait that's conflicting. Wait wait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait the sample input says:\n\nIn the first example, the output is '9.0000000000'. Wait that can't be right. Wait let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait the example says:\n\nFor example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is ... ?\n\nWait the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So perhaps in the first example, the output is the sum of all the weeks' averages divided by the number of weeks. Let me recalculate.\n\nIn the first example, the weeks are two weeks. The first week's average is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, the second is (4+7)/2 = 5.5. The average of these two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output says '9.0000000000'? That's conflicting. Wait maybe I misread the example.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement's example:\n\nThe first input is ['3 2\\n3 4 7', ...]. The output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nWait that's impossible. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Oh wait, perhaps the problem says that the average is the sum of all the weeks' total sleep times divided by the number of weeks, but not divided by k. Wait no, the problem says that Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So for each week, he calculates the average (sum/k), and then the overall average is the average of all those averages.\n\nBut according to the example given, the output is 9.0. Let me recheck the example.\n\nWait the problem says that for the first example, the result is 9.0. But according to my calculation, it's 4.5. So something is wrong here. Oh wait maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". So for each week, the average is sum of the k days divided by k. Then, the overall average is the average of all these per-week averages.\n\nBut in the first example, the two weeks have averages of 3.5 and 5.5. The average of these two is 4.5. But the sample output says 9.0. So this suggests that perhaps the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the total sum per week. Like, the average of (sum of each week) divided by the number of weeks. Which would be (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 = 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAh! Oh right! So the problem says that the answer is the average of the sum of each week. Because the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the problem says that the result is 9.0, which is (7 + 11)/2 = 9. So the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the sum of each week. Because the example shows that.\n\nWait but why? Let me re-check the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the average value per week\". So the average of the sum per week. Because the average of the averages would be different. So maybe the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which would be (sum of all window sums) divided by the number of windows.\n\nBut that contradicts the problem description. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nIn the example, the result is 9.0. Which is (3+4 + 4+7)/2 = (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 = 9. So the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Not the average of the averages.\n\nBut why? Because the problem says that the average is the average of the sum per week. So the problem says that the answer is the average of the sum of the weeks, not the average of the averages. So the problem's wording is a bit confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"the average amount of hours of sleep per week.\"\n\nSo for each week, the average is (sum of the week's hours) / k. Then, the overall average is the average of those values. Which would be (sum of all week sums) / (k * number of weeks). But in the sample input, that would be 18/(2*2) = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. Which suggests that the problem is not doing that.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the output is 9.0. So the problem must be to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which would be (sum of all window sums) / (number of windows). Which for the sample is 18/2=9. So the problem's wording may be incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nIn the example, the output is 9.000... So the correct answer for that case is 9.0. Which implies that the problem wants the average of the sum of each week. So the answer is (sum of all window sums) divided by (number of windows). Which is the same as the average of the sum of each week. So the problem's wording is a bit confusing, but the example shows that.\n\nSo the problem says that the average is the average of the sum of each week. So the answer is (sum of all window sums) / (number of windows). Which is the same as the average of the sum of each week. So the problem's note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which makes sense.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the sum of all the window sums, then divide by the number of windows.\n\nSo that's the key. Therefore, the steps are:\n\nCalculate the sum of all the window sums, then divide by m (number of windows) to get the answer.\n\nSo for the first example, the sum of the window sums is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 gives 9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Not the average of the average of each week. So that's the key.\n\nSo now, how to compute the sum of all window sums.\n\nThe sliding window approach can help here. Let me think.\n\nThe initial sum is sum(a[0..k-1]). Then, for each next window, we subtract a[i] and add a[i + k], for i from 0 to (n -k -1). So for each of the m = n -k +1 windows, we can compute their sum and add them all.\n\nBut for large n and k, how to compute this efficiently?\n\nYes, using the sliding window approach. Let's see:\n\nInitialize current_sum as sum of first k elements. Add this to total_sum.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to (n -k -1):\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i] + a[i +k]\n\nAdd this current_sum to total_sum.\n\nSo the total_sum is the sum of all window sums.\n\nOnce we have total_sum, the answer is total_sum / m, where m = n -k +1.\n\nYes. So that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then read the array.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nCompute the initial sum. Then iterate through the array, updating the current sum and adding to total.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, handling the edge cases. For example, when k = n, then m = 1. So the sum is the sum of the entire array, divided by 1. So the answer is sum(a)/1 = sum(a).\n\nAnother edge case is when k=1. Then each window is a single element, and the sum of all window sums is sum(a). The average is sum(a) / n. Which is correct.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nIf m is zero? No, because k <=n. So m is at least 1.\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k]).\n\ntotal_sum = initial_sum.\n\nThen for i in 0 to (m-1 -1) ? Wait, how many times do we need to loop?\n\nWait, the number of windows is m. The first window is 0..k-1. Then the next is 1..k, then 2..k+1, etc. So the number of times we need to update the current_sum is m-1 times. Because the first window is already added to total_sum. Then for each of the remaining m-1 windows, we compute current_sum and add to total_sum.\n\nSo the loop runs from i=0 to (m-1 -1) ?\n\nWait, for example, when m is 2, the first window is added. Then we have one more window. So the loop runs once.\n\nSo the loop runs for (m-1) times.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(0, m-1):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i] + a[i +k]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\nThen the answer is total_sum / m.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in Python, this can be implemented.\n\nBut for large n and k, the initial sum can be O(k) time. Which for k up to 2e5, that's acceptable, since the total time is O(n) for the initial sum and O(n) for the rest.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and k.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nif k ==0? Well, constraints say 1<=k<=n.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(m-1):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i] + a[i +k]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\nThen, the answer is total_sum / m.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the sample input:\n\nSample 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nm = 3-2+1 = 2.\n\ncurrent_sum = 3+4 =7. total_sum =7.\n\nLoop runs for m-1 =1 time.\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[0+2] = 7-3 +7= 11. total_sum becomes 7+11=18.\n\nThen answer is 18/2=9. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is '1 1\\n10' → m=1, total_sum is 10, answer is 10/1=10. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example input: 8 2 → array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. m=8-2+1=7.\n\nThe sum of all windows:\n\nwindow 1: 1+2=3\n\nwindow 2: 2+4=6\n\nwindow3:4+100000=100004\n\nwindow4: 100000 + 123 = 100123\n\nwindow5:123 +456 = 579\n\nwindow6:456+789= 1245\n\nwindow7:789+1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3 +6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = let's compute:\n\nLet me add step by step:\n\n3+6=9\n\n+100004 → 100013\n\n+100123 → 200136\n\n+579 → 200715\n\n+1245 → 201,960?\n\nWait 200715 + 1245 = 201,960?\n\nYes. Then +790 → 202,750.\n\nThen total_sum is 202750. Divided by 7 → 202750 /7 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 7 × 28964 = 202748. So 202750 - 202748 = 2. So 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.285714..., which matches the sample output of 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code works for that example.\n\nTherefore, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for very large n and k, the sum could be a big number, but Python handles big integers well. So no problem.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead the input. However, the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first line says that the input is:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. Wait, the problem says that the user should write a program that reads input from stdin. So the input is multiple test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has three test cases. But in the problem statement, perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement's input and output:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nBut the sample input shows three separate test cases, which suggests that the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description may have had multiple test cases. But looking back at the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich seems to be three test cases. However, the problem's original input may be multiple test cases. But the problem's original description says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nWait, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k. The second line contains the array. So for each test case, the input is two lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input may be for a single test case. But the sample input shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. How?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases. But the problem's original statement is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is three test cases, and the sample output is three outputs. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait the problem's original input may be multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in the sample input, the input is given as three separate test cases, each with their own lines.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line and second line. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description may not mention that. But looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original statement says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code must read from stdin. For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input format isn't clearly stated. But looking at the sample input, which shows three test cases, perhaps the code should read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to read that in Python?\n\nThe sample input shows that the input is given as multiple lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nThird test case:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo the code should read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to read that in Python?\n\nThe standard way is to read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of two lines (each test case has two lines), and process them.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input may have only one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input and output:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k...\n\nOutput:\n\nOutput average sleeping time...\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. So in the code, the user needs to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, reading all lines from stdin, and processing them in pairs.\n\nSo the code can read all lines, split into groups of two lines. For example, for each test case, read two lines: the first line is n and k, the second line is the array.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all input as a list of lines. Then process them in pairs.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may be provided with multiple test cases, each with two lines. So for example, the code can read all the lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n    n, k = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    # process the test case\n\n    i += 2\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is lines[0] and lines[1], the second is lines[2] and lines[3], etc.\n\nBut this approach assumes that each test case is two lines, which is correct according to the problem's input description.\n\nSo the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description may not mention this, but the sample input shows that.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input and output, the sample input shows three test cases, and the output has three answers. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nNow, for each test case, compute the answer as explained before.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is '3 2\\n3 4 7', which is two lines. So in code, the code must read each test case as two lines.\n\nBut in the problem's input, the user may enter multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nSo the code must handle that.\n\nNow, implementing that.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and k\n\n        n, k = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        # process this test case\n\n        m = n -k +1\n\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n        total_sum = current_sum\n\n        for i in range(m-1):\n\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i] + a[i +k]\n\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n        average = total_sum / m\n\n        # print with 10 decimal digits\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, in the sample outputs, the first sample is '9.0000000000' which is 10 decimal digits. So the code needs to output at least 6 digits, but the sample uses 10. So the code can format with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when you use the format string, it rounds the number. However, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 1e-6. So outputting with 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nBut what about cases where the division is not exact?\n\nFor example, the third sample input:\n\nThe average is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... So when printed with 10 decimals, it's 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut in Python, when you do division, it returns a float. However, for very large numbers, perhaps there is precision loss. However, since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-6, using floating point division should be sufficient.\n\nBut for very large numbers, perhaps using floating points could accumulate errors. However, since the sum is calculated as an integer (sum of integers) and then divided by m (integer), which can be represented exactly as a float if the numbers are small enough. However, for very large numbers, perhaps using floating points could lead to inaccuracies. However, in Python, the division is done with arbitrary precision (but in reality, it's done with double-precision floats). However, since the problem allows for a relative or absolute error of up to 1e-6, the code should be okay.\n\nBut for example, if the total_sum is very large, but when divided by m, the result can be represented accurately enough. For example, if the sum is 1e15 and m is 1e5, the division is 1e10, which can be represented exactly as a float.\n\nBut for numbers that require more precision than a float can provide, perhaps there's a problem. However, given that the problem allows for a certain error margin, and that the code uses the correct approach, this should be acceptable.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the code against the sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nThe code processes each test case.\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=3, k=2, a = [3,4,7]\n\nm = 3-2+1=2\n\ncurrent_sum = 3+4=7. total_sum =7.\n\nloop runs m-1=1 times:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_sum =7 -a[0] + a[0+2] =7-3 +7= 11. total_sum becomes 7+11=18.\n\naverage =18/2=9.0 → printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=1, k=1. m=1.\n\ncurrent_sum is sum of a[0:1] =10. total_sum is 10. average is 10/1=10.0 → printed as 10.0000000000.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\narray is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nm=8-2+1=7.\n\ncurrent_sum is sum of first 2 elements: 1+2=3. total_sum =3.\n\nloop runs 6 times:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 5 (since m-1=6).\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_sum =3 -a[0] +a[0+2] → 3-1 +4 =6 → total_sum +=6 → 3+6=9.\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_sum =6 -a[1] +a[1+2] →6-2 +100000 → 100004. total_sum is 9 + 100004 = 100013.\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_sum =100004 -a[2] +a[2+2] → 100004 -4 + 100000 → 200000. total_sum += 200000 → 100013 + 200000 = 300013.\n\nWait, but the array is [1,2,4,100000, 123, 456, 789, 1].\n\nSo for i=2, the current_sum is previous value (100004) minus a[2] (which is 4) plus a[2+2] (which is a[4] = 123). So 100004 -4 +123 = 100004 + 119 = 100123. So total_sum becomes 9 + 100004 + 100123 ?\n\nWait no. Let me retrace.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nInitially, total_sum is 3 (from the first window [1,2]).\n\nThen for i=0 to 6-1=5 (since m-1 is 6).\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\nFirst, current_sum is 3.\n\nLoop for i=0:\n\ncurrent_sum = 3 - a[0] + a[0+2] → 3-1 +4 = 6. total_sum becomes 3+6=9.\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_sum =6 - a[1] +a[1+2] → 6-2 +a[3] → 4 +100000 = 100004. total_sum becomes 9 + 100004 = 100013.\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_sum =100004 - a[2] +a[2+2] → 100004 -4 +a[4] → 100000 + 123 = 100123. total_sum becomes 100013 + 100123 = 200136.\n\ni=3:\n\ncurrent_sum = 100123 - a[3] +a[3+2] → 100123 -100000 +a[5] → 123 + 456 = 579. total_sum becomes 200136 + 579 = 200715.\n\ni=4:\n\ncurrent_sum = 579 - a[4] +a[4+2] → 579 -123 +a[6] → 456 +789 = 1245. total_sum becomes 200715 + 1245 = 201960.\n\ni=5:\n\ncurrent_sum = 1245 - a[5] +a[5+2] → 1245 -456 + a[7] → 789 +1 = 790. total_sum becomes 201960 +790 = 202750.\n\nSo after all iterations, total_sum is 202750. m is 7. 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which is printed as 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, considering the code's efficiency. For n up to 2e5, and per test case, the code runs O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that for the case where k equals n, m is 1. So the code will not enter the loop, and the average is the sum of the entire array divided by 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when k=1. Then m =n. The code computes the sum of all elements (each window is one element), and the average is sum(a)/n. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this code.\n\nBut in Python, when reading input, sometimes the lines may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(input_lines):\n\n        # Read n and k\n\n        n_k_line = input_lines[idx]\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a_line = input_lines[idx]\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        n, k = map(int, n_k_line.split())\n\n        a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n\n        m = n - k +1\n\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n        total_sum = current_sum\n\n        for i in range(m-1):\n\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i] + a[i + k]\n\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n        average = total_sum / m\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut what if the input has an odd number of lines? For example, if there's a line left without a corresponding line. However, according to the problem statement, each test case is two lines, so the input should have even number of lines. But the code may crash if not. However, the problem's test cases should be valid.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: Output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample 2: 10.0000000000.\n\nSample 3: 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of `k` days from a given list of `n` days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of each consecutive week using a sliding window technique to ensure optimal performance.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case provides two lines: the first line contains integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of a week), and the second line contains the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique:** For each test case, we use a sliding window approach to compute the sum of each consecutive week of `k` days. This allows us to efficiently update the sum for each subsequent window by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n3. **Calculate Total Sum of Week Sums:** We maintain a running total of the sums of all consecutive weeks. This total is then divided by the number of weeks to get the average sleep time per week.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input_lines):\n        # Read n and k\n        n_k_line = input_lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        a_line = input_lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        n, k = map(int, n_k_line.split())\n        a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n        m = n - k + 1\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        for i in range(m - 1):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i] + a[i + k]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        average = total_sum / m\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing. Each test case is processed in a loop, reading two lines per test case.\n2. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation:** The initial sum of the first `k` elements is computed. For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by subtracting the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that has entered the window.\n3. **Total Sum and Average Calculation:** The total sum of all window sums is accumulated and then divided by the number of windows (weeks) to get the average sleep time. The result is formatted to ensure at least 10 decimal places for precision, meeting the problem's requirements for accuracy.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution runs efficiently in O(n) time per test case, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the given constraints.",
