String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the task is to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. The beautiful string has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's this modification process involved. The key here is understanding what kind of strings can be transformed into the target character g through these modifications.\n\nLet me think about the modification process. The operation is replacing the last two characters with one. For example, if you have two zeros, you replace them with a one. If you have two ones, you replace them with a zero. Otherwise, if they are different, like 0 and 1, then what? Wait, the problem says \"exactly one other character\". Wait, the description says: replace two last characters by exactly one other character. The character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise zero. Oh right! So, if the two characters are not both zero, then the replacement is zero. Wait, no. Let me re-read the description:\n\n\"A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\n\nAh, so when you replace two characters, if they are both zero, you replace them with one. Otherwise, you replace them with zero. So for example:\n\n- Two 0s → replace with 1.\n- Any other pair (like 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, or two 1s) → replace with 0.\n\nSo the modification reduces the string length by one each time. And the process can be done multiple times, as long as the string's length is at least two.\n\nThe problem says that after some number of modifications (possibly zero), the resulting string must have exactly one character, which is equal to g. So the question is: how many initial strings (with exactly n zeros and m ones) can be modified down to the character g?\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the string s is beautiful if we can obtain g from it via some number of modifications. So our task is to count all such s.\n\nFirst, we need to model what possible initial strings can be reduced to g.\n\nLet me think about the process. Let's consider that the final result after all possible modifications is g. Let's think recursively. Each modification step reduces the string length by one. So for a string of length L, after (L-1) steps, we get a single character.\n\nBut the way the modifications work depends on the sequence of operations. However, perhaps there's a way to model this as a binary operation, where the final result depends on the parity of certain counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern based on the number of 0s and 1s. Let's think about the possible end results based on the initial counts.\n\nLet me think of the process as a series of operations that reduce the string. Each operation replaces two characters with one. Let's think of this as a binary tree, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the entire process as a function that takes the initial counts of 0s and 1s and determines whether it's possible to reach g through some sequence of operations.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the example given in the first sample input: n=1, m=1, g=0. The possible strings are \"01\" and \"10\". How do these reduce to 0?\n\nLet's take \"01\". Since its length is 2, we can perform one modification. The two last characters are 0 and 1. Since they are not both 0s, the replacement is 0. So the result is 0. Which matches g=0. Similarly for \"10\": same thing.\n\nIn the second sample input, n=2, m=2, g=0. The answer is 4. Let's take one of the examples, say \"0011\". How does it reduce?\n\nLet me think. The initial string is \"0011\". Let's perform operations:\n\nOption 1: Take the last two characters (1 and 1). Replace them with 0. Now the string is \"000\". Then, take the last two 0s, replace with 1. Now the string is \"01\". Then replace those two with 0. So the final result is 0. That works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another path. But regardless, the key is that the initial counts of 0s and 1s must satisfy some condition that allows the process to end with g.\n\nSo what's the condition on the counts of 0s and 1s?\n\nLet me think of the entire process as a series of operations that combine pairs of characters. Each operation reduces the total count of characters by 1. So, for a string with total length k = n + m, we need to perform (k - 1) operations to get down to one character.\n\nBut each operation depends on the last two characters. However, since the order of operations might affect the outcome, perhaps there's a way to model the final result based on the parity of the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, but maybe the final result depends only on the parity of the number of 0s and the parity of the number of 1s. Or perhaps on some combination of the counts.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Suppose we have a string S. Let's denote the number of 0s as a and 1s as b. We want to know if it's possible to reach g through some sequence of operations.\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes based on a and b.\n\nBut since each operation reduces the total length by 1, the total number of operations is (a + b - 1). So the process ends when there's one character left.\n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of operations. For example, each operation replaces two characters with one. So the total number of operations is (original_length - 1). Let's think about the original length being L = a + b. So the number of operations is L-1.\n\nBut how does this affect the final result?\n\nAnother approach: think about the entire process as a binary operation. Each operation is combining two characters into one. The way they are combined depends on their values. However, since the order of operations may vary, perhaps the final result can be determined by some invariant.\n\nLet me think of the process as a binary tree. Each operation combines two nodes into one. The final value depends on the way these operations are performed. However, perhaps there's a way to compute the final value based on the initial counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the final result depends on the parity of the number of 1s, or something similar.\n\nWait, let's think about the case where all operations are done in a way that combines pairs of 0s and 1s. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of parity. Let's see:\n\nEach operation replaces two characters with one. Let's model the effect of this operation on the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nSuppose we have two characters:\n\nCase 1: two 0s → replaced by 1. So the count of 0s decreases by 2, and count of 1s increases by 1.\n\nCase 2: two 1s → replaced by 0. So count of 1s decreases by 2, count of 0s increases by 1.\n\nCase 3: one 0 and one 1 (in any order) → replaced by 0. So count of 1s decreases by 1, count of 0s increases by 1 - 1 (since we remove one 0 and one 1, and add a 0). So net change: 0s: (original 0 count -1 +1) = same. 1s: (original 1 count -1) → decrease by 1.\n\nWait, for case 3: original counts are a and b. After replacing two characters (say, 0 and 1) with 0. So the new counts are:\n\nnumber of 0s: a - 1 + 1 (since we removed one 0 and added one 0) → same as before. Number of 1s: b - 1 (since we removed one 1).\n\nSo in this case, the number of 1s decreases by 1, and the number of 0s remains the same.\n\nHmm. So, each operation can affect the counts in different ways.\n\nBut perhaps there's an invariant here. Let's think about the parity of the number of 1s.\n\nLet me think of the final character. Let's suppose that after all operations, the final character is g. What can we say about the initial counts of 0s and 1s?\n\nAlternatively, think about the entire process as a series of operations that eventually produce a single character. Let me think recursively. Suppose I have a string that can be reduced to g. What conditions must the initial counts satisfy?\n\nLet me think about small examples.\n\nFor example, if the initial string is of length 1: then it's already the final character. So if the initial string has exactly one 0 (n=1, m=0) and g is 0, then it's valid. Similarly for 1.\n\nNow, for length 2:\n\nIf the string is \"00\", then after one operation, it becomes 1. So for this to be equal to g, g must be 1. So if the initial counts are (2, 0), then the final character is 1.\n\nIf the string is \"01\", then the operation replaces them with 0. So the final character is 0. So for initial counts (1,1), the final character is 0.\n\nSimilarly, \"11\" → 0. So for initial counts (0,2), the final character is 0.\n\n\"10\" → same as \"01\", gives 0.\n\nSo for length 2, the final character depends on the counts:\n\nif the counts are (a, b):\n\nif a is even and b is 0 → then after combining pairs of 0s, each pair becomes 1. But how? For example, a=2, b=0: becomes 1. If a=4, then you can combine two pairs, each pair becomes 1, then combine those two 1s into 0. So the final character would be 0.\n\nWait, this suggests that the parity of the number of 0s and 1s may play a role here.\n\nLet me think again. For a general case, perhaps the final character depends on the parity of the number of 1s in the initial string.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a series of operations that can be represented as a binary tree, where each node represents a character, and the leaves are the original characters. The root is the final character. But how to compute this root based on the leaves?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe we can find a pattern based on the parity of the number of 1s and the total number of operations.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a way to compute the XOR of the number of 1s modulo something. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLet me think of the following: Let's consider that each operation reduces the number of characters by 1. The total number of operations is (a + b - 1). Let me denote the total number of operations as T = a + b - 1.\n\nEach operation affects the counts of 0s and 1s. But perhaps there's a way to model the final character based on the initial counts.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the process as a function f(a, b) that returns the final character (0 or 1) that can be obtained from a string with a 0s and b 1s. Then, the problem reduces to checking whether f(n, m) == g.\n\nBut how to compute f(a, b)?\n\nLet me think about f(a, b). Let's consider that the order of operations doesn't affect the final result. Is this true?\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have three 0s and one 1. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: 0001.\n\nPossible paths:\n\nOption 1: Combine the last two characters (0 and 1) → replace with 0. Now the string is 000. Then combine the last two 0s → 1. Now the string is 01. Combine them → 0. Final result is 0.\n\nOption 2: Combine the first two 0s → 1. String becomes 101. Now combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. String becomes 10. Combine → 0. Same result.\n\nAnother example: Let's take a=3, b=1. So total length is 4. T = 3 operations.\n\nAnother scenario: Combine the first two 0s to 1. Now the string is 1001. Then combine the last two 0s → 1. Now string is 111. Then combine two 1s → 0. Final result is 0. Same as before.\n\nHmm. So maybe the order of operations doesn't matter. If that's the case, then f(a, b) is uniquely determined by a and b.\n\nIf that's true, then we can find a formula for f(a, b).\n\nSo, assuming that the order of operations doesn't matter, how can we find f(a, b)?\n\nLet's think recursively. Suppose we have a and b.\n\nIf a + b == 1, then f(a, b) is 0 if a=1, else 1.\n\nElse, we can perform one operation. But how?\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, perhaps we can find a way to express f(a, b) based on the parity of the number of 1s or something else.\n\nWait, let's think of the following: every time we perform an operation, the number of 0s and 1s changes in a certain way. However, perhaps the parity of the number of 1s is important.\n\nLet me think: Let's consider the parity of the number of 1s in the initial string. Let's denote c = b (number of 1s). Let's see:\n\nIn the first example, when a=1, b=1. c is 1. The final result is 0. In the case of a=2, b=2. The final result is 0. Let's see what the parity of c is. For a=2, b=2, c=2 (even). For a=1, b=1, c=1 (odd). The final result was 0 in both cases. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=0. Then, initial string is 00. Operation replaces with 1. So final result is 1. Here, c=0 (even). The result is 1.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=0. Initial string is 000. Let's perform operations:\n\nCombine two 0s → 1. Now the string is 01. Combine them → 0. So final result is 0. Here, c=0 (even). Result is 0.\n\nAnother example: a=4, b=0. Combine two 0s → 1. Now string is 001. Combine two 0s → 1. Now string is 11. Combine → 0. Result is 0. So for even numbers of 0s (a=4), the result is 0. For a=2, the result is 1. Hmm, this seems inconsistent with parity.\n\nWait, a=2: even, result is 1. a=4: even, result is 0. So parity of a isn't directly giving the result. Hmm.\n\nWhat's the difference between a=2 and a=4? Let's think of the process for a=2:\n\nInitial a=2, b=0. One operation: 00 → 1. Result is 1.\n\nFor a=4: 0000 → combine two 0s → 1, string is 001. Then combine two 0s → 1, string is 11. Combine → 0. So the result is 0.\n\nSo the result depends on the number of operations. Let's see:\n\nFor a=2, T = 2+0 -1 = 1 operation. For a=4, T=4-1=3 operations.\n\nSo for a=2, the number of operations is 1. For a=4, it's 3.\n\nBut how does that relate to the result?\n\nMaybe we need to think about the parity of the total number of operations. For a=2, T=1 (odd), and result is 1. For a=4, T=3 (odd), result is 0. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a series of operations that can be modeled as follows: each operation reduces the count of 0s and 1s, and the final result depends on the parity of the number of times certain operations are done.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: each time you have a pair of 0s, you can generate a 1. Each pair of 1s generates a 0. And any pair of different characters generates a 0. But since the order of operations can vary, perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the number of 1s and the parity of the total number of operations.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 1s modulo something. For example, considering that each operation can be thought of as a transformation that affects the count of 1s.\n\nLet me think about the following: Let's track the number of 1s in the string during the process. Let me denote it as c.\n\nInitially, c = m.\n\nEach operation can change c in different ways:\n\nCase 1: combining two 0s → c increases by 1 (since we remove two 0s and add a 1).\n\nCase 2: combining two 1s → c decreases by 2 (since we remove two 1s and add a 0).\n\nCase 3: combining one 0 and one 1 → c decreases by 1 (since we remove one 1 and add a 0).\n\nBut how can we model the final value of c? Well, the final value is either 0 or 1, since there's only one character left. If the final character is 0, then c is 0. If it's 1, then c is 1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding whether, through a series of operations, the initial c (m) can be transformed to 0 or 1, depending on the final desired g.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a way to reduce the number of 1s (c) and 0s (a) to a single value. Let me think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the following recurrence:\n\nf(a, b) is the final character.\n\nBase case:\n\nif a + b == 1:\n\n   return 0 if a == 1 else 1.\n\nElse:\n\n   We can perform some operation. But since the order doesn't matter, maybe we can find a way to express f(a, b) in terms of other values.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following: the final result depends on the parity of the number of 1s and the parity of the total number of operations. For example, in the case where the total number of operations is T = a + b - 1.\n\nWait, for the first example, a=1, b=1, T=1. The final result is 0. Let's see: the initial c is 1. After one operation (case 3), c decreases by 1 → 0. Which is the final result.\n\nIn the case of a=2, b=0, T=1. Initial c is 0. The operation is case 1, so c increases by 1 → 1. Which is the final result.\n\nIn the case of a=3, b=0, T=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial c is 0. First operation is case 1 (two 0s → 1). Now the counts are a=1, b=1. Then, the next operation is case 3 (combine 0 and 1 → 0). Now c is 0. So final result is 0.\n\nSo the initial c was 0. After T=2 operations, the final c is 0.\n\nBut how to model this in general?\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the parity of the number of times we perform case 1 and case 2 operations. Because case 3 operations decrease the number of 1s by 1, and case 1 and 2 affect it in other ways.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as follows: the final result is determined by the parity of the number of 1s in the original string, adjusted by the number of operations that involve combining two 0s or two 1s.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me think about the following: the final character can be determined by the parity of the number of 1s in the original string plus the number of operations that convert pairs of 0s into 1s, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each operation reduces the total number of characters by one. The final character is determined by the entire sequence of operations. However, since the order doesn't matter, perhaps the final character can be determined by the following:\n\nThe final character is equal to (the number of 1s mod 2) XOR (some function of the total number of operations).\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 1s in the initial string, but adjusted for the number of operations.\n\nLet me take some examples:\n\nExample 1: n=1, m=1. Total length is 2. T=1 operation. The final result is 0. The initial number of 1s is 1. 1 mod 2 is 1. But the result is 0. So perhaps not directly.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=0. T=1 operation. Initial number of 1s is 0. Result is 1. 0 mod 2 is 0, but result is 1.\n\nAnother example: n=3, m=0. T=2 operations. Result is 0. Initial number of 1s is 0. 0 mod 2 is 0. Result is 0.\n\nAnother example: n=4, m=0. T=3 operations. Result is 0. Initial 1s is 0 mod 2 is 0. Result is 0.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2. T=3. The result is 0. Initial 1s is 2 mod 2 is 0. Result is 0.\n\nHmm, in these examples, the result is (initial number of 1s mod 2) XOR (T mod 2)? Let's check:\n\nExample 1: initial 1s is 1 mod 2 = 1. T=1 mod 2 = 1. 1 XOR 1 = 0 → matches.\n\nExample 2: initial 1s is 0 mod 2 = 0. T=1 mod 2 = 1. 0 XOR 1 = 1 → matches.\n\nExample 3: initial 1s is 0 mod 2 = 0. T=2 mod 2 = 0. 0 XOR 0 = 0 → matches.\n\nExample 4: initial 1s is 0 mod 2 = 0. T=3 mod 2 = 1. 0 XOR 1 = 1 → but the result is 0. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nLet me think again. For the example of n=4, m=0. T=3. The result is 0. Let's see what happens:\n\nInitial string is four 0s. The first operation combines two 0s → 1. Now the string has two 0s and one 1. Next operation combines the two 0s → 1. Now the string has two 1s. Next operation combines them → 0. So the final result is 0. So the initial number of 1s is 0, T=3. How does that relate to the result?\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the parity of the number of operations that involve combining two 0s. But I don't know how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a binary tree. Each operation combines two characters. The final character depends on the number of times certain combinations happened. But this feels too abstract.\n\nAnother approach: think of the entire process as a way to compute the XOR of all the bits, but with some modifications. For example, the final character depends on the parity of the number of 1s and the number of operations. But I need to find a pattern.\n\nLet me think of the following: Let's imagine that the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 1s in the initial string plus the number of operations that replace two 0s with a 1. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: Each time you replace two 0s with a 1, you're adding one 1. Each time you replace two 1s with a 0, you're subtracting two 1s. And each time you replace a 0 and a 1 with a 0, you're subtracting one 1. \n\nBut how can we model the total change in the number of 1s over the entire process?\n\nLet me denote the initial number of 1s as c = m. Let's track how c changes during the process. The final value of c will be either 0 or 1, depending on the final character.\n\nLet’s denote Δc as the total change in the number of 1s during the entire process.\n\nThe final value of c is initial_c + Δc. But since the final string has one character, which is either 0 or 1, the final value of c is 0 if the final character is 0, or 1 if it's 1.\n\nSo:\n\nfinal_c = initial_c + Δc = (final_char == 1 ? 1 : 0).\n\nBut how to find Δc?\n\nLet me think about the entire process. Each operation changes the count of 1s as follows:\n\nCase 1: two 0s → replace with 1. Δc += 1.\n\nCase 2: two 1s → replace with 0. Δc -= 2.\n\nCase 3: one 0 and one 1 → replace with 0. Δc -= 1.\n\nSo, the total Δc depends on how many times each case occurs during the process.\n\nBut how can we find this without knowing the exact sequence of operations?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as reducing the number of characters until one remains. Let me think recursively. Suppose that the final character is f. Then, the initial counts must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nBut this feels stuck again.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the entire process as a series of operations that ultimately reduces the number of 0s and 1s to one. Let's imagine that the process is equivalent to performing a certain number of operations that depend on the parity of the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think of the following: the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 1s in the initial string, adjusted by the total number of operations. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following: Each operation reduces the total number of characters by 1. So, for a string of length L = a + b, the number of operations is L-1.\n\nLet me think about the parity of L-1. For example:\n\nIn the first example (n=1, m=1): L=2, T=1 (odd). The final character is 0.\n\nIn the second example (n=2, m=2): L=4, T=3 (odd). Final character is 0.\n\nIn the example of n=2, m=0: L=2, T=1 (odd). Final character is 1.\n\nIn the example of n=3, m=0: L=3, T=2 (even). Final character is 0.\n\nIn the example of n=4, m=0: L=4, T=3 (odd). Final character is 0.\n\nHmm, not sure about a pattern here.\n\nWait, let's think of the final character as being determined by the parity of the number of 1s and the parity of the total number of operations.\n\nIn the first example: initial number of 1s is 1 (odd), T is 1 (odd). The result is 0. 1 + 1 = 2, which is even. 0 is even? Not sure.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=0. initial 1s is 0 (even), T=1 (odd). 0 + 1 = 1 (odd). Result is 1.\n\nn=3, m=0: initial 1s is 0 (even), T=2 (even). 0 + 2 = 2 (even). Result is 0.\n\nn=4, m=0: initial 1s is 0 (even), T=3 (odd). 0 + 3 = 3 (odd). Result is 0.\n\nHmm, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 1s in the initial string, but with some adjustments based on the number of operations.\n\nLet me think of the following: Each operation of type 1 (two 0s → 1) adds 1 to the count of 1s. Each operation of type 2 (two 1s → 0) subtracts 2 from the count of 1s. Each operation of type 3 (mixed → 0) subtracts 1 from the count of 1s.\n\nBut the total number of operations is fixed as T = a + b - 1.\n\nLet me think of the total change in the number of 1s as Δc = x - 2y - z, where x is the number of type 1 operations, y is the number of type 2 operations, and z is the number of type 3 operations. Also, x + y + z = T.\n\nBut how to find x, y, z?\n\nAlternatively, since the final count of 1s is either 0 or 1, we have:\n\ninitial_c + Δc = final_c.\n\nWhich is:\n\nm + (x - 2y - z) = final_c.\n\nBut since x + y + z = T = a + b - 1 = n + m - 1.\n\nAlso, note that the final_c is either 0 or 1.\n\nBut how to find x, y, z?\n\nThis seems too abstract. Perhaps we can find another relation.\n\nLet me think about the total number of 0s and 1s during the process.\n\nLet me think about the total number of 0s and 1s in the initial string and how they change during the process.\n\nBut I'm stuck again.\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Since the order of operations doesn't matter, perhaps the final result depends only on the initial counts of 0s and 1s, and can be determined by some formula.\n\nLet me think about the following: the final character is 0 if and only if the number of 1s in the initial string plus the number of operations of type 1 minus twice the number of type 2 operations minus the number of type 3 operations equals 0 or 1. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider that during the entire process, every time we have a pair of characters, we replace them with one. This is similar to evaluating a binary expression tree, where each operation is a node. But what's the value of this tree?\n\nLet me think of the process as follows: each operation is a function that takes two characters and returns a new character. The function is defined as:\n\ndef combine(c1, c2):\n    if c1 == '0' and c2 == '0':\n        return '1'\n    else:\n        return '0'\n\nThis function is not associative, but since the order of operations can vary, the final result might depend on the order. But earlier examples suggested that it doesn't. Let me test this.\n\nTake the string \"0001\" (a=3, b=1). Let's try two different orders:\n\nOption 1: Combine first two 0s → 1. New string is 101. Combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. New string is 10. Combine → 0.\n\nOption 2: Combine last two characters (0 and 1) → 0. New string is 000. Combine last two → 1. New string is 01. Combine → 0.\n\nSame result.\n\nAnother example: string \"0011\" (a=2, b=2). Let's combine first two 0s → 1. New string is 111. Combine last two → 0. New string is 10. Combine → 0. Result is 0.\n\nAlternatively, combine the last two 1s → 0. New string is 000. Combine last two → 1. New string is 01. Combine → 0. Same result.\n\nAnother example: string \"0000\" (a=4, b=0). Combine first two → 1, string is 100. Combine last two 0s → 1, string is 11. Combine → 0. Result is 0. Or combine the last two 0s first → 1, string is 001. Combine first two → 1, string is 11. Combine → 0. Same result.\n\nSo, it seems that the order of operations doesn't affect the final result. This is a crucial insight. So, the final result depends only on the initial counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nSo, now the problem is to find, for given n and m, what is the final character after any sequence of operations.\n\nSo, how to compute this final character?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's define f(a, b) as the final character for a string with a 0s and b 1s.\n\nBase cases:\n\n- if a + b == 1: return 0 if a == 1 else 1.\n\nFor a + b > 1:\n\nWe can perform any operation. Let's assume that the final character is determined by the following logic: \n\nLet's think of the process as combining all the characters into a single one. Since the order doesn't matter, perhaps the final result is determined by the parity of the number of 1s and the total number of operations.\n\nWait, let's think of the following: Each operation reduces the total number of characters by 1. The final character is determined by the initial counts of 0s and 1s in a way that depends on the parity of the number of 1s and the total number of operations.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern by looking at several examples.\n\nLet me create a table of (a, b) and the corresponding final character.\n\nCase 1: a=1, b=1 → final 0.\n\nCase 2: a=2, b=0 → final 1.\n\nCase 3: a=2, b=2 → final 0.\n\nCase 4: a=3, b=0 → final 0.\n\nCase 5: a=3, b=1 → let's compute.\n\nString is 0001. As discussed earlier, the final is 0.\n\nCase 6: a=0, b=1 → final is 1.\n\nCase 7: a=0, b=2 → final is 0.\n\nCase 8: a=0, b=3 → let's see. String is 111. Combine two 1s → 0. String is 10. Combine → 0. So final is 0.\n\nCase 9: a=0, b=4 → combine two 1s → 0. String is 110. Combine two 1s → 0. String is 00. Combine → 1. Final is 1.\n\nSo for a=0, b=4 → final 1.\n\nNow, let's look for patterns:\n\nLet's look at the cases where a=0 (only 1s):\n\nb | final\n1 → 1\n2 → 0\n3 → 0\n4 → 1\n5 → 0?\nLet's see for b=5:\n\nString is 11111. Combine two 1s → 0. String is 1110. Combine two 1s → 0. String is 100. Combine two 0s → 1. String is 11. Combine → 0. So final is 0.\n\nSo for b=5, final is 0.\n\nSo for a=0, the final character alternates based on b. It seems like it's (b mod 3) or something else?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nb=1 → 1 → 1\nb=2 → 0\nb=3 → 0\nb=4 → 1\nb=5 → 0\nb=6 → ?\n\nFor b=6: string is six 1s. Combine two 1s → 0. Now string is 11110. Combine two 1s → 0. String is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of \"beautiful\" strings that can be transformed into a given character `g` using a specific set of operations. The key insight is understanding how the operations affect the counts of '0's and '1's in the string and deriving a formula to check if a given string can be reduced to the target character `g`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Operations**: The allowed operation replaces the last two characters of the string with one character. If the two characters are both '0', they become '1'; otherwise, they become '0'. This operation reduces the string length by one each time.\n2. **Final Character Determination**: The final character after all possible operations depends on the parity (even or odd) of the number of '1's in the initial string and the total number of operations needed to reduce the string to a single character.\n3. **Key Observations**:\n   - The number of operations required to reduce a string of length `L` to a single character is `L - 1`.\n   - The final character is determined by the parity of the number of '1's and the parity of the total number of operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(input[0])\n    m = int(input[1])\n    g = int(input[2])\n    \n    total = n + m\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Compute the number of operations needed\n    ops = total - 1\n    \n    # Determine if it's possible to reach g\n    # We need to find whether the final character is g based on n and m\n    \n    # Function to compute the final character given a and b\n    def get_final_char(a, b):\n        # base case: only one character\n        if a + b == 1:\n            return 0 if a == 1 else 1\n        # recursive case: simulate the process\n        # But since order doesn't matter, we can use the following logic\n        # Let's think about the parity of the number of 1s and the number of operations\n        # From examples and analysis, the final character is (number_of_ones + ops) % 2\n        # Wait, let's test this hypothesis\n        # For example:\n        # n=1, m=1: total=2, ops=1, ones=1.
