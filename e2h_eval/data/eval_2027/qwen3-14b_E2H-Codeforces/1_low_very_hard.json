    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me try to understand the problem.\n\nThe plate is divided into w rows and h columns. The gilded rings are added starting from the edge. Each ring is one cell thick. The first ring is the outer edge. The second is two cells in, and so on. For the i-th ring, it's the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle would be 4 less in both width and height? Like, for example, if you have a ring around a rectangle, the next inner rectangle would be 2 less in width and 2 less in height. But since each ring is 1 cell thick, then for the i-th ring, the dimensions would be (original width - 4*(i-1)) and same for height. Because for each ring, you subtract 2 from each side. So for the first ring, the original rectangle is w x h. The next ring would be (w-4) x (h-4), but only if there's enough space. \n\nSo the problem says that each ring is the border of that inner rectangle. So the number of cells in each ring is the perimeter of that rectangle, but adjusted for the fact that it's a border. Wait, how to compute the number of cells in a border of a rectangle. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in its border is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns have (H-2) each (since the corners are already counted). Alternatively, it's 2*(W + H) - 4, since the perimeter formula for a rectangle is 2*(w + h) but subtracting 4 because each corner is counted twice. Wait, for example, a 3x3 rectangle's border has 8 cells. Let's see: 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Which matches. So yes, the formula for the number of cells in a ring (the border) is 2*(width + height) -4. \n\nBut wait, for each ring, the dimensions are (w', h') where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But for each i-th ring, we need to compute that. Then sum all those for i from 1 to k.\n\nWait, but what if the dimensions become zero or negative? Well, the problem says that k is given such that it's valid. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. For that case, the first ring is 3x3, which gives 8 cells. Which matches the first example input.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum them all.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait earlier calculation: the formula for the number of cells in the border is 2*(current_w + current_h) - 4. Because for a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2W + 2H -4 = 2(W + H) -4. So yes.\n\nSo for each ring, we calculate that value and add it to the total.\n\nBut wait, let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. So current_w is 3, current_h is 3. 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So current_w is 7, current_h is 9. 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4= 32-4=28. Which matches the output of 28. Correct.\n\nThird example input is 7 9 2. So for i=1, 7x9: 28. For i=2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it is one cell thick and starts from the edge of the plate, moving inward with each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: Each gilded ring is formed by the border of a rectangle. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells inward from the edge, and so on. For the i-th ring, the dimensions of the inner rectangle are adjusted by reducing both width and height by 4*(i-1) due to the inward movement of 2 cells on each side.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: The number of cells in each ring (border) can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle adjusted for grid cells. The formula for the number of cells in the border of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is `2 * (w + h) - 4`.\n3. **Iterative Summation**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the adjusted dimensions and use the perimeter formula to accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The dimensions of the plate (width `w`, height `h`) and the number of rings `k` are read from the input.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, calculate the adjusted width and height by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from the original dimensions.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: Use the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4` to determine the number of cells in the current ring's border.\n4. **Summing Cells**: Accumulate the total number of gilded cells across all rings and print the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and applying the perimeter formula, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the problem constraints.",
