The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every two districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nSo the key here is to select which districts to keep such that they form a connected subtree, and the sum of their 2^i is as large as possible. Since we want to maximize the sum, we should try to keep the districts with the highest possible i values. But since the districts must form a connected component, we can't just take the top (n -k) districts. We need to find a way to select the best ones while maintaining connectivity.\n\nWait, but the districts are numbered from 1 to n. The value 2^i increases exponentially with i. So higher-numbered districts contribute much more than lower ones. Therefore, our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they are connected. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to select a subtree that includes the largest possible numbers, but how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we want to keep the districts with the largest numbers possible. However, they might not be connected. For example, if the tree is a chain like 1-2-3-4-5-6, and we need to remove 3 districts. Then the best would be to keep 4,5,6. But if they are connected? Well, in that case, yes. But if the tree is structured such that higher-numbered districts are not connected unless some lower ones are kept.\n\nSo the approach here is similar to finding a subtree with (n -k) nodes that has the maximum possible sum. Since the sum depends on the nodes' values, which are 2^i, which are exponentially increasing, the problem reduces to selecting a subtree of size (n -k) that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how do we find such a subtree?\n\nAn idea comes to mind: since higher-numbered nodes have higher values, we should prioritize keeping them. So maybe we can perform a greedy approach where we start by considering all nodes, and then iteratively remove the nodes that are least valuable (i.e., the smallest-numbered ones) but in a way that maintains connectivity.\n\nWait, but how to do that? Let's think of it as a problem where we need to choose (n -k) nodes forming a connected subtree. The optimal choice would be to include the largest possible nodes. However, the challenge is that the subtree must be connected. So, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we start with all the nodes, and then remove the smallest ones, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected. However, how do we determine which nodes to remove?\n\nAnother approach: think of it as a problem where we need to find a subtree with (n -k) nodes, and the sum is maximized. Since the sum is the sum of 2^i for each node in the subtree, which is equivalent to the sum of all nodes except those removed. So maximizing the sum is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the removed nodes. But since the sum is 2^i, which is exponential, the minimal sum of removed nodes would be achieved by removing the smallest possible nodes. But again, the constraint is that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: select k nodes to remove such that the remaining (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree, and the sum of their 2^i is as large as possible. Which is equivalent to choosing the k nodes with the smallest i's (but not sure if that's always possible).\n\nBut how to ensure that after removing those k nodes, the remaining is connected. For example, suppose we have a tree where node 1 is connected to node 2, which is connected to node 3, etc. If we want to remove k=1 nodes. The best is to remove node 1, leaving nodes 2-... connected. But if we have to remove node 2, then the remaining nodes would be split into two parts (node 1 and nodes 3,4,...). So in that case, removing node 2 is not allowed, because the remaining nodes are not connected.\n\nTherefore, the problem requires that the nodes to be removed are those that are not critical for the connectivity of the remaining nodes. So perhaps the approach is to find a subtree of size (n -k) that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and then remove the rest.\n\nBut how to find that subtree?\n\nLet me think of this as a problem where we want to select a subtree of size s = n -k, which is connected, and maximize the sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, which are the ones",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to remove `k` districts from a tree structure such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the sum of the number of fans (which is `2^i` for district `i`) is maximized. The key insight here is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more to the total fan count, so we should prioritize keeping them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The problem involves a tree where each node represents a district. We need to ensure that the remaining nodes after removal form a connected subtree.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: Since higher-numbered districts have exponentially higher fan counts, we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. This translates to removing the smallest-numbered districts while ensuring the remaining nodes form a connected subtree.\n3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We use DFS to traverse the tree and determine which nodes can be removed. Starting from the highest-numbered node, we perform a DFS to explore the subtree and count the nodes, ensuring we only remove nodes that are not critical for maintaining connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n -

After removing a node, its parent is checked to see if it becomes a leaf and is added to the heap if so.\n4. **Result Compilation**: After removing `k` nodes, the removed nodes are sorted and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we remove the least valuable nodes (in terms of fan count) while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining nodes, thus maximizing the total fan count.",
