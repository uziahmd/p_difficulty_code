The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair of districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to select a subset of n - k districts that form a connected subtree, and maximize the sum of their 2^i values. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, the higher-numbered districts contribute way more than the lower ones. So our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring that they form a connected component.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure connectivity? Because if we just take the top (n -k) districts, they might not be connected. For example, if the tree is a chain, and we need to remove some nodes from the middle, but the high-numbered nodes are spread out.\n\nSo the approach here is probably to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and then remove the others. But how?\n\nLet me think: since the value of each node is 2^i, which is very large for higher i, it's optimal to include the highest possible nodes. So the strategy would be to select the highest possible nodes, but ensuring they are connected. However, if some of them are not connected, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe we can think of it as selecting a subtree where we include the largest possible nodes, and then decide which ones to exclude based on their necessity for connectivity.\n\nAn alternative idea comes to mind: since the tree is connected, and we need to choose a connected subtree of size (n -k), perhaps we can model this as choosing a root and then building the subtree by including as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think about the following approach:\n\nWe want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. So, perhaps we should prioritize keeping the highest-numbered districts, and then check if they are connected. If not, we need to include some lower-numbered ones to connect them.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAnother thought: the problem is similar to finding a tree with maximum total value, which is the same as choosing a subtree with (n -k) nodes. Since the value is 2^i, which is additive, the maximum sum is achieved by selecting the (n -k) largest possible districts, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to find which districts to exclude?\n\nWait, but the problem is that even if you take the top (n -k) districts, they may not be connected. So we need to find a connected subset of (n -k) districts that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal solution is to include all districts from (some number) up to n, but adjust for connectivity. However, since the districts are numbered from 1 to n, and the higher numbers are more valuable, maybe the optimal strategy is to include the largest possible numbers, and then include the minimal necessary nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of this as a problem where we need to remove k nodes, leaving a connected component. The best way to maximize the sum is to keep the nodes with the largest possible 2^i values. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree that contains the maximum number of the highest-numbered nodes possible.\n\nHere's an idea: start with the highest-numbered node (n). Then, we need to include enough nodes to form a connected component of size (n -k). But how?\n\nAnother approach is to think of it as a priority-based selection. Since higher-numbered nodes are more important, we can perform a greedy algorithm where we select the highest-numbered nodes first, and then check if they are connected. If not, we need to add some lower-numbered nodes to connect them. However, this seems vague.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the remaining districts form a connected component. So the problem is equivalent to selecting a subtree with (n -k) nodes, and the sum of their 2^i is maximum. How to find that subtree?\n\nSince the value of each node is 2^i, which is strictly increasing with i, the maximum sum will be achieved by including as many of the highest-numbered nodes as possible, and possibly some lower ones to connect them.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes from some x to n, but adjusted for connectivity. However, this might not be possible. For example, if the tree is a straight line from 1-2-3-...-n,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected component while maximizing the total number of fans. The districts with higher numbers have exponentially more fans, so our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible and remove the lowest-numbered ones that are not essential for connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree, which means there's exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: Since the value of each district is $2^i$, which grows exponentially with $i$, we prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected component. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered district and using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the tree, prioritizing higher-numbered nodes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We need to select (n - k) nodes forming a connected component with maximum sum of 2^i\n    # So, the idea is to start from the highest node and greedily include as many high nodes as possible\n    # We'll use a priority-based approach where we prioritize higher-numbered nodes\n    \n    # We'll use a BFS/DFS approach, starting from the highest node and marking nodes to keep\n    # We need to keep track of the nodes that are included in the final component\n    \n    # Initialize the set of kept nodes\n    kept = [False] * (n + 1)\n    to_remove = []\n    \n    # Start from the highest node, n\n    # We'll perform a BFS to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible\n    # But we need to make sure that we only include (n - k) nodes\n    \n    # First, let's find all the nodes that can be included in the subtree starting from n\n    # We'll use a priority queue (max-heap) to always visit the highest-numbered node first\n    # However, since Python's heapq is min-heap, we can store negative values\n    \n    # Let's use a BFS approach with a priority queue (max-heap simulation)\n    # We'll use a priority queue to process nodes in descending order\n    \n    # We need to keep track of visited nodes and the count of kept nodes\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    pq = []\n    pq.append(-n)  # Using negative to simulate max-heap\n    visited[n] = True\n    count = 0\n    \n    while pq and count < (n - k):\n        current = -pq.pop()\n        if not visited[current]:\n            visited[current] = True\n            count += 1\n            kept[current] = True\n            # Push all neighbors into the priority queue\n            for neighbor in edges[current]:\n                if not visited[neighbor]:\n                    pq.append(-neighbor)\n    \n    # Now, collect all the nodes that are not kept\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not kept[i]:\n            to_remove.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the to_remove list and output\n    to_remove.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, to_remove)))\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Traversal**: Starting from the highest-numbered node (n), we use a priority queue (simulated with a max-heap) to traverse the tree, ensuring we visit higher-numbered nodes first.\n2. **Connectivity Check**: By using BFS/DFS traversal starting from the highest node, we ensure that we include as many high-numbered nodes as possible while maintaining connectivity.\n3. **Node Removal**: After determining the nodes to keep, we collect the remaining nodes (which are not kept) and sort them to meet the output requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining districts.
