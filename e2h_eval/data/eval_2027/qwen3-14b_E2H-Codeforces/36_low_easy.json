The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to calculate the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 chance), there's a way to assign signal powers so that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for such a configuration to be possible.\n\nFirst, the signal power setup requires that each town is covered exactly once. Also, the signal from a tower at i with power p covers cities from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Wait, the problem says |c - i| < p. So that's equivalent to c being in (i - p + 1, i + p - 1)? Wait, no. Let me think: |c - i| < p implies that c is in (i - p, i + p). But since c is an integer, it's from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. For example, if p=2, then |c -i| can be 0 or 1, so c ranges from i-1 to i+1.\n\nBut the key point is that when setting the signal powers, each town must be covered exactly once. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\nSo, how can we model the valid tower configurations?\n\nLet me think about the constraints on the tower positions. For the signal setup to be possible, the towers must be arranged in a way that allows each town to be covered exactly once. This seems similar to some kind of partitioning of the towns into intervals covered by towers, with certain constraints.\n\nLet me consider the example given. For n=5, towers at 2,4,5. The tower at 2 has power 2 (covers 1,2,3), tower at 4 has power 1 (covers 4), tower at 5 has power 1 (covers 5). So the coverage is exactly each town once.\n\nAnother example: when n=2, the towers are built at 1 and 2. Each has power 1. Then town 1 is covered by tower 1, town 2 by tower 2. Town 0 and 3 are not covered.\n\nSo what's the condition on the tower positions?\n\nIt seems that the towers must form a structure where each tower's coverage area is non-overlapping except for the exact coverage. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as needing to assign to each tower a range of towns that it covers, such that each town is covered exactly once. Also, the coverage ranges must not extend beyond the allowed areas (i.e., town 0 and n+1 cannot be covered).\n\nWait, but the signal power can be chosen after the towers are built. So the question is: for a given set of towers, is there a way to assign their power levels such that all constraints are satisfied?\n\nSo our goal is to count the number of subsets S of {1,2,...,n} (each subset represents the towers built) such that there exists a way to assign power levels to each tower in S to meet the conditions. Then, the probability is (number of such subsets) / 2^n, which we need to compute modulo 998244353.\n\nThe challenge is to find the number of valid subsets S.\n\nLet me think about what makes a subset S valid. For the signal setup to be possible, each town must be covered exactly once. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered.\n\nLet me think of the towers as covering intervals. For example, if there's a tower at position i, its power p must be chosen so that it covers some interval. But how?\n\nLet me think of the coverage as follows: For each tower, the coverage must be such that it covers some towns, and the union of all coverages is exactly towns 1..n, with no overlaps.\n\nBut how can this be achieved? One possible way is that the towers form a partition of the towns into intervals where each interval is covered by exactly one tower. For instance, each tower's coverage must be a contiguous block of towns, and these blocks are non-overlapping and cover all towns.\n\nMoreover, for a tower at position i, the coverage must be such that it covers some interval [a, b], where a and b are such that the tower's position i is in the middle. For example, if a tower covers [a, b], then the power p must be at least (b - a + 1)/2, but perhaps more precise.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think recursively. Suppose that for the subset S to be valid, there must be a way to split the towns into segments, each of which is covered by exactly",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Configurations**: A valid configuration of towers must allow for non-overlapping coverage of all towns from 1 to n, with no coverage extending to towns 0 or n+1. This can be modeled using dynamic programming (DP) where we track the number of valid configurations up to each town.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. We consider two cases:\n   - The `i-th` town has no tower.\n   - The `i-th` town has a tower, which can cover a range of towns ending at `i`.\n\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each position `i`, we consider the possibility of placing a tower at `i` and ensuring it covers some segment ending at `i`. This leads to transitions from previous states where the tower might have been placed at `i-1` or earlier.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle divisions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at i, so dp[i] += dp[i-1]\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        # Case 2: there is a tower at i, and it covers from some j to i\n        # The tower at i can be placed such that it covers from i - k to i, where k is the power\n        # For this to be valid, the previous segment must end at i - 1\n        # So we add dp[i-1] * 1 (probability of having a tower here)\n        # But since the tower is present, the contribution is dp[i-1] * 1/2 (but we are counting subsets)\n        # Wait, the actual count is considering all subsets, so the recurrence is different.\n        # Actually, the recurrence is based on the number of valid subsets, not probabilities.\n        # Let's think again:\n        # The number of valid subsets for the first i towns is dp[i]\n        # When considering placing a tower at i, we need to ensure that the coverage ends at i\n        # So the previous part must end at i-1, and the tower at i can cover from i - k to i.\n        # However, the exact way to model this is tricky.

For example, the valid configurations for n=2 is 1 (towers at 1 and 2), for n=3 it's 2 (towers at 2 only, or 1,2,3). But the sample says for n=3, the answer is 1/4, which implies 2 valid subsets (since 2 / 2^3 = 1/4). So the count seems to follow a Fibonacci-like pattern.\n        # Let's refer to the correct recurrence relation derived from the problem's structure.\n        # According to the problem's solution, the number of valid subsets is equal to the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number, but adjusted for the specific constraints.\n        # However, based on the sample inputs, for n=2, the answer is 1/4, which corresponds to 1 valid subset. For n=3, it's 2 valid subsets. For n=5, the answer is 5/32, implying 5 valid subsets. This suggests that the count follows the Fibonacci sequence starting with f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=2, f(4)=3, f(5)=5, etc. So f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2).\n        # Therefore, the recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n        # Wait, let's check:\n        # For n=2: dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2?

So the counts are 1, 2, 5... which are Fibonacci numbers starting from index 1: F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, etc. So for n=2, the count is F(2) = 1; for n=3, count is F(3) = 2; for n=5, count is F(5) = 5.
