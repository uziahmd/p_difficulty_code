    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. Let's look at the examples. For 'ababa', the answer is 3 because 'aba' appears twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4). So overlapping is allowed here.\n\nSo the brute force approach would be to check all possible substrings, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, maybe this approach is feasible.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the string.\n2. For each substring, check how many times it appears in the string.\n3. Keep track of the maximum length where the count is at least two.\n\nBut generating all substrings could be O(n^2) in number. For each substring, checking all possible positions would take O(n^2) time as well. For n=100, that's 10^4 substrings, and for each, checking O(n) positions. So total time would be O(n^3), which for 100 is 1e6 operations. That's acceptable for Python, right? Because 1 million operations are manageable.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. However, given the constraints, even a brute force approach should work.\n\nSo how to generate all possible substrings?\n\nFor each possible starting index i (from 0 to len(s)-1), and for each possible ending index j (from i+1 to len(s)), the substring s[i:j]. Then, for each of these substrings, check if it occurs at least two times.\n\nBut how to check if a substring occurs at least twice? For example, for a substring of length l, we can check all possible positions where it can occur, and see if there are at least two different starting positions.\n\nAlternatively, for each substring, collect all the starting indices where it occurs, and if the count is >=2, then note its length.\n\nBut how to efficiently check that?\n\nAnother idea: For each possible length l (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there exists any substring of length l that occurs at least twice. Once we find the maximum l where this is true, return it.\n\nThis way, we can start checking from the largest possible l (which is len(s)//2, since a substring longer than that can't appear twice). Wait, for example, if the string is length 5, the maximum possible l is 2 (since 2*2=4 <=5). Wait, but for example, in 'aaaaa', the substring of length 4 appears twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So the maximum possible l is len(s)-1. But for a substring of length len(s)-1, there are two possible positions, so if the first and second are same, then it's possible.\n\nSo for the maximum possible l, it's len(s)-1. But for the problem, the maximum possible l that can have two occurrences is len(s)-1 (if the first and second characters are same, but that's not possible unless the string is like 'aa...a').\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nLoop l from the maximum possible (len(s)) down to 1:\n\n   For each possible starting index i, such that i + l <= len(s):\n\n       substring = s[i:i+l]\n\n       check if this substring appears again in the string (at least once more)\n\n       if yes, return l as the answer.\n\nOnce we find the maximum l for which this is true, return it.\n\nBut how to check if the substring appears again? For each occurrence of the substring, check if there's another occurrence. For example, for a given substring, check if it appears in the string at least two times.\n\nBut for each l, we can collect all substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs at least two times.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, for a given l, iterate through all possible starting positions i (from 0 to len(s)-l), and collect the substrings. Then, for each substring, check if it appears again in the list. For example, using a set to track the substrings we've seen so far, and if a substring is found again, then return True for this l.\n\nWait, but for each l, we can generate all substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs at least two times. So for each l, we can do:\n\nseen = set()\n\nfor i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n\n    substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n    if substr in seen:\n\n        return l as the answer (since we are checking from largest l down)\n\n    else:\n\n        add substr to seen\n\nBut wait, this approach would work only if there are two occurrences of the same substring. But for example, if the same substring occurs three times, then the first time it's added to the set, and the second time, it's found in the set. So the code would return l as the maximum.\n\nBut this approach would miss some cases? No, because if there's any substring of length l that occurs at least two times, then during the iteration, when we hit the second occurrence, we can return l as the answer.\n\nBut since we are checking l from the largest possible down, once we find such an l, we can return immediately.\n\nSo this seems efficient.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor the given string s:\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            return l as the answer (since we are checking from largest to smallest)\n\n        else:\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    if any of the substrings for this l had duplicates, then return l.\n\nBut wait, in this approach, for each l, we check all substrings of length l. If any of them occurs more than once, then return l as the maximum.\n\nBut this approach would work. Because for example, in the case of 'ababa', when l=3:\n\nthe substrings are:\n\ni=0: aba\n\ni=1: bab\n\ni=2: aba\n\nso when i=2, substr is 'aba', which was already in the set (from i=0). So we return 3.\n\nYes. So this approach would work.\n\nNow, the question is, what about overlapping occurrences? For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs at positions 0-2 and 2-4. The code checks for substrings of length 3, and when i=2, the substr is 'aba', which was already added to the set when i=0. So the code returns 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: for the input 'zzz', the maximum l is 2. Let's see:\n\nfor l=3, the substrings are 'zzz' (only one occurrence). So no duplicates. Then l=2. The substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). When i=1, the substr is 'zz' which is already in the set. So returns 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 'abcd' has no duplicates. So for l=4, 3, 2, 1, none have duplicates. So returns 0.\n\nSo this approach works for the sample cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where a substring appears more than once but with multiple overlaps? Like 'aaaaa' (length 5). For l=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So when i=1, we find that 'aaaa' is already in the set. So returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n- Iterate l from len(s) down to 1.\n\n- For each l, check all substrings of length l. If any of them occurs at least twice, return l as the answer.\n\n- If after checking all l down to 1, none are found, return 0.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\ns = input string.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(l)\n\n            exit\n\n        else:\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut wait, the code needs to check for all possible l. For example, in the case where for l=3, there's a substring that occurs twice, but also for l=4, there's a substring that occurs twice. But since we start from the largest l, we return the first l found, which is the maximum possible.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the input? The input is given as a list of strings, but according to the problem statement, the input is the first line containing the string. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is given as the first input line contains the string. But in the example, the input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but that's probably a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nOutput\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Because in reality, the input is a single string. But perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as the first line containing the string. However, the sample input shows a list of strings. That's confusing. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not correct. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWait, this suggests that the input is a list of strings, but the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual input is a single string per test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, each on their own line. But the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake. But the sample output shows three outputs, which suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo perhaps the actual input is multiple lines, each being a separate test case. For example, the sample input is three lines: 'abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz', and the output is three lines: 0, 3, 2.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. Which is confusing. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list, but in reality, the code must read multiple lines, each being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list, but in reality, the code must read one string per line. For example, the sample input is three lines, each being a string, and the output is three lines, each being the answer for that string.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. Which is conflicting with the sample. So this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as a list of three strings, and the output is a list of three numbers. So perhaps the problem expects that the input is multiple test cases, each given on separate lines. For example, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string, and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list, but in reality, the code should process multiple test cases. For example, the code is supposed to read multiple lines, each line being a string, and output for each line the answer.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect. However, the sample output has three elements, which implies that there are three test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple lines of input, each being a separate test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input(). But if there are multiple lines, perhaps the code should read all lines, process each.\n\nBut the problem's original input description may be incorrect. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nBut sample input shows a list of three strings. So this is conflicting. However, the sample output shows three answers, which implies that the sample input is three test cases. Therefore, the problem's input description is wrong. Or perhaps the sample is written in a way that's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the input is a list of strings, but the problem statement is not properly written. But given that the sample input and output are given as lists, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given as a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. This is confusing. However, the sample input and output indicate that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which is perhaps a representation of the input as a list of strings, but in reality, the input is each string on a separate line. So the code should read all lines from input, and for each line, compute the answer.\n\nBut to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps the original problem is that the code should process a single string, but the sample input is written as a list. However, the sample output is given as a list of outputs. Therefore, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user is to write a function that takes a string and returns the answer, but the code is supposed to read from stdin. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the original problem says that the input is a single string, but the sample shows multiple, perhaps the sample input is not correct. But for the purpose of solving the problem, perhaps the code should read a single string from input, and output a single number.\n\nBut the sample input shows three strings. So perhaps the problem is that the code should process multiple test cases, each on separate lines.\n\nBut how to proceed? Well, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each being a separate line.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from stdin, for each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nFor example, in Python, the code could be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    # process s and print the result.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps in reality, each is on a separate line.\n\nSo, for example, the sample input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThen the output is:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's initial input description says that the first input line contains the string. So this is conflicting. However, given the sample input and output, I think that the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from input, process each line as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nNow, let's proceed with writing the code.\n\nSo, the code will read each line from stdin, for each line, process the string.\n\nNow, for each string s, the code will compute the maximum length of a substring that occurs at least twice.\n\nNow, the code for this part is as discussed earlier.\n\nSo, for each string s:\n\ndef max_substring_length(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - l + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return l\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\nBut wait, for example, in the case where the same substring occurs more than once, but not in the first occurrence. For example, for 'ababa', l=3:\n\ni=0: 'aba' added to seen.\n\ni=1: 'bab' added.\n\ni=2: 'aba' is in seen, so return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the same substring occurs in multiple positions, but not consecutive? For example, 'aabbaa' for l=2. The substrings are 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. So when i=0, substr 'aa' is added. Then i=4, substr 'aa' is found again. So the code returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nNow, considering that the input is multiple lines, each being a string.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        max_len = 0\n\n        for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(0, n - l + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(l)\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            else:\n\n                # no break, continue to next l\n\n                continue\n\n            # if break occurred, then we found l, break outer loop\n\n            break\n\n        else:\n\n            # no l found, print 0\n\n            print(0)\n\nBut wait, the code for each line would process as follows:\n\nFor each line, process the string s.\n\nWe loop l from n down to 1.\n\nFor each l, we check all substrings of length l. If any of them is found twice, then print l and break out of all loops.\n\nElse, after checking all l, print 0.\n\nBut how to structure the code.\n\nThe code inside the for line loop:\n\ns = line.strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfound = False\n\nfor l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(l)\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\n    if found:\n\n        break\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nBut in Python, the for-else construct is such that the else clause runs if the loop completes normally (without break). So, in the code above, for the l loop, if during any l, we find a substring, then break and print l. Else, after checking all l, the else clause is executed, which prints 0.\n\nBut in the code above, the inner for loop (for i) has a break when substr is found. Then, the code breaks out of the l loop.\n\nBut how to structure this.\n\nAnother way is:\n\nfor each string s:\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(...):\n\n        substr = ...\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            max_len = l\n\n            break\n\n        seen.add(...)\n\n    if max_len > 0:\n\n        break\n\nprint(max_len)\n\nBut in code:\n\nSo:\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    max_len = 0\n\n    for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                max_len = l\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n        if max_len > 0:\n\n            break\n\n    print(max_len)\n\nYes, this would work.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample input 1: 'abcd'\n\nn=4.\n\nCheck l=4: n-l+1 = 1. Only one substring. No duplicates. So move to l=3. Check substrings of length 3: 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates. l=2: substrings 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' â€” no duplicates. l=1: substrings 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' â€” no duplicates. So max_len remains 0. Output 0.\n\nSample input 2: 'ababa' (n=5). l starts from 5. For l=5, only one substring. Then l=4. For substrings of length 4: 'abab', 'baba'. No duplicates. Then l=3. For i=0, substr 'aba' added. i=1: 'bab' added. i=2: 'aba' is in seen. So max_len=3. Break and output 3.\n\nSample input 3: 'zzz' (n=3). l=3: substr 'zzz' once. l=2: substrings 'zz' (i=0), then i=1, substr 'zz' again. So found, returns 2.\n\nThus, the code would output 0, 3, 2 for the sample inputs.\n\nSo this code should be correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase 1: empty string? But the problem says that the input is non-empty.\n\nCase 2: all characters same. For example, 'aaaaa' (n=5). For l=4, substrings 'aaaa' (i=0) and 'aaaa' (i=1). So returns 4.\n\nAnother case: 'aa' â†’ returns 1. Because the substring of length 1 is 'a' which occurs twice.\n\nAnother case: 'aaa' â†’ for l=2, substrings 'aa' (i=0) and 'aa' (i=1). So returns 2.\n\nAnother case: 'abab' â†’ for l=2, substrings 'ab', 'ba', 'ab' â†’ when i=2, 'ab' is found again. So returns 2. But also, l=3: substrings 'aba', 'bab' â†’ no duplicates. So the maximum is 2.\n\nBut for 'abab', the maximum substring is 'ab' (length 2) or 'ba' (length 2). So code returns 2.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' â†’ the maximum is 2 (substrings 'aa', 'bb', etc). But also, for l=3, 'aab' occurs once, 'abb' once, 'bba' once, 'baa' once. So no. So code returns 2.\n\nNow, code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, when you have a for loop, the code for the line:\n\nfor l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\nBut for n=0? But the problem says that the input string is non-empty. So n >=1.\n\nSo code is safe.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        max_len = 0\n\n        for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    max_len = l\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if max_len > 0:\n\n                break\n\n        print(max_len)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the case where the string is length 1, like 'a', then n=1. The loop for l in range(1, 0, -1) â†’ l=1. Then for i in range(1-1+1) â†’ i ranges from 0 to 0. So substr is 'a'. seen is empty. Add to seen. No break. So max_len remains 0. So output is 0.\n\nWhich is correct, since the substring of length 1 occurs once.\n\nAnother case: 'aa' â†’ l=2: substrings is 'aa' once. Then l=1. For i=0, substr 'a' added. i=1, substr 'a' is in seen. So returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThe code would process each line:\n\nFor 'abcd' â†’ output 0.\n\nFor 'ababa' â†’ output 3.\n\nFor 'zzz' â†’ output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which allows for more flexibility in identifying valid substrings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read multiple lines of input, each representing a separate test case.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each string, start checking from the longest possible substring length down to 1.\n3. **Track Substrings**: For each length, use a set to track all substrings of that length. If a substring is encountered more than once, it means we have found our answer for that string.\n4. **Early Termination**: As soon as a valid substring length is found, terminate further checks for shorter lengths to ensure efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        max_len = 0\n        for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - l + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+l]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    max_len = l\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if max_len > 0:\n                break\n        print(max_len)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads each line from standard input, processes it as a separate string, and strips any extraneous whitespace.\n- **Substring Length Check**: For each string, we check possible substring lengths starting from the longest possible down to 1. This ensures that we find the maximum valid length efficiently.\n- **Set for Tracking**: A set is used to keep track of substrings of the current length. If a substring is found again, it indicates that the substring appears at least twice, and we immediately record the length and break out of the loop.\n- **Efficiency**: By checking from the longest possible length downwards and breaking early when a valid length is found, the solution ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint of string length (100 characters).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the longest repeating substring while handling multiple test cases as specified.",
