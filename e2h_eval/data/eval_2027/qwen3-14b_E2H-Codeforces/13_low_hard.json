For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem mentions that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. So, for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me think: C to C# is 1 semitone, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4. Yes. So the distance between X and Y is calculated by taking the positions of the notes in the list and subtracting, but considering the cyclic nature.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the distance between two notes? For example, if I have two notes, say, C and E. The positions are C is index 0, E is index 4 (assuming the list is ordered as given in the problem statement). So the distance is 4 - 0 = 4 semitones. But if the notes are in reverse, like E and C, then the distance would be (12 - (4 - 0))? Wait no. Because according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones? Or wait, maybe the distance is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but considering the direction. Wait no, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones. For example, the distance between E and C would be (C's position is 0, E is 4. If we take E to C, then since E is higher than C, the distance would be (C's position + 12 - E's position) = 0 + 12 -4 = 8 semitones. Which matches the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSo the key is to find, for any two notes, the distance between them in semitones, considering the cyclic order. So the first thing I need is a way to map each note to its index in the list of 12 notes. Let me create a list of the notes in order. The problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh, right, and after H comes C again. So the list is:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but in the example given, the third input is 'A B H'. Let me check. Let's see, the output is 'strange' for that. Let's think about that later.\n\nSo, for any note, I can find its index in this list. Then, for two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index + 12 - x_index). Or perhaps more accurately, the distance is (y_index - x_index) mod 12? No, because if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So for example, if X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0), then the distance is 0 + 12 -4 = 8 semitones. Which is correct.\n\nBut how to compute that? Well, given two indices, x and y, the distance from X to Y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + 12). Wait, no. Because if y is less than x, then (y -x) is negative. So adding 12 would make it positive. For example, x=4 (E), y=0",
