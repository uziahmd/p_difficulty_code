For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The input is three notes, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 elements. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart. So, for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone, between C and D is 2, and so on. But since the notes are cyclic, after H (which is B in some notations?), comes C again. Wait, the problem statement says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, maybe there's a typo here? Because normally, the 12 notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B. But the problem lists H as the last note. Oh right, in some countries, like Russia, they use H for B. So here, the order is as given. So the list is:\n\nThe order is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again.\n\nSo the indexes would be from 0 to 11. Let me create a list of the notes in order. Let's see:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the 12th note is H. So the index for each note can be determined based on their position in this list.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance between them is calculated as follows: when considering the distance from X to Y along the scale, it's the number of semitones you move forward from X to reach Y. For example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, D is 2, D# 3, E is 4). But between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones because you go E to F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8). So the distance is calculated as (y_index - x_index) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper note, perhaps the way to compute it is (y_index - x_index) if y is higher than x, else (12 - (x_index - y_index))? Or maybe the distance is computed as (y_index - x_index) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. So, for example, if X is E and Y is C, then the distance is 8 semitones. Because moving forward from E to C would require going through all the notes until you reach C again. So the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) if y is after x, else (12 - (x_index - y_index))? Or maybe it's (y_index - x_index + 12) % 12? Wait no, because for example, C to E is 4 semitones. Let's see: C is index 0, E is index 4. So 4-0=4. Correct. E to C: index 4 to 0. So (0 -4) = -4, but adding 12 gives 8. So the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) if positive, else (y_index - x_index + 12). Which can be written as (y_index - x_index) % 12? Wait, no. Because for example, (0-4) mod 12 is 8. So yes. So the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper note. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, the distance is the number of semitones between them. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones when you go from X to Y via the",
