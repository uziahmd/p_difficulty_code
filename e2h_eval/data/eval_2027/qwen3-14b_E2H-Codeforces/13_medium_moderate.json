For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem mentions that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. So, for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me think: the sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E. So from C to E is 4 semitones. Right. And if you have E to C, since it's cyclic, the distance would be (12 - 4) = 8 semitones? Because going the other way around. But the problem says that the distance is always taken from the lower to the upper. Wait, but how do you determine which is lower? Oh, right, the problem says that when considering the distance between X and Y, it's the distance along the musical scale from X to Y. So if X is lower than Y, then it's the number of semitones between them. If X is higher than Y, then the distance would be the number of semitones from X to Y going upwards, which would be (Y - X + 12) mod 12? Wait, no. Wait, the distance is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, if you consider E as the lower note, then the distance would be 8 semitones. But how do we determine which note is lower? Well, in the problem's definition, the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones from X to Y when moving upwards. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then it's the difference. If X is higher, then it's (Y - X + 12) mod 12? Or perhaps, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if that's negative, then add 12? Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So, for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. Between C and D is 2 semitones. So, for any two notes, the distance from X to Y is the number of steps you take moving forward (clockwise) from X to reach Y. So if X is before Y in the list, then it's the difference in their positions. If X is after Y, then it's (12 - (X's position - Y's position))? Wait, let's take an example. Suppose X is E (position 4, since the list is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Let's index them from 0 to 11. Wait, maybe I should assign each note a numerical value. Let's make a list of the notes in order. Let me think:\n\nThe order is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again.\n\nSo for example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Then, the next C is 0 again.\n\nSo the distance from X to Y is (y - x) mod 12? No, because if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4 semitones. Which is correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance would be (0 -4) mod 12? That would be 8, which is correct. Because moving from E to C upwards would require going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So yes, the distance from X to Y is (y - x) mod 12. But since the distance is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y, which is the minimal steps in the upward direction. So, for any two notes, the distance between X and Y is (y - x) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then it's y -x. If X is higher than Y, then it's (y -x + 12). For example, if X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 -4 + 12) = 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between X and Y is (y - x) if y >= x, else (y -x + 12). But since in code, we can compute this as (y - x) % 12. Wait, no. Because if y is less than x, then (y -x) is negative. For example, if x is 4 (E) and y is 0 (C), (0 -4) is -4. Mod 12 would be 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (y - x) mod 12. But wait, in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. Otherwise, it's 12 - (X - Y). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, in the problem statement, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Which is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Correct.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is map each note to its numerical value. Let's create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, 'D' is 2, etc. Then, given three notes, I need to check all possible permutations of them to see if any of them satisfy the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo the problem says that a major triad is when there exists an ordering X, Y, Z such that distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. Similarly, a minor triad is when there exists an ordering X, Y, Z where distance between X and Y is 3, and Y to Z is 4.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, I need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. For example, for three notes A, B, C, there are 6 possible permutations. For each permutation, check if it satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for any three distinct notes, there are 6 possible orderings. For each of these orderings, check if the first to second is 4, second to third is 3 (for major) or first to second is 3, second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all possible permutations and see if any of them meets the major or minor condition.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Parse the input notes into their numerical representations.\n\n2. Generate all permutations of the three notes (since the order matters for checking the distances).\n\n3. For each permutation, check if it forms a major or minor triad.\n\n4. If any permutation satisfies major, output \"major\". Similarly for minor. If none, output \"strange\".\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Well, for three elements, there are 6 permutations. For example, for [A, B, C], the permutations are ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.\n\nFor each of these permutations, check the distances between first and second, and between second and third.\n\nSo, for each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck if distance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3. If yes, then it's a major.\n\nOr check if distance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4. If yes, then it's a minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies either of these, then return accordingly.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So there's no case where a chord is both major and minor. So once we find any permutation that meets major, we can return 'major', and similarly for minor.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nFirst, create a mapping from note names to their numerical values.\n\nLet me think about the note names. The problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, in the problem description, the list is written as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is as such. So the indexes are:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but what about B and H? In some countries, B is called H. For example, in German notation, B is H. So the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the 11th index is B, and 12th is H? Wait, no. The list has 12 elements. Let me count:\n\nC (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11). Yes. So the indexes are 0-11.\n\nSo the code can have a list or a dictionary that maps each note to its index. For example:\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nWait, but what about the note 'B'? In the problem statement, the list includes B and H. So the note names are as given. So the input will have notes in that notation. So the code must handle the note names as given.\n\nSo, with that mapping, for each note in the input, we can get their index.\n\nOnce we have the three indices, say a, b, c, then we need to generate all permutations of these three indices.\n\nThen for each permutation (x, y, z), check:\n\ndistance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3 → major.\n\nOR\n\ndistance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4 → minor.\n\nBut how to calculate the distance between two notes?\n\nFor two notes, say x and y, the distance is (y - x) % 12. Wait, no. Wait, the distance between x and y is (y - x) mod 12? Let me check with the example given in the problem.\n\nIn the first example, the input is 'C E G'.\n\nC is 0, E is 4, G is 7.\n\nLooking at the permutation C, E, G. The distance between C and E is (4-0) =4 semitones. Then between E and G is 7-4=3. So that's major. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: C# B F. Let's see. The input is C#, B, F.\n\nThe note_to_index for C# is 1, B is 10, F is 5. Now, the example says that ordering as B, C#, F. Let's check:\n\nB is 10, C# is 1. The distance between B and C# is (1 - 10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 → 3. Because 1 -10 is -9. Adding 12 gives 3. So that's 3 semitones. Then between C# (1) and F (5) is 5-1 =4. So that's 4 semitones. So this is a minor triad.\n\nSo, the code needs to compute the distance between x and y as (y - x) mod 12. But wait, for example, when x is 10 (B) and y is 1 (C#), (y -x) is 1 -10 = -9. mod 12 is 3, which is correct.\n\nYes. So the distance between x and y is (y -x) % 12.\n\nSo, in code, for two notes, x and y, the distance is (y - x) % 12.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the three notes, we can check:\n\ndistance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3 → major.\n\nOR distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies either of these, then return accordingly.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the input line as three notes, split into a list.\n\nFor example, input could be 'C E G', which is split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nThen, convert each note into their index values. So for the example, [0,4,7].\n\nThen generate all permutations of these three indices. For each permutation, check the conditions.\n\nNow, how to generate permutations. In Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, permutations([0,4,7], 3) gives all 6 possible orderings.\n\nSo, for each permutation in permutations(notes_indices, 3):\n\nCheck for major and minor.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nThen, for each p in permutations(notes_indices):\n\nx, y, z = p\n\nd1 = (y - x) % 12\n\nd2 = (z - y) % 12\n\nif d1 == 4 and d2 ==3:\n\n   return 'major'\n\nelif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n   return 'minor'\n\nIf none of the permutations meet these conditions, then return 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once we find any permutation that meets major, we can return 'major', and similarly for minor.\n\nSo the code can check all permutations, and for each, check if it meets the major or minor conditions. Once any of them is found, return the corresponding result.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead the input line. For example, the input is a single line with three notes. So, for example, the sample input is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] — but that's probably the test cases. But the actual input is a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo, for example, the input could be \"C E G\" (as in the first example), and the output is \"major\".\n\nSo, the code should read a line from stdin, split into three notes.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, for each note in notes, get their index.\n\nBut first, need to create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nNow, the note names may have '#' in them. So, the keys in the dictionary must be exactly as given. For example, 'C#', 'D#', 'F#', 'G#', 'B' and 'H'.\n\nSo, the note_to_index can be built as a dictionary:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nBut wait, the order is as given. Let me check the note_order list:\n\nThe problem lists the notes as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes. So the note_order list should be as such.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, with that, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead the three notes. For each, get their index.\n\nThen generate all permutations of these three indices.\n\nFor each permutation, check if the first two steps are 4 and 3 (major), or 3 and 4 (minor). If any permutation meets either condition, return the corresponding string.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor p in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = p\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but this code would check all permutations, and for the first permutation that meets the condition, it would print and exit. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once any permutation meets the major or minor condition, the code can exit immediately.\n\nBut what if there are multiple permutations that meet the same condition? For example, multiple permutations that are major. But since the code checks all permutations, once the first one is found, it returns.\n\nBut the code will check all permutations in order. For example, if the first permutation is not a major or minor, but another permutation is, then it will find it.\n\nBut in the code above, for each permutation, it checks if it is major, then minor. So, for example, if a permutation meets both conditions (which is impossible according to the problem statement), but the code would check for major first, and return that.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, there are no ambiguous cases. So the code is safe.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input: 'C E G' → indices are 0,4,7.\n\nPermutations include (0,4,7). For this permutation:\n\nd1 is (4-0) mod 12 → 4, d2 is 7-4=3 → 3. So it's major. So the code prints 'major'.\n\nAnother sample input: 'C# B F' → notes are C#, B, F → indices 1, 10, 5.\n\nOne permutation is (10, 1, 5). Let's compute d1: (1-10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 → 3. d2: (5-1) mod 12 → 4. So this is minor. So the code would print 'minor'.\n\nThird sample input: 'A B H' → indices are 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's see:\n\nFor example, permutation (9, 10, 11):\n\nd1 = 10-9 =1 → mod 12 is 1. d2 is 11-10=1 → 1. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: (9, 11, 10). d1 is (11-9) mod 12 = 2. d2 is (10 - 11) mod 12 → ( -1 ) mod 12 → 11. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: (10, 9, 11). d1 is (9-10) mod 12 → -1 mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nWhat about (10, 11, 9)? d1 is 11-10=1. d2 is 9-11 = -2 mod 12 → 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (11, 9, 10). d1 is (9 -11) mod 12 → -2 mod 12 → 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (11, 10, 9). d1 is (10-11) mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions, so output 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where the same note is repeated? But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, the input is three notes. But the problem says that the teacher gave Vasya a chord, which implies that the three notes are distinct. However, the problem statement does not explicitly state that the three notes are distinct. But according to the problem's example, the input is three distinct notes. However, perhaps the code should handle cases where the three notes are not distinct. But according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. However, if two or more notes are the same, then the distances would be zero. For example, if the input is C C C. Then, any permutation would have d1 = 0, d2 = 0. So it's neither major nor minor. So output 'strange'.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a chord, but perhaps the code doesn't need to check for duplicates. Because according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. So the code can process any three notes, even if they are same.\n\nBut according to the problem's input description, the input is three space-separated notes. So the code can process them regardless of whether they are same or not.\n\nBut the code would handle it correctly.\n\nAnother test case: input is C, E, G. As before. Output is major.\n\nAnother test case: input is C, E, G#. Let's see. Let's check permutations. For example, C, E, G#. Indices 0,4,8. d1 is 4, d2 is 4. So 4 and 4. Not matching. Any permutation? Let's see:\n\nAnother permutation: C, G#, E. d1 is (8-0) mod 12 = 8. d2 is (4-8) mod 12 = 8. No. Another permutation: E, C, G#. d1 is (0-4) mod 12 → 8. No. Not matching. So output strange.\n\nAnother test case: input is C, D#, G. Let's see. Let's check for major or minor.\n\nC is 0, D# is 3, G is 7. Let's check permutations.\n\nFor example, 0,3,7. d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So that's minor. So the code would output 'minor'.\n\nYes. Because the distance between C and D# is 3, and between D# and G is 4. So that's a minor triad.\n\nSo the code would detect that.\n\nAnother test case: input is C, E, B. Let's check. C is 0, E is 4, B is 10.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's see:\n\nOne permutation: C, E, B. d1 is 4, d2 is (10-4)=6. Not 3. So no. Another permutation: C, B, E. d1 is (10-0) =10 mod 12 → 10. No. Another permutation: E, C, B. d1 is (0 -4) mod 12 → 8. No. How about E, B, C. d1 is (10-4) =6. d2 is (0 -10) mod 12 → 2. No. Another permutation: B, C, E. d1 is (0 -10) mod 12 → 2. No. B, E, C. d1 is (4 -10) mod 12 → -6 mod 12 → 6. d2 is (0 -4) mod 12 → 8. No. So no match. So output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code would output strange.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, the code must read from stdin and output the answer.\n\nNow, the code as written earlier:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor p in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = p\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function can be called with sys.exit(), but in code, using exit() may not be allowed in some environments. However, in practice, using sys.exit() is better. However, in Python, the exit() function is available in the standard environment. However, perhaps the code should use sys.exit() instead. Alternatively, the code can break after finding the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can check all permutations, and collect whether any of them is major or minor. However, since the problem says that the answer is unique, once any permutation is found, we can return.\n\nBut the code as written will work. Let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input: 'C E G' → the code would generate permutations and check. The first permutation (assuming the order is C, E, G) would be (0,4,7). d1 is 4, d2 is 3 → print 'major' and exit.\n\nAnother sample input: 'C# B F' → the code will generate permutations. One of them is B, C#, F. Which is (10,1,5). d1 is (1-10) mod 12 → -9 mod 12 = 3. d2 is (5-1) mod 12 →4. So it's minor. So code prints 'minor'.\n\nThird sample input: 'A B H' → indices are 9,10,11. All permutations checked, none meets the conditions, so output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- Are the note names in the input exactly as in the note_order list? For example, the note 'B' and 'H' are in the list. So the code expects that the input uses 'B' and 'H' correctly. For example, if the input has 'H' instead of 'B', it's handled correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue: the note names in the input may have different capitalization, but the problem says that the input is in the given notation. So the code can assume that the input is correct.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, and read from stdin. Also, the code must not have any print statements other than the required output.\n\nThus, the code is as written above. But in Python, the exit() function may not be available in some contexts. So perhaps using sys.exit() is better. Let me adjust that.\n\nIn Python, using exit() may raise an error if not in the interactive shell. So, perhaps better to use sys.exit().\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor p in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = p\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes. That should be correct.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nC E G → output major.\n\nSample Input:\n\nC# B F → output minor.\n\nSample Input:\n\nA B H → output strange.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in the musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each musical note to an index representing its position in the 12-note scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if it forms a major or minor triad by calculating the distances between consecutive notes in the permutation.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. Specifically, the distance from note X to note Y is `(Y - X) % 12`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor p in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = p\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_order` list defines the order of the 12 musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its corresponding index for quick lookup.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input is read as three space-separated notes, which are then converted into their respective indices.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three indices are checked. For each permutation, the distances between the first and second note, and between the second and third note are calculated.\n4. **Major/Minor Check**: If the distances match the criteria for a major triad (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor triad (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones), the corresponding result is printed immediately. If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
