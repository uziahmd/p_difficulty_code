A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, first, calculate the total amount of each resource available.\n\nFor the drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast requires n * nl ml, because each of the n friends needs nl per toast. Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends has a toast. So for t toasts, total drink needed is t * n * nl. But the total available is k*l. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, no, because if you have total_drink divided by (per toast per friend * number of friends). So yes.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Total slices available is c * d. So maximum toasts based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, total is n * np. So maximum toasts based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of those three values. Because all three resources are needed for each toast. So the maximum possible is the minimum of the three possible values.\n\nWait, let me check the example given.\n\nIn the first example input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4 * 5 = 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note where they say 20/3=6 toasts. Wait, wait, what's that?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl. So total per toast is n * nl. So for the first example, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. The total drink is 20. So 20 / 9 is 2.222..., which would be 2 toasts. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why is that?\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". Wait that suggests that per toast, each friend needs 3 ml, but the total per toast is 3 ml? That can't be. Oh wait, maybe the note is wrong? Or perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nWait let me check the problem statement again. \n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, all friends have one toast. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl. So for the first example, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. The total drink is 4*5=20. So 20//9 is 2. So how does the note get 6?\n\nWait the note says: \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait that's confusing. Why divide by 3? Because per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. But the note says 20 / 3 is 6. So that suggests that the per toast is 3 ml total. Which would be if per toast, all friends together need 3 ml. But that doesn't make sense. Unless there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait perhaps I have misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each friend consumes nl ml. So for one toast, total is n * nl ml. For example, if there are 3 friends, and each needs 3 ml per toast, then for one toast, 3*3=9 ml is needed. So the total available is 20 ml. Then 20 / 9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But in the note, they say that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which suggests that the per toast is 3 ml. So why is that?\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Wait, why divide by 3? Because the answer is the number of toasts per friend. Oh! Oh right! Wait the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So each friend makes t toasts. So the total drink required is t * n * nl. Because each of the n friends makes t toasts, each needing nl per toast. So total drink is t * n * nl. So the maximum possible t is (total_drink) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the note, the total_drink is 20, n=3, nl=3. So 20 / (3 * 3) = 20 / 9 = 2.222, so floor 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if the total drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. So there's a contradiction here. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait the note says: \"the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\" So the 6 comes from 20 / 3. Which suggests that the drink is being divided by 3. So perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me re-express the problem. How many toasts can each friend make? Let's call that t. So each friend makes t toasts. For each toast, they need nl ml. So per friend, total drink needed is t * nl. For all friends, total is n * t * nl. Which must be <= total_drink (k*l). So t <= (k*l) / (n * nl). So the maximum t is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) )\n\nBut according to the note, the first example's drink calculation is 20 / 3 = 6. Which would be (k*l) / nl. So why is that? Because in that case, the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but then divides by 3 (number of friends) to get 2. So maybe the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the 6 is the total number of toasts possible for all friends combined. Then divided by the number of friends to get per person.\n\nWait that suggests that the problem is to find the total number of toasts possible, then divide by the number of friends. But that's not possible. Because each toast requires that all friends have a toast. So the number of toasts per friend is t, and the total number of toasts is t (each friend makes t toasts). So for example, if there are 3 friends, and each makes 2 toasts, then the total number of toasts is 3 * 2 = 6? No, no. Wait no. Each toast is made by all friends. Like, if they make one toast, all friends take part. So the number of toasts is t. Each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, all friends are participating. So the total number of toasts is t. So for example, if they make 2 toasts, each friend has 2 toasts. So the total drink is t * n * nl. So the initial approach is correct.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if t is 6, and the total drink is 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml, but that's more than 20. So that can't be.\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that the total drink is 20, and each toast requires 3 ml. So 20 / 3 = 6. So that's 6 toasts. But that would be the case if each toast requires 3 ml total. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires each friend to have nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl. So total per toast is n * nl. So for the first example, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which implies that the per toast is 20 / 6 = 3.333 ml. Which is not matching.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\nAh! So each toast requires that each friend drinks nl milliliters. So for one toast, each of the n friends drinks nl ml. Therefore, per toast, the total drink is n * nl ml. So for t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is sufficient for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So in the first example, that would be 20 / 3 = 6. So 3 is the nl value. So why is that?\n\nWait maybe the problem is that the note is considering the total number of toasts that can be made, not per friend. Let me re-examine the note:\n\nIn the first sample, the note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nAh! So the note is saying that the drink allows for 6 toasts total. Then, since there are 3 friends, each can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts. So that's the key. So the way the problem is structured is that the total number of toasts possible is determined by the resources, and then each friend can make t toasts, where t is total_toasts / n. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each toast is a single event where all friends participate. So for example, one toast is made, and each friend has one drink. So the total number of toasts is t. So for each toast, each friend needs some amount. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink is t * n * nl. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be t=6. Then total drink is 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml, but the available is 20. Which is impossible. So there's a contradiction here. So why is the note saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me re-examine the note's explanation.\n\nNote: the first sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n=3 friends, k=4 bottles, l=5 ml per bottle. So total drink is 4 *5=20 ml. \n\nThe note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So how?\n\nIf each toast requires 3 ml of drink per friend, then for one toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, total is 3 * 3 =9 ml. For 6 toasts, that would be 6 * 9 = 54 ml, which exceeds 20. So that's impossible.\n\nBut according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Which suggests that the total number of toasts possible is 6, then divided by the number of friends. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each toast requires that each friend has one drink. So for each toast, each friend has one drink. So the total number of toasts is t. So each friend has t drinks. So for each friend, the total drink needed is t * nl. So for all friends, total is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before. So the drink is sufficient if n*t*nl <= total_drink.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So that would be t=6. So substituting into the equation:\n\nn * t * nl = 3 * 6 * 3 = 54 > 20. So that's not possible.\n\nSo why does the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts? There's something wrong here. Let me check the note again.\n\nThe note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". Wait, 20 divided by 3 is 6.666... but rounded down to 6. So perhaps the note is calculating the total number of toasts as (total_drink) / (nl) ?\n\nWhich would be 20 /3 = 6.666, floor to 6. But why would that be the case?\n\nIf that's the case, then the total number of toasts is t, and each toast requires nl per friend. But that would mean that the total drink is t * nl * n. Wait, but in that case, the calculation would be:\n\nt * nl * n <= total_drink → t <= total_drink / (n * nl)\n\nBut the note is calculating t as total_drink / nl, which would be 20/3=6.666. So that would be 6. So why?\n\nThis suggests that the note is wrong. But that's impossible. So I must be missing something here.\n\nWait perhaps the problem is that the note is referring to the number of toasts per friend. Let me think.\n\nIf the answer is 2, then each friend makes 2 toasts. So total toasts is 2 per friend. But how many total toasts are there? Well, each toast is a single event where all friends participate. So if each friend makes 2 toasts, then there are 2 toasts in total. Because each toast is shared by all friends. So for example, if they make 2 toasts, each friend has 2 toasts. So the total number of toasts is 2. \n\nSo in that case, the total drink needed is 2 * n * nl. Which for the first example is 2 *3*3=18 ml. Which is less than 20. So that works.\n\nBut then the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 6 toasts. So that would imply that the total drink needed is 6 * n * nl = 6*3*3 =54>20. Which is impossible.\n\nSo why does the note say that? What's the correct way to interpret the problem?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the friends can make t toasts in total, and each friend makes t toasts. But that's not possible unless all friends are making the same number of toasts. So for example, if there are 3 friends, and they make 6 toasts total, then each friend would have 2 toasts. So the total number of toasts is 6, and each friend makes 2. So the total drink needed is 6 * nl * n? No, that would be 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 again. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total number of toasts is t, and each toast requires one drink per friend. So for t toasts, each friend has t drinks. So the total drink needed is t * nl * n. Which is what I thought before.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be t=6. Then the total drink needed is 6 * 3 * 3 = 54. Which is way over 20. So this can't be.\n\nBut the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the 6 comes from 20 / 3. So how is that 6 calculated?\n\nWait perhaps the note is wrong. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Let me recheck the note's numbers.\n\nIn the first example, the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Let's compute 20 / 3 = 6.666... So floor is 6. So maybe the note is saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but that's not the correct way to calculate it. But why?\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the problem is that the friends want to make as many toasts as possible, but each toast requires that each friend takes part. So the number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend has one drink. So for each toast, the total drink needed is n * nl. So for t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl.\n\nSo the maximum t is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) )\n\nIn the first example:\n\nk*l = 4 *5 =20\n\nn * nl =3 *3=9\n\nso 20 /9 is 2.222, so floor 2. So t=2. Which is the answer given in the example. So why does the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But that's 20 divided by nl, not by n * nl. So why is that?\n\nMaybe the note is wrong. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these things. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl. Which must be <= total_drink.\n\nBut in the note, the calculation for the drink is 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be (total_drink) / nl. So that suggests that the total number of toasts is (total_drink) / nl. But that would be the case if each toast requires nl ml total, not per friend. \n\nSo perhaps the problem statement has a mistake. Or perhaps the note is wrong. But given that the sample input produces the output 2, and according to our calculation, the correct value for the drink is 2, then perhaps the note's explanation is wrong. But that's unlikely. So what's the issue here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the number of toasts is the number of times they can make a toast, and each toast requires that each friend has one drink. So for one toast, each friend has one drink. So the total number of toasts is t. For that, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before. \n\nBut in the note, the drink is said to be enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be t=6. So substituting into the formula:\n\nn * t * nl = 3 *6 *3=54>20. Which is impossible. So why is the note saying that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the note is referring to the number of toasts per friend. So if each friend can make t toasts, then the total drink needed is t * nl per friend, multiplied by n friends. So total drink is n * t * nl. So for the first example, the maximum t is 2. Which is the answer given. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be t=6. But that would require 3 *6 *3=54>20. So that's impossible. \n\nUnless the note is using a different calculation. Maybe the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So what's going on here?\n\nLet me look at the sample input and output again. The first sample input is:\n\nInput: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nOutput: 2\n\nSo according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. So the 6 is the number of toasts possible for the drink. So according to this logic, the drink allows for 6 toasts, and then divided by 3 friends, giving 2 per friend. But how is 6 calculated?\n\nLet me think: if the drink is sufficient for 6 toasts, then for each toast, the total drink used is 20 /6 = 3.333... ml. Which would mean that each toast uses 3.333 ml. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires n * nl = 3 *3=9 ml. So this doesn't add up.\n\nWait maybe the note is referring to the number of toasts per friend. So if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is t. But that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the note is referring to the total number of toasts that can be made, and then dividing by the number of friends to get the per-person amount. \n\nBut that would be incorrect. For example, if there are 3 friends, and they make 6 toasts in total, then each friend makes 2 toasts. So the total number of toasts is 6, and each friend makes 2. But for that, the drink required is 6 * n * nl = 6 * 3 * 3 = 54, which is more than 20. So that's not possible. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be the total number of toasts. So how is that calculated?\n\nLet me re-calculate the drink for the first sample. \n\nTotal drink is 4 * 5 = 20 ml.\n\nEach toast requires each friend to have 3 ml. So for one toast, each friend has 3 ml. So for one toast, the total drink is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So for t toasts, it's 9t ml. So 9t ≤ 20 → t ≤ 2.222. So maximum t is 2. So the total number of toasts is 2. Which would mean that each friend makes 2 toasts. So why does the note say that the drink allows for 6 toasts?\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the friends want to make as many toasts as possible, with each toast requiring that each friend has one drink, but the number of toasts is the same for each friend. So the number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total drink is t * nl * n. But the note says that for the first example, the drink allows for 6 toasts. So if t=6, then total drink is 6 * 3 * 3 = 54. But 54 is larger than 20. So it's impossible. \n\nBut the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. So the 6 is coming from 20 / 3 = 6.666, which is 6 when floored. So why is that calculation done? \n\nMaybe the note is mistaken. Let's look at the other parts of the note. For the limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each, giving 80 slices. Each toast requires n slices (3 slices). So the maximum number of toasts is 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26. But the note says it's 80 toasts. That can't be. So the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that each toast requires 1 slice. But that would be the case if each toast requires one slice per friend. Wait, the problem says: \"a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. So total slices available is c*d. So maximum toasts is (c*d) // n. For the first example, c=10, d=8. So 10*8=80 slices. Divided by n=3, gives 26.666, which is 26. But the note says it's 80 toasts. This is a contradiction. \n\nSo the note is clearly wrong. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. \n\nWait the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". So that suggests that each toast requires 1 slice. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires a slice per friend. So for 3 friends, each toast needs 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow for 80 /3 = 26 toasts. But the note says 80 toasts. So this suggests that the problem statement may have been misread. \n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices. So the total number of toasts possible is (c*d) // n. \n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that each toast requires 1 slice. So this suggests that the problem statement is different. Perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice in total, not per friend. \n\nThis is a critical point. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement: \n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, n slices are needed. \n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be if each toast requires 1 slice. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the note, or in the problem statement. \n\nBut given that the sample input's output is 2, and the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2, it seems that the calculation for each resource is:\n\ndrink: total_drink / nl → 20 / 3 = 6.666 → 6\n\nlimes: c*d → 10*8=80 → 80\n\nsalt: p / np → 100 / 1 = 100 → 100\n\nthen take min(6, 80, 100) → 6, then divide by n (3) → 2. \n\nSo this suggests that the way to calculate the maximum number of toasts is:\n\nFor each resource, calculate the maximum number of toasts possible, assuming that each toast requires one unit of that resource. Then take the minimum of these numbers, and then divide by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\nBut this contradicts the problem statement. \n\nSo according to this approach, the drink is calculated as total_drink / nl, the limes as (c*d) / 1, and the salt as p / np. Then take the minimum of those three, and divide by n. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nLet me think: if each toast requires that each friend has one slice of lime, then for each toast, n slices are needed. So the maximum number of toasts is (c*d) // n. But according to the note, it's c*d. So this suggests that the problem statement is different. \n\nPerhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice of lime, not per friend. So for example, each toast needs one slice, regardless of the number of friends. That would explain the note. \n\nBut that would contradict the problem statement's wording. \n\nThis is very confusing. Given that the sample input and note suggest that the calculations are done as follows:\n\ndrink: total_drink / nl → 20 / 3 = 6.666 → 6\n\nlimes: c*d → 10 * 8 = 80\n\nsalt: p / np → 100 / 1 = 100\n\nthen min(6, 80, 100) = 6, then divided by n=3 → 2.\n\nSo this suggests that the number of toasts is calculated as:\n\nfor drink: total_drink // nl\n\nfor limes: total_slices // 1\n\nfor salt: total_salt // np\n\nand then the minimum of these three is divided by n to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\nBut why?\n\nThis would mean that each toast requires:\n\n- nl ml per friend → total for all friends is t * n * nl → but this is not considered. Instead, it's total_drink // nl, which would be t * n * nl <= total_drink → t <= total_drink / (n * nl). But according to the sample calculation, it's total_drink / nl. So this suggests that the calculation is wrong.\n\nBut given that the sample input and note indicate that this approach is correct, perhaps the problem statement has a different requirement.\n\nLet me re-express the problem based on the note:\n\nThe number of toasts each friend can make is t. \n\nFor the drink: each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. Total for all friends is n * t * nl. This must be <= total_drink. So t <= total_drink / (n * nl).\n\nFor the limes: each toast requires one slice per friend. So for t toasts, each friend needs t slices. Total slices needed is n * t. This must be <= total_slices (c * d). So t <= (c*d) / n.\n\nFor the salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * np grams. Total is n * t * np <= p. So t <= p/(n * np).\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three values: total_drink/(n * nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n * np).\n\nBut in the note, the first example's drink calculation is 20 / 3 = 6.666, which would be total_drink / nl. But according to the correct formula, it should be total_drink / (n * nl) = 20 / (3*3) = 2.222.\n\nBut according to the note's calculation, it's 20 / nl = 6.666, which is 6 when floored. So why is that?\n\nThis suggests that the note is incorrect, or that there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement. \n\nBut given that the sample input's output is 2, which aligns with the correct calculation of min(2, 26, 100) = 2, but the note says that it's min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2, it's clear that the note's explanation is wrong, but the actual correct approach is to calculate the three values as described above.\n\nSo, to resolve this, I'll proceed with the correct calculation based on the problem statement, not the note.\n\nLet me re-calculate the first sample input with the correct approach.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink = 4*5=20.\n\nnl=3.\n\nDrink limit: 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 → total_slices=80. n=3. So 80 / 3 = 26.666 → 26.\n\nSalt: p=100, np=1. Salt limit: 100 / (3 * 1) = 33.333 → 33.\n\nMinimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2 → output is 2. Which matches the sample output. So the note's explanation is incorrect. \n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate for each resource the maximum possible t, where t is the number of toasts per friend, and then take the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l.\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\nmax_lime = total_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nmax_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nSo the code should compute these values and return the minimum.\n\nLet me check the note's example again. The note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the correct calculation, it's 80 // 3 = 26. So the note's explanation is wrong. But the sample output is correct with the correct calculation.\n\nNow, let's look at the second example in the input:\n\nInput: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\n\nOutput: 3\n\nLet's compute:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink = 1000.\n\nnl=4 → max_drink = 1000 / (5 *4) = 1000 / 20 = 50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → total_slices = 19. max_lime = 19 // 5 = 3.\n\nsalt: p=90, np=3 → max_salt = 90 / (5 *3) = 90 /15 = 6.\n\nmin(50, 3, 6) → 3 → which matches the sample output.\n\nThird example input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n\nOutput: 0\n\nLet's compute:\n\ntotal_drink = 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000.\n\nnl=50 → max_drink = 1e6 / (10 *50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000.\n\ntotal_slices = 25 * 23 = 575 → max_lime = 575 // 10 = 57.\n\nsalt: p=1, np=1 → max_salt = 1 / (10 *1) = 0.1 → 0.\n\nso min",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The goal is to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink available from the bottles, the total number of lime slices, and the total amount of salt.\n2. **Determine Constraints**: For each resource, calculate the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on the available quantity:\n   - **Drink**: Total drink divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total lime slices divided by the number of friends (each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt**: Total salt divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Find Minimum Constraint**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Thus, the result is the minimum value among the constraints calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    values = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = values\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    max_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    total_slices = c * d\n    max_lime = total_slices // n\n    \n    max_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    result = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. This total is then divided by the product of the number of friends and the milliliters needed per toast per friend to determine how many toasts can be made based on the drink supply.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is obtained by multiplying the number of limes by the number of slices per lime. This total is divided by the number of friends to determine how many toasts can be made based on the availability of lime slices.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available is divided by the product of the number of friends and the grams of salt needed per toast per friend to determine how many toasts can be made based on the salt supply.\n- **Result Calculation**: The final number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum value from the three constraints calculated above, ensuring that no resource is exceeded.",
