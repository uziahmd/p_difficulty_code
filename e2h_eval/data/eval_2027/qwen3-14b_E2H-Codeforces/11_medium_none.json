After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFirst, calculate how much total drink they have. That's k multiplied by l. Then, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, because each of the n friends needs nl per toast. Wait, no. Wait, for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because all friends are making a toast at the same time. So for t toasts, total drink required is t * n * nl. But the total available is k*l. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, that's for total toasts. Wait, no. Wait, the total toasts that can be made is limited by the resources. Let me think again.\n\nEach toast requires for each friend: nl ml. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. So the total number of toasts possible from the drink is (total_drink) // (n * nl). Similarly for the lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Total slices available is c*d. So the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n. For the salt: each toast requires np grams per friend, so total per toast is n * np. So total toasts possible from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values. Because all three resources must be sufficient for the number of toasts. So the maximum possible is the minimum of those three numbers.\n\nWait, but the example given in the first case:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nTotal drink is 4*5=20. For each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. So that's 2 toasts. Then limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (since 3 friends each have one slice). 80 /3 is 26.666..., floor 26. But salt is 100 / (3*1) = 33.333, floor 33. Then the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Wait, why 6? Oh, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait why? Because 20 is total drink. Each toast requires per friend 3 ml. So per toast, 3 *3 =9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222, which is 2. But the explanation says 20/3 =6. Oh, that's a discrepancy. Wait what's the correct way?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. But why? Because perhaps the problem is that each toast requires per person nl ml. So for each toast, each person has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl. So the total drink available is k*l. So t can be at most (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the sample input, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 *3 =9. 20 /9 is 2.222, so floor is 2. But according to the sample explanation, it's 20 /3 =6. Which suggests that they are considering per toast per person, but perhaps the calculation is different. Wait the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, each person needs 3 ml, but the total per toast is 3 ml. Which would be impossible. Because for 3 people, each needing 3 ml per toast, that's 3 *3 =9 ml per toast. So why is the sample explanation saying 20 /3 is 6? \n\nWait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these things. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl. So the total drink available is k*l. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be the case if nl is 1, but in the sample input, nl is 3. \n\nWait the first input line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1' which corresponds to n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the sample explanation says that the drink is 4*5=20 ml. For each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222, so floor 2. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. So that's a contradiction. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So why is 6 the value for drink?\n\nAh! Oh wait! Maybe I got the problem statement wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. Therefore, for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But the sample explanation says that the drink is 20 ml, which is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl=1. But in the sample input, nl is 3. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So why is 6 the value for drink? Because 20 / (3) = 6.666... So that suggests that the drink per toast is 3 ml. Which would be the case if per toast, the total is nl ml. But that would imply that per toast, all friends together need nl ml. Which contradicts the problem statement. \n\nSo there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml. The sample says that it's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. So perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the total per toast is nl ml? That would be a misunderstanding. \n\nWait the sample explanation says that the drink is 20 ml. The sample input has nl=3. So according to the sample explanation, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which implies that per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. But that would require 3 * 3 =9 ml per toast. So 20 /9 = 2.222. Which would be 2 toasts. But the sample says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So how is that possible?\n\nWait maybe I have the problem statement backwards. Maybe each toast requires nl ml per friend. But the total per toast is nl ml. That would be impossible unless n=1. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. But the total for all toasts is that per friend. For example, if you have t toasts, then each friend needs t * nl ml. So the total drink is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. So that would imply that the total drink is 20, and per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be t * 3 = 20. So t is 6.666, so 6. Which would be possible only if per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. So perhaps the problem statement says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. But the total for all friends is nl? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml, which is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that the total drink is 20, and per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be t * 3 = 20. So t=6. So 3 is the total per toast. Which would be possible if for each toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be if each friend needs 1 ml per toast. But in the sample input, nl is 3. \n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let me look back at the sample explanation. \n\nIn the first sample, the explanation says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 =6 toasts. \n\nSo here, 20 divided by 3 is 6. So that suggests that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. So why is the sample input's nl=3?\n\nWait the sample input for the first case is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So the nl is 3, np is 1. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would suggest that per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. So perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the sample explanation is wrong? Or perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. So 20/(n * nl) would be 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222. So that's not matching. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that the total drink is divided by nl, not by (n * nl). \n\nSo why is this happening? There's a contradiction here. How can the sample explanation say that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts when the parameters indicate that it's 20/(3*3) ?\n\nMaybe the problem statement is different. Perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the total per toast is nl milliliters. That is, for each toast, the entire group consumes nl ml. But that would be strange. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement says that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. So the total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20, and the total is 20 /3 =6 toasts. So that would mean that n * t * nl = 20. \n\nIn the sample input, n is 3, nl is 3. So 3 * t *3 = 20 → 9t =20 → t= 2.222. But sample explanation says 6. So this is not matching. \n\nSo there's something wrong here. How can the sample explanation be correct?\n\nLet me read the sample explanation again:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why do they divide by 3? Because the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3. Which gives 2. \n\nSo according to this explanation, the drink allows for 6 toasts, but then divided by 3 friends. So that would imply that the drink is sufficient for 6 toasts per friend? But that's not logical. \n\nWait this seems to suggest that the initial calculation of the number of toasts is done per friend. Like, each friend can make t toasts, and the total resources are calculated accordingly. \n\nSo perhaps the problem is that the total number of toasts per friend is t, and for that, each friend needs t * nl ml of drink. So the total drink required is n * t * nl. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml. So n * t * nl = 3 * t * 3 =9t. This must be ≤20. So t can be up to 2.222, so 2. But the sample explanation says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink allows for 6 toasts, and then divided by 3 friends, giving 2. \n\nSo how does that work? \n\nAh! Maybe the sample explanation is incorrect. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nEach toast requires for each friend:\n\n- nl ml of drink.\n\n- 1 slice of lime.\n\n- np grams of salt.\n\nSo for one toast, each of the n friends uses these resources. \n\nThus, for t toasts, each friend will have made t toasts. So:\n\nTotal drink required is n * t * nl. \n\nTotal lime slices required is n * t. \n\nTotal salt required is n * t * np. \n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nn * t * nl ≤ total_drink (k*l)\n\nn * t ≤ total_lime_slices (c*d)\n\nn * t * np ≤ total_salt (p)\n\nSo t must be the minimum of (k*l)//(n * nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n * np).\n\nBut in the first sample, the sample explanation says that the drink allows for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be (k*l) / nl = 20/3 =6.666. But according to the formula above, it should be (k*l) / (n * nl) = 20/(3 *3)= 2.222.\n\nSo why is the sample explanation using (k*l)/nl instead of (k*l)/(n * nl)?\n\nThis is a critical point. If the sample explanation is correct, then the formula for the drink is (k*l) / nl, but that would imply that the total drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. \n\nBut why would that be the case? Let me re-express the sample explanation's logic.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nDrink is 20 ml. Each toast requires nl=3 ml per friend. So for each toast, each friend uses 3 ml. So for one toast, total drink is 3 * 3 =9 ml. For t toasts, total is 9t. So 9t ≤20 → t=2.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. So this suggests that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be the case if each toast requires nl=3 ml in total for all friends. Which would be impossible unless n=1. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. But the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. Which suggests that the initial calculations are (for drink) 20 /3 =6, for limes 10*8=80, and for salt 100/1=100. Then take the minimum of those three numbers, and divide by 3 to get 2.\n\nSo according to this, the drink allows for 6 toasts, the limes allow for 80, salt for 100. Then the minimum is 6. Divided by 3 (number of friends), gives 2. \n\nBut why is the drink allowing for 6 toasts? According to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 ml. So 20/3 =6. So that suggests that each toast requires 3 ml of drink, not per friend. \n\nBut then, how many friends are there? For example, if each toast requires 3 ml of drink, and there are 3 friends, then how is that possible? \n\nThis is very confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement once more.\n\nThe problem statement says: \n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml of drink. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. \n\nSo for t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl. \n\nSo the maximum t for drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nIn the first sample:\n\nk*l = 4*5 =20.\n\nn * nl =3 *3=9. \n\n20//9 is 2. \n\nLimes: total slices is 10 *8=80. Each toast needs n slices (each friend one slice). So per toast, n slices. So total toasts for limes is 80 //n = 80//3 =26. \n\nSalt: p is 100. Each toast needs n * np grams. So 3*1=3. 100//3 is 33. \n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which is the correct answer. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink allows for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be (k*l)/nl =20/3=6.666. So why is that?\n\nAh! Maybe the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. \n\nBut according to the sample input and output, the correct answer is 2, which is what the calculation gives. So why does the sample explanation say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, and then divides by 3 to get 2? \n\nThat suggests that the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps there's a translation error. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement requires that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total for all toasts is that per friend. So for each friend, the total amount of drink they consume is t * nl. So total for all friends is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be the case if the total drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. \n\nSo why would the sample explanation say that? \n\nPerhaps the problem statement is written differently. For example, maybe each toast requires nl milliliters for all friends combined. \n\nIf that were the case, then for each toast, the total drink is nl. So for t toasts, total is t * nl. \n\nIn the first sample, nl is 3. So 20 /3 =6.666, so 6 toasts. Then the limes are 10*8=80 slices. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n*t slices. So 80 >= n*t → t <=80/n=80/3=26.666. \n\nSalt: p=100 grams. Each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, n * np grams. So 100 / (n * np) = 100/(3*1) =33.333. \n\nSo the minimum is 6, then the answer is min(6, 26, 33) =6. Which is the sample explanation's value. But then the answer would be 6, but the correct output is 2. \n\nBut this contradicts the sample output. \n\nSo this suggests that the sample explanation is incorrect. Or perhaps the problem statement is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the friends can make t toasts, and the total number of toasts per friend is t. So the total drink is t * nl per friend, multiplied by n friends. Which is the same as before. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink allows for 6 toasts, but then divides by 3 friends to get 2. Which suggests that the initial calculation was for per friend. \n\nSo perhaps the sample explanation is wrong, but the actual correct approach is to calculate the three values as follows:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nthen answer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nWhich for the first sample:\n\ndrink_toasts = 20 // (3 *3) = 20//9 =2\n\nlime_toasts = 80//3=26\n\nsalt_toasts=100//3=33\n\nmin(2,26,33) =2 → correct. \n\nWhich matches the sample output. \n\nSo why does the sample explanation say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts? It must be a mistake in the explanation. \n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the three values as I outlined. \n\nTherefore, the code should compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nSo the code needs to compute this. \n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ndrink_toasts = (4*5) / (3 *3) → 20 /9 =2.222 → 2.\n\nlime_toasts = (10*8)/3 → 80/3=26.666 → 26.\n\nsalt_toasts = 100/(3*1) → 33.333 →33.\n\nmin is 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000.\n\nnl=4 → drink_toasts = 1000/(5*4) = 1000/20=50.\n\nlime: c=1, d=19 → slices 1*19=19. lime_toasts =19//5=3.8 →3.\n\nsalt: p=90, np=3 → 90/(5*3) =90/15=6.\n\nso min(50,3,6) →3 → which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink 1,000,000.\n\nnl=50 → drink_toasts = 1e6/(10 *50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000.\n\nlime: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575. lime_toasts=575//10=57.5 →57.\n\nsalt: p=1, np=1 → 1/(10 *1) = 0.1 →0.\n\nso min(2000,57,0) →0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach works with the samples.\n\nTherefore, the code should calculate those three values and take the minimum.\n\nSo the Python code would read the input, split into the variables, compute those three values, and print the minimum.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers. For example, for the first sample input, the input is a list of numbers.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe input is given as a list of lines. For example, the first sample input shows:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nWait, the sample input shows multiple lines, but that's probably part of the example for multiple test cases. However, the actual problem says that the input is a single line. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem's example:\n\nThe sample input shows three lines, but the output is three lines. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases. But the actual problem expects that the code reads one line of input, processes it, and outputs one line of output. \n\nBut in the problem's example, the input is given as a list of lines. But the user's task is to write a program that reads from standard input. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single line. \n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nSo the code should read one line of input. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. But that's likely because the sample input is showing multiple test cases. For example, the first sample input is three different test cases, each with their own input lines. And the output is three lines, each being the answer for each input line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So this is a contradiction. Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that the input is a single line. But the sample input shows multiple lines. So perhaps the sample input is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code should process one test case per input line. \n\nBut the user's task is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin and prints the desired outputs. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each representing a separate test case, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single line. So this is confusing. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np...\n\nSo the input is one line. But the sample input shows three lines. That suggests that the sample input is for multiple test cases, and the code should read multiple lines of input. \n\nBut how can that be? Because the problem says that the input is a single line. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2', '3', '0']\n\nThis suggests that the input consists of multiple lines, each being a separate test case. But the problem says that the input is a single line. \n\nThis is a contradiction. However, looking at the problem's original source (probably from Codeforces or similar), it's possible that the sample input is shown as multiple lines for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads one line. \n\nBut the user's task is to write a Python script that reads from stdin. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the result for each. \n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. However, the sample shows multiple lines. \n\nThis is a critical point. Let me check the problem statement again:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nSo the input is one line. So why does the sample input show multiple lines? Probably, the sample input is showing multiple test cases, each with their own input lines. For example, the first sample input has three test cases, each with their own input line, and the output has three lines. \n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem statement is ambiguous. \n\nHowever, looking at the sample input and output, it's clear that the code should process multiple test cases, each given in a separate line. \n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input is a single line. So this is conflicting. \n\nBut the user's task is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin and prints the desired outputs. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each. \n\nIn the sample input, the first line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1' and the output is '2'. \n\nSo the code should read each line from stdin, process it, and output the answer. \n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So this is confusing. \n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple lines, and the output shows multiple lines, it's likely that the code is expected to handle multiple test cases, each on a separate line. \n\nThus, the code should read all lines from stdin, for each line, process the numbers, and output the answer for each line. \n\nSo the code would read lines until EOF, for each line, split into the 8 integers, compute the answer as explained earlier, and print it. \n\nBut how to handle that in Python? \n\nFor example, the code could read all lines from stdin, loop through each line, process each as a test case. \n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    line = line.strip()\n    if not line:\n        continue\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line.split())\n    # compute the values\n    total_drink = k * l\n    drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    total_lime = c * d\n    lime_toasts = total_lime // n\n    salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n    res = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n    print(res)\n\nBut let's test this with the first sample input line:\n\nSample input line 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ndrink_toasts = (4*5) // (3*3) → 20//9=2.\n\nlime_toasts = (10*8) //3 → 80//3=26.\n\nsalt_toasts = 100 // (3*1) → 33. \n\nmin is 2 → correct. \n\nSecond sample input line: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → n=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink 100*10=1000. drink_toasts = 1000/(5*4)= 1000/20=50. lime_toasts = (1*19) //5 =19//5=3. salt_toasts=90/(5*3)=90/15=6. min is 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input line: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → drink_toasts = 1000*1000/(10*50) → 1,000,000 / 500 = 2000. lime_toasts = 25*23=575 //10=57. salt_toasts = 1/(10*1)=0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples. \n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where one of the resources is zero. For example, if the salt is zero, then salt_toasts is zero. \n\nAnother case: when any of the denominators is zero? No, since the problem says that all inputs are at least 1. \n\nBut for example, if n is 1, and nl is 1, then drink_toasts is (k*l) // (1*1) = k*l. \n\nAnother edge case: when the division results in zero. For example, if the salt is less than n * np, then salt_toasts is zero. \n\nSo the code handles that. \n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The goal is to find the minimum number of toasts that can be made considering all three resources.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available, the total number of lime slices available, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available. This is determined by dividing the total drink by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total lime slices available. This is determined by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available. This is determined by dividing the total salt by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Determine the Result**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum value among the constraints derived from the drink, lime slices, and salt.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line.split())\n        total_drink = k * l\n        drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n        total_lime = c * d\n        lime_toasts = total_lime // n\n        salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n        res = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each representing a separate test case.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: For each test case, the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt are calculated.\n- **Toast Constraints Calculation**:\n  - **Drink**: Divides the total drink by the product of the number of friends and the drink required per toast per friend.\n  - **Lime Slices**: Divides the total number of lime slices by the number of friends (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n  - **Salt**: Divides the total salt by the product of the number of friends and the salt required per toast per friend.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result for each test case is the minimum value among the constraints derived from drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring all resources are sufficient for the number of toasts calculated.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum number of toasts each friend can make by considering the limiting resource for each test case.",
