Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's see what the problem says. So, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The task is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand compatibility. Two colors are compatible if they are the same (if both are specific), or if one is a question mark. So, for example, a '?' can pair with any color. Also, two '?'s are compatible.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs, making sure that each boot is used at most once.\n\nHmm. How to approach this? Let's think about possible strategies.\n\nAn initial idea: match the specific colors first, then use the question marks.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nLet me think. For example, for each color c (not '?'), count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. The maximum possible pairs for that color is the minimum of the two counts. But since a left boot can't be used more than once, and same for right, we need to track that.\n\nBut then, after matching all specific colors, the remaining question marks can be matched between left and right. However, there's also the possibility that some question marks can be used to fill in gaps where there are mismatches in specific colors.\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal approach is:\n\n1. Match as many specific color pairs as possible. For each color, pair left and right boots with that color. But need to make sure that each boot is used once.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAnother idea: create a mapping of counts for each color. For example, for left boots, count how many of each color (excluding ?) there are, same for right boots. Then, for each color c, take min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs. Then, the remaining left and right ? can be matched. But wait, that's not considering that some of the ? could be used to cover mismatches. Like, if there are left boots with color 'a' and right boots with color 'b', but no way to pair them, but maybe some ? can be used to help.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to first pair all specific colors, then pair the remaining ?s. Because using a ? as a specific color may not be optimal. Wait, but maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, for example: suppose there are 2 left boots with 'a', and 1 right boot with 'a'. Then, we can pair one left 'a' with the right 'a'. The other left 'a' can't be paired with anything else except a '?', but maybe there are other possibilities. But if there's a right '?' and a left '?', maybe that's better.\n\nBut the main point is that the specific color pairs should be matched first, because they are more restrictive. Once those are handled, the ? can be used for the remaining.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nStep 1: Pair all left and right boots with specific colors (non-?) that match. For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used? Because for example, if we have multiple left and right boots of the same color, we need to pair them, but not reuse them.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently? Well, perhaps we can use dictionaries to track the counts. For example, for each color c (not ?), take the minimum between the number of left boots and right boots, and add that to the total. Then, subtract those from the counts. Then, for the remaining left and right boots, which are either ? or have colors that couldn't be matched, process the ?.\n\nBut this is a bit abstract. Let me think of the steps in code terms.\n\nFirst, let's collect all the left and right boots that are not '?'. For each color c, we can count how many are on left and right.\n\nFor each color c in the left's non-? colors, we can pair with the same color in the right's non-? colors. But how to do that without overlapping?\n\nWait, perhaps we can create for left and right, a frequency map. Then, for each color c in the left's frequency map, we take the minimum between left[c] and right[c], and add that to the answer. Then, subtract that from both left and right's counts. Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots are either ? or have colors that have no matches in the other side.\n\nBut this approach may not capture all possibilities. For example, suppose there are left boots with color 'a' and right boots with color 'a' and 'b'. If we pair the left 'a's with the right 'a's, but maybe some of the right 'b's could be paired with left '?'s. However, if we first pair the 'a's, that's better.\n\nSo this seems correct. Once we've done that, we can then process the '?'s.\n\nBut how to handle the '?'s? The remaining left and right boots that are not matched yet include:\n\n- Left boots with color c (non-?), but their count was higher than the right's count for that color.\n\n- Similarly for right boots.\n\n- Also, the '?'s.\n\nSo, for the '?'s, we can pair them with any remaining boots (either left or right, but need to make sure that the pairing is between left and right).\n\nWait, but the '?'s can be used to match any color. So, after handling the specific color pairs, the remaining left and right boots can be processed as follows:\n\nWe can take the remaining left '?'s and remaining right '?'s, and pair them. Also, the remaining left '?'s can be paired with the remaining right boots that have specific colors (but were not matched before), and vice versa.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs here?\n\nThis seems like a bipartite graph problem, but with large n (up to 150,000), so we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nOnce the specific color pairs are handled, the remaining left and right boots can be grouped into:\n\nLeft_remaining = list of left boots that are either unpaired (specific colors that couldn't be matched) or '?'\n\nSame for right_remaining.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally.\n\nLet me think. For the remaining left boots, we can have some that are specific colors (but not enough right boots for that color) and some that are '?'. Similarly for the right.\n\nNow, for each specific color in left_remaining, we can try to pair them with '?' in the right_remaining. Similarly, for specific colors in right_remaining, pair with '?' in left_remaining. Also, pair the '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do that optimally.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to:\n\n1. For each color c (non-?), count the number of left boots that are left (after pairing specific colors) and the number of right boots that are left. Then, for each such left boot with color c, we can pair it with a right '?'.\n\nSimilarly, for each right boot with color c, pair with a left '?'.\n\nThen, after that, the remaining '?'s can be paired between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the steps again:\n\nInitial step: process specific color pairs.\n\nLet me create two dictionaries: left_counts and right_counts, which count the number of each color (excluding ?) in left and right strings.\n\nFor each color c in left_counts, the number of pairs we can make is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). We add that to the total. Then, subtract that from both left_counts and right_counts.\n\nBut wait, how to track which actual boots are used? Because the problem requires to output the indices of the pairs. So, this approach of counting frequencies is not sufficient for tracking the actual pairs.\n\nAh, right. So, the initial approach of counting frequencies is useful for determining the maximum possible pairs, but to actually find the pairs, we need to track which boots are used.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nFirst, for each color (non-?), pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for each color c, iterate through the left boots with that color and the right boots with that color, and pair them up. But how to track which ones have been used already.\n\nSo, perhaps we can use a data structure that allows us to track available boots for each color.\n\nFor example, for each color c (non-?), have a list of indices of left boots with that color, and similarly for right boots. Then, for each color c, pair as many as possible between the left and right lists. For example, take the first min(len(left_list[c]), len(right_list[c])) elements from each and pair them.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, we can collect all left boots with that color and all right boots with that color, and pair them up. For example, for color 'a', if there are 3 left and 2 right, we pair 2 left and 2 right. Then, the left boots that are paired are marked as used, and the right ones as well.\n\nBut how to track which are used. So, perhaps we can have two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False. Then, when we pair a left boot i and right boot j, we set left_used[i] = True and right_used[j] = True.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as all False.\n\nFor each color c in the alphabet (a-z):\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used.\n\n   for each pair (left index, right index) up to the minimum of the two lists, pair them and mark them as used.\n\nOnce that is done, we have all the specific color pairs.\n\nThen, process the remaining boots (those not used yet) which are either '?' or have specific colors but couldn't be matched.\n\nNow, for the remaining boots, we need to pair them. Let's consider:\n\nThe remaining left boots are those not used, which can be either '?' or specific colors. Same for the right.\n\nFor these, we can pair:\n\n- left '?' with right '?': each pair contributes 1.\n\n- left '?' with right specific colors (which are not yet paired): each such pair contributes 1.\n\n- right '?' with left specific colors (which are not yet paired): each such pair contributes 1.\n\nSo, how to maximize this?\n\nThe optimal way is to first pair the left '?' with right specific colors (that are not yet paired), and vice versa, then pair the remaining '?'s.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think. For the remaining left boots, collect the ones that are '?' and the ones that are specific colors. Similarly for the right.\n\nFor example, for the left boots not used, we can have:\n\nleft_question: list of indices where l[i] is '?'\n\nleft_specific: list of indices where l[i] is a specific color (not used yet)\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nThen:\n\nFor each left_specific color, we can pair them with right_question.\n\nFor example, for each left boot with color c (specific), we can pair it with a right '?'.\n\nSimilarly, for each right boot with color c (specific), pair with a left '?'.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired among themselves.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCollect all left_question and left_specific (unused) and right_question and right_specific (unused).\n\nPair as follows:\n\nFor each left in left_specific:\n\n   if there is a right_question not used, pair them.\n\nSimilarly for right_specific.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nCollect all the unused left boots and unused right boots.\n\nFor each unused left boot, if it's a specific color, try to pair it with a right '?'.\n\nFor each unused right boot, if it's a specific color, try to pair it with a left '?'.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nMaybe we can have two queues or stacks for the left and right specific colors. For example, for the left_specific, we can iterate through them and for each, try to pair with a right '?'.\n\nBut to avoid missing opportunities, perhaps we can process all left_specific and right_specific first.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nTake all the left boots that are not used and have specific colors (i.e., not '?').\n\nTake all the right boots that are not used and have specific colors.\n\nFor each left_specific, we can pair with a right '?'.\n\nSimilarly for each right_specific, pair with a left '?'.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, for all left boots that are not used and are specific, collect them into a list. Similarly for right.\n\nThen, for each left in left_specific_list:\n\n   if there is a right '?' not used, pair them.\n\nSimilarly for right_specific_list.\n\nBut how to track which right '?' are available.\n\nSo, perhaps we can have a list of available right '?' indices, and a list of available left '?' indices.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter processing the specific color pairs:\n\nCreate a list of available_left_question (indices of left boots with '?', not used yet).\n\navailable_right_question = same for right.\n\navailable_left_specific = list of left boots (indices) that are not used and have specific colors.\n\navailable_right_specific = same for right.\n\nThen:\n\nFor each left in available_left_specific:\n\n   if available_right_question is not empty:\n\n       pair left with the first element in available_right_question.\n\n       remove that right from available_right_question.\n\nSimilarly, for each right in available_right_specific:\n\n   if available_left_question is not empty:\n\n       pair right with the first element in available_left_question.\n\n       remove that left from available_left_question.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining available_left_question and available_right_question can be paired between themselves.\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, if there are m left '?' and k right '?', the maximum possible pairs is min(m, k). So, pair each left '?' with a right '?'.\n\nBut how to choose which ones. Since the problem allows any valid pairing, we can just pair them in order.\n\nSo, for example, take the first min(len(available_left_question), len(available_right_question)) pairs.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nProcess specific color pairs first.\n\nThen process specific color left with right '?', and vice versa.\n\nThen pair the remaining '?'s.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in code, keeping track of the indices and which are used.\n\nBut how to manage the available_left_question, etc.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 150,000, we need an O(n) solution.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n, l, r.\n\nThen, create two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used.\n\n   for each pair up to min(len(left_list), len(right_list)), pair them.\n\n   mark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect these indices.\n\nBut for each color, we can iterate through the entire string once, but that would be O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for each color, we can loop through the left and right strings once, but that would be O(n) per color, leading to O(26n) = O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, for each color, precompute a list of indices. For example, for left, have a dictionary where for each color c, we have a list of indices where l[i] is c. Similarly for right.\n\nBut building that would take O(n) time.\n\nOnce that's done, for each color c, we can process the left and right lists.\n\nBut during processing, we need to track which indices have been used. So, perhaps we can process the color c by taking the first available indices from the left and right lists.\n\nWait, but the order in which we process the colors might affect the outcome, but since the problem allows any valid maximum pairing, perhaps it's okay.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nPreprocessing:\n\nFor left, create a dictionary (color_to_indices) where for each color c (including '?'), we have a list of indices (0-based or 1-based? The output uses 1-based indices, so probably easier to store as 0-based and then add 1 when outputting).\n\nSame for right.\n\nBut for the initial processing, we need to process the non-? colors first.\n\nSo:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = color_to_indices_left[c]\n\n   right_list = color_to_indices_right[c]\n\n   for i in range(min(len(left_list), len(right_list))):\n\n       left_index = left_list[i]\n\n       right_index = right_list[i]\n\n       if not left_used[left_index] and not right_used[right_index]:\n\n           pair them, mark as used.\n\nBut wait, this approach would not work because the color_to_indices_left[c] includes all indices of color c, including those that may have already been used in previous steps. So, perhaps the initial approach of building the lists once and then processing them in a way that skips used indices is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: for each color c, we can have a pointer indicating up to which index in the list we have processed. But that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial processing, for each color c, we can iterate through the left and right lists, and for each index in the list, check if it's not used. If not, pair them.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think. For example, for color 'a', the left indices are stored in a list. Then, for each left index in this list, if not used, and same for right indices. Then, pair as many as possible.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, for the left list and right list, we can iterate through them, and for each left and right index, pair them if not used.\n\nBut this may take O(n) time for each color, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices with color c, not used.\n\n   collect all right indices with color c, not used.\n\n   pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) of them.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nIn code, for each color c:\n\nleft_candidates = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n\nright_candidates = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n\nthen, for i in range(min(len(left_candidates), len(right_candidates))):\n\n   pair left_candidates[i] with right_candidates[i]\n\n   mark them as used.\n\nBut this would take O(n) time per color, leading to O(26n) = O(n) time.\n\nBut for n=150,000, 26*150,000 is manageable.\n\nBut for Python, this could be slow. However, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nOnce this is done, we have processed all specific color pairs.\n\nThen, we need to process the remaining left and right boots, which are either '?' or have specific colors that couldn't be matched.\n\nSo, now, collect all left indices not used and with color '?', and all right indices not used and with color '?'.\n\nAlso collect all left indices not used and with specific colors (non-?), and same for right.\n\nThen, for each left in left_specific (non-?), pair with right '?' if available.\n\nSimilarly for right_specific.\n\nSo, for example:\n\navailable_left_question = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\navailable_right_question = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\navailable_left_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\navailable_right_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, for each left in available_left_specific:\n\n   if available_right_question is not empty:\n\n       take the first element in available_right_question, pair with this left.\n\n       remove that right from available_right_question.\n\nSimilarly for each right in available_right_specific:\n\n   if available_left_question is not empty:\n\n       take the first element in available_left_question, pair with this right.\n\n       remove that left from available_left_question.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining available_left_question and available_right_question can be paired between themselves.\n\nSo, for the remaining, take min(len(available_left_question), len(available_right_question)) pairs. For example, pair the first i elements of left_question with the first i elements of right_question.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nBut again, for Python, creating these lists would take O(n) time.\n\nOnce all these steps are done, the total pairs is the sum of all the pairs found in each step.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in code, while keeping track of the used indices and the pairs.\n\nBut how to manage the available_left_question and available_right_question, etc.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as lists of False.\n\nInitialize the list of pairs as empty.\n\nThen, for each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left_candidates and right_candidates.\n\n   for i in range(min(len(left_candidates), len(right_candidates))):\n\n       left_idx = left_candidates[i]\n\n       right_idx = right_candidates[i]\n\n       add (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) to the pairs list.\n\n       mark left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect available_left_question, available_right_question, available_left_specific, available_right_specific.\n\nThen, for each left in available_left_specific:\n\n   if available_right_question is not empty:\n\n       take the first element from available_right_question, pair with left.\n\n       add to pairs.\n\n       mark left_used[left] = True (already marked?)\n\nWait, no. Because available_left_specific is built from indices not used yet. So when we pair them, we need to mark the right index as used.\n\nWait, available_left_specific is a list of indices that are not used yet. So, for each left in available_left_specific:\n\n   if available_right_question is not empty:\n\n       take the first right_q from available_right_question.\n\n       add (left+1, right_q+1) to the pairs.\n\n       mark left_used[left] = True (already True? No. Because available_left_specific is made from indices not used yet. So, the left is not used yet. But after pairing, it's marked as used. Similarly for the right_q.\n\nWait, but available_left_specific is generated as [i for i in ... if not left_used[i]], so during this phase, the left indices are not used. So, when we pair them, we need to mark them as used.\n\nBut in the code, after collecting available_left_specific, available_right_question, etc., during the processing of this step, we need to track which indices are used.\n\nBut in this step, the available_left_specific and available_right_question are generated once, and then during the pairing, we need to modify the available_right_question and available_left_question.\n\nBut since available_right_question is a list, perhaps we can process it as follows:\n\navailable_right_question is a list. For example, for the first part:\n\navailable_right_question = [ ... ]\n\nThen, for each left in available_left_specific:\n\n   if available_right_question is not empty:\n\n       right_q = available_right_question.pop(0)\n\n       add pair (left+1, right_q+1)\n\n       mark left_used[left] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_q] = True\n\nSimilarly for available_right_specific and available_left_question.\n\nBut note that available_left_specific and available_right_specific are generated once, but during this step, the left_used and right_used are being updated.\n\nBut since available_left_specific is generated before this step, and the left_used is not modified during this step (since the available_left_specific is a list of indices not used yet), during the processing, we can safely process them.\n\nBut once we start pairing, we need to mark the left and right indices as used.\n\nBut the code for this step would be:\n\navailable_left_question = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\navailable_right_question = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\navailable_left_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\navailable_right_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, for each left in available_left_specific:\n\n   if available_right_question:\n\n       pair left with available_right_question[0], then remove it from the list.\n\nSimilarly for each right in available_right_specific:\n\n   if available_left_question:\n\n       pair right with available_left_question[0], then remove it from the list.\n\nBut how to process available_left_specific and available_right_specific. For example, if available_left_specific is a list, and we iterate through each element, and for each, try to pair with a right '?'.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nfor left in available_left_specific:\n    if available_right_question:\n        right_q = available_right_question.pop(0)\n        pairs.append( (left+1, right_q+1) )\n        left_used[left] = True\n        right_used[right_q] = True\n\nfor right in available_right_specific:\n    if available_left_question:\n        left_q = available_left_question.pop(0)\n        pairs.append( (left_q+1, right+1) )\n        left_used[left_q] = True\n        right_used[right] = True\n\nWait, but in the available_right_specific, the right is not used yet. So when pairing with a left_q, we need to mark the right as used.\n\nBut in the code above, for the first loop, left is in available_left_specific, which is a list of indices not used. After pairing, we mark left_used[left] = True, and the right_q is marked as used.\n\nSimilarly for the second loop.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining available_left_question and available_right_question can be paired between themselves.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nremaining_left = available_left_question\nremaining_right = available_right_question\n\nfor i in range( min( len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right) ) ):\n    left_q = remaining_left[i]\n    right_q = remaining_right[i]\n    pairs.append( (left_q+1, right_q+1) )\n    left_used[left_q] = True\n    right_used[right_q] = True\n\nBut wait, the available_left_question and available_right_question were modified during the previous steps. So, after processing the available_left_specific and available_right_specific, the available_left_question and available_right_question may have some elements left.\n\nBut in code, after the first two loops, the available_left_question and available_right_question have been modified (elements popped from them). So, the remaining elements in available_left_question and available_right_question are those that couldn't be paired with specific colors.\n\nSo, for the final step, pair the remaining left and right '?'s.\n\nBut how to get those lists. Well, after the two loops, available_left_question and available_right_question are lists that have been modified. So, perhaps after the two loops, the remaining elements in those lists can be paired.\n\nBut the code for that would be:\n\n# Now pair the remaining ? with ?\n\n# Take the first min(len(available_left_question), len(available_right_question)) pairs.\n\nfor i in range( min( len(available_left_question), len(available_right_question) ) ):\n    left_q = available_left_question[i]\n    right_q = available_right_question[i]\n    pairs.append( (left_q+1, right_q+1) )\n    left_used[left_q] = True\n    right_used[right_q] = True\n\nBut wait, during the previous steps, available_left_question and available_right_question were modified. For example, when we popped elements from them during the processing of available_left_specific and available_right_specific. So, the available_left_question and available_right_question at this point are the remaining elements that couldn't be paired with specific colors.\n\nBut in the code above, after the two loops, the available_left_question and available_right_question have the remaining elements. So, pairing them in order would work.\n\nBut in Python, popping from the front of a list is O(n) time. So, if we have a lot of elements, this could be slow. For example, if available_right_question is a list of 1e5 elements, and we pop(0) for each, that's O(n^2) time.\n\nWhich would be too slow for n=150,000.\n\nSo, this approach may not be efficient enough.\n\nAlternative idea: use deque for available_right_question and available_left_question. Because popping from the front of a deque is O(1).\n\nYes. So, during the initial collection, we can convert the available_right_question into a deque, and then during the processing, we can popleft().\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\navailable_left_question = deque( [i for i in ... ] )\n\navailable_right_question = deque( [i for i in ... ] )\n\nThen, for the first loop:\n\nfor left in available_left_specific:\n    if available_right_question:\n        right_q = available_right_question.popleft()\n        pairs.append( ... )\n\nSimilarly for the second loop.\n\nThen, for the final pairing between left and right '?'s, we can take the first min(len(available_left_question), len(available_right_question)) elements. But since they are deques, perhaps we can iterate through them.\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, for each i in range(min(len(available_left_question), len(available_right_question))):\n\n   take left_q = available_left_question.popleft()\n\n   take right_q = available_right_question.popleft()\n\n   add to pairs.\n\nBut this would take O(k) time, where k is the number of pairs.\n\nSo, this approach would be efficient.\n\nThus, the code steps would be:\n\nAfter the initial processing of specific color pairs:\n\nCollect available_left_question as deque of indices.\n\nCollect available_right_question as deque.\n\nThen, process available_left_specific and available_right_specific as before, using the deques.\n\nThen, pair the remaining deques.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\n...\n\navailable_left_question = deque( [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?'] )\navailable_right_question = deque( [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?'] )\navailable_left_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\navailable_right_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\n# Pair left specific with right question\nfor left in available_left_specific:\n    if available_right_question:\n        right_q = available_right_question.popleft()\n        pairs.append( (left+1, right_q+1) )\n        left_used[left] = True\n        right_used[right_q] = True\n\n# Pair right specific with left question\nfor right in available_right_specific:\n    if available_left_question:\n        left_q = available_left_question.popleft()\n        pairs.append( (left_q+1, right+1) )\n        left_used[left_q] = True\n        right_used[right] = True\n\n# Pair remaining ? with ?\nwhile available_left_question and available_right_question:\n    left_q = available_left_question.popleft()\n    right_q = available_right_question.popleft()\n    pairs.append( (left_q+1, right_q+1) )\n    left_used[left_q] = True\n    right_used[right_q] = True\n\nThis would be efficient.\n\nNow, the question is, how to collect the available_left_specific and available_right_specific. Because in the code above, for available_left_specific, we are generating a list of all indices not used and with l[i] != '?'. But during the processing of the first loop, the left_used is being updated. However, in this code, the available_left_specific is generated once before processing, so it's safe.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, creating these lists can be expensive. However, given that n is up to 150,000, and each list is O(n), it's manageable.\n\nNow, the code for the initial processing of specific colors.\n\nFor that, perhaps:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    # collect left indices with color c and not used\n    left_candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_candidates.append(i)\n    right_candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c:\n            right_candidates.append(i)\n    # pair as many as possible\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_candidates), len(right_candidates))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        left_idx = left_candidates[i]\n        right_idx = right_candidates[i]\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this would be O(26n) time. However, for n=150,000, 26*150,000 = 3.9 million operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there is a better way. For example, precompute for each color, the list of indices once, and then during processing, track which indices have been used. But for the initial processing, the code as written would work.\n\nBut for large n, this may be slow. For example, for each color, looping through the entire string. However, given that it's O(26n) time, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each color, we can precompute the list of indices once. For example:\n\npre_left = defaultdict(list)\npre_right = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    pre_left[l[i]].append(i)\n    pre_right[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, during the initial processing, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_candidates = pre_left[c]\n\n   right_candidates = pre_right[c]\n\n   then, for each pair up to min(len(left_candidates), len(right_candidates)), but need to check if they are not used.\n\nBut this approach would not work, because the pre_left[c] contains all indices of color c, including those that may have been already used in previous steps. So, this approach would not work.\n\nHence, the initial approach of checking for each color, and for each index, whether it is used or not, is necessary.\n\nBut with n=150,000 and 26 letters, this may be manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize this.\n\nAnother idea: during the initial processing, for each color c, we can iterate through the precomputed list of indices, and for each index, check if it's not used. If not, add to left_candidates. Then pair them.\n\nBut this would require for each color, to process its precomputed list, and collect the unused indices.\n\nBut this would be O(n) time for each color, same as before.\n\nBut perhaps this is more efficient.\n\nSo, for example:\n\npre_left = defaultdict(list)\npre_right = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    pre_left[l[i]].append(i)\n    pre_right[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = pre_left[c]\n\n   right_list = pre_right[c]\n\n   left_ptr = 0\n\n   right_ptr = 0\n\n   while left_ptr < len(left_list) and right_ptr < len(right_list):\n\n       left_idx = left_list[left_ptr]\n\n       right_idx = right_list[right_ptr]\n\n       if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n\n           pairs.append( ... )\n\n           left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n           right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n           left_ptr += 1\n\n           right_ptr += 1\n\n       elif not left_used[left_idx]:\n\n           left_ptr += 1\n\n       elif not right_used[right_idx]:\n\n           right_ptr += 1\n\n       else:\n\n           left_ptr += 1\n\n           right_ptr += 1\n\nBut this approach would not work, because the pointers may not track correctly. For example, if the left_idx is already used, we need to move the left_ptr forward. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut this approach may be more efficient than checking for all indices for each color.\n\nBut I'm not sure. It depends on how the data is structured.\n\nBut for the purposes of code writing, perhaps the first approach is easier to implement.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the first approach is manageable.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as [False]*n.\n\nInitialize pairs as empty list.\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_candidates.append(i)\n    right_candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c:\n            right_candidates.append(i)\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_candidates), len(right_candidates))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        left_idx = left_candidates[i]\n        right_idx = right_candidates[i]\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect available_left_question, etc.\n\nBut this code may be slow for large n. For example, for n=150,000 and 26 letters, each loop would be O(n) for each color, leading to O(26n) time.\n\nBut perhaps in Python, this would be too slow. For example, 150,000 * 26 is 3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility is determined by specific colors or the wildcard character '?', which can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Specific Color Matching**: First, we match boots with specific colors (non-?) that are compatible. For each color from 'a' to 'z', we collect indices of left and right boots that have this color and are not yet used. We then pair these indices as much as possible.\n2. **Wildcard Matching**: After handling specific colors, we use the remaining wildcards ('?') to match with any remaining boots.
