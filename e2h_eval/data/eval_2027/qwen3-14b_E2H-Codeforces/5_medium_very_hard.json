Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair. \n\nSo, first, I need to figure out how to pair them optimally. Let's think about the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') can only pair with another 'a' or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'. \n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. Maybe we can first pair the specific colors with each other, then use the question marks for the remaining ones. But how to handle that efficiently?\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots and right boots. For example, if there are x left boots of color 'a' and y right boots of color 'a', then the maximum possible pairs for this color is min(x, y). But since '?' can also pair with them, maybe we need to first pair the specific colors, then use the '?'s.\n\nBut wait, the '?' can be used as wildcards. So maybe the optimal way is to first pair the specific colors where possible, then use the remaining '?'s to pair with whatever is left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the colors in a way that uses the '?'s optimally.\n\nLet me think of an approach:\n\n- First, create two dictionaries: left_count and right_count, which count the occurrences of each color (excluding '?') in l and r respectively. Also, count the number of '?' in both l and r.\n\nWait, but the actual positions matter because we need to output the indices. So maybe we need to track not just counts but also the positions of each color.\n\nSo, here's an idea:\n\nFirst, for each color c (not '?'), pair as many left boots of color c with right boots of color c as possible. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (including those with '?'), use the '?'s to pair them. However, since '?' can be used in either direction, perhaps we need to manage that.\n\nBut how to handle the pairing between left and right '?'s? For example, if there are some left '?' and some right '?', they can be paired with each other. Also, left '?' can pair with right non-'?', and vice versa.\n\nSo the plan could be:\n\n1. Pair all specific color matches first. For each color c (not '?'), pair left c with right c. For example, for color 'a', take min(left_a, right_a) pairs. But how to track which ones are used? Because we need to track which indices are used.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of counting, we can first calculate the total possible pairs from specific color matches, then use the remaining '?'s and leftover specific colors to form more pairs.\n\nBut the problem is that the order in which we process the colors might affect the maximum. For example, if we have left 'a's and right 'a's and left 'b's and right 'b's, it's better to pair them all. But if there are leftovers, then use '?'s.\n\nBut how to track the actual pairs? Because when we pair specific colors, we need to mark those boots as used so they can't be paired again.\n\nSo maybe the approach is:\n\n- For each color c (excluding '?'), collect the list of indices in l and r where the color is c. Then, pair as many as possible between these lists. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, pair 3 of them. Once paired, those indices are marked as used and cannot be used again.\n\nThen, after handling all specific colors, we have some left and right boots that are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched (because their counterparts were already paired with others). Now, we need to pair the remaining '?'s with any available boots (either specific or '?').\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nLet me think: The remaining left boots are either '?' or colors that have no matching right boots (or vice versa). Similarly for the right boots.\n\nBut since '?' can match anything, the best way is to pair as many as possible between left '?' and right '?', then use the leftover '?'s to pair with the remaining specific colors.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal way is:\n\nAfter handling the specific color pairs, we have:\n\n- left_remaining: a list of left boots that are either '?' or have colors that have no matching right boots (but maybe they could be matched with '?' on the right).\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nSo, for the remaining, we can:\n\n- Pair left '?' with right '?'. The number of such pairs is min(left_q, right_q), where left_q is the number of left '?'s not yet used, and right_q is the same for right.\n\nThen, for the remaining left '?' and right non-? (and vice versa), pair them. For example, if there are left '?' and right 'a's that were not paired (because their own 'a's were already paired?), then pair them.\n\nWait, but in the first step, we already paired all specific color matches. So for example, if there are left 'a's and right 'a's, they are all paired. So any remaining left 'a's would be because there were more left 'a's than right 'a's. But in that case, those left 'a's can't be paired with any right 'a's. But they can be paired with right '?'s.\n\nSo, after the first step, the remaining left boots are:\n\n- Left boots with color c (non-?) where there are more left boots than right ones for that color. So, for example, if there were 5 left 'a's and 3 right 'a's, then after pairing 3, there are 2 left 'a's left. These can be paired with right '?'s.\n\nSimilarly, for right boots with color c (non-?), where there are more right boots than left ones for that color.\n\nSo, after the first step, the next step is to pair the remaining left and right boots using '?'s.\n\nSo, here's a possible approach:\n\n1. For each color c (excluding '?'), pair left and right boots of color c. Record the pairs.\n\n2. Now, collect all left boots that are not yet paired. These are:\n\n   a. Left boots with color c (non-?), where there were more left boots than right ones.\n\n   b. Left boots with color '?'.\n\nSimilarly for the right boots.\n\nNow, for these remaining left and right boots, we can pair them as follows:\n\n- Pair left '?' with right '?'. The number of such pairs is min(left_q_count, right_q_count).\n\n- Then, pair the remaining left '?' with right boots that have non-? colors. For each such right boot, if it's not yet paired, we can pair it with a left '?'.\n\n- Similarly, pair the remaining right '?' with left boots that have non-? colors.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to pair all the remaining left '?' with all the remaining right non-? (and vice versa), but how to track which ones are available.\n\nAlternatively, we can collect all the remaining left and right boots (excluding those already paired) and then try to pair them as follows:\n\nFor each left boot that is not paired and is '?', we can pair it with any right boot that is not paired. Similarly, for right boots that are not paired and are '?', pair them with any left boots not paired.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nBut for the purpose of maximizing the number of pairs, perhaps the following steps:\n\n- After step 1, collect all left boots that are not paired (left_unpaired) and all right boots not paired (right_unpaired).\n\nThen, for all left_unpaired and right_unpaired, we can pair them as follows:\n\nFor each left in left_unpaired:\n\n   if left is '?', then pair it with any right in right_unpaired (if possible).\n\n   else, if there's a right in right_unpaired that is '?', pair them.\n\n   else, if the right is same color as left, but that's already handled in step 1.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting complicated.\n\nAn alternative approach is to collect for the remaining left and right boots:\n\n- All left '?'s and all right '?'s.\n\n- All left non-? and right non-?.\n\nBut since in step 1, all possible specific color matches have been made, the remaining left non-? and right non-? cannot be paired with each other (since their counts were already matched in step 1). For example, suppose there are left 'a's and right 'a's. All possible pairs are already made, so any remaining left 'a's would have no right 'a's left. So, the remaining left 'a's can only be paired with right '?'s.\n\nSo, the remaining left non-? and right non-? can only be paired if one of them is a '?'. So, the only possible pairs are:\n\n- left '?' with right non-? (any color)\n\n- right '?' with left non-? (any color)\n\n- left '?' with right '?'\n\nSo, the way to maximize the pairs is to first pair left '?' with right '?', then pair left '?' with right non-? and right '?' with left non-?.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about data structures. For step 1, we need to pair specific colors. So for each color c (non-?), collect all the left indices and right indices. Then, pair them up as much as possible. For example, if there are 5 left 'a's and 3 right 'a's, we pair the first 3 left 'a's with the 3 right 'a's.\n\nOnce that is done, the left and right indices for those pairs are marked as used.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots, collect all the left '?'s and the left non-?s (that couldn't be paired in step 1), and similarly for right.\n\nSo, for the second part, perhaps:\n\nWe can collect:\n\nleft_question: list of indices of left boots that are '?' and not yet paired.\n\nright_question: list of indices of right boots that are '?' and not yet paired.\n\nleft_non_question: list of left boots (non-?) that are not yet paired.\n\nright_non_question: list of right boots (non-?) that are not yet paired.\n\nThen, the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nnumber of pairs from step 1 + min(len(left_question), len(right_question)) + min(len(left_question) - min(len(left_question), len(right_question)), len(right_non_question)) + min(len(right_question) - min(len(left_question), len(right_question)), len(left_non_question)) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAfter pairing left_question and right_question as much as possible (say, m pairs), we have:\n\nleft_question_remaining = len(left_question) - m\n\nright_question_remaining = len(right_question) - m\n\nNow, these remaining left_question_remaining can be paired with right_non_question (each left '?' can pair with any right non-?).\n\nSimilarly, the right_question_remaining can be paired with left_non_question.\n\nSo the total pairs from this step is:\n\nm (from ?-?) + min(left_question_remaining, len(right_non_question)) + min(right_question_remaining, len(left_non_question)).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to pair as many as possible between left_question and right_non_question, and between right_question and left_non_question.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Pair as many as possible between left_question and right_question (call this count q_pairs).\n\n- Then, pair left_question with right_non_question (call this count lq_rn_pairs).\n\n- Then, pair right_question with left_non_question (call this count rq_ln_pairs).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nBut the total possible is:\n\nq_pairs = min(len(left_question), len(right_question)).\n\nThen, after that, the remaining left_question is len(left_question) - q_pairs.\n\nThese can be paired with right_non_question. Similarly for right_question.\n\nBut how many can be paired?\n\nThe maximum possible is min(remaining_left_question, len(right_non_question)).\n\nSimilarly, min(remaining_right_question, len(left_non_question)).\n\nSo adding those two gives the total.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut for the code, we need to track which indices are used, and which are not.\n\nSo, here's the plan for the code:\n\nWe need to track for each left and right boot whether they are used or not.\n\nWe can have two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nFor each color c (not '?'):\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[j] == c and not used.\n\n   pair as many as possible (min of the two lists), and mark them as used.\n\nOnce that's done, collect the left and right indices that are not used.\n\nNow, for the second part, collect:\n\nleft_question = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not left_used[i]]\n\nright_question = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?' and not right_used[j]]\n\nleft_non_question = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not left_used[i]]\n\nright_non_question = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] != '?' and not right_used[j]]\n\nNow, for the pairs between left_question and right_question:\n\npair them as much as possible. For example, take the first k elements of left_question and first k elements of right_question, where k is min(len(left_question), len(right_question)).\n\nThen, for the remaining left_question, pair them with right_non_question.\n\nSimilarly, pair remaining right_question with left_non_question.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nSo, for example, for the left_question_remaining:\n\nfor each index in left_question_remaining, pair with any right_non_question that is not yet used. Since the right_non_question are not used, and their color is not '?', and the left is '?', which is compatible.\n\nSimilarly for the right_question_remaining.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut the order may not matter. For example, for the left_question_remaining and right_non_question, we can pair them in any order, as long as each is used once.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\n- For the first part, pair all specific color matches.\n\n- Then, collect all the remaining left and right boots.\n\n- Pair left_question and right_question as much as possible.\n\n- Then, pair left_question_remaining with right_non_question (as many as possible).\n\n- Then, pair right_question_remaining with left_non_question (as many as possible).\n\nBut how to track which ones are used?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nFirst, read n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as arrays of False.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices with l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices with r[j] == c and not used.\n\n   take the min of the two lists, and pair them.\n\n   for each pair, mark left_used[i] and right_used[j] as True.\n\nBut how to collect the colors? Well, we can loop through all possible letters (from 'a' to 'z').\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can pre-process for each color, the list of left and right indices.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 150,000, we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, for each color in 'a' to 'z', we can iterate through the left and right strings and collect the indices.\n\nBut that's O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce that's done, the next step is to collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nNow, for the second part:\n\nCollect left_question and right_question as lists.\n\nThen, pair as many as possible between them. For example, for i in 0 to min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) -1, pair left_q[i] with right_q[i].\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q, pair them with right_non_q. For each left_q element, take the first available right_non_q element.\n\nSimilarly for the remaining right_q elements.\n\nBut how to collect the right_non_q? Well, right_non_q is the list of right indices that are not used and have color not '?'.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nWe can collect right_non_q as a list. Then, for each left_q_remaining, pair with the first element in right_non_q that hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut how to track which elements are used? Because during this step, the right_non_q list may have elements that are already used. Wait, no. Because right_non_q is constructed as those not used. So during this step, when we pair left_q_remaining with right_non_q, we need to pair them in the order of the list, and mark them as used.\n\nWait, the right_non_q list is built as [j for j in range(n) if r[j] != '?' and not right_used[j]].\n\nSo, during this step, all elements in right_non_q are not used yet.\n\nSo, for example, if we have left_q_remaining and right_non_q, we can pair as many as possible. For each left_q in left_q_remaining, take the first available right_non_q, pair them, and mark them as used.\n\nSame for right_q_remaining and left_non_q.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nleft_q = list of left indices with l[i] == '?', not used.\n\nright_q = list of right indices with r[j] == '?', not used.\n\nleft_non_q = list of left indices with l[i] != '?', not used.\n\nright_non_q = list of right indices with r[j] != '?', not used.\n\nThen, for the first part of step 2:\n\nq_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in 0 to q_pairs-1:\n\n   pair left_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q (len_left_q = len(left_q) - q_pairs):\n\nwe can pair them with right_non_q.\n\nfor each left in left_q[q_pairs:]:\n\n   if there are any right_non_q elements not used:\n\n      take the first one, pair them, mark as used.\n\nSimilarly for the remaining right_q elements.\n\nBut how to collect right_non_q and left_non_q?\n\nWait, right_non_q is a list of right indices that are not used and have non-? color. So during step 2, when we pair left_q_remaining with right_non_q, we can iterate through the right_non_q list and pair them.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used? Well, during this step, the right_non_q list is built once. So, for example, we can have a pointer for right_non_q. For each left_q_remaining, we take the first element of right_non_q, pair them, and remove it from the list (or track the index). Similarly for the other steps.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nAfter collecting left_q, right_q, left_non_q, right_non_q:\n\nWe can create pointers for the right_non_q and left_non_q.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor the left_q_remaining:\n\ni = 0\n\nfor each left_index in left_q_remaining:\n\n   if i < len(right_non_q):\n\n       pair left_index with right_non_q[i]\n\n       mark left_used[left_index] and right_used[right_non_q[i]] as True.\n\n       i += 1\n\nSimilarly for the right_q_remaining and left_non_q.\n\nWait, but how to get the left_q_remaining and right_q_remaining?\n\nLet me think. After pairing the first q_pairs between left_q and right_q, the remaining left_q is left_q[q_pairs:], and the remaining right_q is right_q[q_pairs:].\n\nSo, for the remaining left_q, we can pair them with right_non_q.\n\nSimilarly for the remaining right_q.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\n# Step 1: pair specific colors.\n\nThen:\n\n# collect left_q, right_q, left_non_q, right_non_q.\n\nleft_q = []\nright_q = []\nleft_non_q = []\nright_non_q = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not left_used[i]:\n        if l[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_non_q.append(i)\n\nfor j in range(n):\n    if not right_used[j]:\n        if r[j] == '?':\n            right_q.append(j)\n        else:\n            right_non_q.append(j)\n\n# Now, pair left_q and right_q:\n\nq_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(q_pairs):\n    a = left_q[i]\n    b = right_q[i]\n    # add pair (a+1, b+1) to the result\n    pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n    left_used[a] = True\n    right_used[b] = True\n\n# Now, process left_q_remaining (those not in the first q_pairs)\nleft_q_remaining = left_q[q_pairs:]\nright_q_remaining = right_q[q_pairs:]\n\n# Pair left_q_remaining with right_non_q:\n\nptr = 0\nfor idx in left_q_remaining:\n    if ptr < len(right_non_q):\n        a = idx\n        b = right_non_q[ptr]\n        pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n        left_used[a] = True\n        right_used[b] = True\n        ptr += 1\n\n# Then, pair right_q_remaining with left_non_q:\n\nptr = 0\nfor idx in right_q_remaining:\n    if ptr < len(left_non_q):\n        a = left_non_q[ptr]\n        b = idx\n        pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n        left_used[a] = True\n        right_used[b] = True\n        ptr += 1\n\nWait, but what about the left_non_q and right_non_q? Are they already processed?\n\nYes, because during the first step, we have already paired all specific color matches. So, the left_non_q and right_non_q are those that couldn't be paired with their same color. But since they have non-? colors, they can only be paired with ?s. But in this code, after pairing the left_q_remaining with right_non_q, and right_q_remaining with left_non_q, those are the only possibilities.\n\nBut this code may not capture all possibilities. For example, after pairing left_q_remaining with right_non_q, there may be some right_non_q left, and also some right_q_remaining. But those can't be paired with anything else except each other (but they are already processed in the first step). Wait, no. The right_q_remaining are the ones that are '?', but they are already processed in the first step. So after that, the code pairs the remaining left_q_remaining with right_non_q and the remaining right_q_remaining with left_non_q.\n\nThis should cover all possibilities.\n\nBut wait, the left_non_q and right_non_q are lists of non-? colors. So, for example, a left_non_q element has a color c (non-?), but there are no right boots of color c left (since that was handled in step 1). So, the only way to pair them is with a '?' (either left or right). But in this code, the left_non_q is being paired with right_q_remaining (which are '?').\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case where there are left_non_q and right_non_q elements that can't be paired? Like, for example, a left_non_q with color 'a' and right_non_q with color 'b'. These can't be paired, so they are left unpaired.\n\nSo, this approach would capture all possible pairs.\n\nNow, the question is how to collect the left and right indices for each color in step 1.\n\nBut for that, perhaps we can use dictionaries to map each color to a list of indices.\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps:\n\nFor step 1, we can process each color from 'a' to 'z' (since the problem says lowercase letters). For each color, collect all left indices and right indices not yet used, then pair them.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nHere's the code for step 1:\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as lists of False.\n\npairs = list()\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    # collect left indices with color c and not used\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n    # collect right indices with color c and not used\n    right_list = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == c and not right_used[j]]\n    # pair as many as possible\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        a = left_list[i]\n        b = right_list[i]\n        pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n        left_used[a] = True\n        right_used[b] = True\n\nBut this is O(26n) time, which is acceptable for n=1.5e5.\n\nWait, but for each color, we are scanning the entire string. That would be O(26 * n) = O(n) operations.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, that's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to pre-process for each color, the list of indices. For example, create for left and right, a dictionary mapping color to list of indices. Then, for each color, process those lists.\n\nBut even with the code above, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps for large n, building the lists each time is expensive. However, given that 26 is small, it's manageable.\n\nBut in practice, for Python, this approach may be too slow for n=1.5e5. Let me think: for each color, looping through the entire string (length n) for left and right. So for each color, 2n operations. Multiply by 26, it's 52n operations. For n=1.5e5, that's 7.8e6 operations. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo, that's manageable.\n\nNow, considering that, the code steps are:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as [False]*n.\n\nProcess step 1 as above.\n\nThen, collect the left_q, right_q, left_non_q, right_non_q as discussed.\n\nThen process step 2 as discussed.\n\nNow, the problem is to output the pairs. So, the code needs to collect all the pairs generated in step 1 and step 2.\n\nBut the order in which pairs are generated may vary, but the problem allows any valid answer.\n\nNow, testing with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFor example, the first sample input is:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nSample Output is 5 pairs.\n\nBut let's not go into details here.\n\nAnother test case is when there are no possible pairs. For example, if l is all 'a's and r is all 'b's. Then, no pairs. So output is 0.\n\nAnother case: l is all '?', r is all '?'. Then, maximum pairs is n.\n\nNow, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nBut what about when there are overlapping pairs? For example, when a left '?' can be paired with multiple right boots, but the code chooses the first ones.\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid answer, the code's approach is acceptable.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code for step 1 may not be efficient enough. However, given that 26 is small, it's manageable.\n\nBut for Python, list comprehensions are efficient. So, for each color, generating left_list and right_list is acceptable.\n\nAnother issue is that the code may pair the same left or right boot multiple times. But since in step 1, we check for not used, and mark them as used once paired, that should not happen.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut for the code, we need to read the input. However, the initial problem statement says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line is l.\n\nThird line is r.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user provided sample input as:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line contains l.\n\nThird line contains r.\n\nBut in the sample input given, there are four entries, which suggests that the user may have intended to show multiple test cases. However, the actual problem's input is per test case. So, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. But the code needs to read from stdin.\n\nAssuming that the code is supposed to handle a single test case, as per the problem statement.\n\nBut looking back, the problem says:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line contains l.\n\nThird line contains r.\n\nSo, the code should read three lines: n, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input given by the user seems to have multiple test cases. However, that's probably a formatting error. So, the code should read from stdin normally.\n\nThus, the code should be written to read n, then l, then r.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l.\n\nRead r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as lists of False.\n\nProcess step 1.\n\nThen process step 2 as discussed.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for the step 1, the code is:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n\n    right_list = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == c and not right_used[j]]\n\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n        a = left_list[i]\n\n        b = right_list[i]\n\n        pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n        left_used[a] = True\n\n        right_used[b] = True\n\nBut this is O(26n) time.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, this is acceptable.\n\nThen, collect left_q, right_q, etc.\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not left_used[i]]\n\nright_q = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?' and not right_used[j]]\n\nleft_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not left_used[i]]\n\nright_non_q = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] != '?' and not right_used[j]]\n\nThen, process the pairs between left_q and right_q.\n\nThen, process left_q_remaining with right_non_q, and right_q_remaining with left_non_q.\n\nBut for the code, the pairs list is built step by step.\n\nNow, code for that part:\n\nAfter step 1, collect left_q, right_q, left_non_q, right_non_q.\n\nThen:\n\n# Pair left_q and right_q:\n\nq_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(q_pairs):\n\n    a = left_q[i]\n\n    b = right_q[i]\n\n    pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n    left_used[a] = True\n\n    right_used[b] = True\n\nThen, the remaining left_q_remaining is left_q[q_pairs:].\n\nSimilarly for right_q_remaining.\n\nThen, for the left_q_remaining:\n\nptr = 0\n\nfor idx in left_q_remaining:\n\n    if ptr < len(right_non_q):\n\n        a = idx\n\n        b = right_non_q[ptr]\n\n        pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n        left_used[a] = True\n\n        right_used[b] = True\n\n        ptr += 1\n\nSimilarly for the right_q_remaining:\n\nptr = 0\n\nfor idx in right_q_remaining:\n\n    if ptr < len(left_non_q):\n\n        a = left_non_q[ptr]\n\n        b = idx\n\n        pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n        left_used[a] = True\n\n        right_used[b] = True\n\n        ptr += 1\n\nBut in Python, the lists left_q_remaining and right_q_remaining are slices of the left_q and right_q lists.\n\nNow, the code for this part.\n\nBut what about the order in which the pairs are generated? For example, in step 1, the code pairs the left_list and right_list in the order of their indices. But since the problem allows any valid pairing, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code for the entire problem.\n\nBut in Python, for large n (like 1.5e5), the code may be too slow if using list comprehensions for each color. For example, for each color, generating the left_list and right_list by checking all n elements.\n\nAn alternative approach is to pre-process for each color, the list of indices. For example, create for left and right, a dictionary mapping color to list of indices. Then, during step 1, for each color, we can iterate through the precomputed lists, but skipping those that are already used. However, this may not help much.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps the code as written is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nBut I'm not going to compute that manually. However, the code should generate the correct output.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing all steps.\n\nBut also, note that for the code to handle multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, the code should read from stdin and output the answer for one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but perhaps that's a mistake. But according to the problem's original description, the input is for one test case. Therefore, the code should read n, l, r.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nBut note that in Python, reading input can be done via input(). However, sometimes for large inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the code, assuming that the input is given correctly.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = input[1]\n    r = input[2]\n    # Wait, but the input may have multiple lines. For example, the first line is n, then the second line is l, then third line is r.\n\n    # So, the code should read the input as:\n\n    # Read all lines at once.\n    # But in practice, for code submission, perhaps it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\n    # However, the code may not work if the input is read as split(), since the strings may contain spaces. But the problem says that the input strings are of length n, and contain only lowercase letters and '?'.\n\n    # So, perhaps the correct way is to read the first line as n, then the next line as l, then the next line as r.\n\n    # So, the code should read from stdin as:\n\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    left_used = [False] * n\n    right_used = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: pair specific colors\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        left_list = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]:\n                left_list.append(i)\n        right_list = []\n        for j in range(n):\n            if r[j] == c and not right_used[j]:\n                right_list.append(j)\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            a = left_list[i]\n            b = right_list[i]\n            pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n            left_used[a] = True\n            right_used[b] = True\n\n    # Step 2: collect remaining\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n    left_non_q = []\n    right_non_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not left_used[i]:\n            if l[i] == '?':\n                left_q.append(i)\n            else:\n                left_non_q.append(i)\n    for j in range(n):\n        if not right_used[j]:\n            if r[j] == '?':\n                right_q.append(j)\n            else:\n                right_non_q.append(j)\n\n    # Pair left_q and right_q\n    q_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(q_pairs):\n        a = left_q[i]\n        b = right_q[i]\n        pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n        left_used[a] = True\n        right_used[b] = True\n\n    # Pair left_q_remaining with right_non_q\n    left_q_remaining = left_q[q_pairs:]\n    ptr = 0\n    for idx in left_q_remaining:\n        if ptr < len(right_non_q):\n            a = idx\n            b = right_non_q[ptr]\n            pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n            left_used[a] = True\n            right_used[b] = True\n            ptr += 1\n\n    # Pair right_q_remaining with left_non_q\n    right_q_remaining = right_q[q_pairs:]\n    ptr = 0\n    for idx in right_q_remaining:\n        if ptr < len(left_non_q):\n            a = left_non_q[ptr]\n            b = idx\n            pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n            left_used[a] = True\n            right_used[b] = True\n            ptr += 1\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for a, b in pairs:\n        print(a, b)\n\nBut wait,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots based on their colors. Each boot can be either a specific color (a lowercase letter) or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). A specific color is compatible with another boot of the same color or an indefinite color. An indefinite color is compatible with any other color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors**: First, we pair boots of the same specific color. For each color from 'a' to 'z', we collect indices of left and right boots that match this color and have not been used yet. We then pair them as much as possible.\n2. **Handle Indefinite Colors**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots which are either indefinite ('?') or could not be paired due to lack of matching specific colors.
