His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the scores of the first and second tours, but not the names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of the first and second tour scores for the participants, and determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have, given that his total is at least x.\n\nLet me think about the approach here.\n\nFirst, the key points:\n\n- Each participant has a score in the first tour (a_i) and second tour (b_j). But the problem says that the list of a's and b's are given in arbitrary order. So, for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but we don't know which a_i pairs with which b_j. However, the actual pairing is such that each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa. Because each participant took both tours. So the problem is that the teacher has the lists of first and second tour scores, but doesn't know which a_i belongs to which b_j. So, when considering possible pairings, we can arrange the a's and b's in any way as long as each a is paired with exactly one b.\n\nBut Vasya's total is at least x. However, the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where some a_i + b_j >= x. So our job is to find, among all possible pairings of a's and b's (each a is matched with exactly one b), the best and worst possible rank that Vasya could have. But how do we model this?\n\nWait, the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher knows that he has at least x. So, when considering possible pairings, we need to choose a pairing where at least one of the pairs (a_i, b_j) has a_i + b_j >= x. But since the problem says it is guaranteed that such a pair exists, we don't have to worry about that.\n\nBut how do we model Vasya's possible positions? Because for the best possible rank, we want to arrange the pairings such that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. For the worst possible rank, arrange the pairings so that Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x) and others are as high as possible.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think.\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to maximize Vasya's total (so that he is as high as possible), and arrange others' totals to be as low as possible. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is determined by the scenario where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are arranged so that as many as possible have higher totals than him. But since we can arrange the pairings, perhaps the best rank is determined by choosing the maximum possible sum for Vasya, and then counting how many people can have a higher sum than that.\n\nBut how do we choose the pairing where Vasya's sum is maximized?\n\nWait, but how do we know which a_i and b_j are assigned to Vasya? Since the problem says that there exists some pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But for the purposes of calculating the best and worst possible ranks, we can choose any possible pair (i,j) for Vasya as long as a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the rest of the pairings are done in a way that affects the total sums.\n\nBut the problem is that the best and worst possible ranks depend on how the other pairings are made.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya (with a_i + b_j >=x) such that when the rest of the pairings are done optimally (to minimize the number of people with higher sum than Vasya's), the rank is as high as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya (with sum >=x) such that when the rest of the pairings are done to maximize the number of people with higher or equal sum than Vasya's, the rank is as low as possible.\n\nBut how can we compute this?\n\nLet me think about the best possible rank first.\n\nBest possible rank: We want to assign Vasya the maximum possible sum. Because if his sum is higher, then fewer people can have higher sums than him. So, the best scenario is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible.\n\nSo, first, find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves considering all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to find optimal scenarios for Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank, we maximize Vasya's total score by pairing the highest scores from the first tour with the highest scores from the second tour. This ensures that Vasya's score is as high as possible, minimizing the number of participants who could have a higher score.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank, we minimize Vasya's total score while still meeting the minimum requirement (x). This involves pairing the lowest possible scores from the first tour with the lowest possible scores from the second tour, maximizing the number of participants who could have a higher score.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort a and b for best and worst cases\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Best case: maximize Vasya's score\n    # Pair largest a with largest b\n    max_vasya = 0\n    best_rank = 1\n    # Find the maximum possible sum for Vasya\n    # We can take the top a and top b\n    # Then, count how many people can have a total >= this sum\n    # For best rank, we want to choose the maximum possible sum\n    # So, take the top a and top b\n    max_sum = a_sorted[-1] + b_sorted[-1]\n    # Now, we need to count how many pairs can have sum >= max_sum\n    # But since we are trying to maximize Vasya's sum, we can assume he has this sum\n    # Then, others are paired to get as many as possible sums >= max_sum\n    # However, since we can arrange the pairings, the best case is that only Vasya has this sum\n    # But to calculate the minimal possible rank, we need to count how many other pairs can have sum >= max_sum\n    # Wait, no. Actually, for the best case, we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged to have as low as possible sums.\n    # However, the problem says that the jury can assign places arbitrarily when there are ties. So, for the best case, we can assume that Vasya is placed first even if there are others with same sum.\n    # Therefore, the best possible rank is 1, because we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya has the maximum possible sum, and others have lower or equal.\n    # Wait, but if there are multiple people with the same sum as Vasya, the jury can place him first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n    # However, the example shows that when all have same sum, the best rank is 1. So perhaps the best possible rank is always 1, but that's not the case.\n    # Wait no, in the first example, the output is 1 5. Because the teacher can arrange the pairings so that Vasya is first, or fifth.\n    # So how do we compute the best and worst possible ranks?\n\n    # Let me re-express the approach:\n    # For best rank, we want to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, count how many other pairs (from the remaining a and b) can have sum >= this value. The best rank is then that count + 1 (since if there are k people with higher sum, Vasya is k+1).\n\n    # However, since we can arrange the pairings, the best case is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and the rest of the pairings are arranged to minimize the number of people with sum >= Vasya's sum.\n\n    # So, for best rank:\n    # Find the maximum possible sum Vasya can have, which is the maximum of a[i] + b[j], where i and j are indices. But since we can choose any pairing, the maximum sum is max_a + max_b.\n\n    # Then, we need to find how many other participants can have a sum >= this value, given that we pair the remaining a and b optimally to minimize that number.\n\n    # To compute this, we can use the following approach:\n    # After taking the maximum a and maximum b for Vasya, we need to pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that minimizes the number of pairs with sum >= max_sum.\n\n    # How to do that? Well, the minimal number of such pairs would be achieved by pairing the smallest a's with the largest b's, or vice versa, but I'm not sure.\n\n    # Alternatively, to compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >= some value, we can sort the a and b arrays, then for each a_i, find the number of b_j that can be paired with it to get sum >= target.\n\n    # But this seems complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\n    # Let me think of the best possible rank:\n\n    # For best rank, we want to select a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, for the rest of the participants, we pair them in such a way that as few as possible have a sum >= this value.\n\n    # To do that, after choosing the best possible a_i and b_j for Vasya, we need to pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that minimizes the number of pairs with sum >= (a_i + b_j). How?\n\n    # For example, suppose after taking the max a and max b, we have the remaining a's and b's. To minimize the number of pairs with sum >= max_sum, we can pair the smallest a's with the largest b's, and vice versa. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\n    # Suppose the max_sum is S. We want to pair the remaining a's and b's such that as few as possible pairs have sum >= S. The way to do that is to pair the smallest a's with the largest b's. Because that way, the a's are as small as possible, and the b's are as large as possible. For example, if a is small and b is large, their sum may be close to S. But if you pair a small a with a small b, their sum will be smaller.\n\n    # So, to minimize the number of pairs with sum >= S, we can sort the remaining a's in ascending order and the remaining b's in descending order, and pair them. Then, for each a in ascending order and b in descending order, check if a + b >= S.\n\n    # Alternatively, sort the remaining a's in ascending order and the remaining b's in ascending order, and pair them in a way that maximizes the number of pairs with sum < S. Wait, but how?\n\n    # This seems complex. Perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible pairs for Vasya, and for each possible sum, compute the minimal number of people that can have a sum >= that sum.\n\n    # However, given the constraints (n up to 1e5), this approach would be too slow.\n\n    # Let me think again. For the best possible rank, the best scenario is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible. Let's say that sum is S. Then, the best possible rank is the number of participants whose sum can be >= S, assuming optimal pairing for the others.\n\n    # But how do we find the minimal number of participants that can have sum >= S, given that S is fixed?\n\n    # Here's an idea: For the best case, we want to maximize Vasya's sum S. Once S is determined, the minimal number of participants with sum >= S is determined by how many pairs (from the remaining a and b) can be formed with sum >= S. To minimize this number, we need to pair the remaining a and b in a way that as few as possible pairs have sum >= S.\n\n    # How to compute that? It's similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S. Wait, but we want to minimize the number of such pairs. So we need to pair the remaining a and b in a way that as few as possible pairs have sum >= S.\n\n    # To do this, we can sort the remaining a in ascending order and the remaining b in descending order, and pair them. For example, the smallest a with the largest b. This way, the sum may be larger than S, but if we can avoid that, it's better.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can sort both in ascending order and pair them. But I'm not sure.\n\n    # Let me think of an example. Suppose S is 10, and the remaining a's are [3, 4, 5], and the remaining b's are [7, 8, 9].\n\n    # If I pair 3 with 9 (sum 12), 4 with 8 (sum 12), 5 with 7 (sum 12), all three pairs have sum >= 10. That's 3.\n\n    # If I pair 3 with 7 (sum 10), 4 with 8 (sum 12), 5 with 9 (sum 14), then two pairs have sum >= 10.\n\n    # Wait, but this is worse. So pairing the smallest a with the smallest b may help reduce the number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\n    # Hmm, perhaps the correct way to minimize the number of pairs with sum >= S is to pair the smallest a with the largest b, and the next smallest a with the next largest b, etc. This way, the a's are as small as possible, and the b's are as large as possible, which might lead to more pairs having sum >= S. So that's not helpful.\n\n    # Alternatively, pairing the largest a with the smallest b, and so on. Let's see:\n\n    # For the same example, a = [3,4,5], b = [7,8,9], S=10.\n\n    # Pair 5 with 7 (sum 12), 4 with 8 (sum 12), 3 with 9 (sum 12): 3 pairs.\n\n    # If we pair 3 with 7 (sum 10), 4 with 8 (sum 12), 5 with 9 (sum 14): 3 pairs.\n\n    # So no difference.\n\n    # Another example: a = [3, 6], b = [5, 7], S=10.\n\n    # If we pair 3 with 7 (10) and 6 with 5 (11): both >= 10 → 2 pairs.\n\n    # If we pair 3 with 5 (8) and 6 with 7 (13): one pair >= 10. So that's better.\n\n    # Ah, so pairing the smallest a with the smallest b may help minimize the number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\n    # So, the approach would be: sort the remaining a in ascending order, sort the remaining b in ascending order, and pair them in order. Then, for each pair, check if a[i] + b[i] >= S.\n\n    # This way, we can compute how many pairs have sum >= S.\n\n    # So, to find the minimal number of pairs with sum >= S, we need to sort a and b in ascending order, and pair them in order.\n\n    # Therefore, the algorithm for the best rank is:\n\n    # 1. Find the maximum possible sum S for Vasya (max_a + max_b).\n    # 2. Remove one a (the max a) and one b (the max b).\n    # 3. Sort the remaining a and b in ascending order.\n    # 4. Pair them in order (a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], etc.).\n    # 5. Count how many of these pairs have sum >= S.\n    # 6. The best rank is the count + 1 (since Vasya's sum is S, and there are count people with sum >= S).\n\n    # Similarly, for the worst rank:\n\n    # 1. Find the minimum possible sum S for Vasya that is >= x. This is done by choosing the smallest possible a and b that sum to at least x. Or wait, no. To get the worst possible rank, we need to choose a sum S for Vasya that is as small as possible (but still >= x), and then arrange the rest of the pairings to maximize the number of people with sum >= S.\n\n    # So, for the worst case, we want to choose the minimal possible S (>=x) for Vasya. Then, pair the remaining a and b to maximize the number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\n    # How to find this minimal S? We need to find the minimal possible sum S such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= x, and S is as small as possible.\n\n    # To find this, we can sort a and b in ascending order, and for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >= x. Then, the minimal S would be the minimal a_i + b_j over all such pairs.\n\n    # However, since we need to choose one pair for Vasya, and then pair the rest optimally to maximize the number of people with sum >= S.\n\n    # Once S is chosen, to maximize the number of pairs with sum >= S, we can sort the remaining a and b in ascending order, and pair them in a way that maximizes the number of pairs with sum >= S. How to do that?\n\n    # This is similar to the classic two-pointer technique for maximum pairs with sum >= target.\n\n    # For example, sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet and a_i + b_j >= S.\n\n    # The standard approach for this is:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order.\n\n    # Initialize two pointers, i=0 (start of a), j=0 (start of b).\n\n    # For each a[i], if a[i] + b[j] >= S, then we can pair them, increment both pointers. Otherwise, increment i (since a[i] is too small to pair with any b[j] left).\n\n    # This gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\n    # So, putting it all together:\n\n    # Best rank calculation:\n    # - Take the maximum a and maximum b for Vasya's sum S.\n    # - Remove these from the lists.\n    # - Sort the remaining a and b in ascending order.\n    # - Pair them in order, count how many have sum >= S.\n    # - Best rank is count + 1.\n\n    # Worst rank calculation:\n    # - Find the minimal S >= x that Vasya can have.\n    # - Remove the corresponding a_i and b_j from the lists.\n    # - Sort the remaining a in ascending order and b in descending order.\n    # - Use two pointers to count the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S.\n    # - Worst rank is count + 1.\n\n    # Now, let's implement this.\n\n    # First, for best rank:\n    # Find the maximum sum S for Vasya.\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    max_a = a_sorted[-1]\n    max_b = b_sorted[-1]\n    max_sum = max_a + max_b\n\n    # Create new lists without max_a and max_b\n    remaining_a_best = a_sorted[:-1] + [a_sorted[-1]]  # Wait no, we need to remove one occurrence of max_a and one of max_b.\n    # Wait, the original a_sorted has a_sorted[-1] as max_a. But there might be multiple entries with the same value. So we need to remove one occurrence of max_a and one of max_b.\n\n    # To do that, we can make copies of the sorted lists, and remove the last elements (which are the max values).\n    # However, this assumes that the max_a and max_b are unique. But what if there are multiple max values?\n\n    # For example, if a is [5,5,5], and we remove one 5, the remaining is [5,5].\n\n    # So, for the best case, we can remove one max_a and one max_b from the sorted lists.\n\n    # Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n    # Create a copy of the sorted lists, then remove one max from each:\n    temp_a = a_sorted.copy()\n    temp_b = b_sorted.copy()\n    # Remove one max from a\n    temp_a.pop()\n    # Remove one max from b\n    temp_b.pop()\n\n    # Now, sort both in ascending order\n    temp_a.sort()\n    temp_b.sort()\n\n    # Now, pair them in order and count how many have sum >= max_sum\n    count_best = 0\n    for ai, bi in zip(temp_a, temp_b):\n        if ai + bi >= max_sum:\n            count_best += 1\n    best_rank = count_best + 1\n\n    # Now for worst rank:\n    # Find the minimal S >= x that Vasya can have.\n    # To find this, we can use a two-pointer approach on the sorted a and sorted b.\n    # Sort a in ascending, b in ascending.\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_asc = sorted(b)\n\n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    i = 0\n    j = len(b_asc) - 1\n    while i < len(a_asc) and j >= 0:\n        current_sum = a_asc[i] + b_asc[j]\n        if current_sum >= x:\n            if current_sum < min_sum:\n                min_sum = current_sum\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    # Now, we need to find the minimal possible S >= x. However, there might be multiple pairs that give the same sum. We need to pick one of them.\n    # Once we have the minimal S, we need to remove one a and one b that form this sum.\n\n    # However, the above approach finds the minimal S. Let's assume that min_sum is found.\n\n    # But what if there are multiple pairs with sum >= x?

Once found, we remove that a_i and b_j from the lists, and then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= min_sum.\n\n    # However, the above code for finding min_sum may not capture all possibilities.

We then count how many other participants can have scores equal to or higher than Vasya's, assuming optimal pairing for the remaining participants.\n2. **Worst Rank Calculation**: We find the minimum possible score Vasya can have that meets the threshold `x`. We then count how many other participants can have scores equal to or higher than Vasya's, assuming optimal pairing for the remaining participants to maximize this count.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes both the best and worst possible ranks using sorting and two-pointer techniques, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",

Actually, for the best case, we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged to have as low as possible sums.\n    # However, the problem says that the jury can assign places arbitrarily when there are ties. So, for the best case, we can assume that Vasya is placed first even if there are others with same sum.\n    # Therefore, the best possible rank is 1, because we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya has the maximum possible sum, and others have lower or equal.\n    # Wait, but if there are multiple people with the same sum as Vasya, the jury can place him first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n    # However, the example shows that when all have same sum, the best rank is 1. So perhaps the best possible rank is always 1, but that's not the case.\n    # Wait no, in the first example, the output is 1 5. Because the teacher can arrange the pairings so that Vasya is first, or fifth.\n    # So how do we compute the best and worst possible ranks?\n\n    # Let me re-express the approach:\n    # For best rank, we want to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, count how many other pairs (from the remaining a and b) can have sum >= this value. The best rank is then that count + 1 (since if there are k people with higher sum, Vasya is k+1).\n\n    # However, since we can arrange the pairings, the best case is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and the rest of the pairings are arranged to minimize the number of people with sum >= Vasya's sum.\n\n    # So, for best rank:\n    # Find the maximum possible sum Vasya can have, which is the maximum of a[i] + b[j], where i and j are indices. But since we can choose any pairing, the maximum sum is max_a + max_b.\n\n    # Then, we need to find how many other participants can have a sum >= this value, given that we pair the remaining a and b optimally to minimize that number.\n\n    # To compute this, we can use the following approach:\n    # After taking the maximum a and maximum b for Vasya, we need to pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that minimizes the number of pairs with sum >= max_sum.\n\n    # How to do that? Well, the minimal number of such pairs would be achieved by pairing the smallest a's with the largest b's, or vice versa, but I'm not sure.\n\n    # Alternatively, to compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >= some value, we can sort the a and b arrays, then for each a_i, find the number of b_j that can be paired with it to get sum >= target.\n\n    # But this seems complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\n    # Let me think of the best possible rank:\n\n    # For best rank, we want to select a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, for the rest of the participants, we pair them in such a way that as few as possible have a sum >= this value.\n\n    # To do that, after choosing the best possible a_i and b_j for Vasya, we need to pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that minimizes the number of pairs with sum >= (a_i + b_j). How?\n\n    # For example, suppose after taking the max a and max b, we have the remaining a's and b's. To minimize the number of pairs with sum >= max_sum, we can pair the smallest a's with the largest b's, and vice versa. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\n    # Suppose the max_sum is S. We want to pair the remaining a's and b's such that as few as possible pairs have sum >= S. The way to do that is to pair the smallest a's with the largest b's. Because that way, the a's are as small as possible, and the b's are as large as possible. For example, if a is small and b is large, their sum may be close to S. But if you pair a small a with a small b, their sum will be smaller.\n\n    # So, to minimize the number of pairs with sum >= S, we can sort the remaining a's in ascending order and the remaining b's in descending order, and pair them. Then, for each a in ascending order and b in descending order, check if a + b >= S.\n\n    # Alternatively, sort the remaining a's in ascending order and the remaining b's in ascending order, and pair them in a way that maximizes the number of pairs with sum < S. Wait, but how?\n\n    # This seems complex. Perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible pairs for Vasya, and for each possible sum, compute the minimal number of people that can have a sum >= that sum.\n\n    # However, given the constraints (n up to 1e5), this approach would be too slow.\n\n    # Let me think again. For the best possible rank, the best scenario is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible. Let's say that sum is S. Then, the best possible rank is the number of participants whose sum can be >= S, assuming optimal pairing for the others.\n\n    # But how do we find the minimal number of participants that can have sum >= S, given that S is fixed?\n\n    # Here's an idea: For the best case, we want to maximize Vasya's sum S. Once S is determined, the minimal number of participants with sum >= S is determined by how many pairs (from the remaining a and b) can be formed with sum >= S. To minimize this number, we need to pair the remaining a and b in a way that as few as possible pairs have sum >= S.\n\n    # How to compute that? It's similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S. Wait, but we want to minimize the number of such pairs. So we need to pair the remaining a and b in a way that as few as possible pairs have sum >= S.\n\n    # To do this, we can sort the remaining a in ascending order and the remaining b in descending order, and pair them. For example, the smallest a with the largest b. This way, the sum may be larger than S, but if we can avoid that, it's better.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can sort both in ascending order and pair them. But I'm not sure.\n\n    # Let me think of an example. Suppose S is 10, and the remaining a's are [3, 4, 5], and the remaining b's are [7, 8, 9].\n\n    # If I pair 3 with 9 (sum 12), 4 with 8 (sum 12), 5 with 7 (sum 12), all three pairs have sum >= 10. That's 3.\n\n    # If I pair 3 with 7 (sum 10), 4 with 8 (sum 12), 5 with 9 (sum 14), then two pairs have sum >= 10.\n\n    # Wait, but this is worse. So pairing the smallest a with the smallest b may help reduce the number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\n    # Hmm, perhaps the correct way to minimize the number of pairs with sum >= S is to pair the smallest a with the largest b, and the next smallest a with the next largest b, etc. This way, the a's are as small as possible, and the b's are as large as possible, which might lead to more pairs having sum >= S. So that's not helpful.\n\n    # Alternatively, pairing the largest a with the smallest b, and so on. Let's see:\n\n    # For the same example, a = [3,4,5], b = [7,8,9], S=10.\n\n    # Pair 5 with 7 (sum 12), 4 with 8 (sum 12), 3 with 9 (sum 12): 3 pairs.\n\n    # If we pair 3 with 7 (sum 10), 4 with 8 (sum 12), 5 with 9 (sum 14): 3 pairs.\n\n    # So no difference.\n\n    # Another example: a = [3, 6], b = [5, 7], S=10.\n\n    # If we pair 3 with 7 (10) and 6 with 5 (11): both >= 10 → 2 pairs.\n\n    # If we pair 3 with 5 (8) and 6 with 7 (13): one pair >= 10. So that's better.\n\n    # Ah, so pairing the smallest a with the smallest b may help minimize the number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\n    # So, the approach would be: sort the remaining a in ascending order, sort the remaining b in ascending order, and pair them in order. Then, for each pair, check if a[i] + b[i] >= S.\n\n    # This way, we can compute how many pairs have sum >= S.\n\n    # So, to find the minimal number of pairs with sum >= S, we need to sort a and b in ascending order, and pair them in order.\n\n    # Therefore, the algorithm for the best rank is:\n\n    # 1. Find the maximum possible sum S for Vasya (max_a + max_b).\n    # 2. Remove one a (the max a) and one b (the max b).\n    # 3. Sort the remaining a and b in ascending order.\n    # 4. Pair them in order (a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], etc.).\n    # 5. Count how many of these pairs have sum >= S.\n    # 6. The best rank is the count + 1 (since Vasya's sum is S, and there are count people with sum >= S).\n\n    # Similarly, for the worst rank:\n\n    # 1. Find the minimum possible sum S for Vasya that is >= x. This is done by choosing the smallest possible a and b that sum to at least x. Or wait, no. To get the worst possible rank, we need to choose a sum S for Vasya that is as small as possible (but still >= x), and then arrange the rest of the pairings to maximize the number of people with sum >= S.\n\n    # So, for the worst case, we want to choose the minimal possible S (>=x) for Vasya. Then, pair the remaining a and b to maximize the number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\n    # How to find this minimal S? We need to find the minimal possible sum S such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= x, and S is as small as possible.\n\n    # To find this, we can sort a and b in ascending order, and for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >= x. Then, the minimal S would be the minimal a_i + b_j over all such pairs.\n\n    # However, since we need to choose one pair for Vasya, and then pair the rest optimally to maximize the number of people with sum >= S.\n\n    # Once S is chosen, to maximize the number of pairs with sum >= S, we can sort the remaining a and b in ascending order, and pair them in a way that maximizes the number of pairs with sum >= S. How to do that?\n\n    # This is similar to the classic two-pointer technique for maximum pairs with sum >= target.\n\n    # For example, sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet and a_i + b_j >= S.\n\n    # The standard approach for this is:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order.\n\n    # Initialize two pointers, i=0 (start of a), j=0 (start of b).\n\n    # For each a[i], if a[i] + b[j] >= S, then we can pair them, increment both pointers. Otherwise, increment i (since a[i] is too small to pair with any b[j] left).\n\n    # This gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\n    # So, putting it all together:\n\n    # Best rank calculation:\n    # - Take the maximum a and maximum b for Vasya's sum S.\n    # - Remove these from the lists.\n    # - Sort the remaining a and b in ascending order.\n    # - Pair them in order, count how many have sum >= S.\n    # - Best rank is count + 1.\n\n    # Worst rank calculation:\n    # - Find the minimal S >= x that Vasya can have.\n    # - Remove the corresponding a_i and b_j from the lists.\n    # - Sort the remaining a in ascending order and b in descending order.\n    # - Use two pointers to count the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S.\n    # - Worst rank is count + 1.\n\n    # Now, let's implement this.\n\n    # First, for best rank:\n    # Find the maximum sum S for Vasya.\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    max_a = a_sorted[-1]\n    max_b = b_sorted[-1]\n    max_sum = max_a + max_b\n\n    # Create new lists without max_a and max_b\n    remaining_a_best = a_sorted[:-1] + [a_sorted[-1]]  # Wait no, we need to remove one occurrence of max_a and one of max_b.\n    # Wait, the original a_sorted has a_sorted[-1] as max_a. But there might be multiple entries with the same value. So we need to remove one occurrence of max_a and one of max_b.\n\n    # To do that, we can make copies of the sorted lists, and remove the last elements (which are the max values).\n    # However, this assumes that the max_a and max_b are unique.

However, there might be multiple pairs that give the same sum.
