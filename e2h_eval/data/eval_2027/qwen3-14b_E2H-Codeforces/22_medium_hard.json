After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters, each representing the marks. Oh right, each line is a string of digits, like '223' for a student's marks in three subjects.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (column), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark in that subject equals the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, but how do I process the data? Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, let's parse the input. Let's read n and m. Then read the next n lines as a list of strings. Each string can be converted into a list of integers, perhaps. For example, the first example input is 3 students and 3 subjects. The first student's marks are [2,2,3], second [2,3,2], third [1,1,2].\n\nThen, for each subject (columns 0, 1, 2), find the maximum value. For subject 0, the values are 2, 2, 1. Max is 2. For subject 1: 2,3,1 → max is 3. For subject 2: 3,2,2 → max is 3.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in a subject is equal to the max of that subject. For example, student 1 (marks [2,2,3]) has in subject 0 (max 2) → yes, so he is successful. Also subject 2 (max 3) → yes. So he's successful. Student 2 has [2,3,2]. Subject 0: 2 (max is 2) → yes. So he's successful. Student 3 has [1,1,2]. None of his marks are equal to the max of their respective subjects. So he's not. Hence total is 2, which matches the example.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read the data into a 2D array (list of lists of integers).\n- For each column (subject), compute the maximum value.\n- For each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max of that column. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, read the input. Let's see. The input can be read via stdin. For example, the first line is n and m. Then n lines follow. So in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nOnce we have grades as a list of lists, then we can compute the max for each column.\n\nTo get the max for each column, since columns are from 0 to m-1. For each column j, iterate through all students' j-th element and find the max.\n\nSo, for example, for j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nOnce we have that, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max for that subject.\n\nSo for each student in grades:\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nSo the total count is the answer.\n\nYes. Now, let's think about edge cases. What if all students have the same marks in all subjects? Then each student would have at least one subject where they are the best (since all are same). For example, if all are 5, then for each subject, the max is 5. So every student has all subjects as max. So all are successful. So the answer would be n.\n\nAnother case: if there's only one student, then they are automatically successful, since they are the best in all subjects. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: multiple students have the same max in a subject. For example, two students have 9 in a subject. Then both are considered best in that subject. So each of them would be successful.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngrades becomes [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: max(2,2,1) = 2\n\ncolumn 1: max(2,3,1) =3\n\ncolumn 2: max(3,2,2) =3\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2 (col0) is max, so yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: 3 in column1 is max. So yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: none of his marks are equal to the max. So no. So total is 2.\n\nWhich matches the first sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ngrades:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\ncol0: max(9,1,1) =9\n\ncol1: max(1,1,1) =1\n\ncol2: max(7,8,1) =8\n\ncol3: max(2,2,1) =2\n\ncol4: max(8,8,1) =8\n\nNow, check each student:\n\nstudent 0: in col0, he has 9 which is max. So yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 1: in col2, he has 8 which is max. Also, col4 has 8. So yes.\n\nstudent 2: check for any column. For col1, he has 1 which is max. So yes. So all three are counted. Hence output is 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string, convert into list of integers.\n\nCompute max_per_subject for each column.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max of that column.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nCompute max_per_subject:\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps the first way is better, but for m up to 100 and n up to 100, it's negligible.\n\nOnce that's done, count the successful students.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead input, process, compute max per subject, then check each student.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngrades is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject is [2,3,3]\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2 (col0) is 2, which is max. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: in col1, 3 is max. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: none. So no.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ngrades:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 0 has 9 in col0 → yes.\n\nstudent 1 has 8 in col2 and 8 in col4 → yes.\n\nstudent 2 has 1 in col1 (which is max 1) → yes.\n\nSo all three are counted. Output is 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nEdge case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 followed by 5. Then the student is successful. Output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Both have 5. Then both are successful. Because for the subject, max is 5, and both have it. So output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [1, 2], student 2 has [2, 1]. Max per subject: 2 and 2. So each student has one subject where they are best. So both are successful. Output is 2.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next n lines, each as a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_per_subject for each column.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks equals the max in that column.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That should be the code.\n\nLet me check for the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nAfter reading, grades is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject is [2,3,3]\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2 (col0) is 2 → yes. count becomes 1.\n\nstudent 1: in col0, 2 equals 2 → yes. count becomes 2.\n\nstudent 2: none of the columns. So no. total is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\ngrades is:\n\n[ [9,1,7,2,8], [1,1,8,2,8], [1,1,1,1,1] ]\n\nmax_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 0: 9 in col0 → yes.\n\nstudent 1: 8 in col2 or 8 in col4 → yes.\n\nstudent 2: 1 in col1 (max is 1) → yes.\n\nSo count is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code is written. Now, handle the input correctly. For example, when the input is given as a list of strings, like in the example given in the problem statement. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given via standard input. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook data.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in at least one subject. If so, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as integers for the number of students and subjects, followed by reading each student's marks as a list of integers.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), we compute the maximum mark obtained by any student using a list comprehension.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, we check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful. This is done using a nested loop where we break out of the loop once a successful subject is found for the student.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject and checking each student against these values. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of students and subjects, making it efficient for the given constraints.",
