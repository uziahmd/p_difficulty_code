He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where this count equals m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Let's think about how the count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. Wait, no. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, adding 1 to n would add one more 5. But if it's a multiple of 25, then adding 1 would add two 5s. Wait, no. The count for n=24 is floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 = 4. For n=25, it's 5 + 1 = 6. So when you go from 24 to 25, the count jumps by 2. So between certain numbers, the count can jump by more than 1. That means that for some m values, there are no n's that produce exactly that m. For example, if m is 5, then there's a jump from 24 (count 4) to 25 (count 6). So m=5 would have no solutions. Wait, but in the sample input, m=1 gives 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Let me check that.\n\nWait for m=1: the count for 5! is 1 (since 5/5=1). For 6! it's still 1 (since 6/5=1.2, floor is 1). Similarly for 7,8,9. Then for 10, it's 2 (floor(10/5) + floor(10/25) = 2 + 0 = 2). So the numbers 5-9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero. So the answer for m=1 is 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's such that their trailing zero count is exactly m. Now, how to find these n's?\n\nThe approach I think is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimum n such that the trailing zero count is >=m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. But wait, perhaps there are ranges where the count is exactly m. So maybe we need to find the lower and upper bounds of n where the count is exactly m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For each possible m, the possible n's that generate exactly m trailing zeros must lie in a range. For example, for m=1, the range is from 5 to 9. But for some m, there may be no such n. For example, m=5. So how do we find if there are any n's for a given m?\n\nFirst, I need a function that computes the number of trailing zeros for a given n. Let's call this count_zeros(n).\n\nThen, for a given m, I need to find all n such that count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find those n's efficiently?\n\nLet me think about binary search. Since count_zeros(n) is a non-decreasing function as n increases. So for example, for a given m, there's a range of n's where count_zeros(n) = m. But how to find that range?\n\nBut first, perhaps for a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (like the sample). Wait, why 5? Because when you have a number that's not a multiple of 5, adding 1 to it doesn't increase the count. For example, 5 gives 1, 6 gives 1, etc., until 9. Then 10 gives 2. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) have exactly 1 trailing zero. So that's 5 numbers.\n\nBut how do I find",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values of `n` that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is calculated using the formula: \n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   This sum continues until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given `m`, we use binary search to find the smallest number `n` such that `count_zeros(n) >= m`. We then check if this value of `n` gives exactly `m` trailing zeroes. If not, there are no valid `n` values. If it does, we determine the range of `n` values that produce exactly `m` trailing zeroes.\n\n3. **Finding Valid Range**: Once we find the smallest `n` where `count_zeros(n) == m`, we check subsequent numbers until the count of trailing zeroes increases beyond `m`. This range of numbers will be our solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m  # Upper bound for binary search\n    # Find the smallest n with count_zeros(n) >= m\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    # Now check if count_zeros(left) == m\n    if count_zeros(left) != m:\n        return []\n    # Find the upper bound where count_zeros is still m\n    upper = left\n    while count_zeros(upper) == m:\n        upper += 1\n    return list(range(left, upper))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    if m == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    results = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(results))\n    if len(results) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, results)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by powers of 5 and summing the results.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: The binary search is used to efficiently find the smallest number `n` such that the count of trailing zeroes is at least `m`. This helps narrow down the possible range of values for `n`.\n\n3. **Finding Valid Range**: After identifying the smallest `n` with the required number of trailing zeroes, we extend the range upwards until the count of trailing zeroes exceeds `m`. This gives us all valid values of `n` that meet the condition.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of `n` values using binary search and arithmetic checks, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
