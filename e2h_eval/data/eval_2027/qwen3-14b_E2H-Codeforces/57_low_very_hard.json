His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. \n\nSo, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher has the first and second tour scores for all participants, but not their names. So, we need to consider all possible ways of pairing the first and second tour scores such that there's at least one pair (ai + bj) >= x, and then determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the best possible rank. For that, we want to maximize Vasya's total points. Because if he has the highest possible sum, he can be placed first. However, since the actual pairing is arbitrary, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible. Wait, but how do we model this?\n\nWait, the problem states that Vasya's total is at least x. So, the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x, but the actual value could be higher. However, when considering the best possible rank, we need to imagine that Vasya's actual total is as high as possible. But how does that affect his rank?\n\nActually, the way to find the best possible rank is to assume that Vasya's total is the maximum possible. But since the teacher knows that his total is at least x, but doesn't know exactly, we need to find the scenario where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, which would allow him to be ranked as high as possible.\n\nBut how to model this? Let me think.\n\nThe best possible rank occurs when Vasya's total is as high as possible, and other participants' totals are as low as possible. Wait, no. Wait, the best possible rank for Vasya is when his total is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. But how do we find that?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can consider that Vasya's total is the maximum possible sum (ai + bj) that is >=x. Then, we need to arrange the other participants' sums so that as few as possible people have a sum higher than Vasya's. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by considering that Vasya's total is the maximum possible (so that he can be first). But how to compute that?\n\nWait, the problem allows us to choose any pairing of the first and second tour scores. So, for the best possible case, we need to select a pair (ai, bj) such that ai + bj is as large as possible (but at least x). Then, in that scenario, arrange the rest of the pairs such that as few as possible people have a sum higher than Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, but how do we find that? Because the rest of the pairs would be determined by the way we pair the other elements. But maybe for the best possible rank, we can take Vasya's sum as the maximum possible (so that he's as high as possible), and then count how many people have a sum strictly higher than that. Then, the best possible rank is that count + 1.\n\nWait, but how do we find that maximum possible sum for Vasya? Well, since the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x, but he could have a higher sum. So for the best possible scenario, we can take the maximum possible sum (ai + bj) that is >=x, and then find how many people can have a sum higher than that. Wait, but how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the best possible rank, we can take Vasya's sum as the maximum possible (ai + bj), and then count how many other pairs (from the remaining a's and b's) can have a sum greater than or equal to that. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nFor the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's sum. So, we can choose the maximum possible sum that is >=x. Let's say that sum is S. Then, the best possible rank is the number of participants whose sum (in some pairing) is strictly greater than S plus 1. But how to find the minimal number of people that can have a sum higher than S?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the best possible rank for Vasya is when he has the highest possible sum. So, if we can pair Vasya's a and b such that his sum is the maximum possible (say, S), then the number of people who can have a sum higher than S is zero. Therefore, his rank is 1. But that's only if there's no other participant who can have a sum higher than S. But how do we ensure",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points across two tours. The solution involves efficiently calculating the maximum and minimum possible ranks by considering all possible pairings of scores from the two tours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: \n   - To find the best possible rank, we consider the scenario where Vasya's total score is maximized. This is done by pairing the highest scores from the first tour with the highest scores from the second tour.\n   - We use a greedy approach to sort both the first and second tour scores in descending order and then compute the maximum possible sum for Vasya. The number of participants who can have a higher sum than this maximum is determined, which gives the best possible rank.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**:\n   - For the worst possible rank, we consider the scenario where Vasya's total score is minimized (but still at least x). This is done by pairing the lowest scores from the first tour with the lowest scores from the second tour.\n   - Similarly, we sort both the first and second tour scores in ascending order and compute the minimum possible sum for Vasya. The number of participants who can have a higher sum than this minimum is determined, which gives the worst possible rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    n, x = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Best possible place\n    a_sorted_desc = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n    b_sorted_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    max_vasya = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a_sorted_desc[i] + b_sorted_desc[i] >= x:\n            max_vasya = a_sorted_desc[i] + b_sorted_desc[i]\n            break\n    \n    # Count how many pairs can have sum > max_vasya\n    # We need to find the number of pairs (ai, bj) such that ai + bj > max_vasya\n    # To find the minimal count, we can use two pointers approach\n    # Sort a in ascending and b in descending\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    count_higher = 0\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a_asc[i] + b_desc[j] > max_vasya:\n            count_higher += 1\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    best_place = count_higher + 1\n    \n    # Worst possible place\n    a_sorted_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted_asc = sorted(b)\n    min_vasya = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a_sorted_asc[i] + b_sorted_asc[i] >= x:\n            min_vasya = a_sorted_asc[i] + b_sorted_asc[i]\n            break\n    \n    # Count how many pairs can have sum >= min_vasya\n    # To maximize the count, we want as many as possible\n    # So we use two pointers approach again\n    a_desc = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n    b_asc = sorted(b)\n    count_lower = 0\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a_desc[i] + b_asc[j] >= min_vasya:\n            count_lower += 1\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    worst_place = count_lower + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Possible Rank**: By sorting both tours' scores in descending order and pairing them, we ensure Vasya's maximum possible score. Using a two-pointer technique, we count how many participants can have a higher score than this maximum, giving the best rank.\n- **Worst Possible Rank**: By sorting both tours' scores in ascending order and pairing them, we ensure Vasya's minimum possible score (still meeting the threshold x). Using a similar two-pointer technique, we count how many participants can have a higher score than this minimum, giving the worst rank.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation using sorting and two-pointer techniques, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints.",
