Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that we have an undirected graph with given flows on each edge, and we need to assign directions to these edges such that the flow is a valid maximum flow. The conditions are that for every vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the incoming flow equals outgoing flow. Also, the source has no incoming edges, and the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nHmm. So the main challenge is to find a direction for each edge that satisfies these constraints. Let's think about what these constraints imply.\n\nFirst, the flow conservation for intermediate nodes. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows entering equals the sum leaving. That's standard for flow networks. But since the graph is undirected and we're assigning directions, how do we model this?\n\nWait, but the given ci's are already the flow values. So the problem isn't about computing the maximum flow, but rather assigning directions to edges so that the flow is valid and the graph is acyclic. Oh right, because the original algorithm computed the flow volumes but not the direction.\n\nSo the problem reduces to directing the edges in such a way that:\n\n- The flow is a valid flow (conservation at internal nodes, source has no incoming, sink has no outgoing? Or maybe the sink can have outgoing, but the total flow from source to sink is maximized? Wait, the problem says the resulting flow should be a correct maximum flow. So the direction assignment must correspond to a maximum flow.\n\nBut perhaps the way to approach this is to model the flow as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds, and the graph is acyclic. Also, the source (node 1) must have all edges directed away from it, and the sink (node n) must have all edges directed towards it? Not sure about that. Wait, the problem says that the source has no incoming edges. So all edges incident to the source must be directed away from it. Similarly, for the sink, perhaps the edges can be directed towards or away, but the flow must satisfy that the total outflow from source is equal to the inflow into sink.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows entering equals the sum of flows leaving. Which implies that the net flow (outflow minus inflow) is zero. For the source, the net outflow is equal to the total flow (since no incoming edges). For the sink, the net inflow is equal to the total flow.\n\nBut how do I assign directions to edges to satisfy this?\n\nAnother thought: Since the graph is connected, and the solution exists, perhaps we can model this as building a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the flow conservation holds. How can we construct such a DAG?\n\nOne idea is to perform a topological sort. Because if the graph is acyclic, then there's a topological order. In such an order, all edges go from earlier nodes to later ones. Then, for each node except the source and sink, the sum of flows from incoming edges (which would be those edges pointing to it from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows going out (edges pointing to later nodes).\n\nWait, but how does that help us assign directions? Maybe we can arrange the nodes in a topological order, and for each edge, direct it from the node that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. However, how to choose the order such that flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of finding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each edge is directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds. How can we model this?\n\nAnother angle: The problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles. So perhaps we can model this as a DAG with a topological order. Let's imagine that we have a topological order where node 1 comes first, and node n comes last. Then, all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later ones. In this case, the graph is acyclic. Now, for each node except 1 and n, the sum of the flows on edges coming into it (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows going out (to later nodes). How can we compute this?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For a node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges going into v (from earlier nodes in the order) must equal the sum of flows on edges going out of v (to later nodes in the order). But how do we ensure that?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model the flow as a directed graph with a certain structure. Let's consider that for each node, the net outflow is equal to the total flow from the source minus the flow that's been accounted for up to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph forms a valid maximum flow with no cycles. The key constraints are ensuring flow conservation at intermediate nodes, the source (node 1) has no incoming edges, and the sink (node n) has no outgoing edges. Additionally, the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Topological Ordering**: We use a topological sort to ensure the directed graph is acyclic. Nodes are ordered such that all edges point from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order.\n2. **Flow Conservation**: For each node (except the source and sink), the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows. This is achieved by maintaining a balance of flows using a priority queue (min-heap) to manage nodes based on their current flow balance.\n3. **Direction Assignment**: As we process nodes in topological order, we direct edges from the current node to its neighbors, adjusting the flow balance accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    edges = []\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        graph[a].append((b, i))\n        graph[b].append((a, i))\n    \n    # Build adjacency list with edge indices\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = edges[i]\n        adj[a].append((b, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, i))\n    \n    # Compute in-degree for topological sort\n    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for u in range(1, n + 1):\n        for v, _ in adj[u]:\n            in_degree[v] += 1\n    \n    # Initialize the priority queue with node 1\n    heap = []\n    heapq.heappush(heap, 1)\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    top_order = []\n    \n    while heap:\n        u = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if visited[u]:\n            continue\n        visited[u] = True\n        top_order.append(u)\n        for v, _ in adj[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                in_degree[v] -= 1\n                if in_degree[v] == 0:\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, v)\n    \n    # Now, build the direction array\n    direction = [0] * m\n    \n    # Compute balance for each node\n    balance = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for u in range(1, n + 1):\n        for v, idx_edge in adj[u]:\n            if u < v:\n                balance[u] -= edges[idx_edge][2]\n                balance[v] += edges[idx_edge][2]\n            elif u > v:\n                balance[u] += edges[idx_edge][2]\n                balance[v] -= edges[idx_edge][2]\n    \n    # Adjust balance for source and sink\n    balance[1] = -balance[1]\n    balance[n] = -balance[n]\n    \n    # Use a priority queue to process nodes with zero balance first\n    pq = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i != 1 and i != n:\n            if balance[i] == 0:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, i)\n    \n    # Process nodes in topological order\n    processed = [False] * (n + 1)\n    for u in top_order:\n        if u == 1 or u == n:\n            continue\n        if processed[u]:\n            continue\n        while True:\n            if balance[u] == 0:\n                processed[u] = True\n                break\n            found = False\n            for v, idx_edge in adj[u]:\n                if processed[v]:\n                    continue\n                if balance[u] > 0:\n                    if balance[v] < 0:\n                        if u < v:\n                            direction[idx_edge] = 1\n                            balance[u] -= edges[idx_edge][2]\n                            balance[v] += edges[idx_edge][2]\n                        else:\n                            direction[idx_edge] = 0\n                            balance[u] -= edges[idx_edge][2]\n                            balance[v] += edges[idx_edge][2]\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                else:\n                    if balance[v] > 0:\n                        if u < v:\n                            direction[idx_edge] = 0\n                            balance[u] += edges[idx_edge][2]\n                            balance[v] -= edges[idx_edge][2]\n                        else:\n                            direction[idx_edge] = 1\n                            balance[u] += edges[idx_edge][2]\n                            balance[v] -= edges[idx_edge][2]\n                        found = True\n                        break\n            if not found:\n                break\n    \n    # Handle edges connected to source and sink\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = edges[i]\n        if a == 1:\n            direction[i] = 0\n        elif b == 1:\n            direction[i] = 1\n        elif a == n:\n            direction[i] = 1\n        elif b == n:\n            direction[i] = 0\n        else:\n            pass  # already handled\n    \n    # Output the directions\n    for d in direction:\n        print(d)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Topological Sort**: We use a priority queue (min-heap) to perform a topological sort starting from node 1, ensuring we process nodes in an order that respects dependencies.\n2. **Balance Calculation**: For each node, we calculate the initial balance of flows.
