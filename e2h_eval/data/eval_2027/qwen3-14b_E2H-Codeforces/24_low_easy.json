She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem says that each second she can move left or right, or close tabs on one side. So, the goal is to figure out the optimal steps to do this as quickly as possible.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial setup. The current position is 'pos', and the tabs that need to stay are from l to r. So, any tabs outside this range need to be closed. But how do we do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. For example, if the current position is already within [l, r], maybe we can just close the tabs on the left and right. But maybe there's a more optimal way depending on where the cursor is.\n\nWait, the closing operations can be done only when the cursor is at a certain position. For example, to close all tabs to the left, you have to be at the leftmost tab (or maybe not? Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that when the cursor is at tab i, she can close all tabs to the left (from a to i-1) or to the right (i+1 to b). But a and b are the current min and max of unclosed tabs. So, when you close tabs, the a and b change accordingly. But perhaps the key here is that to close all tabs to the left of the current segment, you need to be at the left end of the target segment. Or maybe not. Let's think.\n\nSuppose the target is [l, r]. So, all tabs to the left of l must be closed. How can we do that? Well, perhaps we can first move the cursor to l, then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, for tabs to the right of r, move to r and close all to the right. But maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already in the [l, r] range? Then, perhaps we can just close left and right as needed. However, the steps required depend on where the cursor is.\n\nLet me consider the example given:\n\nIn the first example input: 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The target is tabs 2,3,4. So the tabs to close are 1,5,6. How does the sample solution work?\n\nThey moved to tab 2 (from 3, which takes 1 second), then close left (which closes tab 1). Then move to 3 (but maybe that's already done?), then move to 4 (taking 1 second?), then close right (closing 5 and 6). But how many steps?\n\nWait the sample says total of 5 seconds. Let me check the steps:\n\nOriginal pos is 3. Let's see:\n\nStep 1: move left to 2 (1 sec). Then close left (tabs [a, i-1] where a is 1 (since all tabs are open initially), so closing tabs 1. That's 1 sec. Now, the remaining tabs are 2,3,4,5,6. But a is now 2, b is 6. Then, the cursor is at 2. Now, she needs to close tabs to the right of 4. So she needs to get to 4. From 2, moving to 3 (1 sec), then to 4 (another sec). Then, close right (tabs 5 and 6). That's another second. So total steps: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) = 5 seconds. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the idea is that to close the left part, you need to be at l, and then close left. Similarly, to close the right part, you need to be at r, then close right. But how do you get there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to close both sides with fewer steps. For example, if the current position is already in the target range, maybe you can close left and right in some way.\n\nBut let's think about the general case. The problem requires that after closing, only l to r are left. So, the steps needed are:\n\n- Close all tabs to the left of l. So, the cursor must be at l, then close left. Or maybe if the cursor is at l, then closing left would close all tabs before l. Similarly for closing right.\n\nBut how do we reach l and r?\n\nSo, the steps can be broken into:\n\n1. Move the cursor to l (if necessary) and close all tabs to the left. This takes (distance from current pos to l",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The operations allowed include moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Target Positions**: The target segment is [l, r]. Tabs outside this range need to be closed.\n2. **Determine Movement Requirements**:\n   - If the current position `pos` is already within the target segment [l, r], no movement is needed to close tabs within the segment.\n   - If `pos` is to the left of l, move the cursor to l and then close all tabs to the left.\n   - If `pos` is to the right of r, move the cursor to r and then close all tabs to the right.\n3. **Calculate Moves**:\n   - Calculate the distance from the current position `pos` to the nearest end of the target segment (either l or r).\n   - Add 1 second for the closing operation once the cursor is at the correct position.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the current position is already within the target range\nif l <= pos <= r:\n    # No need to move, just check if there are tabs to close on either side\n    # But since we need to close tabs outside [l, r], we need to check if we need to close left or right\n    # However, the optimal way is to close left and right if needed, but since the cursor is inside, it's possible to do so\n    # However, the steps required depend on whether we need to close left or right.\n    # But according to the problem, the minimal steps would be:\n    # If we need to close left (i.e., l > 1), then we need to move to l and close left.\n    # Similarly for the right.\n    # Wait, no. Because if the current pos is within [l, r], then to close tabs to the left of l, you need to move to l and close left. Similarly for right.\n    # So the steps would be:\n    # For left: if l > 1, then move to l (distance is (pos - l) if pos >= l? No, wait pos is in [l, r]. So to reach l from pos, it's (pos - l) steps to the left.\n    # Then close left: 1 sec.\n    # Similarly for right: if r < n, then move to r from pos (r - pos steps) and close right: 1 sec.\n    # However, maybe there's a better way. For example, if we can close both sides from the current position.\n    # But no, because to close left, you have to be at l. To close right, you have to be at r.\n    # So, the total steps would be:\n    steps = 0\n    # Check if need to close left (i.e., l > 1)\n    if l > 1:\n        steps += (pos - l) + 1  # move to l and close left\n    # Check if need to close right (i.e., r < n)\n    if r < n:\n        steps += (r - pos) + 1  # move to r and close right\n    print(steps)\nelse:\n    # If pos is to the left of l\n    if pos < l:\n        # Need to move to l, then close left\n        steps = (l - pos) + 1\n        # After closing left, the remaining tabs are from l to r, but need to check if need to close right\n        if r < n:\n            steps += (r - l) + 1  # move from l to r and close right\n        print(steps)\n    else:  # pos is to the right of r\n        # Need to move to r, then close right\n        steps = (pos - r) + 1\n        # After closing right, check if need to close left\n        if l > 1:\n            steps += (r - l) + 1  # move from r to l and close left\n        print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Within Target Segment**: If the cursor is already within [l, r], calculate the steps needed to move to the leftmost (l) and rightmost (r) positions of the target segment and close the tabs outside the segment.\n- **Outside Target Segment**: If the cursor is outside the target segment, move to the nearest end of the target segment (either l or r), close the tabs on the outside, and then move to the other end to close the remaining tabs on the opposite side.\n\nThis approach ensures that the minimum number of moves and closes are performed efficiently, considering both movement and closing operations.",
