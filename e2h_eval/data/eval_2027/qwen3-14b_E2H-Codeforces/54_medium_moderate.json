Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Mister B wants to find three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a regular polygon, the measure of each internal angle can be calculated. But wait, the problem isn't directly about the internal angles. Instead, it's about choosing three vertices where the angle at v2 is formed by two sides that connect to v1 and v3. So, for example, in a regular polygon, if we pick three consecutive vertices, like 1, 2, 3, then the angle at 2 would be the internal angle of the polygon. But maybe other configurations give different angles.\n\nLet me think about the formula for the angle formed by three vertices. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's consider vertex v2. The angle at v2 depends on how many steps away v1 and v3 are from v2 along the perimeter. For instance, if v1 is k steps away clockwise from v2, and v3 is k steps counter-clockwise (or vice versa), then the angle formed would be determined by that k.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle depends on the number of sides between the points. Let me think about the central angles. In a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. For example, in a square (n=4), each central angle is 90 degrees.\n\nNow, when considering an angle formed at a vertex v2 with v1 and v3, the angle depends on the arc lengths between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. But since the polygon is regular, maybe there's a formula for the angle at v2 based on the number of edges between v1 and v2 and between v3 and v2.\n\nAlternatively, think of the regular polygon inscribed in a unit circle. The angle at v2 can be calculated using some geometric formulas.\n\nLet me try to derive the formula. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's pick vertex v2 as the center of the polygon (but no, the polygon is regular, so all vertices are on the circumference). Let me consider three vertices v1, v2, v3. The angle at v2 is formed by the lines v2v1 and v2v3.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the angle is formed such that v2 is the vertex, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides. So the angle is the angle between the two lines from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\nBut how do we calculate this angle? Let me think in terms of the number of steps between the vertices. For example, suppose between v2 and v1 there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are m steps counter-clockwise. Then the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter would be k + m. However, since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon. For example, if you fix v2, and consider the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, no. Because the angle at v2 is formed by two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The angle between those two lines depends on the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Because in a circle, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference. Wait, maybe that's the key here.\n\nLet me recall that theorem. The central angle is twice the inscribed angle. So if there's an arc between two points, then the angle subtended at the center is twice that subtended at any point on the circumference.\n\nBut in our case, the angle is at v2, which is one of the polygon's vertices. Let me think: suppose between v1 and v3, there are k edges along the perimeter. Then the arc between v1 and v3 (the shorter arc) corresponds to k * (360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 (assuming that v2 is on the circumference) would be half of that arc's central angle? Or maybe not. Wait, if the arc between v1 and v3 is k steps, then the central angle is (k * 360)/n degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of that if v2 is on the circumference of the circle. Wait, but that's only true if v2 is on the opposite side of the arc. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the triangle formed by v1, v2, v3. Since the polygon is regular, all the vertices lie on a circle. So, the triangle v1-v2-v3 is inscribed in that circle. The angle at v2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Let me denote that arc length as k steps. Then the central angle for that arc is (k * 360)/n degrees. The angle at v2 is half of that. Wait, no. Because if the arc is between v1 and v3, then the angle subtended at the center is theta = (k * 360)/n. The angle subtended at any point on the circumference on the opposite arc would be theta/2. But if the point is on the same arc, then it's something else. Wait, I think I need to clarify this.\n\nSuppose there's a circle with points A and B. The central angle between A and B is θ. Then, any point C on the circumference of the circle that is not on the arc AB will form an angle ACB equal to θ/2. If C is on the arc AB, then the angle ACB is (360 - θ)/2. Wait, maybe that's the case.\n\nBut in our scenario, the points v1, v2, v3 are all on the circumference of the circle. The angle at v2 is formed by v1 and v3. So, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 is the arc that is opposite to v2. Let me assume that the arc length between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is k steps. Then, the central angle for that arc is (k * 360)/n degrees. The angle at v2 is half of that, because according to the inscribed angle theorem. So the angle at v2 is (k * 360/(2n)) degrees. Which simplifies to (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nWait, but what if the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't pass through v2 is k steps. But since the polygon is regular, the number of steps between v1 and v3 can be determined by their positions. However, since the polygon is convex and regular, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be less than n-1 steps. Wait, but for the angle to be formed, the points v1 and v3 must be on different sides of v2. So for example, if v2 is fixed, then v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is k steps counter-clockwise from v2. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 is 2k steps. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose n=5 (a regular pentagon). Let's fix v2 as vertex 2. Suppose v1 is vertex 1 (adjacent to v2), and v3 is vertex 3 (also adjacent to v2). Then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 is 3 steps (from v1 to v2 to v3 is 2 steps, but the other arc would be 5-2=3 steps). Wait, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't pass through v2 would be the longer arc. But in that case, the angle at v2 would be based on the arc that does not include v2. So, in this case, the arc length is 3 steps. The central angle is 3*(360/5) = 216 degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of that, 108 degrees. But what is the actual angle in the pentagon?\n\nIn a regular pentagon, each internal angle is 108 degrees. But that's the internal angle of the polygon. However, if we take three consecutive vertices, like 1,2,3, then the angle at 2 is the internal angle of the polygon, which is 108 degrees. Which matches with the calculation above. So the formula seems to hold here.\n\nAnother example: in a square (n=4). Let's take v1=1, v2=2, v3=3. The arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is 2 steps (from 1 to 4 to 3). Central angle is 2*90=180 degrees. The angle at v2 would be 90 degrees. Which is indeed the internal angle of the square. Now, if I take v1=1, v2=2, v3=4. Then the arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is 1 step (from 1 to 4). Central angle is 90 degrees. The angle at v2 would be 45 degrees. Which matches with the example given in the problem statement. For example, in the second sample input (4 67), the closest angle is 45 degrees.\n\nSo this formula seems to work. Therefore, the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not include v2. But how to determine k?\n\nWait, the k here is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not include v2. But since the polygon is regular, the minimal arc between v1 and v3 is either k or n -k steps. However, in our case, the arc that does not include v2 must be the one that's longer than the minimal arc. Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIf v1 and v3 are such that the arc between them that does not contain v2 is k steps, then the angle is (k * 180)/n. However, since the polygon is regular, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 can be determined based on their positions.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's imagine that for any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in one direction. Wait, perhaps for the angle to be formed, the points v1 and v3 must be on opposite sides of v2. So, if we fix v2, then v1 is m steps away in one direction (say, clockwise), and v3 is l steps away in the other direction (counter-clockwise). Then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 would be (m + l) steps. But since the total number of steps around the polygon is n, the arc that contains v2 would be n - (m + l) steps. However, since the arc that does not contain v2 is the one that's used in the formula, we need m + l steps.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, for the angle at v2, the value of k is m + l. However, since the polygon has n vertices, the maximum possible value for k is n-2 (if v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other, but not including v2). Wait, no. For example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 (m=1), and v3 is adjacent to v2 (l=1), then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is n-2 steps. Because the arc that contains v2 is 2 steps (from v1 to v2 to v3), and the other arc is n-2 steps. So the angle would be ((n-2)*180)/n.\n\nBut in the case of a square (n=4), if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 (like in the square's case, 1,2,3), then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 2 steps (since n-2=2). So the angle is (2*180)/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: in the square, if v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4. Then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step (from 1 to 4). So k=1, angle is (1*180)/4 = 45 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to be that the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not include v2. And since the arc that does not include v2 is the longer arc if m + l is more than n/2, but regardless, the formula holds.\n\nBut how do we find k for a given configuration of vertices? Well, for any three distinct vertices, if we fix v2, then the other two vertices must be on different sides of v2. So for example, if we fix v2 as vertex 2, then v1 could be vertex 1 (1 step clockwise from v2) and v3 could be vertex 3 (1 step counter-clockwise from v2). Then k is 1 + 1 = 2 steps (arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 2 steps, which is the same as the arc that contains v2? No, in this case, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 would be the longer arc. Wait, in a square, between 1 and 3, the arc that doesn't contain 2 is the arc from 1 to 4 to 3, which is 2 steps. Which is the same as the arc that contains 2 (steps 1-2-3 is 2 steps). Wait, but in that case, the arc that does not contain v2 would be the same length as the arc that contains v2. How can that be?\n\nAh, no. Because for a square, between 1 and 3, there are two arcs: one of length 2 steps (1-2-3) and another of length 2 steps (1-4-3). So the arc that does not contain v2 (vertex 2) is the 1-4-3 arc. Which is also 2 steps. So k is 2 steps, leading to angle (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees, which is correct. But in this case, the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. Which is the internal angle of the square. But when v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, then the arc between them not containing v2 is 1 step (1-4), leading to angle (1*180)/4 = 45 degrees.\n\nSo, the formula for the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. But how to compute k given the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2?\n\nAlternatively, for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in one direction. Wait, but perhaps there's a simpler way. Let's think that for a given v2, the possible angles are determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3. Let me imagine that for a fixed v2, I can choose v1 and v3 such that they are k steps away from each other in the arc that does not contain v2. But how to find k?\n\nAlternatively, think that for a fixed v2, the angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3. For example, if between v1 and v3 there are m edges along the arc that does not contain v2, then the angle is (m * 180)/n. But how to find m?\n\nBut perhaps the key is to realize that for a fixed v2, the possible angles are determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3. For example, if we fix v2, then the minimal number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is 1 (when v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other, but not through v2). The maximal is (n-2) steps (when v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other through the other arc).\n\nWait, but for a fixed v2, the possible values of m (the steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2) can range from 1 to (n-2). Because if m is 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 step, which means that they are adjacent. But since the arc does not contain v2, that implies that v2 is on the other arc. For example, if the polygon is a square (n=4), and v2 is vertex 2, then v1 could be vertex 1, and v3 could be vertex 4. Then the arc between them (1-4) is 1 step, and the arc that contains v2 is 2 steps (1-2-3-4 is not, but the arc between 1 and 4 that contains v2 is 1-2-3-4, which is 3 steps? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a fixed v2, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is equal to the number of steps between them in the polygon minus 2 times the number of steps between v1 and v2 or something. Maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight is that for a given n, the possible angles that can be formed at a vertex v2 are of the form (k * 180)/n, where k ranges from 1 to (n-2). Because for each k, there exists a configuration where the angle is exactly (k * 180)/n. For example, when k=1, the angle is 180/n degrees. When k=2, 360/n degrees, etc., up to k = n-2, which gives (n-2)*180/n degrees.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the square (n=4). The possible k values are 1, 2, 3. For k=1: angle is 180/4 = 45 degrees. For k=2: 360/4=90 degrees. For k=3: 540/4=135 degrees. But in the square, the angle at v2 can't be 135 degrees. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's take the square. Let's say v2 is vertex 2. Suppose v1 is vertex 1, and v3 is vertex 3. The arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is 2 steps (since the arc that contains v2 is 2 steps (1-2-3), the other arc is 4-1-4-3? No, the square has 4 vertices. The arc between 1 and 3 that doesn't contain 2 is the arc 1-4-3, which is 2 steps. So k=2 steps, leading to angle 2*180/4=90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nIf we want to get k=3 steps, then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 must be 3 steps. How can that happen? For example, take v1 as 1, v2 as 2, v3 as 4. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1-4, which is 1 step. But if I take v1 as 1 and v3 as 2? No, because v3 can't be v2. Or maybe v1 is 1 and v3 is 4. Wait, that gives k=1 step. How to get k=3?\n\nHmm. Maybe for n=4, the maximum k is 2. Because the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 can't be longer than n-2 steps. Wait, n-2 for n=4 is 2. So why is there a k=3 in the earlier thought?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake here. Because for a given pair of points v1 and v3, the arc between them that does not contain v2 can be of varying lengths. However, for the formula to work, the k must be the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. So for that to be possible, the arc that does not contain v2 must be the longer arc between v1 and v3. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, for any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. This arc can be computed as follows:\n\nLet me imagine that the polygon is arranged in a circle. Let me define the positions of the vertices as numbers from 1 to n in clockwise order. Suppose that v2 is fixed. Let's say that between v2 and v1, there are x steps clockwise. Between v2 and v3, there are y steps counter-clockwise. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is (x + y) steps. Because moving from v1 clockwise x steps gets to v2, then moving counter-clockwise y steps from v2 gets to v3. So the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 is the path that goes from v1 clockwise around the polygon, skipping v2, then to v3. Or maybe the other way around. But regardless, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is (x + y) steps. However, since the total number of steps around the polygon is n, the other arc (which contains v2) would be n - (x + y) steps.\n\nBut for the angle at v2, the formula uses the arc that does not contain v2. So the value of k is (x + y) steps. However, since x and y are positive integers (as v1 and v3 are distinct from v2), then x + y can range from 2 to ... ?\n\nFor example, if x is 1 (v1 is adjacent to v2 clockwise), and y is 1 (v3 is adjacent to v2 counter-clockwise), then x + y = 2 steps. Which gives the angle of (2 * 180)/n degrees. Which for n=4 is 90 degrees, which is correct.\n\nIf x is 1 and y is 2 steps, then x + y = 3 steps. Which would be for v1 adjacent to v2, and v3 two steps counter-clockwise from v2. For example, in a pentagon (n=5), v2 is 2, v1 is 1, v3 is 4 (since counter-clockwise from 2 is 1, then 5, then 4). The arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 3 steps (from 1 to 5 to 4?), which would be 3 steps. The angle would be 3*180/5 = 108 degrees. Which is possible.\n\nSo in general, for a fixed v2, the possible values of k (the steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2) can be any integer from 2 to n-2? Wait, no. Because x and y are at least 1 (since v1 and v3 are distinct from v2), so x + y is at least 2. But the maximum possible x + y is (n-1) + 1 = n, but since the arc that contains v2 is n - (x + y) steps. But since the arc that contains v2 must be at least 1 step (since v1 and v3 are distinct from v2), then x + y can be up to n-1 steps. Wait, but then if x + y = n-1, then the arc that contains v2 is 1 step. Which is possible. But how?\n\nLet me take n=5, v2 is 2. Suppose v1 is 1 (x=1), and v3 is 5 (y=1). Then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 (from 1 to 5) steps? Or is it 4 steps? Wait, the arc that does not contain v2 would be the longer arc. Because between 1 and 5, the arc that contains v2 is 1-2-3-4-5 (which is 4 steps?), but the arc that does not contain v2 is 1-5 (1 step). Wait, but that's the shorter arc. So in this case, the formula would use k=1 steps, but the arc that contains v2 is 4 steps. But according to the previous reasoning, the formula uses the arc that does not contain v2. But in this case, the arc that does not contain v2 is the shorter arc. So why is the formula using that?\n\nThis suggests that my earlier reasoning was incorrect. Because in this case, the angle at v2 would be (k * 180)/n where k is 1 step. Which would be 36 degrees. But what's the actual angle?\n\nLet's think. In a regular pentagon, the internal angle is 108 degrees. But if we take v1=1, v2=2, v3=5. Then the angle at v2 is formed by the lines from 2 to 1 and 2 to 5. What is that angle?\n\nWell, the central angle between 1 and 5 is 4 * (360/5) = 288 degrees (since there are 4 steps between 1 and 5). But the angle at v2 would be half of that? No, because according to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle at v2 would be half of the central angle of the arc that does not contain v2. Wait, if the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step (central angle 72 degrees), then the angle at v2 is 36 degrees. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me rederive it.\n\nThe angle at v2 is the angle between two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. The measure of this angle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, I think that's the correct formula. The angle formed by two chords in a circle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.\n\nSo, in this case, the angle at v2 intercepts two arcs: the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2, and the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2. The angle is equal to half the difference between these two arcs.\n\nLet me denote the arc that contains v2 as A, and the arc that does not contain v2 as B. Then the angle at v2 is (A - B)/2.\n\nBut since A + B = 360 degrees (the entire circle), substituting gives (A - (360 - A))/2 = (2A - 360)/2 = A - 180 degrees.\n\nBut this seems problematic. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula for the angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference is half the measure of the intercepted arc. But when the two chords are from the same point, like v2, then the angle is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to the angle.\n\nWait, maybe I should refer to the formula for the angle between two chords meeting at a point on the circumference. The measure of the angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, in this case, the angle at v2 is formed by two chords, and intercepts the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Therefore, the angle is half the measure of that arc.\n\nAh! That makes sense. So earlier, I had the formula wrong. The angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. So the formula is:\n\nangle = (arc_measure / 2)\n\nwhere arc_measure is the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nSince the arc_measure is (k * 360)/n degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc.\n\nSo the angle becomes (k * 360 / n ) / 2 = (k * 180)/n degrees. Which matches the earlier formula. So the formula is correct.\n\nBut in the case where the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the shorter arc (like the 1 step arc in the pentagon example), then the angle is (1 * 180)/5 = 36 degrees. Which would be the case.\n\nBut how can that be? Let me imagine the pentagon. If v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 5. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc from 1 to 5 (which is 1 step), which has a measure of 72 degrees (since each step is 72 degrees for n=5). The angle at v2 is 72/2 = 36 degrees. Which seems small, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nSo the key is that for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. And that number of steps can be from 1 to (n-2) steps. Because the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 can't be longer than n-2 steps. For example, if the arc has n-1 steps, then the arc that contains v2 has 1 step, which would imply that v1 and v3 are adjacent, but that would make the arc that does not contain v2 have n-1 steps. But that's possible.\n\nWait, let's take n=5 again. Suppose v1 is 1, v3 is 2. Then the arc between them that does not contain v2 (assuming v2 is 3?) Wait, no, I need to fix v2. Let me choose v2 as 3. Then v1 is 1, v3 is 2. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 (3) is the arc from 1 to 2, which is 1 step. The arc that contains v2 is from 1 to 2 via 3, which is 3 steps (1-5-4-3-2? No, n=5. From 1 to 2 via 3 would be 1-5-4-3-2, which is 4 steps. So the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step. So the angle at v2 (3) is (1 * 180)/5 = 36 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nBut if v1 is 1 and v3 is 5, and v2 is 3. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is from 1 to 5, which is 4 steps (since the other arc would be 1-2-3-4-5, which contains v2). The arc measure is 4 * 72 = 288 degrees. The angle at v2 is 288/2 = 144 degrees. Which would be (4 * 180)/5 = 144 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula holds. Thus, for any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. And k can range from 1 to n-2 steps.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding the value of k (between 1 and n-2) such that (k * 180)/n is as close as possible to the given angle a. Once we find the optimal k, we can choose any three vertices that form this k.\n\nBut how do we find the optimal k?\n\nLet me think. We need to find k in [1, n-2] such that |(k * 180)/n - a| is minimized. Once we find the best k, we can construct any triple of vertices that corresponds to this k.\n\nSo first, compute for each possible k, the value of the angle. Then find the k that gives the minimum difference with a.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e5, iterating through all possible k's may be feasible, but perhaps we can compute the optimal k analytically.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. We want to find k such that (k * 180)/n ≈ a → k ≈ (a * n)/180.\n\nBut since k must be an integer between 1 and n-2, the optimal k is the integer closest to (a * n)/180. However, there may be multiple k's that are equally close, so we need to check the floor and ceiling of this value.\n\nBut wait, the angle is (k * 180)/n. Let me denote target_angle = a. We need to find k such that (k * 180)/n is as close as possible to target_angle.\n\nLet me compute the ideal k as k_ideal = (target_angle * n) / 180. Since k must be an integer, we can take the floor and ceil of this value, and check which one is better.\n\nBut also, we need to ensure that k is within [1, n-2]. For example, if the ideal k is larger than n-2, we take k = n-2. Similarly, if it's less than 1, take 1.\n\nOnce we find the best k, then we can choose any three vertices that correspond to this k.\n\nNow, the next question is: how to choose the three vertices once k is known.\n\nLet's assume that we have selected k. Now, we need to choose three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 has k steps.\n\nHow to choose such vertices? Well, the simplest way is to fix v2 as any vertex (say, vertex 1), and then select v1 and v3 such that they are positioned k steps apart along the arc that doesn't contain v2.\n\nFor example, let's choose v2 as vertex 1. Then, we can choose v1 as vertex 2 (adjacent to v2), and v3 as vertex (2 + k) mod n? Wait, no. Wait, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be k steps. So, if v2 is fixed, then v1 and v3 must be on opposite sides of v2, such that between them along the arc that doesn't include v2 is k steps.\n\nAn easy way to construct this is to take v2 as vertex 1. Then, v1 is vertex 2 (one step clockwise from v2), and v3 is vertex (2 + k) steps away from v2 in the counter-clockwise direction? Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed v2, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is k steps. To achieve this, v1 can be one step clockwise from v2, and v3 can be (k + 1) steps counter-clockwise from v2. Because then, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 would be (k + 1 - 1) steps? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, imagine that between v2 and v1 there is 1 step clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there is m steps counter-clockwise. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is (1 + m) steps. We want this to be equal to k. So m = k - 1. Therefore, for a given k, m = k-1 steps counter-clockwise from v2.\n\nSo, for example, if v2 is vertex 1, then v1 is vertex 2 (clockwise), and v3 is vertex (1 - (k-1)) mod n? Or perhaps, since the counter-clockwise direction is the other way, perhaps v3 is vertex (1 + (n - (k-1))) mod n? Wait, maybe",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The approach involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently determining the optimal configuration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices can be determined based on the number of steps between those vertices along the arc that does not contain the vertex where the angle is formed. This angle can be calculated using the formula: $ \\text{angle} = \\frac{k \\times 180}{n} $, where `k` is the number of steps between the two vertices along the arc.\n\n2. **Optimal k Calculation**: We need to find the value of `k` that minimizes the absolute difference between the calculated angle and the target angle `a`. This value of `k` can be derived from the formula $ k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a \\times n}{180} \\right\\rfloor $ and its neighboring integers.\n\n3. **Vertex Selection**: Once the optimal `k` is determined, we can construct the vertices. For simplicity, we fix one vertex (say, vertex 1) and determine the other two vertices such that they are positioned `k` steps apart along the arc that does not contain the fixed vertex.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Calculate the ideal k\n    ideal_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n    k_candidates = []\n    for k in [int(ideal_k - 1), int(ideal_k), int(ideal_k + 1)]:\n        if 1 <= k <= n - 2:\n            k_candidates.append(k)\n    # Also check boundaries\n    if ideal_k < 1:\n        k_candidates.append(1)\n    elif ideal_k > n - 2:\n        k_candidates.append(n - 2)\n    \n    # Remove duplicates and sort\n    k_candidates = list(set(k_candidates))\n    k_candidates.sort()\n    \n    # Find the best k among candidates\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    for k in k_candidates:\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Choose the smallest k for consistency\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    \n    # Now, select the vertices\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    # v3 is (v2 - best_k) mod n?
