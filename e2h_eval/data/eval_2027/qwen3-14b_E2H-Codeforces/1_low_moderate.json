The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. And each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, we take a rectangle that's smaller by 4*(i-1) in both dimensions. But how does that translate into the perimeter?\n\nWait, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4, because the four corners are counted twice if you just do 2*(w + h). Wait, no. Wait, for a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the perimeter (the border) is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns have (H-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). Alternatively, it's 2*(W + H) - 4. Because 2*(W + H) counts each corner twice. So subtracting 4 gives the correct count.\n\nSo for each ring i, the perimeter is calculated based on the current width and height. But the problem says that each ring is the border of the inner rectangle. So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), but wait, that's the size of the inner rectangle. But the ring itself is the perimeter of that rectangle. Wait, no. Wait, the i-th ring is the border of that inner rectangle. Wait, but that inner rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So the perimeter of that rectangle would be 2*( (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h - 4*(i-1)) ) - 4. But wait, that's the same as 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1)) -4? Or wait, let me re-calculate:\n\nOriginal formula for perimeter: 2*(W + H) - 4, where W is the width and H is the height of the rectangle. So for the i-th ring, W is (w - 4*(i-1)), H is (h - 4*(i-1)). So perimeter is 2*(W + H) - 4. But wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again. For example, if the rectangle is 3x3, then the perimeter is 3*4 - 4 = 8? Because 3*4 is 12, minus 4 gives 8. Which matches the first example input. The first example input is 3 3 1. So the output is 8, which is indeed 3*3's perimeter. So yes, the formula is 2*(W + H) - 4.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, let me check the second example. Input is 7 9 1. So the perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the output. Then for the third example, input is 7 9 2. So first ring is perimeter of 7x9: 28. Second ring is perimeter of (7-4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Wait, 2*(3+5) is 16? No, 3+5 is 8, times 2 is 16. Then minus 4 gives 12. So total is 28 + 12 = 40, which matches the sample output. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is to loop from i=1 to k, compute for each i the perimeter of the rectangle with width w_i = w - ",
