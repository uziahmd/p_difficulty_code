Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check all cells on the two diagonals. They should all be the same character. Let's call this char 'd_char'.\n2. Check all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same character, say 'o_char', and that 'o_char' != 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check this?\n\nFirst, for each cell in the grid, determine if it's on either diagonal. For a cell at (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So, for each cell, if it's on either of these, it's part of the diagonals. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo, let's collect all the characters on the diagonals and check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the diagonals have different characters. For example, if one diagonal has 'x' and the other has 'y', then it's invalid. So first, we need to check that all the diagonal cells are the same.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on either diagonal. If yes, collect its character into a set. If the size of this set is more than 1, then return NO.\n- Then, collect all the non-diagonal characters into another set. Check that this set has size 1, and that the character is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, get the input. The input is n followed by n lines, each with n letters.\n\nThen:\n\n- Collect all diagonal characters. Let's collect them into a set. If the length of this set is not 1, then return NO.\n- Collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If the length of this set is not 1, return NO.\n- Also, check that the diagonal character and non-diagonal character are different.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal characters? Well, n is at least 3. For example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping at the center. So total diagonal cells are 2n -1 (since for n=3, 3+3-1=5 cells). So for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 9 -5 =4. So there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 or len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    return 'NO'\n\nelse:\n\n    if diagonal_chars.pop() == non_diagonal_chars.pop():\n\n        return 'NO'\n\n    else:\n\n        return 'YES'\n\nWait, but for the case where the non_diagonal_chars is empty? But n is at least 3. For example, when n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4. So no, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut for n=1? Well, the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for n=3, the diagonals are 5 cells (since 3 + 3 -1 = 5). So the non-diagonal is 9 -5 =4 cells.\n\nSo the code would collect those.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is >=3. So no.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nBut let's test with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nCheck diagonals: for each cell (i,j) where i==j or i+j=4.\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (x), j=4 (x) → both are x.\n\ni=1, j=1 (x), j=3 (x) → x.\n\ni=2, j=2 (x), j=2 (i=2, j=2 is on main diagonal. i + j = 4? 2+2=4? Yes, since n=5, n-1=4. So for i=2, j=2, i+j=4. So that's part of the anti-diagonal. So the cell (2,2) is on both diagonals. So the diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,4). Wait, for i=3, j=1: i +j=4. So yes.\n\nSo the diagonal characters are x, x, x, x, x, o, x, x, x? Wait let's look at the grid.\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is x. Also, (i=2, j=2) is i+j=4? 2+2=4 → yes. So that's part of the anti-diagonal. So the cell (2,2) is on both diagonals.\n\nRow 3: o x o x o → (3,1) is x (i=3, j=1: i + j=4?), 3+1=4 yes. And (3,3) is x. So for row 3, j=1 and j=3 are part of the anti-diagonal.\n\nRow 4: x o o o x → (4,0) is x, (4,4) is x.\n\nSo the diagonal characters are:\n\nLooking at all the cells on diagonals:\n\n(0,0) x\n\n(0,4) x\n\n(1,1) x\n\n(1,3) x\n\n(2,2) x\n\n(3,1) x\n\n(3,3) x\n\n(4,0) x\n\n(4,4) x\n\nSo all are x. So diagonal_chars is {'x'}, which is okay.\n\nNow the non-diagonal cells. For example, row 0, j=1,2,3: o, o, o.\n\nRow 1, j=0,2,4: o, o, o.\n\nRow 2: j=0,1,3,4: s, o, o, o.\n\nRow 3: j=0,2,4: o, o, o.\n\nRow 4: j=1,2,3: o, o, o.\n\nSo the non-diagonal characters include s, o, etc. So non_diagonal_chars would have s and o. So the set size is 2. Hence, the answer is NO, which matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) w; (0,2) w.\n\n(1,1) w.\n\n(2,0) w; (2,2) w.\n\nSo all diagonals are w. So diagonal_chars is {'w'}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are:\n\nRow 0, j=1: s.\n\nRow 1, j=0 and 2: s and s.\n\nRow 2, j=1: s.\n\nSo non_diagonal_chars is {'s'}, which is different from 'w'. So returns YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x, (2,2) e. Wait, (2,2) is part of the main diagonal (i=2, j=2). So the diagonals include (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So the diagonal characters are x, x, x, x, e. So the set for diagonals is {x, e}, which has size 2. Hence, returns NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'b'. Should return YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'a' → returns NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have two different letters. Like, one diagonal has 'a' and another has 'b' → returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. So, grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell, check if it's on the diagonals.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 or len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    if d_char != nd_char:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is n^2 - (2n -1) = n² - 2n +1 = (n-1)^2. For n=3, that's 4 cells. So no problem.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the problem says n is at least 3, so no.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe diagonals are all x except for the cell (2,2) ?\n\nWait no. Wait in the third row (row 2) is 'soxoo'.\n\nSo (2,2) is x. So the diagonals are all x. But the non-diagonal includes the 's' in row 2, column 0. Because for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2. n-1 is 4. So 2 !=4. So i=2, j=0 is not on the diagonal. So that cell is 's' which is added to non_diagonal_chars. Also, other cells like row 2, j=1, etc. So non_diagonal_chars has 's' and 'o's. So the set has size 2. So returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ngrid:\n\nrow 0: w s w\n\nrow 1: s w s\n\nrow 2: w s w\n\ndiagonal cells:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w; (1,1) w; (2,0) w, (2,2) w. So all are w. So diagonal_chars is {'w'}, non-diagonal cells are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s → all s. So non_diagonal_chars is {'s'}, so returns YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ngrid:\n\nrow 0: x p x\n\nrow 1: p x p\n\nrow 2: x p e\n\ndiagonal cells:\n\n(0,0) x; (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x; (2,2) e. So diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, the input may be read as follows. However, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as first line n, then n lines each with n letters.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is something like:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nWait, but the user is supposed to read from stdin. So in the actual code, the input is read via input() function.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is n, then n lines. So for example, for the first case, the input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nBut when reading from stdin, the code will read the first line as n, then read n lines.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut need to make sure that each line is read properly. So for example, in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the input lines are exactly n characters long, no leading or trailing spaces. So using strip() is safe? Well, perhaps not. Because if the input line is exactly n characters, then strip() may remove leading/trailing whitespace, but the problem says that each line is exactly n letters. So maybe better to read as input().strip()? Or perhaps just input(). Because for example, if the input is given with a newline, but the line is exactly n letters. For example, if the input is 'xooox\\n', then input().strip() would give 'xooox' which is correct. But perhaps using input().strip() is safer.\n\nBut perhaps the problem ensures that each line is exactly n letters. So perhaps the code can read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps the code can read as:\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut for example, if a line has leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each line has exactly n letters. So perhaps the code can just read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut in any case, the code should process the input correctly.\n\nOnce the grid is read, proceed with the code as discussed.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck diagonals and non-diagonals.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 or len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n    if d_char != nd_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you do set.pop(), it removes and returns an arbitrary element. But since the set has only one element, it's okay.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code would collect diagonal_chars as {'x'}, non_diagonal_chars has 's' and 'o's. So len(non_diagonal_chars) is 2 → print NO.\n\nSample 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ndiagonal_chars is {'w'}, non_diagonal is {'s'}, so returns YES.\n\nSample 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiagonal_chars is {x, e} → len 2 → print NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\nall diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals 'b' → returns YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals 'a' → returns NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have two different letters. For example, n=3:\n\nxax\n\naxa\n\nxax\n\nWait, for this grid, the diagonals are x, x, x, x, x → all x. So diagonal_chars is {'x'}, non-diagonal is a's. So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) a; (2,0) a, (2,2) a → all a. Non-diagonal cells: (0,1) b, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) b. So non_diagonal_chars is {b, a} → len 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nWhat about if all cells are same? For example, n=3, all 'a's. Then diagonals are 'a's, non-diagonal is 'a's. So len(diagonal) is 1, len(non) is 1, but same. So returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code is written. Now, check for possible errors.\n\nWhat about when n is 1? Well, problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nWhat about when n is even? Problem says n is odd. So code is safe.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all cells on both diagonals must contain the same character, and all other cells (non-diagonal) must contain the same character different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` followed by the grid itself.\n2. **Character Collection**: Traverse each cell in the grid to collect characters from the diagonals and non-diagonal cells separately.\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Check if all diagonal characters are the same.\n   - Check if all non-diagonal characters are the same.\n   - Ensure that the characters on the diagonals are different from the non-diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 or len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n    if d_char != nd_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first input line is the integer `n`, which denotes the size of the grid. The subsequent `n` lines are read into a list of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Traversing the Grid**: For each cell in the grid, we check if it lies on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal where row index equals column index, and anti-diagonal where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`). Characters from these cells are collected into `diagonal_chars`, while others are collected into `non_diagonal_chars`.\n3. **Validation Checks**:\n   - If the set of diagonal characters has more than one unique character, or the set of non-diagonal characters has more than one unique character, the answer is \"NO\".\n   - If both sets have exactly one character each, we check if they are different. If they are, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the required conditions using set operations, making the solution both simple and effective.",
