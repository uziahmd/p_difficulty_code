            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and I have to find the minimum extra tiles required.\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements. For the current three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add so that after adding, there's at least one mentsu.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu after adding some tiles?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nFor the initial three tiles, there are two possibilities: they already form a mentsu (so answer 0), or not. If not, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut how to check if the current three tiles can form a mentsu?\n\nLet's think about the three tiles:\n\nCase 1: Check if they form a triplet. That would require all three to be the same. For example, 9m, 9m, 9m. So if all three are same, then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Check if they form a sequence. For that, they must be in the same suit, and their numbers are consecutive. Like 1s, 2s, 3s. But the order doesn't matter. So, for the three tiles, check if they are same suit, and when sorted, their numbers are consecutive.\n\nIf either of these cases is true, output is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: given three tiles, what's the minimal number of tiles to add to form a triplet or sequence.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nLet me think about the possible ways to form a mentsu with the existing tiles plus some added ones.\n\nLet me consider each possible way to form a triplet or sequence.\n\nFirst, check for possible triplet:\n\nIf there are two same tiles, then adding one more of the same would form a triplet. For example, if two 1m, then adding another 1m gives a triplet. So in this case, the number of tiles to add is 1.\n\nBut maybe there are other possibilities. Like, maybe there's a way to form a sequence with fewer additions.\n\nBut for the minimal count, we need to check all possibilities and take the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to generate all possible possibilities for forming a triplet or sequence, and calculate the required number of tiles to add for each possibility, then take the minimum.\n\nSo, for the given three tiles, we can:\n\nCheck for possible triplet options. For example, for each tile, see how many copies are present. Suppose we have two copies of a tile, then adding one more gives a triplet. Or if there's only one copy, then adding two more.\n\nBut since we can add any number of tiles, but want the minimal, perhaps for triplet possibilities, the minimal required is (3 - count) where count is the number of existing tiles of that type.\n\nBut maybe there are multiple possibilities here. For example, suppose the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, to form a triplet, you could add another 1m (needs 1) or add two 2m's (but that would require 2). So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for triplet possibilities, the minimal number of tiles needed is (3 - max_count), where max_count is the maximum count of any tile in the current hand. However, this is only if we choose to form a triplet of that tile.\n\nBut perhaps there are other possibilities. For example, if the current tiles have two different tiles, but maybe adding one tile to make a triplet of another.\n\nWait, no. Because for a triplet, you need three of the same tile. So, for example, if the current tiles have two 1m and one 2m, then the possible triplet is 1m (needs 1 more) or 2m (needs 2 more). So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for the triplet option, the minimal required is (3 - max_count) where max_count is the maximum number of same tiles in the current hand. But maybe there's another way to get a triplet by adding more tiles. For example, if the current hand has one 1m, one 2m, and one 3m. Then, to form a triplet, you can add two 1m's (total 3) which requires 2, or two 2m's, etc. So the minimal is 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way via a sequence.\n\nSo",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw in order to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the current three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence. If they do, no additional tiles are needed.\n2. **Triplet Check**: If the current tiles do not form a valid mentsu, determine the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet. This is done by counting how many of each tile are present and calculating the difference from 3.\n3. **Sequence Check**: For sequences, check all possible sequences that can be formed with the current tiles by adding one or two tiles. This involves checking if the current tiles can be extended to form a sequence by adding one or two tiles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    tiles = input.split()\n    \n    # Parse the tiles into a list of tuples (number, suit)\n    parsed = []\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suit = t[1]\n        parsed.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Check if already has a mentsu\n    def has_mentsu(tiles):\n        # Check for triplet\n        if len(set(tiles)) == 1:\n            return True\n        # Check for sequence\n        nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles])\n        suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n        if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n            return False\n        if nums[1] - nums[0] == 1 and nums[2] - nums[1] == 1:\n            return True\n        return False\n    \n    if has_mentsu(parsed):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # If not, calculate the minimum needed\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    count = defaultdict(int)\n    for num, suit in parsed:\n        count[(num, suit)] += 1\n\n    max_count = max(count.values())\n    triplet_needed = 3 - max_count\n\n    # Now check for possible sequence\n    # Group by suit\n    suits = defaultdict(list)\n    for num, suit in parsed:\n        suits[suit].append(num)\n    \n    min_add = float('inf')\n    \n    # Check for each suit\n    for suit in suits:\n        nums = sorted(suits[suit])\n        # Try to find a sequence with 3 numbers\n        # We can try all possible combinations of adding tiles\n        # Check if there's a possible sequence with 3 numbers by adding 0, 1, or 2 tiles\n        # For example, existing nums could be [1, 2], need to add 3 (1 tile)\n        # Or [1,3], need to add 2 (1 tile)\n        # Or [1,4], need to add 2 and 3 (2 tiles)\n        \n        # Check all possible sequences of length 3 in the same suit\n        # The possible sequences are from 1-9, so for any three consecutive numbers\n        \n        # Generate all possible sequences\n        for i in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [i, i+1, i+2]\n            current_nums = set(nums)\n            needed = 0\n            for num in seq:\n                if num not in current_nums:\n                    needed += 1\n            if needed < min_add:\n                min_add = needed\n    \n    # The minimal between triplet and sequence\n    result = min(triplet_needed, min_add)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and parsed into a list of tuples representing each tile's number and suit.\n2. **Mentsu Check**: The function `has_mentsu` checks if the current tiles form a valid triplet or sequence.\n3. **Triplet Calculation**: If no valid mentsu is found, the code calculates the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet by considering the maximum count of any tile.\n4. **Sequence Calculation**: The code checks all possible sequences for each suit and calculates the minimum number of tiles needed to complete a sequence.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum number of tiles required to form either a triplet or a sequence is determined and printed.",
