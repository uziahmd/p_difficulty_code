Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a block here. Each block is a region divided by the infinite roads. The roads are lines, and their intersections create regions. The key thing is that moving between blocks requires that they share a common segment (not just a point). So, two blocks are adjacent if their boundary shares a line segment, which would happen when they are separated by exactly one road. But how do I model this?\n\nThe challenge is to model the blocks and their adjacency. But since there are potentially an infinite number of blocks, we can't model them all directly. However, the problem is about moving between blocks, and the movement depends on crossing roads. So maybe we can model the problem in terms of the roads and the positions of the home and university relative to them.\n\nAnother idea: think of each block as being determined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, a point lies on one side or the other. The combination of all these signs determines which block the point is in. But since there are n roads, there are 2^n possible combinations. However, some combinations might not be possible (like if the roads are parallel, etc.), but for the purposes of modeling, perhaps we can represent each block by the sign vector of each road.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that even if two points have different sign vectors, they might be in the same block. However, given that the roads divide the plane into regions, the sign vector (for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side) uniquely identifies the block. Because each line divides the plane into two parts, and the regions are determined by the intersection of these half-planes. So, for a given point not on any road, the sign vector (for each road, +1 or -1) determines which block it's in. Therefore, two points are in the same block if and only if their sign vectors are the same for all roads.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of steps between the sign vectors of the home and university. But how do steps work? Each step corresponds to crossing a road, which changes the sign of exactly one road. But wait, no. Because when you cross a road, you change the sign of that road. However, moving from one block to another adjacent block requires that you cross exactly one road. So, the adjacency between blocks would be when their sign vectors differ in exactly one road's sign. Because changing one road's sign would take you across that road into an adjacent block.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose two blocks are separated by two roads. Then, their sign vectors would differ in two roads. But perhaps they are adjacent via a common segment. Wait, no. Because if two blocks are adjacent, they must be separated by exactly one road. Because each road is a line, and two regions separated by a single road are adjacent. If two regions are separated by multiple roads, then their boundaries are not directly connected. So, the adjacency between blocks is equivalent to differing in exactly one sign in their sign vectors. \n\nTherefore, the problem becomes similar to a graph where each node is a sign vector, and edges exist between nodes that differ in exactly one coordinate. Then, the minimum number of steps between the home and university's sign vectors is the minimum number of sign changes needed to go from one to the other, with each step changing exactly one sign. However, this seems like a BFS problem where each state is the sign vector, and transitions are flipping one bit (the sign of a road). But the problem is that for n=300, the number of possible sign vectors is 2^300, which is way too big to handle directly. So this approach is impossible.\n\nSo, this suggests that we need a different approach. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: The problem can be modeled as a graph where each node represents a block. However, since the number of blocks is exponential in n, we can't store all of them. Therefore, we need a smarter way.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight is that the minimum number of steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university. Wait, no. Because each step allows crossing one road. So, for example, if the home and university are in blocks that are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps would be k. But how to find k?\n\nAlternatively, think of each road as a hyperplane. The home and university are in two different regions. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of hyperplanes (roads) that need to be crossed to get from one region to the other. But since each step crosses exactly one road, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that separate the two points. However, this isn't exactly correct. Because some roads might be redundant. For example, if two roads cross each other, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads, then you need to cross both roads, but the minimal steps would be 2. But perhaps there's a way to cross them in a different order.\n\nBut how can we compute the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university? Well, each road can be considered as a hyperplane. For each road, the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides. Let's consider for each road i, whether the home and university are on the same side or not. Let's say that for road i, the home is on the positive side (a_i x1 + b_i y1 + c_i > 0) and the university is on the negative side (a_i x2 + b_i y2 + c_i < 0), or vice versa. If they are on opposite sides, then that road is a separator between the home and university. The minimal number of steps would be the minimal number of such roads that need to be crossed. However, since each step crosses exactly one road, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once. However, if the home and university are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps is k. But is that always the case?\n\nWait, suppose there are two roads, A and B. The home is on the positive side of A and positive side of B. The university is on the negative side of A and negative side of B. Then, the home and university are separated by both roads. To get from home to university, you need to cross both roads. But perhaps you can cross A first, then B, which would take two steps. Alternatively, cross B first, then A. Either way, two steps. So the minimal steps is 2. Which is the number of roads separating them. So in this case, the answer is the count of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads. The home and university are separated by roads A and B. But road C is such that home and university are on the same side. Then, the minimal steps is 2. Which is the number of roads separating them.\n\nSo, this suggests that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. But why is that? Because each such road must be crossed once, and crossing a road that does not separate them doesn't help. Therefore, the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nBut how to verify this? Let's think of a scenario where two points are separated by two roads, but there's a way to cross one road and then cross another road that is not separating them. But that would not change the separation. For example, imagine roads A and B cross each other, and the home is in a region that is on the positive side of A and positive side of B. The university is on the negative side of A and positive side of B. Then, the home and university are separated by road A. So, the minimal steps is 1. But if there's another road C that is not separating them, but crossing it would not help. So the minimal steps is indeed the count of roads that separate them.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step. Therefore, the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nBut wait, let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x+1y+0=0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0).\n\nFor the first road (y=0): home (1,1) is y=1>0, so positive side. University (-1,-1) is y=-1 <0. So this road separates them. For the second road (x=0): home is x=1>0, university x=-1 <0. Also separates. So total of 2 roads. Output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. Let's check each road.\n\nFor x=0: home is positive, university negative. Separates.\n\nFor y=0: same as above. Separates.\n\nThird road: x + y -3 = 0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0. University: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. Both are on the same side. So this road does not separate. So total of 2 roads. Output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to work. So the answer is simply the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because each road that separates them must be crossed once. And since each step allows you to cross exactly one road, the minimal steps is exactly the number of such roads. \n\nBut how to confirm that there's no scenario where the minimal steps is less than the count of separating roads?\n\nSuppose there are two roads that separate the home and university. Let's say, road A and road B. Now, if the home is in a region that is on the positive side of A and B, and the university is on the negative side of A and B. Then, the minimal steps is 2. Because you have to cross both roads. But suppose that roads A and B intersect. Then, crossing A first and then B would take two steps. There's no way to cross both in one step. Hence, the minimal steps is indeed 2.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads that separate the home and university. Then, the minimal steps would be 3, because each must be crossed once.\n\nSo this seems to hold. Thus, the solution is to compute for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. The answer is the count of such roads.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking, for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides. How do we check that?\n\nFor a given road equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0, the value of (a_i x + b_i y + c_i) for a point (x,y) determines which side of the line the point is on. For the home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), compute the values:\n\nval1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i\n\nval2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i\n\nIf val1 and val2 have opposite signs (i.e., val1 * val2 < 0), then the road separates them. So, count this road.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each road, compute val1 and val2.\n\n- If val1 * val2 < 0, increment the count.\n\n- The answer is the count.\n\nWait, but what about if the road is such that the home and university are on the same side, but the road is not between them. But according to the problem statement, the roads are infinite lines. So, if the two points are on the same side of a road, then that road does not separate them. So the count is correct.\n\nBut why is that sufficient? Because the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them. So this approach is correct.\n\nBut why didn't the problem mention anything about the roads being in general position or not? For example, if two roads are parallel, but the home and university are on opposite sides of both. Then, the count is 2, and the minimal steps is 2. Which makes sense.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university coordinates (x2, y2), n roads.\n\nFor each road, compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i, val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. If val1 * val2 < 0, increment the count.\n\nOutput the count.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows that the answer is exactly this count. So why is this the case?\n\nBut why is the minimal steps equal to the number of roads that separate the two points?\n\nBecause each such road must be crossed once. Since each step crosses exactly one road, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. Because you can cross each road once, in some order.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses each of those roads once, and no more? Because each road that separates them is a barrier that must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of such roads.\n\nThis seems to be the case. Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me test this against the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Two roads:\n\nRoad 1: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. val1 for home is 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * (-1) = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads:\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → same as before, count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → same as before, count +=1.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 =0. val1 is 1+1-3 = -1. val2 is -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0. So no count. Total 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then the answer is 0 steps. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are separated by one road. Answer is 1.\n\nSo the code should be as simple as that.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because the problem's movement allows moving between adjacent blocks through a common border. So each time you cross a road, you move to a neighboring block. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each crossing takes one step. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses each of these roads once and that no roads are crossed more than once? Well, since each road that separates the two points must be crossed once, and the order in which they are crossed can be arbitrary. For example, if there are two roads that separate them, then you can cross one and then the other. So the minimal steps is indeed the count.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward. Now, implement it.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nFor each road:\n\nCompute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i.\n\nCompute val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i.\n\nIf val1 * val2 <0 → count +=1.\n\nAt the end, print count.\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 can't be zero. So we don't have to worry about division by zero or anything.\n\nSo the code is as simple as that. Let's see why the sample input gives the correct outputs.\n\nYes, as shown earlier.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because the problem's movement is equivalent to moving through the roads that separate the two points. Each such road is a step.\n\nThis seems surprisingly simple. But according to the samples, it works. So perhaps this is the correct approach.\n\nBut why is this the case? Let's think of the problem as a graph where each node is a block, and edges connect blocks that are separated by exactly one road. Then, the minimal steps between the home and university blocks is the minimal number of roads that separate them. Because each step moves across a road, and each road that separates them must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nThus, this approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code is straightforward. Now, let's write it.\n\nRead the input:\n\nIn Python, read from stdin. The input is given as multiple lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSo, the first line is x1, y1. Second line is x2, y2. Third line is n. Then n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nThen for each line, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0: count +=1.\n\nFinally, print count.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is simple. Let's test another case.\n\nCase where home and university are separated by 0 roads. So they are in the same block. Answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by 3 roads. Answer is 3.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut why did the problem mention that the roads are infinite and that the movement requires a common border? Because if two blocks are separated by more than one road, then they are not adjacent. So, the minimal steps would require crossing each of the separating roads once. Hence, the count.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
