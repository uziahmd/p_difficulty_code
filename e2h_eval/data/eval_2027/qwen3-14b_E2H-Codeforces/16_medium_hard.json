Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent each block? Since there are n roads, each block is determined by the arrangement of these lines. But directly representing all possible blocks isn't feasible because the number can be exponential in n. However, since we only need to find the shortest path between two specific blocks (home and university), perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of considering each block, think of each region as being defined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For each road, a point lies on one side or the other. So for each road, the home point will have a certain sign (positive or negative) when plugged into the equation. Similarly for the university. \n\nBut how does this help with adjacency? Because two blocks are adjacent if they share a common border, which means that they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. So, the adjacency between blocks is determined by flipping exactly one road's sign. \n\nWait, but the problem says that moving from one block to another requires that their common border has a non-zero length. Which implies that they share a segment of a road. So, two regions are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road. So, the problem reduces to a graph where each node is a state of signs for all roads, and edges exist between states that differ in exactly one road's sign. Then, the problem becomes finding the minimum number of steps (edges) between the home's state and the university's state. \n\nBut how do we represent the state? For each road, the sign of the home point (or the university's) when evaluated against the road's equation. So, for each road, compute the sign of home's coordinates in that road's equation. Similarly for the university. Then, the problem is to find the minimum number of sign differences between the home's state and the university's state, where each step flips exactly one sign. \n\nWait, no. Because each step corresponds to crossing a road. So, moving from one block to another adjacent block requires changing exactly one sign. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum number of sign changes needed to transform the home's sign vector into the university's sign vector, where each step can flip exactly one sign. \n\nBut that's not quite right. Because each road's sign is determined by the position relative to that road. So, the home's state is a vector of signs for each road. Similarly for the university. The question is: what's the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped in order to go from home's state to university's state, such that each flip represents crossing a road. However, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the two vectors, but that's only if each flip is allowed. Wait, no. Because if the home and university's sign vectors differ in k positions, then the minimal steps would be k. Because each step can flip one sign. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, suppose the home and university's sign vectors differ in k positions. Then, the minimal number of steps is k, because each step can flip one sign. But that's only if the path is possible. However, maybe there's some dependency. For example, if two roads are parallel, then flipping their signs might not be possible in some way. Wait, but no. Because each road is a line. The sign of each road is independent. So, the state is a binary vector (for each road, + or -). The adjacency is that two states are connected if they differ in exactly one bit. Therefore, the minimal steps between the two states is exactly the Hamming distance between them. \n\nWait, but that seems too easy. Let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x + 1y +0 =0 (which is y=0), and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor the home point (1,1):\n\nFirst road: 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1>0 → sign is positive. \n\nSecond road: 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1>0 → positive. So the home's state is [+, +].\n\nUniversity is (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign is negative. \n\nSecond road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → negative. So the university's state is [-, -]. \n\nThe Hamming distance is 2, so the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nAnother sample input: \n\nHome is (1,1), university (-1,-1). 3 roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nx=0: 1>0 → + \n\ny=0: 1>0 → +\n\nx+y-3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → - \n\nSo home's state is [+, +, -].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nx=0: -1 <0 → - \n\ny=0: -1 <0 → - \n\nx+y-3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → - \n\nSo university's state is [-, -, -]. \n\nHamming distance is 2 (the first two positions differ). So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo this approach seems correct. Therefore, the problem reduces to computing the Hamming distance between the two states of home and university. \n\nWait, but how do we compute the state for home and university? For each road, evaluate the sign of the point (home or university) in the equation. \n\nBut how to compute the sign? For a road equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. For a point (x0, y0), the value is val = a_i x0 + b_i y0 + c_i. The sign of val determines which side of the road the point is on. \n\nSo for each road, compute val for home and for university. \n\nBut the problem says that neither home nor university lies on any road. So val can't be zero. \n\nThus, for each road, the sign of val for home and for university can be determined. \n\nThen, the home's state is a vector of signs (for each road, +1 or -1). Similarly for university. \n\nThe Hamming distance between these two vectors is the number of roads where the signs differ. And that's the answer. \n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which flips the sign of that road. So, to get from home's state to university's state, you need to flip the signs of the roads where they differ. Each flip is a step. So the minimal steps is the number of differing roads. \n\nYes. Because each differing road requires a flip. So the answer is the number of differing signs between home and university. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: compute for each road, whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides. The answer is the count of roads where they are on opposite sides. \n\nWait, but how? Let me think again. \n\nSuppose that for a given road, the home and university are on the same side. Then, in their sign vectors, they have the same sign. So, that road doesn't contribute to the Hamming distance. \n\nIf they are on opposite sides, then their signs differ, contributing 1 to the Hamming distance. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the number of roads where home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). \n\nIf the product of these two values is negative, then the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. So, count that road. \n\nThe answer is the count. \n\nWait, but why? Because if the product is negative, then the two points are on opposite sides of the road. So, the signs are different. \n\nYes. So for each road, check if (val1 * val2) < 0. If yes, increment the count. \n\nThat's the answer. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nLet me test this with the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample:\n\nRoads are y=0 and x=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nval1 for first road (y=0): 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1. For university (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 = -1. Product is 1 * (-1) = -1 <0 → count +=1. \n\nSecond road: x=0. val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1. Product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. \n\nWhich matches the sample output. \n\nSecond sample: \n\nRoads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nHome (1,1):\n\nFor first road (x=0): val1 =1. University (-1,-1): val=-1. product -1 → count +=1. \n\nSecond road (y=0): same as first. product -1 → count +=1. \n\nThird road: x+y-3. For home: 1+1-3 = -1. For university: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. \n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo this approach works. \n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), then n roads. For each road, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If val1 * val2 <0, then increment the count. Finally, output the count. \n\nBut wait, why is that the case? Because each road that separates home and university contributes to the minimal steps. Because each such road must be crossed once. \n\nBut why is the minimal steps equal to the number of roads that separate them? Because each such road must be crossed once. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads? Well, since the roads are arranged in such a way that you can cross each road once. \n\nBut perhaps there's some dependency. For example, if two roads are parallel, but the home and university are on opposite sides of both. Then, you need to cross both roads. But since they are parallel, crossing one doesn't affect the other. So the minimal steps is 2. \n\nYes, which would be counted correctly. \n\nSo the code is very straightforward. \n\nSo the problem is really simple once you realize that the answer is the number of roads that separate the home and university. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of the n roads:\n\n   read a, b, c.\n\n   val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n   val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n   if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n       count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but that's it? That seems too easy. But according to the samples, it works. \n\nBut why is the answer the number of roads separating the two points?\n\nBecause each such road must be crossed once. And since each crossing is a step, the minimal steps is the number of such roads. \n\nBut how to prove that this is indeed the minimal steps?\n\nWell, imagine that the home and university are in two regions. The minimal steps required to get from one to the other is the minimal number of roads that you have to cross. Each road that separates them must be crossed once. \n\nBut how do you know that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads? \n\nWell, the arrangement of roads divides the plane into regions. The minimal number of crossings is the number of roads that separate the two points. Because each time you cross a road, you can move into a new region. So, if there are k roads separating the two points, then you need to cross each of them once. \n\nBut how can you be sure that there's a path that crosses each of those roads once, and no more? \n\nBecause the regions are connected. For example, imagine that the two points are separated by k roads. Then, there exists a path that crosses each of those roads once. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to cross some roads multiple times, but that would not be minimal. \n\nSo the minimal steps is indeed the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nSo this approach is correct. \n\nThus, the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let's code this. \n\nRead the input. For each test case. Wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. \n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1. \n\nSecond line two integers x2, y2. \n\nThird line is n. \n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i. \n\nBut the sample input shows two examples. Wait, the first sample input is given as a string like ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', ...]. So perhaps the input is read as multiple test cases. But in the actual problem, the input is one test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is as per the given format. So the code should read one test case. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1. Second line two integers x2, y2. Third line is n. Then n lines of the coefficients. \n\nSo the code needs to read this. \n\nBut the sample input shows two examples. But the user probably wants to read a single test case. \n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nCompute for each line, val1 and val2, check if their product is negative. \n\nCount the number of such roads. \n\nPrint the count. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nBut wait, what about the case when the home and university are in the same region? Then, the count is zero. Which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code would handle all cases. \n\nNow, let's code this. \n\nIn Python, read from stdin. \n\nBut note that the input may have multiple lines. \n\nSample code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's it. \n\nBut let me test with the samples. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nval1 for first road (0,1,0): 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val2: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road (1,0,0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 = -1. product -1 → count +=1. total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst road (1,0,0): val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road (0,1,0): val1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road (1,1,-3): val1 is 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 is 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0 → no count. \n\nTotal count is 2 → correct. \n\nSo the code works for the samples. \n\nWhat about other cases?\n\nCase where home and university are on same side of all roads. Then output is zero. \n\nAnother case: one road. Suppose home is on positive side, university on negative. Then count is 1. Which is correct. \n\nSo this code seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the solution is as above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves crossing a road, which means moving from one block to an adjacent block that shares a common border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each road is defined by a linear equation. The key insight is that moving from one block to another adjacent block requires crossing a road, which changes the sign of the road's equation evaluation for the point's coordinates.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road, they must cross that road to move between blocks. The number of such roads directly gives the minimum number of steps needed.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n   - Check if the product of these values is negative, indicating that the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n   - Count the number of such roads, which gives the minimum steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university points are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Evaluating Road Equations**: For each road, the linear equation is evaluated at both the home and university points.\n- **Checking Opposite Sides**: If the product of the evaluations at the two points is negative, it indicates that the points are on opposite sides of the road, necessitating a crossing.\n- **Counting Steps**: The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their evaluations, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
