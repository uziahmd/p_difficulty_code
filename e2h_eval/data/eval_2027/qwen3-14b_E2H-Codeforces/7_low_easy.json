The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) get connected to k new vertices each. And this process is repeated at least once. Wait, the description says that each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. And this step should be done at least once. So the process is like building layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's consider the construction steps.\n\nLet me model the process. Let's say we have a certain number of layers. The initial step is layer 0: 1 node. Then layer 1 adds k nodes connected to the root. Then, for each subsequent layer, each node added in the previous layer (which has degree 1) gets k new nodes. But wait, each such node is connected to k new ones. So each layer adds more nodes.\n\nLet me think of it as a tree. The snowflake is a tree. Because each step adds new nodes connected to existing ones. So the structure is a tree. Let me think about the number of nodes after m steps.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the number of nodes after m levels of expansion. Let's see:\n\n- Level 0: 1 node (root).\n- Level 1: Add k nodes. Total nodes: 1 + k.\n- Level 2: Each of the k nodes from level 1 adds k nodes. So total added here is k * k. Total nodes: 1 + k + k^2.\n- Level 3: Each of the k^2 nodes from level 2 adds k nodes. Total added here is k^3. Total nodes: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n- And so on, up to some level m.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the process must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then the next step is done at least once. So the minimum number of layers is 2? Because the initial step is adding the first layer (level 1), then the next step (level 2) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have 1 + k + k^2 nodes. For example, when k=4, the minimal is 1+4+16=21? But the example given says that for n=6, the answer is NO, and for n=13 it's YES. Wait let's check the sample input.\n\nSample input includes n=6, output is NO. Let's see. Let's think for possible k.\n\nFor example, if k=2:\n\nLevel 0: 1.\n\nLevel 1: 1+2 = 3.\n\nLevel 2: 3 + 2^2 = 3+4=7. So for k=2, possible n is 3,7, 15, etc. So 6 isn't in that sequence.\n\nAnother possibility is that the process can stop after any number of steps. So the snowflake can be constructed with m layers, where m ≥ 2 (since the step after the first addition is done at least once). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. Wait, but the problem says that each time you add new nodes, you do it for all the leaves (those with degree 1). So the structure is such that each step adds a new level. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, but with m ≥ 1? Or maybe m ≥ 2?\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the next step (which must be done at least once) adds k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k^2. So m is the number of steps. The first step (adding k nodes) is step 1, then step 2 adds k^2, etc. So the total nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2? No, because for m=1, sum is 1 + k. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is the first step. Then, the second step (adding k^2) is done once. So the minimal case is m=2, which gives sum from i=0 to 2: 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut then,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and our task is to check if such a structure can exist for the given `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with a single vertex and expands in layers. Each layer adds new vertices connected to the vertices from the previous layer. The construction process must be done at least once after the initial step.\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: The total number of vertices in a snowflake graph can be represented as a geometric series. For a given `k`, the number of vertices after `m` steps is given by the sum of a geometric series: $1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m$. This sum must be checked against the given `n`.\n3. **Efficient Checking**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists a `k > 1` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`. We iterate over possible values of `k` and check if the sum of the series matches `n` for some number of terms.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Try all possible k > 1\n    # For each k, check if there exists m >= 2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n\n    # Or sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n where m >= 1 (but the step must be done at least once)\n    # So the minimal case is m=2: 1 + k + k^2\n    # So for k >= 2, we check for possible m\n    # Let's try all possible k up to cube root of n or similar\n    # For each k, compute the sum until it exceeds n\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/3)) + 2  # since k^3 <= n implies k <= n^(1/3)\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1  # start with the root\n        m = 0\n        while True:\n            # Add next term\n            next_term = k ** (m + 1)\n            if total + next_term > n:\n                break\n            total += next_term\n            m += 1\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n    # Also check for cases where the sum is exactly 1 + k (but only if m=1, but according to the problem statement, the second step must be done at least once)\n    # Wait, the second step must be done at least once, so the minimal is 1 + k + k^2\n    # So the case where sum is 1 + k is invalid\n    # However, for the case where m=1, the sum is 1 + k. But according to the problem statement, the step after the first addition must be done at least once. Therefore, m must be at least 2.\n    # Hence, the code above checks for m starting from 0, but the sum must have at least two terms (k and k^2)\n    # Wait, in the loop, for k, we start with total = 1 (m=0), then add k^1 (m=1), then k^2 (m=2). So when m=2, total is 1 + k + k^2\n    # So the code checks for m >= 2?\n    # Let me see: initial total is 1 (m=0), then next term is k^1 (m=1), then k^2 (m=2)\n    # So the code will check for sum 1 + k (when m=1), which is not allowed. So need to adjust.\n    # So in the code, after adding k^1, the total is 1 + k. Then adding k^2 gives 1 + k + k^2.\n    # So we need to make sure that the sum has at least 3 terms (1 + k + k^2). So in the code, the check for total == n should only happen after at least two additions (i.e., m >= 2)\n    # So modifying the code to check after adding at least two terms\n    # Let me rework the code\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1  # m=0\n        m = 0\n        while True:\n            # Next term is k^(m+1)\n            next_term = k ** (m + 1)\n            if total + next_term > n:\n                break\n            total += next_term\n            m += 1\n            if m >= 1:  # because after adding k^1 (m=1), we have 1 + k\n                if total == n:\n                    # But need to ensure that the step was done at least once (so m >= 2)\n                    # Wait, the problem says that the step after the initial one must be done at least once.\n                    # So the initial step is adding k nodes (level 1), and then the next step (adding k^2) is done once (level 2).\n                    # So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2. So m must be at least 2.\n                    # So in the code, m must be >= 2\n                    if m >= 2:\n                        return True\n    # Also, check cases where the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, but m could be larger than 2\n    # Another approach: for each possible k, check if n-1 is divisible by (k-1) and the quotient is of the form (k^m - 1)/(k-1)\n    # Because sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1)\n    # So for a given n, we need (n-1) / (k-1) = k^{m+1} - 1 / (k-1) => n-1 = (k^{m+1} - 1)\n    # Wait no. The sum S = (k^{m+1} - 1) / (k - 1)\n    # So if S = n, then n*(k-1) = k^{m+1} - 1\n    # So for each k, check if (n-1) is divisible by (k-1), then check if the quotient plus 1 is a power of k\n    # Let me think again.\n    # S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^{m+1} - 1) / (k - 1)\n    # So for given n, we need (k^{m+1} - 1) = (n)(k - 1)\n    # So for each k, check if (n - 1) is divisible by (k-1), then check if (n - 1)/(k-1) + 1 is a power of k.\n    # Wait, let me rephrase: S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k - 1) = n\n    # So rearranged: k^{m+1} - 1 = n(k - 1)\n    # => k^{m+1} = n(k - 1) + 1\n    # So for a given k, compute the right-hand side, and check if it's a power of k.\n    # So for example, if n=13, then possible k=3: RHS = 13*(3-1) +1 = 27 = 3^3. So yes.\n    # So this approach might be more efficient.\n    # So let's implement this method.\n    # Now, for each k >= 2, check if (n-1) is divisible by (k-1), then check if (n-1)/(k-1) +1 is a power of k.\n    # Wait, no. From the equation: k^{m+1} = n(k - 1) + 1\n    # So for each k >= 2, compute x = n*(k-1) + 1, and check if x is a power of k.\n    # If yes, then return True.\n    # So for example, for n=13, k=3: x = 13*2 + 1 = 27 = 3^3. So yes.\n    # Also, for n=6: trying k=2, x = 6*1 +1 =7, which is not a power of 2. k=3: 6*2 +1=13, not a power of 3. etc. So returns false.\n    # So this seems better.\n    # So the approach is: iterate k from 2 to some upper bound, compute x = n*(k-1)+1, and check if x is a power of k.\n    # Now, what is the upper bound for k? Since x = n*(k-1) +1 >= k^2 (since m+1 >= 2, because m >=1)\n    # So k^2 <= x = n(k-1)+1\n    # Rearranged: k^2 -n(k-1) -1 <=0\n    # Solving for k, but perhaps it's easier to find an upper bound for k. For example, since x = n(k-1) +1 >= k^2, then k^2 <= n(k-1) +1\n    # Let's approximate for large k: k^2 ~ nk => k ~ n. So upper bound for k is up to sqrt(n) + something. But for n up to 1e18, even sqrt(n) is 1e9, which is too big for t=1e4.\n    # However, considering that the original approach may not be feasible for large n, but with the new approach, maybe we can optimize further.\n    # However, for the problem constraints, n can be up to 1e18, and t up to 1e4. So we need an efficient way.\n    # So the new approach is better, but how to implement it?\n    # For each k from 2 to some upper limit, compute x = n*(k-1) +1, then check if x is a power of k.\n    # How to check if x is a power of k? We can do log(x)/log(k) and see if it's integer. But due to precision issues, better to do iterative multiplication.\n    # So for x, check if there exists an exponent m such that k^m = x.\n    # So for example, start with current = k, multiply by k until it exceeds x. If during this process, current equals x, return True.\n    # Now, the upper bound for k is such that k^2 <= n*(k-1) +1. Let's approximate for k.\n    # For large k, n*(k-1) +1 ≈ nk. So k^2 <= nk → k <= n. But this is too large for k up to 1e18.\n    # However, for n=1e18, checking k up to say 1e6 would be feasible for t=1e4.\n    # But for n=1e18, even k=1e6 would take O(1e6) operations per test case. For t=1e4, this would be 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n    # So this approach may not be feasible. Need another idea.\n    # Let's think back to the original problem. What are the valid values of n?\n    # For any k >=2 and m >=1, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n    # So for any n that can be written in this form, the answer is YES.\n    # So for example, n=1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m for m >=1 and k >=2.\n    # So for each possible m, we can check if there exists a k such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n    # But for m up to log_2(n), since for m=1, the sum is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. So n can be any number >= 3 (since k>=2, n=3,4,...)\n    # So for m=1, the possible n is k+1, which can be any integer >=3.\n    # But according to the problem statement, the step after the initial addition must be done at least once. Which means that m+1 >=2, i.e., m >=1. So for m=1, the sum is 1 +k, which is allowed.\n    # Wait, this contradicts the earlier understanding. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n    # The problem says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n    # So the initial step is adding k vertices. Then, the next step (connecting those k vertices to k new ones) must be done at least once. So the minimal number of vertices is 1 + k + k^2. Which corresponds to m=2 (sum from i=0 to 2 of k^i).\n    # So the correct formula is sum_{i=0}^m k^i where m >= 2.\n    # So the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), and m+1 >=3 → m >=2.\n    # So for example, m=2: sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n    # Thus, for the problem, we need to check whether n can be expressed as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some k >=2 and m >=2.\n    # So the equation becomes: n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for k >=2, m >=2.\n    # So the approach is to check for all possible k and m such that this equation holds.\n    # For a given n, we can iterate over possible m values (starting from 2) and see if there exists a k such that this equation holds.\n    # Let's try this approach.\n    # For each m from 2 to log_2(n) (since for m=2, k^3-1/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1, which for k=2 is 7. So for n=7, m=2, k=2 is valid).\n    # For each m, we can solve for k in the equation (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n    # This is equivalent to finding integer k such that k^{m+1} -1 = n(k-1).\n    # Rearranged: k^{m+1} - n*k + (n -1) = 0.\n    # This is a polynomial equation in k, and solving it for integer k >=2 is challenging.\n    # However, for fixed m, we can perform a binary search on k.\n    # For example, for a given m, the function f(k) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing with k. So for each m, we can binary search for k such that f(k) = n.\n    # Let's see for m=2: f(k) = k^3-1/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1.\n    # So for n=13, k^2 +k +1 =13 → k^2 +k -12=0 → k=( -1 ± sqrt(1 +48))/2 → sqrt(49)=7 → k=( -1+7)/2=3. So k=3 is valid.\n    # So for each m from 2 to log_2(n), perform binary search on k to see if there exists an integer k >=2 such that f(k) =n.\n    # Now, what is the maximum m we need to consider? For m=2, the minimal value of f(k) is 2^3-1/(2-1) = 7. For larger m, the function grows faster. So for n=1e18, the maximum m is small.\n    # For example, for m=50, k=2: f(k) = 2^51-1/(2-1) = 2^51-1 ≈ 2e15, which is less than 1e18. For m=60, k=2: f(k) = 2^61-1 ≈ 2e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for m up to around 60, we can cover all possibilities.\n    # So the plan is:\n    # For each test case n:\n    #   if n < 7: return NO (since the minimal possible is 7 for k=2, m=2)\n    #   else:\n    #       for m in 2 to 60:\n    #           perform binary search for k in [2, ...] such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n\n    #           if found, return YES\n    #       if none found, return NO\n    # Now, the binary search for k:\n    # For a fixed m, the function f(k) increases with k. So we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound.\n    # The upper bound can be determined as follows: for m+1, the minimal value of f(k) for a given m is when k=2.

So yes.\n    # So this approach might be more efficient.\n    # So let's implement this method.\n    # Now, for each k >= 2, check if (n-1) is divisible by (k-1), then check if (n-1)/(k-1) +1 is a power of k.\n    # Wait, no. From the equation: k^{m+1} = n(k - 1) + 1\n    # So for each k >= 2, compute x = n*(k-1) + 1, and check if x is a power of k.\n    # If yes, then return True.\n    # So for example, for n=13, k=3: x = 13*2 + 1 = 27 = 3^3. So yes.\n    # Also, for n=6: trying k=2, x = 6*1 +1 =7, which is not a power of 2. k=3: 6*2 +1=13, not a power of 3. etc. So returns false.\n    # So this seems better.\n    # So the approach is: iterate k from 2 to some upper bound, compute x = n*(k-1)+1, and check if x is a power of k.\n    # Now, what is the upper bound for k? Since x = n*(k-1) +1 >= k^2 (since m+1 >= 2, because m >=1)\n    # So k^2 <= x = n(k-1)+1\n    # Rearranged: k^2 -n(k-1) -1 <=0\n    # Solving for k, but perhaps it's easier to find an upper bound for k. For example, since x = n(k-1) +1 >= k^2, then k^2 <= n(k-1) +1\n    # Let's approximate for large k: k^2 ~ nk => k ~ n. So upper bound for k is up to sqrt(n) + something. But for n up to 1e18, even sqrt(n) is 1e9, which is too big for t=1e4.\n    # However, considering that the original approach may not be feasible for large n, but with the new approach, maybe we can optimize further.\n    # However, for the problem constraints, n can be up to 1e18, and t up to 1e4. So we need an efficient way.\n    # So the new approach is better, but how to implement it?\n    # For each k from 2 to some upper limit, compute x = n*(k-1) +1, then check if x is a power of k.\n    # How to check if x is a power of k? We can do log(x)/log(k) and see if it's integer. But due to precision issues, better to do iterative multiplication.\n    # So for x, check if there exists an exponent m such that k^m = x.\n    # So for example, start with current = k, multiply by k until it exceeds x. If during this process, current equals x, return True.\n    # Now, the upper bound for k is such that k^2 <= n*(k-1) +1. Let's approximate for k.\n    # For large k, n*(k-1) +1 ≈ nk. So k^2 <= nk → k <= n. But this is too large for k up to 1e18.\n    # However, for n=1e18, checking k up to say 1e6 would be feasible for t=1e4.\n    # But for n=1e18, even k=1e6 would take O(1e6) operations per test case. For t=1e4, this would be 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n    # So this approach may not be feasible. Need another idea.\n    # Let's think back to the original problem. What are the valid values of n?\n    # For any k >=2 and m >=1, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n    # So for any n that can be written in this form, the answer is YES.\n    # So for example, n=1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m for m >=1 and k >=2.\n    # So for each possible m, we can check if there exists a k such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n    # But for m up to log_2(n), since for m=1, the sum is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. So n can be any number >= 3 (since k>=2, n=3,4,...)\n    # So for m=1, the possible n is k+1, which can be any integer >=3.\n    # But according to the problem statement, the step after the initial addition must be done at least once. Which means that m+1 >=2, i.e., m >=1. So for m=1, the sum is 1 +k, which is allowed.\n    # Wait, this contradicts the earlier understanding. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n    # The problem says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n    # So the initial step is adding k vertices. Then, the next step (connecting those k vertices to k new ones) must be done at least once. So the minimal number of vertices is 1 + k + k^2. Which corresponds to m=2 (sum from i=0 to 2 of k^i).\n    # So the correct formula is sum_{i=0}^m k^i where m >= 2.\n    # So the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), and m+1 >=3 → m >=2.\n    # So for example, m=2: sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n    # Thus, for the problem, we need to check whether n can be expressed as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some k >=2 and m >=2.\n    # So the equation becomes: n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for k >=2, m >=2.\n    # So the approach is to check for all possible k and m such that this equation holds.\n    # For a given n, we can iterate over possible m values (starting from 2) and see if there exists a k such that this equation holds.\n    # Let's try this approach.\n    # For each m from 2 to log_2(n) (since for m=2, k^3-1/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1, which for k=2 is 7. So for n=7, m=2, k=2 is valid).\n    # For each m, we can solve for k in the equation (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n    # This is equivalent to finding integer k such that k^{m+1} -1 = n(k-1).\n    # Rearranged: k^{m+1} - n*k + (n -1) = 0.\n    # This is a polynomial equation in k, and solving it for integer k >=2 is challenging.\n    # However, for fixed m, we can perform a binary search on k.\n    # For example, for a given m, the function f(k) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing with k. So for each m, we can binary search for k such that f(k) = n.\n    # Let's see for m=2: f(k) = k^3-1/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1.\n    # So for n=13, k^2 +k +1 =13 → k^2 +k -12=0 → k=( -1 ± sqrt(1 +48))/2 → sqrt(49)=7 → k=( -1+7)/2=3. So k=3 is valid.\n    # So for each m from 2 to log_2(n), perform binary search on k to see if there exists an integer k >=2 such that f(k) =n.\n    # Now, what is the maximum m we need to consider? For m=2, the minimal value of f(k) is 2^3-1/(2-1) = 7. For larger m, the function grows faster. So for n=1e18, the maximum m is small.\n    # For example, for m=50, k=2: f(k) = 2^51-1/(2-1) = 2^51-1 ≈ 2e15, which is less than 1e18. For m=60, k=2: f(k) = 2^61-1 ≈ 2e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for m up to around 60, we can cover all possibilities.\n    # So the plan is:\n    # For each test case n:\n    #   if n < 7: return NO (since the minimal possible is 7 for k=2, m=2)\n    #   else:\n    #       for m in 2 to 60:\n    #           perform binary search for k in [2, ...] such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n\n    #           if found, return YES\n    #       if none found, return NO\n    # Now, the binary search for k:\n    # For a fixed m, the function f(k) increases with k. So we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound.\n    # The upper bound can be determined as follows: for m+1, the minimal value of f(k) for a given m is when k=2. So for a given n, the upper bound for k is roughly n^(1/(m+1)) + 1.\n    # But for binary search, we can set the upper bound as n (since for k=n, f(k) = n^{m+1} -1 / (n-1) which is much larger than n for m >=2).\n    # But for efficiency, we can use a higher upper bound.\n    # Now, implement this logic in code.\n\n    # Edge cases:\n    # n=1: no\n    # n=2: no\n    # n=3: no (because minimal is 7)\n    # n=7: yes (k=2, m=2)\n    # So first, check if n < 7 → return NO\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    # Now for m from 2 to 60\n    max_m = 60\n    for m in range(2, max_m + 1):\n        # For this m, find k such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n\n        # Binary search k from 2 to upper_bound\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find an upper bound for k\n        # For k=2, f(k) = 2^{m+1} -1 / (2-1) = 2^{m+1} -1\n        # We need to find high such that f(high) >= n\n        # Start with high=2 and double until f(high) >=n\n        while True:\n            val = (high ** (m+1) - 1) // (high - 1)\n            if val >= n:\n                break\n            high *= 2\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            try:\n                # Compute f(mid)\n                numerator = mid ** (m+1) - 1\n                denominator = mid - 1\n                if denominator == 0:\n                    val = 0\n                else:\n                    val = numerator // denominator\n            except:\n                val = float('inf')\n            if val == n:\n                return True\n            elif val < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
