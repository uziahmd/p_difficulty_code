He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all a's. But there has to be at least one 'a' here.\n2. Then B appends some number of 'b's. So after this step, the string is a bunch of a's followed by b's. And there must be at least one 'b' added here. Because the problem says that after B's step, there's at least one a and one b. So the original string from A can't be empty, and B adds at least one b. So the total a's count is at least 1, and the total b's count is at least 1.\n3. Then C appends some number of 'c's. The number of c's added must be equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the string at that point. Also, note that when C adds the c's, the string is a's followed by b's followed by c's. Because each step appends to the end.\n\nSo the final string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the structure of the string must be a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. If the string doesn't follow this structure, then it's automatically invalid.\n\nSo first thing I need to check is that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. For example, if there's a 'c' before a 'b', that's invalid. Or if there's an 'a' after a 'b', that's invalid. So the first check is to see that the string is properly ordered.\n\nSo for example, the input 'bbacc' would be invalid because after the initial a's and b's, there's a 'c' but then another 'a' comes after. Wait, no. Wait, the original steps are that A creates a string of a's, then B appends b's. Then C appends c's. So the final string must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So any occurrence of a character that is not in order (like a 'b' followed by an 'a') would be invalid. So the first check is that the string is composed of a's, then b's, then c's. So the string must be in the form of a* b* c*.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is in this format. How can I do that? Well, I can check that all the a's come before any b's, and all the b's come before any c's. For example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b' or 'a', etc.\n\nSo let's think about how to check that. For example, the string can be split into three parts: the a part, the b part, the c part. So, for the entire string, the first occurrence of a 'b' must be after all the a's, and the first occurrence of a 'c' must be after all the b's. So, perhaps we can check that the string is made up of a's, then b's, then c's. So for example, the string can be divided into three sections where the first section is all a's, the second all b's, third all c's.\n\nSo, how to check that. Let's think of the string as having three parts. Let's find the first occurrence of 'b' and 'c'.\n\nAnother approach is to check that the string does not have any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b's after a 'c'. So, for example, once a 'b' is encountered, there should be no 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there should be no 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nSo, for the string, we can check that the characters are in non-decreasing order according to their letters. Because 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So the entire string must be in order. So, for example, if the string is 'aabbc', that's okay. But 'abac' is not okay because after the 'b' comes an 'a'.\n\nSo, the first check is that the string is in order. So, for each character in the string, it should not be less than the previous character. Wait, no. Because the order is a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, the characters must be non-decreasing. For example, 'aaabbbcc' is okay. But 'aabbaacc' is not okay because after the b's, there's a 'a' again.\n\nSo, the first step is to check that the string is in non-decreasing order. Wait, but that's not exactly correct. Because the string can have a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, the entire string must be a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's. So, for example, the string can be split into three parts. So, the first part is all a's, then the next part is all b's, then all c's.\n\nSo, for example, the string 'aabcc' is valid. But 'abacb' is invalid. So, how to check this?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and check that once a 'b' is encountered, there are no more 'a's. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there are no more 'a's or 'b's.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nInitialize flags for a, b, c. Initially, a is allowed. Once a 'b' is found, a is not allowed anymore. Once a 'c' is found, b is not allowed anymore.\n\nAlternatively, we can check the following:\n\nThe string must consist of a's, then b's, then c's. So, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all a's. The first occurrence of 'c' must be after all b's.\n\nSo, for example, if the string has a 'b' and a 'c', then the first 'c' must come after the first 'b'.\n\nBut how to check this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nCheck that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So:\n\n- All a's are before any b's and c's.\n- All b's are before any c's.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be split into three parts. Let's find the index where the a's end and the b's start, and where the b's end and the c's start.\n\nBut maybe the string can have only a's and b's, or only a's and c's, etc. Wait, but according to the problem statement, after B appends the b's, there is at least one a and one b. Then C appends c's. But the number of c's can be zero? No, wait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. So the number of c's must be at least zero? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nC appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. However, since C is a good friend, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. So, the number of c's added must be equal to the count of a's or the count of b's in the string before adding the c's. But since the number of c's added is some number, but it's possible that it's zero? No, because the problem says \"some number of letters 'c'\". Wait, but the problem says \"some number\" which could be zero? Or does \"some number\" imply that it's at least one?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'. He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.\"\n\nSo, B appends some number of 'b's, but that number must be at least 1. Because after appending, there is at least one 'a' and 'b'.\n\nSimilarly, when C appends the 'c's, the problem says that he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. But the problem says that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. So, for example, if the number of 'a's is zero (which is impossible, because after B's step, there is at least one 'a'), then the number of 'c's would be zero? But that's not possible. Wait, but the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c'. So, \"some number\" could be zero? Or does \"some number\" mean at least one?\n\nThis is ambiguous. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"C now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\"\n\nBut the note says that in the third example, the input is 'aabc' which is aabc. So the counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. So the number of c's is equal to the number of b's (1). So the number of c's added is 1. So in this case, the c's added is 1. So the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. But the problem says that the number of 'c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string before adding the c's. So the number of c's added must be equal to either the count of a's (before adding c's) or the count of b's (before adding c's). So, since the count of a's and b's are at least 1 (from the earlier steps), the number of c's added is at least 1. So, the final string must have at least one 'c'? No, wait, because the problem says that C appends some number of letters. But what if the number of c's added is zero? But according to the problem statement, the number of c's is equal to the count of a's or the count of b's. So, for example, if the count of a's is zero (but that's impossible, because the original string from A had some a's, and B added some b's. So the count of a's is at least 1, and the count of b's is at least 1. So the number of c's added is equal to either a_count or b_count, which is at least 1. So C appends at least 1 'c's. Therefore, the final string must have at least one 'c'.\n\nBut that's not true. Wait, suppose that the count of a's is zero? No, because the original string from A is some number of a's, so at least one. Then B appends some number of b's. So the count of a's is at least one. So when C appends c's, the count of a's is at least one, and count of b's is at least one. So the number of c's added is equal to either a_count or b_count. Which is at least one. Therefore, the final string must have at least one c. Therefore, the final string must contain at least one a, one b, and one c. So the string must have all three characters present. Wait, but what if the count of a's is zero? No, because the original string from A is some number of a's. So the count of a's is at least 1. Then B adds at least one b. Then C adds at least one c. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, one c. Therefore, if the input string does not contain all three characters, it's invalid. For example, if the string is 'aaa', then it's invalid because there are no b's or c's. Similarly, 'aab' would have no c's, so invalid. So the first check is that the string has at least one a, one b, and one c. Wait, but the problem says that the input string can be given. But according to the problem's note, the third example is 'aabc', which has a, b, c. So the input string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. So, in our code, first we can check that the counts of a, b, c are all at least 1. If not, output is NO.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the string may have only a's and b's? No, because C must have added some c's. So the final string must have at least one c. So, the input string must have at least one c. Otherwise, it's invalid. So, for example, if the input string is 'aab', then the answer is NO. So, the first checks are:\n\n- The string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nBut also, the order of the string must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, the first check is that the string is in the form a* b* c*, and that there's at least one a, one b, one c.\n\nSo, for example, the input 'aaabccc' is valid. The counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. So the number of c's is equal to the number of a's. So that's acceptable.\n\nNow, once the string is in the correct order and has all three characters, then we need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts. Let's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of b's in the string.\n\ncount_c = number of c's in the string.\n\nBut according to the process, the count_c must be equal to count_a (before adding c's) or count_b (before adding c's). But when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's is the same as in the string before adding the c's. Because the string before adding the c's is the a's followed by b's. So, the count_a is the original count of a's (from A's string), and count_b is the original count of b's (from B's appending). Then C appends count_c = count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. But in the final string, count_a_initial is count_a (since no a's were added after that). Similarly, count_b_initial is count_b (since no b's were added after that). So, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the count_c is the number of c's added. So, the count_c in the final string is equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. Because when C appends the c's, the count_c is exactly the number of c's added. So, in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nBut in the final string, count_a_initial is the count of a's in the string (since no a's were added after that). Similarly, count_b_initial is the count of b's in the string (since no b's were added after that). So, the count_c in the final string must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, the condition is that count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the count_c is the number of c's added. So, in the final string, count_c is equal to count_a_initial (the count of a's before adding c's) or count_b_initial (the count of b's before adding c's). But since in the final string, count_a_initial is count_a (the count of a's in the string), and count_b_initial is count_b (the count of b's in the string). So, the condition is that count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. (i.e., the order is correct)\n2. Check that the string contains at least one a, one b, and one c.\n3. Check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are satisfied, then output YES, else NO.\n\nBut let me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. So count_c is 3. Which equals count_a (3). So yes.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So yes.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the string is 'bba...'. Wait, the string is 'bbacc' → the order is b, b, a, c, c. So the a comes after the b's, which is invalid. So the first check (order) would fail. Hence output NO, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → order is correct. counts a:2, b:2, c:1. count_c is 1. Which is not equal to a (2) or b (2). So output NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abcc' → order is correct. a:1, b:1, c:2. count_c is 2. Which is equal to a (1)? No. Equal to b (1)? No. So output NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=1. So count_c is 1, which equals a or b. So output YES.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So count_c is 2, which equals a and b. So yes.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabcc'? a=2, b=1, c=2. So count_c is 2. Which is equal to a (2). So yes.\n\nSo, the logic seems to hold.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the input string S:\n\n- Check that the order is a's followed by b's followed by c's. How?\n\nWe can check that the string is in non-decreasing order. Because each character must be >= the previous. Because a < b < c. So if the string is in non-decreasing order, then it's a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\nBut wait, what about 'aaabbbcc'? It's non-decreasing. Yes. So, the check for order can be done by checking that for all i > 0, S[i] >= S[i-1]. If this is true, then the string is in order. But if not, then it's invalid.\n\nBut for example, 'aabb' is valid, but 'abba' is invalid.\n\nSo, the first check is to verify that the string is non-decreasing. Then, check that there is at least one a, one b, one c. Then check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nCheck that the string is non-decreasing. How?\n\nLoop through each character from index 1 to end, check if current character is >= previous. If any is not, then invalid.\n\nThen, check that the string contains at least one a, one b, one c. So:\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1 → invalid.\n\nThen, check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all those conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the counts of a and b? Because during the process, the original a's and b's are present. For example, the count of a's in the string is the original count from A. The count of b's is the original count from B. So, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. Which is exactly what we check.\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: 'abc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=1. c equals a (1) or b (1). So yes.\n\nCase 2: 'abbbc' → counts a=1, b=3, c=1. c equals a (1) → yes.\n\nCase 3: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. c is not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nCase 4: 'aabcc' → a=2, b=1, c=2. c equals a (2). So yes.\n\nCase 5: 'abbcc' → a=1, b=2, c=2. c equals b (2). So yes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabbcc' → c is 2, a is 2, b is 2. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → count_c is 3, which equals a (3) or b (3). So yes.\n\nWhat about a string that is ordered correctly, but the counts don't match?\n\nLike 'aabcc' → a=2, b=1, c=2. So yes. But if the string was 'aabbc' → a=2, b=2, c=1. Then count_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nNow, let's check the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts a=3, b=1, c=3. c equals a. So yes.\n\nSample input 2: 'bbacc' → the order is not correct. Because the first two are 'b's, then 'a', which is less than 'b'. So the non-decreasing check fails. So output is no.\n\nSample input 3: 'aabc' → order is a, a, b, c. Correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. c equals b. So yes.\n\nSo the sample outputs are correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcc' → order is correct. a=1, b=1, c=2. c is not equal to a or b. So output no.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → order is correct. a=1, b=3, c=1. c equals a (1). So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → c is 2. Not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nSo, the code needs to perform these steps.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string. Then:\n\nCheck the order.\n\nHow to check the order:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        return NO\n\nThen, check that the counts of a, b, c are all >=1.\n\nThen, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf all of these, return YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the counts of a and b? For example, the string could have a's and b's but no c's. But in that case, the check for count_c >=1 would fail. So, the code would return no.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nImplementing this:\n\nIn Python:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen:\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n\n    # Check order\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    # Check counts\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    # Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        return True\n\n    else:\n\n        return False\n\nBut wait, this is not sufficient. Because the order check may pass, but the string may not have a's followed by b's followed by c's. For example, the string 'aabbcc' is okay. But what if the string is 'aabbc'? Then, the order is correct (non-decreasing). But the counts are a=2, b=2, c=1. So count_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So returns false.\n\nBut what about the string 'aabbcc'? Then count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So yes.\n\nBut what about the string 'abba'? The order check would fail, since the third character is 'b' which is less than the previous 'a'? No. Wait, the string 'abba' would have 'a' followed by 'b' (ok), then 'b' followed by 'a' (which is less than 'b'). So the order check would return false. So that's handled.\n\nAnother example: 'abcb' → order check would find that 'c' is after 'b' (ok), but then 'b' is after 'c', which is less. So returns false.\n\nSo the order check is correct.\n\nBut what about the string 'aabbcc'? The order is correct. So the code proceeds.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about the case where the string is 'aabcc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c equals count_a. So returns true.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → order is correct. count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So 1 not equal to 2. So returns false.\n\nBut what if the string is 'abc'? count_c is 1, which equals count_a (1) and count_b (1). So returns true.\n\nBut what if the string is 'abcc'? count_c is 2. count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So 2 is not equal to 1. So returns false.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The order check would check for i=2 (third character, index 2), which is 'a' compared to previous 'b'. 'a' < 'b' → returns false. So the code returns false, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a string, and the output is YES or NO.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line, which is the string S.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Because in the problem statement, the input is given as a single string. But the sample input shows a list of strings, which is probably a mistake. Looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 5000). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo, the input is a single string. However, in the sample input, the user provided a list of strings, which is probably a formatting error. For example, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nOutput:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nWhich suggests that the problem is actually a batch of test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. But perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the code should read multiple test cases. But the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nBut the input is given as a single string. So, perhaps the sample input is written in a wrong way. For example, the sample input may be three separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one string per line. But the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is given in a way that is confusing.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. So the code should read one line from stdin, process it, and output YES or NO.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple strings. So perhaps the problem is in the way the sample is presented. For example, the sample input may be a list of test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one string per line. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that is not matching the actual input.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin. So, for example, in the sample input, perhaps the user is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code should read one string per line. However, in the problem statement, the input is a single string.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is in the way the sample is presented. For example, in the sample input, the user shows a list of strings, but the actual input is a single string. So, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, and the code should read multiple lines. But the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 5000). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo the code should read one line, which is the string S. So the sample input is probably a mistake. For example, the sample input may be:\n\nSample Input:\n\naaabccc\n\nSample Output:\n\nYES\n\nBut the sample shows a list of three strings and outputs. So perhaps the problem is in a programming competition where multiple test cases are given. But the problem says that the input is a single string.\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output given in the problem:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So this is likely a mistake in the problem description. Perhaps the actual input is multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut given that the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout, and given that the sample input shows a list of strings, perhaps the actual problem expects to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows a list of strings, and the output is a list of answers, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the problem is expecting that the input is a list of strings (each on its own line), and the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is given as a string S. So perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly. For example, the sample input may be three separate test cases, each given on their own line, and the sample output is the corresponding outputs.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So this is a confusion.\n\nBut since the sample input shows that the input is a list of strings, but the problem says that the input is a single string, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, given that the user has provided the sample input and output, perhaps the code should read multiple lines (each line being a test case), and for each line, output YES or NO.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut given that the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout, and given that the sample input is a list of strings, perhaps the actual input is multiple lines, each being a test case. So, for example, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case, and output the corresponding result for each.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output show that the code must process multiple test cases, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake, and the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the actual code should read a single string.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple strings, perhaps the code should read multiple lines. For example, in the sample input, the first line is ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user is using a list to represent the input strings, but in reality, the input is given as multiple lines.\n\nAssuming that the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a separate test case. For example, the code should read all lines from stdin, and for each line, output YES or NO.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is confusing.\n\nHowever, given that the sample input shows a list of strings, and the sample output shows a list of answers, perhaps the actual code should process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process it as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from stdin, for each line, process it.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are as such, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each given on a separate line. So, for example, the code would read each line, process it, and output the corresponding answer.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake. However, the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and print output to stdout. So perhaps the code should read one line from stdin, process it, and output one line.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three answers. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nIn the problem statement's sample input, perhaps the user is using a list to represent the input, but in reality, the input is given as multiple lines. For example, the sample input is:\n\naaabccc\n\nbbacc\n\naabc\n\nAnd the output is:\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nSo, the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nGiven that, the code should read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process it and output YES or NO.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. But perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the actual input is multiple test cases. Given that the sample shows that, perhaps the code should read multiple lines.\n\nBut since the problem says that the input is a single string, I'm confused.\n\nBut given that the sample input is given as a list of strings, but the problem says that the input is a single string, I think that the problem statement may have a mistake. However, given that the user provided the sample input and output, and the code is supposed to handle that, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut for the sake of solving the problem, perhaps the code should read one line, process it, and output one line. For example, the sample input is a single string, and the sample output is a single line. But the sample input and output given in the problem are lists, which is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nBut this is likely a formatting error. Perhaps the actual input is three lines, each being one of the strings. And the output is three lines, each being the corresponding answer.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process it and print the result.\n\nBut how to handle this in Python?\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from stdin, for each line, process it, and print the result.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, I think the code should read a single string from input. However, given that the sample input shows multiple strings, perhaps the code should read multiple lines.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S...\n\nSo, the code should read a single line.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple strings, which suggests that the problem may have multiple test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a single string, I'll proceed under that assumption. So the code reads one line, processes it, and outputs YES or NO.\n\nBut then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of appending characters. The string must be composed of 'a's followed by 'b's and then 'c's, with the number of 'c's being equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must be in non-decreasing order of characters, i.e., all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's.\n2. **Check Presence**: Ensure that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n3. **Check Count Validity**: Verify that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid(s):\n    # Check if the string is in non-decreasing order\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    \n    # Count occurrences of each character\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if all three characters are present\n    if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    return count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b\n\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        if is_valid(s):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The loop iterates through the string to ensure each character is not less than the previous one, ensuring the correct order of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n2. **Presence Check**: Using `count` method, we ensure there is at least one occurrence of each character 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n3. **Count Validity Check**: We verify if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's, which is a requirement based on the problem description.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently validate the string against all given constraints, providing the correct result in linear time relative to the length of the string.",
