The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every two districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nSo the key here is to select which districts to keep such that they form a connected subtree, and the sum of their 2^i is as large as possible. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the districts with higher i values, but we have to ensure connectivity.\n\nWait, but the problem is that removing k districts means keeping n - k districts. So we need to choose a connected subtree of size (n - k) that has the maximum possible sum of 2^i. Then, the districts not in this subtree are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how do we find this subtree?\n\nSince 2^i increases exponentially with i, the optimal strategy would be to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. However, they must form a connected subtree. So perhaps we can think of it as selecting a subtree that includes the highest possible districts, and then trimming down to the required size.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that the districts with higher numbers have higher values. So ideally, we want to include as many of them as possible. But since the tree is connected, we need to make sure that they are connected.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to start from the highest-numbered district and perform some kind of selection process where we greedily include the largest possible nodes while maintaining connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we need to select a subtree of size (n - k) that maximizes the sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, and each node's value is 2^i, which is unique and increases with i, the optimal subtree would include the largest possible nodes, but connected.\n\nSo perhaps the way to approach this is to build a tree where we prioritize including higher-numbered nodes. For example, we can perform a traversal starting from the highest node, and then include as many of the higher nodes as possible, ensuring that the subtree remains connected.\n\nWait, but how to model this? Maybe we can use a priority-based approach where we select nodes in order of their value, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nAnother idea: since the sum is the sum of 2^i for the nodes kept, and 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the optimal solution is to keep the (n -k) largest nodes possible, but they must form a connected subtree. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the connected subtree that includes as many of the largest nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find that subtree?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- We need to select a subset of nodes of size s = n -k. These nodes must form a connected subtree.\n\n- The best way to maximize the sum is to include the largest possible nodes. However, since they might not be connected, we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to determine which ones to include?\n\nThis feels similar to the problem of finding a tree with certain properties. One approach could be to start with the largest node, then add the next largest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree. But how to implement this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a maximum spanning tree where the nodes are weighted by their 2^i values. Wait, but the tree is already given. So perhaps we need to find a subtree that contains the maximum possible nodes with high indices, connected.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the largest node (say, node n). This node must be part of the subtree.\n\n2. Then, we need to add other nodes, but they must be connected to the existing subtree. However, since the tree is connected, perhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the largest node, and collect the nodes in order of their priority (i.e., higher nodes first), but ensuring that we collect enough nodes to reach size s = n -k.\n\nBut wait, if we take the largest node and then all the nodes connected to it in a way that allows us to collect the largest possible nodes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as choosing a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, and for that, we can perform a priority-based traversal where we prioritize nodes with higher indices. For example, we can perform a BFS or DFS, but always expanding the subtree by adding the highest possible available nodes first.\n\nBut how to ensure that the subtree has exactly s nodes?\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by taking the highest possible nodes and their necessary connections. So the idea is to select the nodes with the highest possible values, and then ensure that they are connected. For example, if the highest node is n, then we need to include all the nodes that are necessary to connect the other high nodes.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a problem where we need to select a subtree of size s, and we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. To do this, we can perform a greedy algorithm where we start with the highest-numbered node and then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think about using a priority queue (max heap) approach. Here's an idea:\n\n- Start with the highest-numbered node (node n). Add it to the selected set.\n\n- Then, for each step, we look for the highest-numbered node that is adjacent to the current selected set and not yet included. Add it to the selected set.\n\n- Repeat until the selected set has size s.\n\nThis way, we are greedily adding the highest possible nodes that can be connected to the existing subtree.\n\nBut how to efficiently check which nodes are adjacent to the current selected set?\n\nThis sounds like a BFS or Dijkstra-like approach where we track the nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree and select the next best one.\n\nBut for large n (up to 1e6), we need an efficient way to do this.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. Let's imagine that we have a priority queue (max heap) that contains all the nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree but not yet included. Initially, the current subtree is {n}, and the adjacent nodes are its neighbors. We can push those into the priority queue.\n\nThen, in each step, we extract the node with the maximum number from the priority queue, add it to the subtree, and then add its neighbors that are not already in the subtree or the priority queue to the priority queue.\n\nWait, but how to track which nodes are already in the priority queue or the subtree?\n\nWe can have a visited array. For example:\n\n- Initially, the subtree is {n}, and we mark it as visited.\n\n- For each neighbor of n, if they are not visited, add them to the priority queue.\n\nThen, for each step:\n\n- Extract the max node from the priority queue.\n\n- Add it to the subtree.\n\n- For each neighbor of this node, if not visited, add to the priority queue.\n\nThis way, the subtree is built in a way that always adds the highest possible node available at each step.\n\nThis approach would give us a subtree of size s, which includes the highest possible nodes. Because each time we pick the highest possible node that is adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nBut why does this work? Because by choosing the highest possible node each time, we ensure that the nodes with higher values are included first, thus maximizing the sum.\n\nYes! Because the priority queue always selects the next highest node that can be added to the subtree. This way, the sum is maximized.\n\nOnce we have this subtree of size s, the nodes not in it are the ones to be removed. Then, we collect those nodes, sort them, and output them.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute s = n -k.\n\n- Find the subtree of size s that includes the highest possible nodes, using the greedy approach above.\n\n- The nodes not in this subtree are the ones to remove.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, the tree is given as an adjacency list. So for each node, we have a list of neighbors.\n\nWe need to build a max-heap (priority queue) that allows us to get the next highest node.\n\nBut in Python, the heapq module is a min-heap. So to simulate a max-heap, we can insert negative numbers.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, we need an efficient way to handle this. Let's proceed.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n1. Read n and k, then read the n-1 edges and build the adjacency list.\n\n2. Compute s = n -k.\n\n3. Initialize a visited array (or set) to track which nodes are in the selected subtree.\n\n4. Initialize a priority queue (max heap). Initially, we start with node n. Add it to the visited set, and then add all its neighbors to the priority queue (but only if not visited).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial step is to start with node n. Then, the priority queue contains all nodes adjacent to n. Because those are the candidates to be added next.\n\nBut the priority queue will be used to select the next node to add to the subtree.\n\nBut how to manage the priority queue. Let's think:\n\nInitialize a max heap. Start with node n. Mark it as visited. Then, for all neighbors of node n, add them to the heap. Then, for each step, pop the max node from the heap. Add it to the subtree. Then, for each of its neighbors, if not visited, add them to the heap. Mark them as visited once added to the heap.\n\nWait, but when you add a neighbor to the heap, you have to make sure that it's not already in the heap or already processed. So, the visited array is needed to prevent adding duplicates.\n\nWait, but the way the algorithm works is that once a node is added to the heap (even if it's not popped yet), it's marked as visited. Because otherwise, multiple entries for the same node can be added to the heap. For example, suppose a node is adjacent to two nodes already in the subtree. Then, when we process those nodes, their neighbors (the same node) would be added to the heap multiple times. But since we mark them as visited once added to the heap, this is avoided.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When a node is added to the heap, it's because it's adjacent to the current subtree. Once added to the heap, we mark it as visited, so that when processing other nodes, we don't add it again. Because if a node is already in the heap (but not yet processed), adding it again would result in duplicates. But in this case, the algorithm would process the same node multiple times. Which is not desired.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\n- The visited array marks whether the node is in the subtree or in the priority queue. So when a node is added to the priority queue, it's marked as visited. Then, when processing a node, we look at its neighbors. For each neighbor, if not visited, add to the priority queue and mark as visited.\n\nThis way, each node is added to the priority queue exactly once.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize:\n\nselected_nodes = empty set\n\nvisited = array of booleans, initialized to False\n\npriority_queue = max heap\n\nStart with node n. Add it to the selected_nodes, mark visited[n] = True. Then, add all its neighbors to the priority queue, and mark them as visited. Wait, no. Wait, the initial node is added to the selected_nodes. Then, the neighbors are not in the selected_nodes, but they are adjacent to the selected_nodes. So, they can be considered for addition. So, we add them to the priority queue, and mark them as visited (so that they are not added again through other paths).\n\nThen, for each step until we have selected s nodes:\n\n   Pop the node with maximum value from the priority queue.\n\n   Add it to the selected_nodes.\n\n   For each neighbor of this node:\n\n      if not visited:\n\n          mark as visited\n\n          add to the priority queue.\n\nSo, the initial node is added to selected_nodes. Then, the process continues.\n\nWait, but initially, the priority queue contains the neighbors of node n. Then, the first iteration pops the maximum among those, adds it to selected_nodes, and adds its neighbors (if not visited) to the queue.\n\nThis way, the selected_nodes grows by one each time, until it reaches size s.\n\nYes. So, the total number of steps is s-1 steps. Because we start with 1 node (n) and add s-1 more nodes.\n\nBut what if the tree is such that even after adding all possible nodes, the size is less than s? Well, since the tree is connected, and s is n -k, which is less than n, the process will stop once the selected_nodes has s elements.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nselected_nodes starts with {n}\n\nthen, for (s-1) times:\n\n   select the maximum possible node adjacent to the current subtree and add it.\n\nThus, this process ensures that the selected_nodes is a connected subtree of size s, and that the nodes in it are as high as possible.\n\nOnce we have selected_nodes, the answer is all the nodes not in selected_nodes, sorted in increasing order.\n\nBut wait, let's test this against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3\n\nEdges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo the tree is structured as follows:\n\nLet me draw it:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nSo the tree:\n\nn=6, s = 6 -3 = 3.\n\nWe need to select 3 nodes.\n\nStart with node 6. Wait no, the initial node is n=6?\n\nWait, according to our approach, the starting node is n (the highest numbered node). For the first sample, n is 6.\n\nSo initial selected_nodes is {6}.\n\nThe neighbors of 6 are 2 and 5. So these are added to the priority queue. The priority queue has 5 and 2. Since it's a max heap, the next node to be selected is 5.\n\nAdd 5 to selected_nodes. Now selected_nodes is {6,5}. Then, check neighbors of 5: which is 6 (already in selected_nodes). So nothing added.\n\nNow, the priority queue has 2. Pop it. Add to selected_nodes. Now selected_nodes is {6,5,2} which is size 3. So we stop.\n\nThe selected nodes are 6,5,2. Their sum is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2 = 64 +32 +4= 100. Which matches the sample. The districts to remove are 1,3,4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works for the first sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n8 4\n\nSo n=8, k=4, s = 8-4=4.\n\nThe edges are:\n\n2 6\n\n2 7\n\n7 8\n\n1 2\n\n3 1\n\n2 4\n\n7 5\n\nSo the tree structure:\n\nLet me think. Node 2 is connected to 6,7,1,4.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 2, 8, 5.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 2, 3.\n\nNode 8 connected to 7.\n\nNode 5 connected to 7.\n\nSo the highest node is 8. Start with 8.\n\nNeighbors of 8: 7. Add 7 to the priority queue.\n\nNow, pop 7. Add to selected_nodes. Now selected_nodes is {8,7}.\n\nCheck neighbors of 7: 2, 8 (already in selected), 5. So add 2 and 5 to the priority queue. The priority queue now has 5 and 2. The next max is 5. Add it. Now selected_nodes is {8,7,5}. Then check neighbors of 5: 7 (in selected). No new nodes.\n\nPriority queue has 2. Pop it. Add to selected_nodes. Now size is 4. So selected_nodes are 8,7,5,2. The sum is 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^5 + 2^2 = 256 + 128 + 32 +4 = 420.\n\nThe districts to remove are the other four: 1,3,4,6. But the sample output is '1 3 4 5'? Wait sample output for the second input is '1 3 4 5'?\n\nWait sample input 2's output is ['1 3 4 5'].\n\nWait according to the sample input given, the second input is:\n\nInput:\n['8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\nSo the output is '1 3 4 5'.\n\nBut according to our algorithm, the selected nodes are 8,7,5,2. The removed nodes are 1,3,4,6. But the sample output is 1,3,4,5. That suggests that our approach is wrong here.\n\nWait that's a problem. What's wrong here?\n\nWait in the sample output, the districts removed are 1,3,4,5. Which implies that the selected nodes are 2,6,7,8. Let's compute their sum:\n\n2^2 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 = 4 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 452, which is higher than 420. So our algorithm's approach is not giving the correct answer here. So there's a mistake in the logic.\n\nHmm. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right, the algorithm starts with node 8, and adds 7, then 5, then 2. But perhaps there's a better selection. For example, selecting 8,7,2,6, but since s is 4, maybe the optimal is 8,7,2,6. Let's see:\n\nIn this case, the selected nodes are 8,7,2,6. Sum is 256+128+4+64= 452. Which is better than 420. So why didn't the algorithm choose this?\n\nBecause according to the algorithm, after selecting 8, then 7, then 5, then 2. But why didn't the algorithm choose 2 instead of 5?\n\nLet's retrace the steps.\n\nInitial selected_nodes is {8}.\n\nPriority queue has 7 (neighbor of 8). So pop 7, add to selected_nodes. Now selected_nodes is {8,7}.\n\nNeighbors of 7 are 2, 8 (already selected), 5. So add 2 and 5 to the priority queue. The priority queue now has 5 and 2. Which is higher? 5 is higher than 2. So the next node to be added is 5. So selected_nodes becomes {8,7,5}.\n\nThen, the priority queue has 2. Pop it. Add to selected_nodes. Now size is 4.\n\nBut if instead, when the priority queue had 5 and 2, the algorithm should have chosen 2 instead of 5. Because adding 2 would allow us to include higher nodes later. Wait, but 5 is higher than 2. So why would the algorithm not choose 5?\n\nBecause the algorithm is trying to add the highest possible node at each step, which would maximize the sum. But in this case, adding 5 gives us a node with value 2^5=32, whereas adding 2 gives 2^2=4. But then, adding 2 allows us to connect to 6 and 4, which are higher than 5?\n\nWait, but the algorithm is choosing 5 first, which is higher than 2. But that may lead to a suboptimal selection. Because adding 2 would allow adding 6 (which is higher than 5) later.\n\nAh! So the problem is that the greedy approach of choosing the highest possible node at each step is not optimal. Because sometimes, adding a lower node now allows adding higher nodes later.\n\nThis is a classic problem with greedy approaches. So this approach may not work for all cases.\n\nSo our previous reasoning was flawed. The greedy approach of selecting the highest node available at each step may not yield the optimal solution.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to select a subtree of size s, and maximize the sum of 2^i. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, and the 2^i values are exponentially increasing, the optimal selection is to include the s largest possible nodes, provided they are connected. However, the problem is that they may not be connected, so we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to select which ones?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the problem as selecting the s nodes with the highest possible values, and then checking if they form a connected subtree. If not, we need to add some lower nodes to connect them. However, this seems computationally expensive for large n.\n\nBut perhaps, given that the nodes are ordered by their value, we can find a way to select the nodes in a way that ensures connectivity.\n\nLet me think again. Since the 2^i values are strictly increasing with i, the optimal solution must include the s largest nodes possible. However, if these nodes are not connected, we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which ones to include?\n\nFor example, in the second sample, the s is 4. The largest 4 nodes are 8,7,6,5. Are they connected? Let's see:\n\nNode 8 is connected to 7. Node 7 is connected to 2. Node 6 is connected to 2. Node 5 is connected to 7. So the nodes 8,7,5,6 are connected via node 7 and 2. So the subtree containing these nodes would be connected. Thus, the optimal solution would be to include 8,7,6,5. But the sum would be 256+128+64+32 = 480. Which is higher than the 452 from earlier.\n\nBut why didn't our previous algorithm select this? Because the algorithm started with node 8, added 7, then added 5, then 2. So the selected nodes are 8,7,5,2. But the optimal is 8,7,6,5. How to get there?\n\nThe issue is that the algorithm's priority queue after adding 7 has 5 and 2. Choosing 5 (higher than 2) leads to adding it, but if instead we had added 2, then we could have added 6 later.\n\nSo the algorithm's greedy choice is not optimal.\n\nSo the problem with the initial approach is that it's too greedy and doesn't look ahead. It chooses the best immediate option, but that may prevent adding better options later.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the nodes' values are 2^i, which are exponentially increasing, the optimal solution is to include all the nodes from (n - s + 1) to n, but connected. But how to ensure that?\n\nWait, for example, in the second sample, s = 4. So the largest 4 nodes are 8,7,6,5. Are they connected?\n\nYes, because 8 is connected to 7, which is connected to 2, which is connected to 6. So the nodes 8,7,6,5 can be connected through 7,2,6 and 7,5.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal number of nodes to include to connect the largest s nodes. However, how to determine which nodes to include?\n\nBut how can we find that?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as selecting the nodes with the highest values, and then building a minimum spanning tree (but not sure). Alternatively, think of the problem as a priority on including higher nodes, but allowing for some lower nodes to be included to connect them.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to perform a BFS or DFS starting from the highest node, but during traversal, always prioritize visiting higher-numbered nodes first. However, this is similar to the initial approach but perhaps the error was in the way the priority queue was handled.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we need to select the s nodes with the highest values, and then find the minimal number of additional nodes to connect them. But this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a maximum spanning tree where the nodes are weighted by their 2^i values, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a variation of the maximum spanning tree problem. Since the goal is to have a connected subtree with maximum sum, which is equivalent to a spanning tree of the original tree (since the original tree is connected). But since the original tree is already connected, the maximum sum subtree of size s is a subtree that includes as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAnother thought: since the nodes' values are unique and increase with i, the optimal subtree must contain the s largest nodes, and possibly some smaller nodes to connect them. So the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of small nodes needed to connect the s largest nodes.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Collect all the nodes in a list sorted in decreasing order. Let's say sorted_nodes = [n, n-1, ..., 1].\n\n2. We need to select the first s nodes (the largest s nodes), but they may not be connected. So we need to find the minimal number of additional nodes to connect them. However, since the total number of nodes in the subtree is s, this is not possible. Wait, no. The s largest nodes may not be connected. So to connect them, we need to include some of the lower nodes. But the total number of nodes in the subtree is s. So how to choose which ones?\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think of the problem as selecting a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and the way to do this is to start with the highest node and perform a traversal that includes as many higher-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nPerhaps the initial approach was almost correct, but the priority queue should not be based on the node's value, but on something else. For example, during the traversal, the priority is to include higher nodes, but when a node is added to the subtree, it allows adding its neighbors. But the initial approach failed in the sample case because it added 5 before 2, which prevented adding 6.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that the algorithm should prioritize nodes that are part of the larger nodes. So, when considering which nodes to add next, we should prefer nodes that are part of the higher-numbered nodes.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAnother idea: the priority queue should prioritize nodes based on their own value, but also considering the potential of their subtree. However, this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a tree where we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and during the traversal, we prioritize nodes with higher numbers. However, in the second sample, the algorithm added 5 before 2, which was a mistake. Why?\n\nBecause the node 5 has a higher value than node 2. But adding node 2 allows connecting to node 6, which is higher than node 5. So the algorithm's choice was locally optimal but globally suboptimal.\n\nThis suggests that the initial greedy approach is incorrect. So what's the correct way to model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the optimal subtree must include all nodes from some threshold upwards, plus some connecting nodes. But how to find this threshold?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: since the value of each node is 2^i, which is exponentially larger than any lower node, the optimal subtree must include all nodes with i >= m for some m, and possibly some lower nodes to connect them. The question is to find the largest possible m such that the number of nodes >= m is at least s, and they form a connected subtree. But this is not necessarily true, as there may be cases where including a few lower nodes allows including more higher nodes.\n\nBut given the exponential nature, it's likely that the optimal solution includes as many high nodes as possible. So perhaps we can try to find the largest possible set of nodes with the highest indices, and then see if they are connected. If not, we need to add some lower nodes.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nFor example, in the second sample, the largest 4 nodes are 8,7,6,5. Are they connected? Yes. So the optimal solution is to include them. But how to find this?\n\nBut how to check if the largest s nodes are connected?\n\nIf they are connected, then we can select them. Otherwise, we need to find which lower nodes to include to connect them.\n\nBut how to check if the largest s nodes are connected?\n\nThis seems like a possible approach. Let's think:\n\n- Sort all nodes in descending order.\n\n- Take the first s nodes. Check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, then those are the nodes to select.\n\n- If not, then we need to include some lower nodes to connect them. But which ones?\n\nBut checking connectivity for the largest s nodes is not trivial. For large n (up to 1e6), this would require an efficient method.\n\nBut how to check if a subset of nodes forms a connected subtree?\n\nThis can be done by performing a BFS or DFS starting from the highest node in the subset, and seeing if all other nodes in the subset are reachable without going through nodes outside the subset.\n\nBut for large n and s, this might be expensive if done naively.\n\nBut given that the problem requires handling up to 1e6 nodes, we need an efficient way.\n\nHowever, this approach might not be feasible for large s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: since the nodes are ordered by their indices, and the values are exponentially increasing, the optimal solution must include all nodes from some x to n, and possibly some nodes below x to connect them. But how to find x?\n\nBut this seems unclear.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the tree's structure. Since the tree is connected, the subtree of the largest s nodes must be connected if they are all in a single connected component. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the tree as a rooted tree, and perform some kind of traversal that prioritizes higher-numbered nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to perform a BFS or DFS starting from the highest node, but during the traversal, always visit the children with higher numbers first. This way, we include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the second sample. Starting from 8, then 7, then 2, then 6. So the selected nodes would be 8,7,2,6. Which is size 4. But this is not the optimal solution, as the optimal is 8,7,6,5. So why isn't this being captured?\n\nBecause when you start at 8, then go to 7, then from 7, you have neighbors 8 (already selected), 2, and 5. If you prioritize visiting 5 first, then you get 5, but if you prioritize visiting 2 first, then you can get to 6. But how to decide which path to take?\n\nThis suggests that the order in which children are visited is crucial. If we prioritize higher-numbered children first, then from node 7, we would visit 5 (higher than 2?), no. Wait 5 is less than 2? No. 5 is higher than 2. So from node 7, the neighbors are 2, 8, and 5. So the highest-numbered neighbor is 8 (already selected), then 5, then 2. So the algorithm should visit 5 first. But that leads to adding 5, which is worse than adding 2.\n\nBut why? Because adding 2 allows adding 6, which is higher than 5.\n\nSo the problem is that the local choice of adding higher-numbered nodes may not be the best global choice.\n\nThis seems like a classic case where greedy algorithms fail. So what can be done?\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the value of each node is 2^i, which is much larger than the sum of all smaller nodes, the optimal solution must include the highest possible nodes, even if it means including some lower nodes to connect them. So, the optimal subtree is the one that includes as many high nodes as possible, and the minimal number of low nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nPerhaps, the correct way is to include all nodes with i >= m, for some m, and then include the minimal number of lower nodes to connect them. But how to find m?\n\nBut this seems difficult.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is maximized by including the highest possible nodes, perhaps the optimal solution is to include all nodes except for the smallest k nodes, but ensuring that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. However, this is not necessarily true, as removing the smallest k nodes might leave the subtree disconnected.\n\nFor example, if the smallest k nodes are in different branches of the tree, removing them might disconnect the tree.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to remove the smallest k nodes that are not part of the critical paths.\n\nBut how to identify which nodes to remove?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached with a priority queue, but with a different strategy.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: we want to keep the nodes that are most important for connectivity. Since the value of a node is 2^i, which is much larger than the sum of all lower nodes, it's better to keep higher nodes even if it means including some lower nodes for connectivity.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to keep all nodes except for the smallest k nodes, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected. However, this is not always possible. So, the idea is to remove the smallest k nodes that are not critical for connectivity.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes to remove?\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a priority queue that removes the smallest nodes first, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThis seems like the reverse of the previous approach. Let's think of it as follows:\n\nInitially, all nodes are in the tree. We need to remove k nodes, such that the remaining are connected and have the maximum sum.\n\nTo maximize the sum, we want to remove the nodes with the smallest values, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nSo the approach would be to remove the smallest nodes, but only if their removal does not disconnect the tree.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes to remove?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the minimum number of nodes to remove to keep the tree connected, but here we need to remove exactly k nodes, and the choice of which nodes to remove depends on their values.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be addressed with a priority queue, where we iteratively remove the smallest node that is not critical for connectivity.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes are critical?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps we can use the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a problem where we want to keep the nodes with the highest possible values. So, we can perform a process where we iteratively remove the smallest node possible, provided that its removal does not disconnect the tree.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the minimal number of nodes to remove to keep the tree connected, but here we need to remove exactly k nodes, and we want to remove the ones with the smallest values.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the full tree.\n\n2. We want to remove k nodes. To maximize the sum, we want to remove the k nodes with the smallest values, provided that their removal doesn't disconnect the tree.\n\n3. To do this, we can use a priority queue (min-heap) that contains all the nodes that are currently leaves (since removing a leaf doesn't disconnect the tree). At each step, we remove the smallest leaf node, add it to the list of removed nodes, and then update the tree.\n\nBut this approach may not work for all cases, but it's worth exploring.\n\nLet's try applying this to the second sample:\n\nSample 2:\n\nNodes: 1-8.\n\nWe need to remove 4 nodes.\n\nInitially, all nodes are in the tree. Let's find the leaves.\n\nWhich nodes are leaves? Let's look at the tree structure.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 2 and 3. Node 3 is a leaf. Node 6 is connected to 2, so if 2 is not a leaf, but node 6 is connected to 2. Let's see:\n\nThe tree is:\n\n- 2 is connected to 6, 7, 1, 4.\n\n- 7 is connected to 2, 8, 5.\n\n- 8 is connected to 7.\n\n- 5 is connected to 7.\n\n- 1 is connected to 2 and 3.\n\n- 3 is connected to 1.\n\n- 4 is connected to 2.\n\nSo the leaves are 3, 6, 4, 8, 5.\n\nInitially, the leaves are 3, 6, 4, 8, 5. The smallest among them is 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. The smallest is 3.\n\nRemove 3. Now, the tree is still connected. Now, the new leaves are 1 (since node 1 now has only one connection to 2), and the others.\n\nNext, the leaves are 1, 4, 5, 6,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected subtree with the maximum possible total number of fans. The districts are represented as nodes in a tree, and each node has a fan count of $2^i$ where $i$ is the district number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, which means there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: To maximize the sum of fans, we should prioritize keeping nodes with higher indices since $2^i$ increases exponentially with $i$. However, we must ensure the remaining nodes form a connected subtree.\n3. **Priority Queue (Max Heap)**: Use a max-heap to always select the next highest node that can be added to the current connected subtree.

This is done by checking neighbors of the current subtree and pushing them into the heap.\n4. **Result Construction**: After selecting the required number of nodes, we determine which nodes were not selected and output them in sorted order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by prioritizing higher-indexed nodes while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining districts.",
