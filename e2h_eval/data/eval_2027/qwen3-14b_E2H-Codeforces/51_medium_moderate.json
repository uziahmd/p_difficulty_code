Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is: combine the guest and host names into one string, then check if the pile's letters are a permutation of that combined string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to count the frequency of each character in the combined guest+host string, and compare it with the frequency in the pile. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines. Let's call them guest, host, pile.\n\n2. Combine guest and host into a single string, say combined = guest + host.\n\n3. Check if the sorted combined string is equal to the sorted pile string.\n\nWait, yes. Because if you sort both the combined and the pile, then if they are the same, then the pile is a permutation of the combined.\n\nBut what about the lengths? Well, if the lengths are different, then the sorted strings would be different. So checking the sorted strings would automatically take care of that.\n\nSo for example, if combined is \"ABC\" and pile is \"AB\", then sorted combined is \"ABC\", sorted pile is \"AB\", which are different. So the answer is NO.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: check if sorted(guest + host) equals sorted(pile).\n\nBut wait, let me think about the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS, host: DEDMOROZ. Combined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Then pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check the length. Let's see:\n\nOriginal guest: len(\"SANTACLAUS\") is 10 letters. Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" is 8 letters. Total 18 letters. The pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". Let me count the letters. Let me see, but maybe the code will handle that.\n\nBut when sorted, the combined and pile should be same.\n\nSo in code, the steps would be:\n\nRead three lines. Then combine first two, then check if the sorted combination equals sorted pile.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be something like:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\nif sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but the input is given as three lines. So in the sample input given, for example, the first case is:\n\nInput lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo combining the first two gives SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's check the length. Let me count:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S). DEDMOROZ is D E D M O R O Z: 8 letters. Total 18 letters. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me count that. Let's see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S. Let me count letters. Let me see:\n\nBut perhaps the code will handle that. So the code would work.\n\nBut what about cases where there are duplicate letters? For example, if the combined string has two 'A's and the pile has two 'A's, then sorted would match.\n\nYes, so this approach should work.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nguest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' and pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nLet me sort both.\n\nBut perhaps the code will handle that.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nguest is PAPAINOEL, host is JOULUPUKKI. Combined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me check the lengths. Guest is 9 letters, host is 10 letters. Combined is 19 letters. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nThe pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' — let's count letters. Let me see:\n\nBut maybe the code will catch that. For example, the combined string would have letters from guest and host. Let's see:\n\nThe guest is PAPAINOEL. Let's count letters:\n\nP, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L. So two P's, two A's, etc.\n\nHost is JOULUPUKKI: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. So three U's, two K's, etc.\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me check the length. Let me count the letters in the pile. Let me see:\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's count letters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I. Let me count letters. Let me see:\n\nBut maybe the code would find that the combined has a certain count, and the pile has different counts. For example, the sample says that there is a missing P and an extra L.\n\nSo the code would compare the sorted combined and sorted pile. If they are different, output NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: All letters same. For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\". Then output is YES.\n\nEdge case 2: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES. If pile is \"BA\" → same. If pile is \"AAB\" → NO.\n\nAnother edge case: empty lines? But according to the input description, all lines are not empty. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead three lines, combine first two, check if sorted combined equals sorted pile.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\nif sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but the input is given as three lines. So in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, but the input is three lines. So for each test case, the code reads three lines. But the sample input shows that there are three test cases. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is three lines. The sample input shows three test cases. Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\n\nSo for each test case, there are three lines. But the sample input shows three separate test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ... ]\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is three test cases, each with three lines. But the way the sample input is written is a bit confusing. Let me check the sample input and output again.\n\nSample input:\n\nThe input is given as three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\nThe first test case's input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThen the second test case's input is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nThird test case's input is:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nSo the sample input is three test cases, each with three lines. But how is that given as input? Well, the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So for each run, the code reads three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. How does that fit?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So for each test case, the input is three lines. But in the sample input, there are three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read three lines per test case, and process them. However, the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as three lines, and the output is three lines. But in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of three elements, each being a string with three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But that's not clear from the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is three lines. The output is one line (YES or NO). The sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines, and the output is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So for each test case, the code reads three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines once.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input file consists of three lines. So the code should read three lines from the input, and output one line (YES or NO). The sample input shows three test cases, but perhaps that's just part of the example. For example, in the sample input, the first input is three lines, and the output is YES. Then the second input is three lines, output is NO, etc. But how is that presented in the input? For example, perhaps the code is supposed to read three lines, process once, and output once. But in the sample input, there are three test cases, which would require reading three sets of three lines.\n\nBut that's conflicting with the problem's input description. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo for each test case, the input is three lines. So the code is supposed to read three lines, process them, and output YES or NO. The sample input shows three test cases, but that's probably because the problem is using multiple examples. For example, the first example's input is three lines, the output is YES. The second example's input is three lines, output is NO, etc.\n\nBut in the actual programming problem, the code is supposed to read three lines from the input, process once, and output once. So the sample input is three test cases, but each is processed separately.\n\nBut how is that handled in the code? For example, in the sample input given, the code would need to process three test cases. However, the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, each with three lines. But the actual code is supposed to process one test case. So the code is supposed to read three lines from stdin, process them, and output YES or NO.\n\nIn that case, the code I wrote earlier is correct.\n\nBut why does the sample input show three test cases? Because the problem says that the output is a list of answers for each test case. But perhaps in the actual problem, the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. That suggests that the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three answers. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me look at the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nSo this seems like three test cases. Each test case is three lines. So the code needs to process three test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut how? Because the code is supposed to read from standard input. So, perhaps the input is given as three test cases, each consisting of three lines. So for example, the input is:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nLine 4: PAPAINOEL\n\nLine 5: JOULUPUKKI\n\nLine 6: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nLine 7: BABBONATALE\n\nLine 8: FATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nLine 9: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nThen the code should process three test cases, each of three lines. So the code would read the three lines for each test case, process, and output the result.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo the input is three lines. So the code is supposed to read three lines once, and output YES or NO once. So the sample input must be three separate test cases, but the problem's sample input is written as a list of three test cases. But in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three answers. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis is a critical point. Because if the code is supposed to process only one test case, then the code is as I wrote before. But if the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, then the code needs to read all lines from input, process each group of three lines.\n\nBut the problem's sample input and output suggests that there are multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has three test cases, each with three lines, and the output has three answers.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. Which suggests that the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nThis is conflicting. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first element is a string that represents three lines. For example, the first test case's input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich is three lines. The output for this is YES.\n\nSimilarly for other test cases.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as three test cases, each with three lines. But the actual code is supposed to read three lines from input, and output one line. So the code should process one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. How is this possible?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is three lines, but the sample input is given as three separate test cases, each with their own three lines. So the code should process each test case, but how?\n\nBut the problem's original wording says that the input is three lines. So the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. This seems to be a contradiction. But perhaps the sample input is not formatted correctly, and the actual code should process one test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three elements, each representing a test case. For example, the first test case's input is three lines, and the output is YES. So the code must read three lines, process them, and output YES or NO. So for each test case, the code is run once. But in practice, when the code is run, the input is three lines, and the output is one line.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. For example, the input may consist of multiple test cases, each with three lines. So the code should read all lines, process each group of three lines as a test case, and output the corresponding answer.\n\nBut how to know? Well, the problem's original input description says that the input consists of three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. So this is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has three test cases, and the output has three answers. So the code needs to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the input can be read via sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nSo, perhaps the code should read all lines from input, and process them in groups of three.\n\nFor example, the code could read all lines, then for each group of three lines (guest, host, pile), process and output YES/NO.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me check the sample input again. The sample input is given as a list of three test cases. Each test case is three lines. So in the actual input, the code would read all the lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is confusing.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem is actually expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description says that the input consists of three lines. This is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that each test case is represented as a single line, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is three lines, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines once. But the sample input shows three test cases, which implies that the code must read three test cases.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample output is ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'], which suggests that there are three test cases. Hence, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from input, then process each group of three lines as a test case.\n\nFor example, in Python, the code could read all lines as a list, and then iterate over them in chunks of three.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, if the input is provided as three lines per test case, then the code can read all lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n    guest = lines[i]\n    host = lines[i+1]\n    pile = lines[i+2]\n    combined = guest + host\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut this assumes that the number of lines is a multiple of three. But according to the problem statement, the input consists of three lines. So perhaps this is not the case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines, leading to nine lines in total.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three elements, each being a string that represents three lines. For example, the first element is 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', which is three lines. So the actual input for the sample is three test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this seems to be a discrepancy.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement's input description is wrong, and the actual input is multiple test cases. Or perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads three lines from the input, and processes them. But the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. So the code must be run three times, once for each test case.\n\nBut this is not practical for programming competition problems. Usually, the code is supposed to read all test cases from the input.\n\nBut how to resolve this? Let's check the problem's note:\n\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left. In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\". In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nThe sample input and output are given as three test cases. But the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the actual input is multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to proceed? Well, the user who posted the problem says that the input is three lines, and the output is one line. The sample input is three test cases. But perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list of three test cases, but the actual code should read three lines once.\n\nBut the user also provided the sample input and output as lists. But perhaps the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nIn that case, the code I wrote initially is correct. But the sample input and output suggest that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to reconcile this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is not formatted correctly. For example, the sample input is written as three test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. So the sample input is written as three separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines once.\n\nBut the sample output has three answers. So this suggests that the code must process three test cases.\n\nThis is very confusing. However, the user has provided the sample input and output. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nLet me think again about the problem's sample input and output. For example, in the sample input, the first element is three lines. The output is YES. So perhaps the code is supposed to process each of these three test cases.\n\nThus, the code should read all lines from the input, and process them in groups of three.\n\nSo, for example, the code reads all lines, and for each group of three lines (guest, host, pile), process and output YES or NO.\n\nSo, for the sample input, the code would process three test cases.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines, then loop through them in groups of three.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read three lines once. But in the sample input, there are three test cases. So this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is formatted incorrectly. For example, perhaps the sample input is three lines, each containing the three parts. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads three lines, but the sample input is written as three test cases, each with three lines. So the code should process each test case.\n\nBut how to determine that? Well, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. But the sample input and output are given as lists, which suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are given as lists, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. For example, the input is a list of test cases, each with three lines.\n\nSo the code should read all the lines, and for each test case, process three lines.\n\nIn that case, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut this code will handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut what if the number of lines is not a multiple of three? Well, the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So for the actual test cases, it's expected that the input is three lines. But for the sample input, it's three test cases, each with three lines, making nine lines total.\n\nBut the problem's sample input and output may be formatted in a way that each test case is given as a single line in the input. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but each test case is three lines, and the code should read three lines per test case.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nWell, the original problem's sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. The output is three lines. So the code must read three lines per test case, and output one line per test case.\n\nThus, the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the code must process multiple test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut then, the problem's input description is incorrect. Or perhaps the problem is from a source where the input is multiple test cases, each with three lines.\n\nIn the absence of further information, I think that the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. Because the sample input and output suggest that.\n\nBut how to verify this? Let's look at the sample input:\n\nSample input is given as:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nThis is a list of three strings, each representing three lines. For example, the first string is three lines:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo, if the code reads all lines from input, then for each group of three lines, process them.\n\nBut in the actual input, the code would receive all the lines of all test cases. For example, in the sample input, the input would be:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nWhich is nine lines. The code would process three test cases.\n\nSo the code that reads all lines and processes in groups of three is correct.\n\nBut then, the problem's input description is incorrect. But given that the sample input and output are as such, this seems to be the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct code is the one that processes multiple test cases, each with three lines.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead all lines from input, then for each group of three lines, check the condition.\n\nSo the Python code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut what if the number of lines is not divisible by three? Well, the problem says that each test case has three lines, so the input is guaranteed to be correct. So the code can assume that.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nFor the first test case:\n\nguest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → sorted. The pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' → sorted. Are they the same?\n\nYes, because the combined is the same as the pile.\n\nSo the code returns YES.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nguest is PAPAINOEL, host is JOULUPUKKI → combined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nWhen sorted, combined and pile should differ. Let's see:\n\nCombined has letters from guest and host.\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL → letters are P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → counts: P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → counts: J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2+1=3?\n\nWait guest's P is 2, host's P is 1 → total 3.\n\nA: 2.\n\nI: 1+1=2.\n\nN: 1.\n\nO: 1+1=2.\n\nE: 1.\n\nL: 1+1=2.\n\nJ: 1.\n\nU: 3.\n\nK: 2.\n\nPlus other letters.\n\nPile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile.\n\nBut perhaps the code will correctly compare the sorted strings.\n\nThe sample says that the second test case's output is NO, because there's a missing P and extra L. So the code will detect that.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nSo this code should handle the sample input correctly.\n\nThus, this is the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all input lines at once.\n2. **Group Processing**: Process each group of three lines as a separate test case. Each group consists of the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n3. **Character Comparison**: For each test case, concatenate the guest and host names into a single string. Then, check if the sorted version of this concatenated string matches the sorted version of the pile string. If they match, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names; otherwise, it cannot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into individual lines for processing.\n- **Processing Groups**: Each group of three lines is processed to check if the combined names (guest + host) can be rearranged to match the pile of letters.\n- **Sorting and Comparing**: By sorting both the concatenated guest-host string and the pile string, we can efficiently check if they contain the same characters in the same frequency. If they do, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently verify the character counts using sorting, which is both straightforward and effective given the constraints of the problem.",
