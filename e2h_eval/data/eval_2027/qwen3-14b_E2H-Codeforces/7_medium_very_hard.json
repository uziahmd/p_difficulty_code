The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such graphs.\n\nFrom the description, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, each time, new vertices are added by connecting each leaf (vertex with degree 1) to k new vertices. And this process must be done at least once. Also, k has to be greater than 1.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step. Let's model the process.\n\nInitially, there's 1 vertex. Let's call this level 0.\n\nThen, in the first expansion, we connect the initial vertex to k new vertices. Now, the total number of vertices is 1 + k. But since the initial vertex is connected to k new ones, each of those new vertices is a leaf. So, this step is the first expansion. However, according to the problem statement, this step (adding k new vertices) is done at least once. Wait, the problem says that after the initial vertex, you add k new vertices connected to it. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the process must have at least two steps: the initial step (adding the first layer), and then expanding each leaf again.\n\nWait, the initial step is creating the first layer. Then, the second step is expanding each leaf (from the first layer) by adding k new vertices. So the process is:\n\n- Start with 1 node (level 0).\n\n- Level 1: Add k nodes connected to the root. Total nodes: 1 + k.\n\n- Then, each node in level 1 (which are all leaves) is expanded by adding k new nodes. So each of those k nodes will have k new children. So for level 2, we add k * k nodes. But wait, each of the original k nodes is connected to k new nodes. So the total nodes after this step would be 1 + k + k*k.\n\nBut then, the next expansion would be to take all the leaves from level 2 (each of which is connected to only one node, their parent), and add k new nodes to each of them. So each expansion step adds more nodes.\n\nSo the process can be thought of as building a tree where each node (except the root) has exactly one parent, and each node that is a leaf (i.e., has no children yet) gets k children. The expansion steps are done multiple times, but at least once. So the structure is like a tree with branching factor k, but with layers. The first expansion is the first layer, then the second expansion adds the second layer, etc.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of connecting leaves to k new vertices is done at least once. So the minimal case would be when we do the first expansion (adding k nodes to the root) and then do the second expansion (adding k nodes to each of the leaves of the first expansion). So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. For example, if k=2, then 1+2+4=7 nodes. But the example given in the problem says that for n=6, the answer is NO. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the sample input includes n=6, and the output is NO. Let's see why. For example, if k=2, the minimal snowflake would be 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. So 6 is not possible. If there's another way to get 6? Let's see. Suppose we have only the first expansion (the initial step) and no further expansions. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is required, but then the expansion step must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when you have two expansion steps: first adding k nodes to the root, then adding k nodes to each of the leaves of the first expansion. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other possibilities. Like, maybe the expansion steps can be done for some layers, but not all. For example, suppose we have two expansion steps. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake can be constructed with varying numbers of expansion steps. For example, the first expansion is adding k nodes to the root (so total 1 +k). Then, the second expansion is adding k nodes to each of the leaves of the first expansion (so adding k*k nodes). Then, the third expansion would be adding k nodes to each of the leaves of the second expansion (adding k^3 nodes). And so on. So the total number of nodes after m expansion steps would be 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. Wait, no. Because the first expansion is step 1 (adding k nodes), then step 2 adds k^2 nodes, step 3 adds k^3 nodes, etc. So the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i. Wait, the initial node is 1. Then, after step 1, we add k nodes. Then after step 2, we add k^2. Then step 3 adds k^3. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So m must be at least 1. However, the first expansion (step 1) is required, and then step 2 (the expansion of the leaves) is also required. Or wait, maybe the expansion steps are done once. For example, the first expansion (adding k nodes) is the first step, and then the expansion step is done once, which is adding k nodes to each of the leaves. So the total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step (connecting each leaf to k new nodes) is done at least once. So the first expansion (the initial step) is required, but then the expansion step (the process of adding k nodes to each leaf) is done once or more. So the minimal case is when we have two expansion steps: initial step (adding k nodes) and then one expansion (adding k^2 nodes). So the total is 1 + k + k^2. However, if we do more expansion steps, like three, then the total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on.\n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step (the process of adding k new nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first layer) is part of the construction, and then the expansion step (adding the second layer) must be done once. So the minimal number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But what about other possibilities? For example, if we have more expansion steps. So the total number of nodes can be 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1.\n\nBut the problem allows any number of expansion steps as long as they are done at least once. So for example, m can be 1, 2, etc.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to check if there exists integers k>1 and m≥1 such that n is equal to 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i. Wait, but that sum is 1 + (k*(k^m -1))/(k-1) -1? Wait, the sum from i=1 to m of k^i is equal to k*(k^m -1)/(k-1) - wait, no. The sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So the sum from i=1 to m of k^i is that minus 1. So sum_{i=1}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) -1 = [k^{m+1} -1 - (k-1)]/(k-1) ) = [k^{m+1} -k ]/(k-1) ) = k*(k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i. So 1 + [k (k^m -1)]/(k-1).\n\nWait, but that's the formula for the total number of nodes. So for example, if m=1, then sum is k. Adding 1 gives 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. Wait, but m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, earlier analysis said that the expansion step must be done once. So when m is 1, the sum is k, and adding 1 gives 1 +k. But that would correspond to the first expansion step. However, according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So perhaps m is the number of expansion steps, which is at least 1. But then, in that case, the total number of nodes would be 1 +k. But that would be allowed? But according to the example input, for n=2, the answer is NO. Let's see: for n=2, can we find k and m such that 2 equals 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i?\n\nIf m=1, sum is k. So 1 +k = 2 → k=1. But k must be >1. So invalid. Hence, n=2 is impossible. Which matches the sample input. So the sample input for n=2 outputs NO.\n\nBut then, what about m=2? For m=2, the sum is k + k^2. So 1 +k +k^2 = n. For example, when k=2 and m=2, the total is 1 +2 +4 =7. Which would be the minimal possible snowflake. So for n=7, the answer is YES.\n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So the m must be ≥1. However, for m=1, the sum is k. Adding 1 gives 1 +k. But in that case, the expansion steps have been done once (the initial expansion step). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh! So the initial step is adding the first k vertices (connecting to the root). Then, the \"step\" of connecting each leaf to k new vertices is done at least once. So the first step (adding k nodes) is part of the construction, and then the second step (the expansion step) is done once. So the minimal case is when we have 1 +k (initial step) plus the expansion step, which adds k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. Therefore, m must be ≥2?\n\nWait, this is conflicting with my previous analysis. Let me re-express the problem's construction steps.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nStart with one vertex.\n\nThen, add k new vertices connected to the initial vertex. (This is the first step.)\n\nThen, each vertex that is a leaf (connected to only one other) is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the step of connecting leaves to k new vertices must be done at least once. So after the initial step (adding k nodes), we perform this expansion step once. Which would add k *k nodes (since each of the k leaves gets k new nodes). So the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo the minimal snowflake has 1 +k +k^2 nodes. Thus, for any valid n, it must be expressible as 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2? Or wait, maybe m is the number of expansion steps. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once (adding k^2 nodes). Then, if we do another expansion step, each of the leaves (from the previous step) would be connected to k new nodes. So the total nodes would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, and so on. So the expansion steps can be done multiple times. So the formula for the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥1 (if m=1, then it's 1 +k). But according to the problem statement, the expansion step (the step of connecting leaves to k new vertices) must be done at least once. So that implies that after the initial step (adding k nodes), we must do at least one expansion step. So the minimal number of expansion steps is 1. Therefore, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥1. But wait, if m=1, then the sum is 1 +k. But the expansion step was done once? How?\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once. So for that, the expansion step is to take all leaves (the k nodes) and add k new nodes to each. So that would add k *k =k² nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k². So the formula is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, but in this case, the initial step is adding k nodes, and the expansion steps are m times. So the formula would be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the process as follows. The snowflake is built as a tree with the following properties:\n\n- The root has degree k.\n\n- Each node that is a leaf (degree 1) is connected to k children. This process is done at least once.\n\nSo the tree is built in levels. The root is level 0. Level 1 has k nodes. Level 2 has k^2 nodes. Level 3 has k^3 nodes, etc. The process of adding each level is the expansion step. The problem says that after the initial step (adding level 1), the expansion step (adding level 2) must be done at least once. So the tree must have at least two levels (level 0 and level 1 and level 2). So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of levels minus 1. Wait, for example, if there are two expansion steps (after the initial step?), or perhaps the number of expansion steps is the number of levels beyond the first.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 2? No, because the initial step is level 1 (k nodes), and then the expansion step adds level 2 (k^2 nodes). So m here would be 2. But if we do another expansion step, then level 3 is added (k^3 nodes), and the total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the number of terms in the sum is m+1, where m is the number of levels. But the problem requires that the expansion step is done at least once. So the minimal case is when there are two levels (level 1 and level 2), giving 1 +k +k^2.\n\nThus, the total number of nodes must be equal to 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥1? Let's think again. The initial step is adding level 1 (k nodes). Then, the expansion step is done once (adding level 2). So the total is 1 +k +k^2. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So m is the number of expansion steps. So m ≥1. Then, the formula is 1 +k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). Wait, the sum from i=1 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1). Adding 1 gives 1 + (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1). Let's compute this:\n\nTotal nodes = 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i = 1 + (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1).\n\nBut for m ≥1. However, in the case where m=1, this becomes 1 + (k^2 -k)/(k-1) = 1 + (k(k-1))/(k-1)) = 1 +k. Which would be the case where we have only the initial step (adding k nodes) and no expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So m must be ≥2? Because m=1 corresponds to the initial step (adding k nodes) and no expansion steps. Wait, no. Because the expansion step is the process of taking the leaves and adding k nodes to each. So for m=1, the sum is k^1. Which would mean that the expansion step was done once. But how? Because the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once: adding k^1 nodes? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the expansion step adds k nodes per existing leaf. So if the initial step is adding k nodes (all leaves), then the expansion step would add k *k nodes. So the sum for m=1 would be k^2. Then the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2. So the formula is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No, I think I need to re-express the formula properly.\n\nLet me think of m as the number of expansion steps. The initial step is step 0 (adding the first level). Then, each expansion step adds a new level. For example:\n\n- After 0 expansion steps (only the initial step): total nodes is 1 +k.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So m ≥1. So after 1 expansion step, the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2. After 2 expansion steps, it's 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc. So the formula for the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} where m is the number of expansion steps (m ≥1). Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nNumber of expansion steps m: after each step, a new level is added. The initial step (adding the first level) is not counted as an expansion step. The expansion steps are the steps that add new levels beyond the first.\n\nSo for m expansion steps:\n\n- Level 0: 1 node.\n\n- Level 1: k nodes (added in initial step).\n\n- Level 2: k^2 nodes (added in first expansion step).\n\n- Level 3: k^3 nodes (added in second expansion step).\n\n...\n\n- Level m+1: k^{m+1} nodes (added in m-th expansion step).\n\nSo the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i - k^0 + ... ? Wait, no. The total is 1 (level 0) + k (level 1) + k^2 (level 2) + ... +k^{m+1} (level m+1). So the sum is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i. But sum_{i=0}^n k^i is (k^{n+1} -1)/(k-1). So for the total nodes, it's (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So m ≥1. Thus, the total number of nodes is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) for m ≥1. But this seems different from earlier examples. Let's test for m=1 (one expansion step). Then the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which equals (k^{3} -1)/(k-1). Which is correct. So yes.\n\nBut then, the problem requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. So for any valid n, there exists some k>1 and m≥1 such that n = (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). Wait, but that seems very restrictive. However, looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample input includes n=13. The output is YES. Let's see:\n\nFor example, let's try k=2 and m=1. Then the total is (2^(1+2) -1)/(2-1) = (8-1)/1=7. Not 13. For m=2: (k^{2+2} -1)/(k-1) = (k^4 -1)/(k-1) = k^3 +k^2 +k +1. For k=2, this is 8 +4 +2 +1=15. Not 13. Hmm. What about k=3 and m=1: (3^3-1)/2 = (27-1)/2 = 13. Yes! So for k=3, m=1, the total is 13. Which matches the sample input. So the answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=15. For k=2, m=2: (2^4 -1)/1 = 15. So that's valid. Hence output is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6. Let's see. Are there any k and m≥1 such that (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) =6?\n\nTry k=2: (2^{m+2} -1)/1 = 2^{m+2} -1 =6 → 2^{m+2} =7 → no solution.\n\nk=3: (3^{m+2} -1)/2 =6 → 3^{m+2} -1 =12 → 3^{m+2}=13 → no.\n\nk=4: (4^{m+2} -1)/3 =6 → 4^{m+2} =19 → nope.\n\nNo solution. Hence output is NO, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the formula seems correct. Thus, the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^{s} -1)/(k-1), where s ≥3 (since s = m+2, m≥1 → s ≥3). Because m ≥1 → s = m +2 ≥ 3. Because m is the number of expansion steps, which is ≥1. So s is the exponent in the formula.\n\nWait, the formula is (k^s -1)/(k-1) = n, where s ≥3. Because s = m+2, m ≥1 → s ≥3. So for example, when m=1, s=3. When m=2, s=4, etc.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether there exists integers k>1 and s≥3 such that n = (k^s -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut wait, what about the case where the expansion steps are done multiple times. For example, if m=2, then s=4. So the formula is (k^4-1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1. Which is indeed the sum of 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. Which is the case when there are three levels (level 0, 1, 2, 3). So the expansion steps were done twice.\n\nTherefore, the problem now is to check if there exists k>1 and s≥3 such that n = (k^s -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut how to check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nFirst, note that (k^s -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1}.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check if there exists s ≥3 and k ≥2 such that this sum equals n.\n\nSo the approach is: for each test case n, iterate over possible s values (starting from 3 up to log_2(n)), and for each s, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check this.\n\nLet me think about how to find for a given s, whether there exists a k such that 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} = n.\n\nThis is equivalent to solving the equation:\n\nk^{s} -1 = (k-1)*n → k^s - (k-1)*n -1 = 0.\n\nBut solving this for general s and k is difficult. However, for a fixed s, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nFor example, for a given s, the minimal value of the sum is 1 +2 + 2^2 + ... +2^{s-1} = 2^s -1. The maximum possible value for the sum is when k increases. But since for a fixed s, the sum increases with k. So for each s, we can compute the minimal possible sum (for k=2) and check if it is ≤n. If it is, then perform a binary search for k in [2, ... upper_bound] to see if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given s?\n\nWell, for the sum 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} = n. Since each term is positive, the sum is ≥k^{s-1} (since the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} ≥k^{s-1} when k ≥1). So k^{s-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(s-1)}.\n\nSo for a given s, the maximum possible k is floor(n^{1/(s-1)}).\n\nBut since s can be up to log_2(n) +1, for example, for s=3, the maximum k is up to n^(1/2). For larger s, the maximum k decreases.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n is 1: answer is NO (since the minimal possible is 1 +k +k^2, which is at least 1+2+4=7 for k=2, s=3. Wait, for s=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. For k=2, that's 7. So for n=1, the answer is NO.\n\nBut the problem says that n can be 1, but according to the sample input, n=1 returns NO.\n\nSo the steps for each n:\n\nCheck if n can be expressed as sum_{i=0}^{s-1} k^i, where s ≥3, k ≥2.\n\nNow, for each possible s (from 3 up to max_s), where max_s is the maximum possible s for which sum_{i=0}^{s-1} 2^i ≤n. Since sum_{i=0}^{s-1} 2^i = 2^s -1. So 2^s -1 ≤n → s ≤ log2(n+1). So for n up to 1e18, the maximum s is around 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18).\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate s from 3 up to 60 (or until the minimal sum for s exceeds n).\n\nFor each s, compute the minimal possible sum (when k=2) and check if it is ≤n. If yes, then perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (as discussed) to see if there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and s?\n\nThe sum is (k^s -1)/(k-1). But for large exponents, computing k^s could be problematic due to overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, and k can be up to around 1e6 for s=3 (since for s=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =n → k^2 ~n → k ~ sqrt(n) ~ 1e9). Wait, but for s=3, the maximum k is sqrt(n). For n=1e18, that's 1e9. So for each s, the binary search for k would take O(log (n^{1/(s-1)} )) steps, which is manageable.\n\nBut calculating k^s for large k and s can be done with exponentiation, but we need to avoid overflow. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nBut during the binary search, we need to compute the sum for a given k and s, and compare it to n. However, for large k and s, the sum can be very big. So during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow (i.e., if during the calculation, the sum exceeds n, we can break early).\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum as (k^s -1) // (k-1), but again, for large exponents, this may be computationally expensive. However, since for each binary search step, we can compute the sum incrementally.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the sum for a given k and s. The sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1}.\n\nWe can compute this as follows:\n\nInitialize total =0\n\nfor i in 0 to s-1:\n\n    total += k^i\n\nBut for large exponents, this may be slow. Alternatively, we can use the formula (k^s -1)//(k-1), but only if k !=1. Which it isn't here.\n\nBut for the purposes of checking whether the sum equals n, perhaps we can compute this using the formula. However, for cases where k is large and s is large, k^s may be very large. But since we know that the sum must be exactly n, which is up to 1e18, we can compute the formula, but during the computation, if at any point the intermediate value exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nAlternatively, for the binary search step, for a given k and s, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop if it exceeds n.\n\nSo here's an approach for checking if for given s and k, the sum equals n:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current_term = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current_term\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return -1  # overflow\n\n        current_term *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut for large s (like 60), and k up to 1e9, this may be slow. However, given that the maximum s is about 60, and for each test case, the number of s's is about 60, and for each s, the binary search steps are about 30, this should be manageable.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nif n < 7: return NO (since the minimal sum is 7 for k=2, s=3)\n\nelse:\n\n    for s in 3 to max_s:\n\n        compute the minimal possible sum for s: when k=2, sum is 2^s -1.\n\n        if 2^s -1 >n: break (since higher s would have even larger minimal sum)\n\n        else:\n\n            perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (which is floor( (n)^(1/(s-1)) )) \n\n            for each candidate k, compute the sum and check if it equals n.\n\n            if found, return YES.\n\n    after checking all s, if no k found, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute upper_bound for k?\n\nupper_bound can be found as the integer part of n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nBut since for the sum 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} >=k^{s-1} (since all terms are positive), and since the sum is equal to n, then k^{s-1} <=n → k <=n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nSo for binary search, the upper limit can be set as n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nBut in Python, we can compute this using pow(n, 1/(s-1)), but since we need an integer, we can take the floor of that value, but perhaps add 1 to be safe.\n\nBut for binary search, even if the upper bound is a bit higher than necessary, it's okay as the check function will return early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nSo, for example, for a given s, the binary search for k would be between low=2 and high=upper_bound.\n\nBut how to compute upper_bound?\n\nAn alternative approach is to start with low=2 and high=2, and double high until the sum for k=high is larger than n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut for the sake of efficiency, perhaps it's better to compute upper_bound as n^(1/(s-1)) +1.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's easier to compute the upper_bound as follows:\n\nWe can compute the maximum possible k as the integer part of n^(1/(s-1)) + 1.\n\nBut in Python, for integer exponents, perhaps we can use binary search to find the upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, for each s, we can compute the upper_bound as 2, then keep multiplying by 2 until the sum for k=upper_bound is larger than n. Then, binary search between upper_bound//2 and upper_bound.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the following steps:\n\nFor a given s:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, s) < n:\n\n    high *=2\n\nOnce we have high such that compute_sum(high, s) >=n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut compute_sum(high, s) can be computed with the function above.\n\nBut this may take some time for large s. However, considering that s is up to 60, and for each s, the number of steps is logarithmic in the upper_bound, it's manageable.\n\nOnce the binary search is set up, for each candidate k in [low, high], compute the sum and see if it equals n.\n\nNow, the code outline is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = ... \n\n    if n < 7:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    found = False\n\n    for s in 3 to max_s:\n\n        # compute min sum for s is 2^s -1. if this is larger than n, break\n\n        min_sum = 2^s -1\n\n        if min_sum >n:\n\n            break\n\n        # else, find if there exists k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^{s-1} k^i =n\n\n        # find upper bound for k\n\n        # find low and high for binary search\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = 2\n\n        while compute_sum(high, s) <n:\n\n            high *=2\n\n        # now binary search between low and high\n\n        left = 2\n\n        right = high\n\n        while left <= right:\n\n            mid = (left + right) //2\n\n            current_sum = compute_sum(mid, s)\n\n            if current_sum ==n:\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n            elif current_sum <n:\n\n                left = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                right = mid -1\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    if found:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut what about cases where s is larger than log2(n)+1? For example, when s is such that 2^s -1 exceeds n. Then, we break the loop.\n\nBut how to compute max_s? Well, for s starting from 3, and increasing until 2^s -1 exceeds n. For example, for n=1e18, 2^s -1 <=n → s can be up to 60, since 2^60 is ~1e18.\n\nSo in code, for each n, the loop for s can go from 3 up to 60, or until 2^s -1 exceeds n.\n\nBut how to compute 2^s -1? Well, in Python, for s up to 60, 2^s can be computed as 1 << s, but for s up to 60, that's manageable.\n\nBut for larger s, even 2^s may be larger than n. So in code, for each s starting from 3, we can compute the minimal sum as (2^s -1). If that's larger than n, break.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints. A snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if such a graph can exist for each input value of `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands iteratively. Each expansion step adds new vertices such that every leaf node (a node with only one connection) gets connected to `k` new vertices. This process must be done at least once.\n\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: The number of vertices in a snowflake graph after `s` levels of expansion (starting from 3 levels) can be represented by the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{sum} = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^{s-1} = \\frac{k^s - 1}{k - 1}\n   $$\n   Here, `k` is the branching factor (greater than 1), and `s` is the number of levels (at least 3).\n\n3. **Efficient Check**: For each test case, iterate over possible values of `s` (starting from 3 up to a maximum feasible value). For each `s`, use binary search to determine if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum equals `n`.\n\n4. **Binary Search**: For each `s`, compute the minimum possible sum using `k=2` and use binary search to find a valid `k` that satisfies the equation for the given `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1  # k^0\n    for _ in range(s):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return -1\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef check_possible(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_s = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for s in range(3, max_s + 1):\n        # Compute min_sum for k=2\n        min_sum = (1 << s) - 1  # 2^s - 1\n        if min_sum > n:\n            break\n        # Now find if there exists a k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^{s-1} k^i == n\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        while True:\n            val = compute_sum(high, s, n)\n            if val == -1:\n                break\n            if val < n:\n                high *= 2\n            else:\n                break\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        left = 2\n        right = high\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            res = compute_sum(mid, s, n)\n            if res == -1:\n                right = mid - 1\n            elif res == n:\n                return True\n            elif res < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if check_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum Function**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series for given `k` and `s`, stopping early if the sum exceeds `n`.\n- **check_possible Function**: This function checks for each possible number of levels `s` (from 3 up to 60) if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`. It uses binary search to efficiently find such `k`.\n- **main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case, and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on whether a valid snowflake graph can be formed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations for each test case, leveraging mathematical properties and binary search to handle large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
