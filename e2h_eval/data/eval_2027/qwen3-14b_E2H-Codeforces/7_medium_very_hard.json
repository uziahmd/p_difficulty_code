Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure of the snowflake.\n\nFrom the description:\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those leaves) are connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So the process is like building layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's consider the steps.\n\nLet me model this. Let's say the initial step is level 0: 1 node.\n\nThen, level 1: add k nodes connected to the root. Now total nodes is 1 + k.\n\nThen, for each subsequent step, we look at all the leaves (nodes with degree 1), which are the nodes added in the previous step. Each of these is connected to k new nodes. So each step adds more nodes.\n\nBut how many steps are there? The problem says that the step of adding k new nodes to each leaf must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do it once. For example, for k=4, the minimal snowflake would be:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then connect to 4 nodes (total 5). Then each of those 4 nodes (which are leaves) get connected to 4 new nodes. So adding 4*4=16 nodes. Total is 1+4+16 = 21? Wait, but the example given in the problem says that for n=6, the answer is NO. Let me check the sample input and output.\n\nWait the sample input includes 6 as a test case, and the output is NO. Let me see why. Let's think about possible values of n.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's model the number of nodes as a function of the number of layers.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as being built in layers. The first layer (level 1) is connected directly to the root. Then each next layer is built by adding k children to each node in the previous layer.\n\nBut the process requires that after the initial step (adding the first layer), the step of adding new nodes to the leaves is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has two layers. Let's think:\n\nFor example, the initial step is 1 node. Then, adding k nodes (level 1). Then, adding k nodes to each of the level 1 nodes. That's level 2. So total nodes is 1 + k + k*k. But wait, that's 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut for k=2, that would be 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. But maybe there are other possibilities. Because maybe after building level 1, you can add some layers. Like, for example, maybe you can have multiple layers.\n\nSo the general formula would be that the snowflake can be constructed with m layers, where m >= 2. Let's think:\n\nLet me think of the number of nodes as follows. Let me denote the number of layers as m. The first layer (layer 1) has k nodes. Then, each subsequent layer adds k times the number of nodes in the previous layer. So the total number of nodes is:\n\nTotal = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m ?\n\nNo, because the initial step is creating the first layer. Wait, the initial step is the root. Then, the first expansion is adding k nodes (layer 1). Then, each of those nodes adds k nodes (layer 2). Then each of those nodes adds k nodes (layer 3), etc. But the process requires that the step of expanding the leaves is done at least once. So for m layers, the total number of nodes is:\n\nTotal = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1} } )\n\nWait, no. Because the root is 1 node. Then, the first layer (layer 1) is k nodes. Then, each of those k nodes has k children (layer 2), so that's k * k = k^2 nodes. Then each of those k^2 nodes has k children (layer 3) adding k^3 nodes. So for m layers (including the root?), or m layers?\n\nWait, the initial step is the root (layer 0). Then, the first expansion (layer 1) adds k nodes. Then, the second expansion (layer 2) adds k^2 nodes. And so on. So the total number of nodes after m expansions (layers) is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. But the problem states that the step of adding to the leaves must be done at least once. Which means that m must be at least 1. Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nThe problem says that the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the step of adding k new nodes to each leaf (those that are connected to only one other) must be done at least once. So the initial step is the first part (the root plus k nodes). Then, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves is done once or more. So the minimal case is when we do that step once. Which would mean that after adding the initial k nodes (layer 1), we add another layer (layer 2). So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2.\n\nSo for the snowflake to be valid, the number of nodes must be equal to 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >= 1 (since the step is done once). Wait, but the sum from 0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). Wait, but the root is 1, then adding k nodes (k^1), then k^2, etc. So the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m >= 1. Because for m=1, the sum is 1 + k. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves (the initial step) must be done at least once. So perhaps the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >= 1. But when m=1, that's 1 + k. However, that would be the case when after adding the first layer (k nodes), we don't do the step again. But according to the problem statement, the step must be done at least once. So that step is done once. So perhaps the minimal case is when m=2, giving 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (so the ones added in the first step) is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh! So the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves (those in the first layer) is done once. So that's adding k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k^2. So the minimal snowflake is when m=2 layers (after the initial step).\n\nBut what if there are more steps? Like, after adding the second layer (k^2 nodes), we do the step again, adding k^3 nodes. So the total becomes 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. So the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m >= 2? Or m >= 1?\n\nWait, the initial step is the first part (adding k nodes). Then the step of adding new nodes to the leaves is done once. So for that step, the number of layers is 2. So the total is 1 + k + k^2. But if we do that step again, then we have 1 + k + k^2 + k^3, etc. So the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >= 2? Or m >= 1?\n\nWait, the initial step (adding k nodes) is required. Then, the step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) is done at least once. So the minimal case is that after the initial step, we do the step once. Which gives us 1 + k + k^2. So the sum is 1 + k + k^2. So the total number of nodes is S = (k^{m} - 1)/(k-1), where m is the number of terms. Wait, for example, if m=2, then S = 1 + k. If m=3, S=1 +k +k^2. So in that case, the sum is (k^{m} - 1)/(k-1). So the problem requires that the number of nodes is such that there exists some k>1 and m >= 2, such that n equals (k^{m} - 1)/(k-1). Or maybe m is the number of layers, but perhaps m is the number of steps after the initial step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k * ( (k^{d} - 1) / (k - 1) ) ), where d is the number of times we applied the step. Because:\n\n- The initial step is 1 node.\n\n- Then, we add k nodes (first step). Then, each of those k nodes gets k children. So that's k * k = k^2 nodes. Then, if we do the step again, each of those k^2 nodes gets k children, adding k^3 nodes. So the total after d steps is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d. And since the step must be done at least once, d >= 1. So the total is (k^{d+1} - 1) / (k - 1). Because sum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1} - 1)/(k-1).\n\nBut for d >= 1, that would mean that the total is (k^{d+1} - 1)/(k-1). For example, when d=1, the total is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k + 1. But according to the problem statement, the step must be done once. So for d=1, that's the case where after the initial step (adding k nodes), we do the step once (adding k^2 nodes). Wait, no. Because if d is the number of steps, then for d=1, the total is 1 + k (the initial step) plus the first step (adding k^2 nodes?) No, that doesn't fit. Let me re-express.\n\nLet me think again. The initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the first step (the required step) adds k^2 nodes. Then, the second step adds k^3 nodes, etc. So the total number of nodes is:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m, where m >= 1. Because m is the number of times we've done the step. Wait, m=1 would be adding k + k^2? No. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the step is done once, adding k^2 nodes. Then, the total is 1 + k + k^2. So for m steps, the total is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1}) ). Which is 1 + (k^{m} - k)/(k-1) ? Let me compute:\n\nsum_{i=1}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1). So adding 1 gives 1 + (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1) = [ (k-1) + k^{m+1} -k ] / (k-1) ) = [k^{m+1} -1 ]/(k-1). Oh right! Because sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So the total is that. So the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^d - 1)/(k-1), where k>1, d >= 2 (since d is m+1, where m is the number of steps. Since m >=1, d is m+1 >= 2).\n\nWait, because for m steps (the number of times we did the step), the total is sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i, which is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). But m is the number of steps. For example, when m=1, the total is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would be the case where the initial step (adding k nodes) and then the step was done once (adding k^2 nodes?), but that's not possible. Wait, no. Because when m=1, the sum is 1 +k. Which would be the case when the initial step (adding k nodes) and no further steps. But according to the problem statement, the step must be done at least once. So this suggests that m must be at least 2 steps?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So for this case, d = 3, which would be m+1 = 3? Or perhaps I need to think of the formula as (k^d - 1)/(k-1), where d >= 2. Because for d=2, the sum is 1 +k. But that would correspond to the case where the step is not done. Which is invalid. Therefore, the correct condition is that n can be written as (k^d -1)/(k-1), where k>1, d>=2, and also the step is done at least once. Wait, but when d=2, (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which is 1 +k. Which is the case where the initial step is done (adding k nodes) and no further steps. But according to the problem statement, the step must be done at least once. So that's invalid. Therefore, the correct formula is that n must be equal to (k^d - 1)/(k-1) where d >= 3? Or perhaps the step is done once, which implies that d is at least 2?\n\nWait, let's think again. The initial step (adding k nodes) is required. Then, the step of adding to the leaves must be done at least once. So after the initial step, the step is done once. Which would be adding k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2 = sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So here, d=3. Thus, the formula is (k^d -1)/(k-1), where d >= 3? No, because if d is 2, then sum is (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would be 1 +k. But that would be the case where the step is not done. So the problem requires that the step is done once, which would require that the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is for d=3. Therefore, the formula for n is (k^d -1)/(k-1), where d >= 2 and k>1, but with the constraint that d >= 2 and the sum must have at least two steps (the initial step and one more). Wait, perhaps I need to think of d as the number of layers. For example, the minimal case is 3 layers (root, first layer, second layer). So the formula for n is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m >= 2. Which would be (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m >= 2, which implies that the exponent is m+1 >= 3. Therefore, the problem reduces to checking if there exists integers k>1 and m >= 2 such that n = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). Or, equivalently, for some d >= 3, n = (k^d - 1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but for example, if m=2, then the formula is (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. Which is the minimal case.\n\nSo the problem is: given n, check if there exists integers k>1 and d >= 3 such that n = (k^d - 1)/(k-1). Or, alternatively, for d >= 2, but with the sum being 1 +k + ... +k^d. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is (k^d - 1)/(k-1) where d is the number of layers, and d >= 2. For example, d=2 gives (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would be the case where the initial step is done (adding k nodes) and the step is not done. Which is invalid. So that's not allowed. So the correct approach is that d must be >= 3. Because then, the sum is 1 +k +k^2, which requires that the step is done once.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to checking whether n can be written in the form (k^d - 1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and d >= 3.\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nSo the approach is, for each test case n, check if there exists some k>1 and d >= 3 such that n = (k^d - 1)/(k-1).\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think about the possible values of d. For each possible d, we can check if there exists a k such that the equation holds.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to find an efficient way.\n\nFirst, note that for a fixed d, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nBecause (k^d - 1)/(k-1) = sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i.\n\nSo for example, for d=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nNow, for each possible d, we can check if there exists a k>1 such that this sum equals n.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible value of d?\n\nWell, for d=3, the minimal sum is 1 +2 +4 =7. For larger d, the sum increases. But for a given n, the maximum possible d is log_2(n). For example, for d=60, even with k=2, the sum is 2^60-1/(2-1) = 2^60-1, which is around 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, d can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each n, we can iterate over possible d from 3 up to log_2(n) +1 (since for k=2, the sum for d steps is 2^d-1). For each d, check if there exists a k>1 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to check for each d?\n\nFor a given d, the sum is S(k) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} = (k^d -1)/(k-1). We need to find if there exists integer k>1 such that S(k) =n.\n\nThis is equivalent to solving for k in the equation:\n\nk^d -1 = (k-1)*n\n\n=> k^d - (k-1)*n -1 = 0.\n\nBut solving this equation for k is tricky. However, for a fixed d, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for fixed d, S(k) is strictly increasing with k. So for each d, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... upper_bound], and see if S(k) equals n.\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given d?\n\nSince S(k) = (k^d -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} < k^{d} / (k-1) (since sum is less than d*k^{d-1} for k>1, but perhaps a better upper bound is needed). Alternatively, for a fixed d, since S(k) increases with k, and for k=2, S(k) is (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1. So if n is less than this, then there's no solution for this d. Otherwise, for k larger than some value, the S(k) would be larger than n. So for each d, we can find the minimal and maximal possible k.\n\nBut how to find the possible k for a given d?\n\nLet me think. For a given d, the minimal possible k is 2. The maximum possible k is such that S(k) <=n. Since S(k) is increasing with k, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... upper_bound].\n\nBut for upper_bound, since S(k) >= k^{d-1} (since the sum has d terms, each at least 1, and the last term is k^{d-1} which is >=k^0=1 for k>=2 and d>=2). So for S(k) =n, we have k^{d-1} <=n. Hence, k <=n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nSo for a given d, the upper bound for k is n^(1/(d-1)).\n\nSo for each d, we can binary search k between 2 and floor(n^(1/(d-1))) +1.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n is 1, output NO (since the minimal snowflake is 1 +k +k^2, which for k=2 and d=3 is 7).\n\n- For each possible d from 3 up to max_d (where max_d is log_2(n)+1, since for k=2, the sum is 2^d -1. So for n up to 1e18, d can be up to 60).\n\n   For each d:\n\n      Compute the minimal and maximal possible k. For example, k_min=2, k_max = floor(n^(1/(d-1))) )\n\n      Perform binary search on k in this range to see if there exists a k where S(k) =n.\n\n      If found, return YES.\n\nIf after checking all possible d, no solution is found, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute the sum S(k) for a given k and d? Well, for large exponents, we can compute it iteratively, and check for overflow. However, since n can be up to 1e18, and d is up to 60, even for k=1e6, the sum for d=3 would be 1 +k +k^2, which for k=1e6 is 1e12 + ... which is manageable.\n\nBut during the binary search, for a given k and d, we can compute the sum step by step, and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nFor example, for a given k and d, compute s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}. To compute this, we can start with sum=0, and for each term from i=0 to d-1, add k^i. But for large d, this could take O(d) time. However, since d is up to 60, and t is 1e4, this is acceptable.\n\nBut even better, we can compute the sum using the formula (k^d -1)/(k-1), but we need to be careful with integer division and possible overflows. However, since Python handles big integers, but for the sake of efficiency, perhaps it's better to compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow.\n\nAlternatively, since for the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally, and if at any step the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's too big.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we are checking for d=3 and k=2. The sum is 1+2+4=7. For n=7, it's okay. For k=3, sum is 1+3+9=13. For n=13, yes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck if n is 1: no.\n\nElse, for each possible d starting from 3 up to max_d (say, 60):\n\n   Compute the maximum possible k for this d as k_max = floor(n^(1/(d-1))).\n\n   For example, for d=3, the maximum k is floor(n^(1/2)).\n\n   Then, perform a binary search between low=2 and high=k_max.\n\n   For each mid in binary search, compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\n   If s ==n, return yes.\n\n   If s <n, search higher.\n\n   Else, search lower.\n\nBut how to compute s?\n\nWe can compute it as follows:\n\nInitialize sum = 0.\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to d-1:\n\n   sum += current_term\n\n   current_term *=k\n\nBut for large d (like 60), this is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, even for d=60 and k=1e6, this would take 60 steps per check, which is acceptable.\n\nBut also, during this computation, if the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's larger than n.\n\nSo, for example, during the sum calculation, if at any step the sum exceeds n, we can return early.\n\nNow, the question is: what is the maximum possible d to check?\n\nFor d, the maximum possible value is when k=2. The sum for d is (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1. So for n up to 1e18, 2^d -1 <= 1e18 => d <= log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60. So d can be up to 60.\n\nThus, for each test case, we can iterate d from 3 to 60.\n\nSo for each d in 3..60:\n\n   compute the maximum possible k as floor(n^(1/(d-1))).\n\n   then perform a binary search on k between 2 and that max_k.\n\nBut how to compute the max_k? For example, for d=3, the max_k is floor(n^(1/2)).\n\nIn Python, we can compute this via taking the integer part of n ** (1/(d-1)), but we need to be careful with floating point inaccuracies. Alternatively, we can use binary search to find the maximum k such that k^{d-1} <=n. But perhaps for the purposes of the code, we can compute it as the integer part of n ** (1/(d-1)), and then check nearby values.\n\nAlternatively, for each d, the maximum possible k is such that k^{d-1} <=n. So k_max = floor(n^(1/(d-1))).\n\nBut in practice, for code, perhaps we can compute k_max as int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2, to account for possible rounding errors.\n\nOnce we have the k_max, we can binary search between 2 and k_max.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample input includes n=13. The output is YES. For d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Let's see: 1 +k +k^2 =13. Solving k^2 +k -12 =0. The roots are (-1 ± sqrt(1 +48))/2 = (-1 +7)/2= 3. So k=3. So for d=3 and k=3, sum is 13. So yes.\n\nAnother sample input is 6: output is NO. Let's see. For d=3, possible k_max is sqrt(6) ~ 2. So k=2. Sum is 1+2+4=7>6. So no. For d=4: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. For d=4, the max k is cube root of 6, which is ~1.8. So k_max is 1, but since k>1, no possible. So no solution. Hence output is NO.\n\nAnother sample input is 255. Output is YES. Let's see. For example, d=3: 1 +k +k^2 =255. Solving k^2 +k -254=0. Discriminant is 1 + 4*254= 1017. sqrt(1017) is approx 31.89. So k=( -1 + 31.89)/2 ~ 15.44. So trying k=15: 1+15+225=241 <255. k=16: 1+16+256= 273>255. So no. For d=4: 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 = 255. Let's see. Try k=4: 1+4+16+64= 85 <255. k=5: 1+5+25+125= 156. k=6: 1+6+36+216= 259>255. So no. For d=5: 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 +k^4 =255. Try k=3: 1+3+9+27+81= 121. k=4: 1+4+16+64+256= 341>255. So no. What about d=8? Let's think. For example, k=2: sum is 2^8-1/(2-1) = 255. Yes! Because for d=8, the sum is (2^8 -1)/1 = 255. So yes. So for d=8, k=2. Hence the answer is YES.\n\nSo the code needs to find this case.\n\nSo, the code will loop through d from 3 up to 60, and for each d, check for possible k.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n in test cases:\n\n   if n ==1: print NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      flag = False\n\n      for d in 3 to 60:\n\n         if d-1 > log2(n): then for k=2, sum would be 2^d -1 which is larger than n. So skip.\n\n         but how to compute that?\n\n         compute the maximum possible k as k_max = integer part of n^(1/(d-1)) + 1.\n\n         then perform binary search between low=2 and high=k_max.\n\n         during binary search, for each mid, compute the sum s. if s ==n: return yes.\n\n      after checking all d, if no, return no.\n\nBut how to compute k_max?\n\nIn Python, for a given d, the exponent is (d-1). So for example, for d=3, the exponent is 2.\n\nBut for n=255 and d=8, d-1 is 7. So k_max is 255^(1/7). 2^7 is 128, 3^7 is 2187. So 255^(1/7) is between 2 and 3. So floor is 2. So k_max=2. So for d=8, binary search between 2 and 2. Check k=2. sum is (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. Which matches.\n\nSo code-wise, for each d, compute the possible k_max as int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2. Then perform binary search between 2 and k_max.\n\nBut in Python, taking n ** (1/(d-1)) may be imprecise due to floating point errors. So perhaps better to compute k_max as a value such that k_max^(d-1) <=n, and (k_max +1)^(d-1) >n.\n\nBut for code, perhaps we can compute k_max as the integer part of n ** (1/(d-1)) and then check up to that + 2, to avoid missing due to floating point errors.\n\nNow, code steps for each d:\n\nCompute the maximum possible k for which k^{d-1} <=n. Since the sum for k and d is at least k^{d-1} (since sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} >=k^{d-1}).\n\nSo for the binary search, the upper bound for k can be found as follows:\n\nlow = 2, high = something like 2e9 (but for n up to 1e18, and d up to 60, the maximum possible k for d=3 is sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. So for code, perhaps setting high to 1e18 is not feasible, but with the binary search steps, the code can compute the upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, for each d, we can compute k_max as the integer part of n ** (1/(d-1)) + 2, and then binary search between 2 and that value.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nIn code, for a given d, we can compute the exponent as (d-1). Then:\n\nif n ==0: ... but n is at least 1.\n\nBut in code:\n\nfor d in range(3, 61):\n\n    exponent = d-1\n\n    # compute k_max such that k^exponent <=n.\n\n    # approximate k_max as int(n ** (1/exponent)) + 2\n\n    # but for cases where n is 0, but n is >=1.\n\n    # handle the case when exponent is 0? No, since d starts at 3, exponent is at least 2.\n\n    # compute k_max_candidate = int(n ** (1.0 / exponent)) + 2\n\n    # but for example, when n is 255 and exponent is 7, 255 ** (1/7) is approx 2. So adding 2 gives 4.\n\n    # but then during binary search, the code can check for k up to that value.\n\nBut even if k_max_candidate is larger than necessary, the binary search will find that the sum is larger than n and adjust accordingly.\n\nSo the code can proceed with that.\n\nNow, the code for checking sum for a given k and d:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for d steps. Because for d layers, the sum is sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i. So the loop runs d times, adding k^0, k^1, ..., k^{d-1}.\n\nBut for example, when d=3, the loop runs 3 times, adding 1, k, k^2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo during the binary search, for each mid value (k), compute the sum. If the sum equals n, return yes. If it's less than n, search higher. Else, search lower.\n\nBut for large exponents, even for k=2 and d=60, the sum is 2^60-1, which is about 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, this is manageable.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead t.\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n ==1:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    found = False\n\n    for d",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and our task is to check if such a structure can exist for the given `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex, then adds `k` new vertices connected to the initial vertex. Each subsequent layer adds `k` new vertices to each leaf node from the previous layer. This process must be done at least once.\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: The total number of vertices in such a graph can be represented as the sum of a geometric series. For integers `k > 1` and `d >= 3`, the number of vertices `n` must satisfy the equation $ n = \\frac{k^d - 1}{k - 1} $.\n3. **Efficient Check**: For each possible value of `d` (from 3 up to 60, considering the maximum possible value for `n` up to $10^{18}$), we perform a binary search on `k` to check if there exists an integer `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef check_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"NO\"\n    max_d = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for d in range(3, max_d + 1):\n        exponent = d - 1\n        # Compute approximate k_max\n        if exponent == 0:\n            continue\n        try:\n            k_max_candidate = int(n ** (1.0 / exponent)) + 2\n        except:\n            continue\n        low = 2\n        high = k_max_candidate\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            total = 0\n            current = 1\n            overflow = False\n            for _ in range(d):\n                total += current\n                if total > n:\n                    overflow = True\n                    break\n                current *= mid\n            if overflow:\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                if total == n:\n                    return \"YES\"\n                elif total < n:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n    return \"NO\"\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        print(check_snowflake(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Special Case**: If `n` is 1, it's immediately determined that no valid snowflake can be formed.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Depths**: For each depth `d` from 3 to 60, we calculate the maximum possible value of `k` using a geometric approximation.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid `k`**: For each depth `d`, a binary search is performed over possible values of `k` to check if the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n5. **Early Termination**: If a valid configuration is found for any `d` and `k`, the function returns \"YES\". If no valid configuration is found after all iterations, it returns \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations using mathematical properties and binary search, ensuring it handles very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
