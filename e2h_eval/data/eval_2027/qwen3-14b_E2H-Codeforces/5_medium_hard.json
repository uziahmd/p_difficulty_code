Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The colors can be specific letters or question marks which act as wildcards. We need to find the maximum number of such pairs and output them.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. Let's see. Each left boot can be paired with a right boot if their colors are compatible. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs, ensuring each boot is used at most once.\n\nSo, the approach here might involve some greedy strategy. But how?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases:\n\n1. Both left and right have specific colors. They must match exactly.\n2. One is a question mark and the other is specific. Then they are compatible.\n3. Both are question marks. They are compatible.\n\nThe main idea is to pair as many as possible. How can we do this efficiently?\n\nI remember that in similar problems, like matching with certain constraints, we can use counting and greedy approaches. For example, first pair the specific colors where they match, then use the wildcards (question marks) to fill in the gaps.\n\nBut since each left and right boot can be used once, we need to track which ones are already paired.\n\nLet me outline a possible plan:\n\n- First, process all pairs where the left and right have the same specific color. Pair them up. For example, for each color c, count the number of left boots with color c and right boots with color c. The minimum of these two counts would be the number of pairs we can make here. But we have to assign which ones to pair. However, since we need to track indices, perhaps we need to collect all the positions for each color.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to first pair all the specific matches, then use the question marks to cover the remaining.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks? Let's think:\n\nLet me think of it in steps.\n\nStep 1: Pair all left boots with specific colors with right boots of the same color. For example, for each color c, take the left boots with c and right boots with c. Pair them as much as possible. This is straightforward.\n\nBut how to track which ones are already used? Maybe we can use some data structures. For example, for each color, keep a list of indices (positions) of left and right boots. Then, for each color, we can pair the left and right boots of that color. Once paired, we remove them from the available lists.\n\nBut since we have to process all colors, maybe we can first process the colors that are not '?', and then handle the '?'s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can first pair left and right boots where both are specific and same color, then pair the remaining left boots (specific or ?) with right boots that are ?. And then pair the remaining right boots (specific or ?) with left boots that are ?.\n\nBut I need to make sure that each boot is used once.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a bipartite graph, but with n up to 150,000, that's impossible for standard maximum matching algorithms (like Hungarian), which are O(n^3) or worse. So we need an efficient way, which suggests a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think again. Here's a possible plan:\n\n1. Create two separate lists for left and right boots, which are not yet paired.\n\n2. For each color (excluding '?'), collect all left boots with that color and all right boots with that color. Then, pair as many as possible between them. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, we can pair 3 of them. Once paired, those left and right boots are marked as used.\n\n3. After processing all specific colors, we have some left and right boots that are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched (because the other side didn't have enough of that color).\n\n4. Now, we can pair the remaining left '?' with remaining right boots (including '?'). Similarly, pair remaining right '?' with remaining left boots. But since '?' can match anything, we can pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nWait, but after step 2, the remaining left and right boots are:\n\nLeft: those with color '?' and those with colors that have no corresponding right boots (or vice versa). Similarly for right.\n\nSo, for example, suppose after step 2, we have some left boots with color 'a' (but no right 'a's left), and some right boots with color 'b' (but no left 'b's left). These can't be matched unless they are paired with '?'.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the '?'s. Let's think:\n\nWe can first pair the left '?' with the right '?'s. Then, pair the left '?' with the right non-'?' (but only if they have specific colors that are compatible, but since the left is '?', it can match any right. Wait, but the right may have a specific color. So, any left '?' can pair with any right (non-used) boot. Similarly, any right '?' can pair with any left (non-used) boot.\n\nBut how to maximize the total pairs.\n\nBut here's the thing: once we've processed the specific colors, the remaining left and right boots can be paired using the '?'s. However, there's a problem: if we pair left '?' with right non-'?', then that uses up the right boot, which could have been used by another left '?'. So, perhaps the optimal way is to pair the left '?' with right '?' first, and then pair the remaining left '?' with the remaining right boots (non-?) and vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to pair as many as possible between left '?' and right non-? (since each left '?' can match any right, and each right non-? can be matched with any left '?'). Similarly for the reverse.\n\nBut how to handle this.\n\nLet me think of the remaining left boots (after step 2) as L, and remaining right boots as R. Let's say L has some left boots with '?', and some with specific colors (but their corresponding color has no matching right boots). Similarly for R.\n\nBut since the specific colors in L and R can't be matched (because during step 2, we've already paired all possible specific color matches), the only way to match them is via '?'.\n\nFor example, suppose there is a left boot with color 'a' (not paired yet) and a right boot with color 'b' (not paired yet). These cannot be paired unless one of them is a '?'. But since both are specific, they can't be paired. So, these will remain unpaired.\n\nTherefore, after step 2, the only possible pairs are between:\n\n- Left '?' and right '?'\n- Left '?' and right non-?\n- Right '?' and left non-?\n\nBut how to maximize the total pairs.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nAfter step 2, collect all left boots that are not yet paired. Let's call them left_remaining. Similarly for right_remaining.\n\nNow, for the left_remaining, we can split them into:\n\nleft_q = list of left boots with '?'\n\nleft_c = list of left boots with specific colors (but not paired)\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining:\n\nright_q = list of right boots with '?'\n\nright_c = list of right boots with specific colors (but not paired)\n\nNow, the maximum possible pairs would be:\n\npair as many as possible between left_q and right_q. The number here is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q with right_c. Since each left_q can pair with any right_c. Similarly, pair the remaining right_q with left_c.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWait, but once you pair a left_q with a right_c, that uses up both. So for example, the number of pairs possible between left_q and right_c is the minimum of len(left_q) and len(right_c). But since after pairing left_q with right_q, the remaining left_q can be paired with right_c, and the remaining right_q can be paired with left_c.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to first pair left_q and right_q, then pair the remaining left_q with right_c, and the remaining right_q with left_c. But perhaps there's a better way. For example, maybe pairing some left_q with right_c and some with right_q, but the order might affect the total. However, since all left_q can pair with any right_c, the maximum is the sum of the left_q and right_c (but only up to the total possible pairs). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of pairs is (number of left_q + number of right_q) - (the number of left_q and right_q that can't be paired with each other?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs possible from the remaining is the sum of the number of left_q and right_q and the number of left_c and right_c? No, that's not correct because left_c and right_c can't be paired unless they are '?'.\n\nWait, no. After step 2, the left_c and right_c can't be paired unless they are same color. But during step 2, we've already processed all the same-color pairs. So any left_c and right_c with same color would have been paired in step 2. Therefore, after step 2, the left_c and right_c have colors that are different. So they can't be paired. Therefore, the only possible pairs are between:\n\nleft_q and right_c (any left_q with any right_c)\n\nleft_q and right_q (any left_q with any right_q)\n\nright_q and left_c (any right_q with any left_c)\n\nBut since left_q can pair with any right, and right_q can pair with any left, the optimal way is to pair as follows:\n\nPair left_q with right_c as much as possible, then pair right_q with left_c as much as possible, and then pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to pair left_q with right_c and right_q with left_c, and then pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs possible is the minimum between (number of left_remaining + number of right_remaining) and the sum of (number of left_remaining and right_remaining). Wait, no. That's not helpful.\n\nWait, the total possible pairs after step 2 is the number of left_remaining plus the number of right_remaining minus the number of pairs that can't be made. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since each left_q can be paired with any right (either q or not), and same for right_q. So the maximum possible pairs is the minimum between the number of left_remaining and the number of right_remaining. Wait, no. Because each pair consists of one left and one right. So the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of the total number of left_remaining and right_remaining. But that's only if all can be paired. However, since all left_remaining can be paired with all right_remaining (as long as they are compatible). But since left_q can pair with any right, and right_q can pair with any left, the total possible pairs is the minimum between the number of left_remaining and the number of right_remaining. Because for any left and right, they can be paired. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, suppose there are 3 left_remaining and 2 right_remaining. Then, the maximum pairs is 2. Because each pair uses one left and one right. So yes, the maximum possible is min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining)).\n\nBut how to achieve that. For example, if left_remaining has 3 elements and right_remaining has 2 elements. We can pair two of the left_remaining with the two right_remaining. The third left_remaining is left unpaired.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum number of pairs is min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining)).\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, the left_remaining could have some left_q and left_c, and right_remaining could have some right_q and right_c. But since any left can be paired with any right (as long as they are compatible). Wait, no. The left_c (specific color) can only be paired with right_q or right_c of the same color. But in this scenario, after step 2, the left_c and right_c have no same color pairs. Because during step 2, we already paired all same-color pairs.\n\nSo, for example, if a left_c has color 'a', and a right_c has color 'a', then they would have been paired in step 2. Therefore, after step 2, the left_c and right_c have colors that are not the same. Therefore, a left_c (specific) can only be paired with a right_q. Similarly, a right_c can only be paired with a left_q. Because if the left is 'a' (specific) and the right is 'b' (specific), they can't be paired. But if the right is '?', then they can be paired.\n\nSo, in this case, the left_remaining and right_remaining consist of:\n\nLeft:\n\nleft_q (can pair with any right)\n\nleft_c (can pair with right_q only)\n\nRight:\n\nright_q (can pair with any left)\n\nright_c (can pair with left_q only)\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs is not necessarily min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining)), because some pairs may not be possible. For example, if there are 3 left_c and 3 right_c, but none of their colors match, then the maximum pairs is zero. However, if there are left_c and right_q, then they can be paired.\n\nThis complicates things. So, the previous approach of pairing left_q with right_q first, then left_q with right_c and right_q with left_c may not be sufficient. How can we model this?\n\nHmm. Let's think of the problem as follows:\n\nAfter step 2, we have:\n\nleft_c: list of left boots with specific colors (unpaired)\n\nleft_q: list of left boots with '?'\n\nright_c: list of right boots with specific colors (unpaired)\n\nright_q: list of right boots with '?'\n\nWe need to pair these in such a way that:\n\nEach pair is either:\n\n- left_q and right_q\n\n- left_q and right_c (since left_q can match any)\n\n- right_q and left_c (since right_q can match any)\n\nBut not left_c and right_c (since they have different colors, and they can't be paired).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of pairs between these four groups.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = len(left_q)\n\nB = len(right_q)\n\nC = len(left_c)\n\nD = len(right_c)\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of pairs given that:\n\nEach pair is one of:\n\n- (left_q, right_q): contributes 1 pair per unit.\n\n- (left_q, right_c): each such pair uses one left_q and one right_c.\n\n- (right_q, left_c): each such pair uses one right_q and one left_c.\n\nSo, the total pairs can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet x be the number of (left_q, right_q) pairs.\n\nThen, the remaining left_q is A - x, and remaining right_q is B - x.\n\nNow, we can pair the remaining left_q with right_c, and the remaining right_q with left_c.\n\nThe maximum possible pairs from these would be min(A - x, D) + min(B - x, C).\n\nBut since x can vary between 0 and min(A, B), we need to choose x that maximizes the total.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is 0, because pairing left_q with right_c and right_q with left_c may yield more pairs. For example, if A=3, B=3, C=3, D=3. Then, if x is 3 (pairing all left_q with right_q), the remaining left_q is 0, right_q is 0, so we can't pair any more. Total is 3.\n\nBut if x is 0, then we can pair 3 (left_q with right_c) and 3 (right_q with left_c), total 6 pairs. Which is better.\n\nSo, the choice of x affects the total. Thus, we need to find the x that maximizes x + min(A -x, D) + min(B -x, C).\n\nBut how to find the optimal x. Since x can be in [0, min(A,B)], perhaps we can find the x that gives the maximum value.\n\nBut for large values of A and B, this might be computationally expensive. However, since this is part of a larger problem, perhaps we can find the optimal x analytically.\n\nLet me think: the expression is:\n\nTotal = x + min(A - x, D) + min(B - x, C)\n\nWe need to find x in [0, min(A,B)] that maximizes this.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me consider that the optimal x is the maximum between 0 and (A + B - (C + D)) ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is achieved when x is as small as possible, so that the min(A-x, D) and min(B-x, C) can be as large as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's take some examples.\n\nCase 1: A=3, B=3, C=3, D=3. As before, x=0 gives total 0+3+3=6, which is better than x=3 (total 3+0+0=3). So here, choosing x as small as possible is better.\n\nCase 2: A=2, B=2, C=1, D=1. If x=0, then min(2,1)=1 and min(2,1)=1 â†’ total 0+1+1=2. If x=1, then min(1,1)=1 and min(1,1)=1 â†’ total 1+1+1=3. So here, choosing x=1 is better.\n\nHmm. So the optimal x depends on the values of A, B, C, D.\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we find the optimal x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the total pairs as follows:\n\nThe total number of pairs possible is the sum of:\n\n- The number of pairs between left_q and right_q (x)\n\n- The number of pairs between left_q and right_c (y)\n\n- The number of pairs between right_q and left_c (z)\n\nConstraints:\n\nx â‰¤ min(A,B)\n\ny â‰¤ A -x and y â‰¤ D\n\nz â‰¤ B -x and z â‰¤ C\n\nAlso, x, y, z â‰¥ 0.\n\nBut the maximum total is x + y + z.\n\nBut since y and z are limited by A -x and D, and B -x and C respectively, the maximum possible y is min(A -x, D), and similarly for z.\n\nThus, the maximum total for a given x is x + min(A -x, D) + min(B -x, C).\n\nTo find the optimal x, perhaps we can try x = max(0, (A + B - (C + D))) ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the maximum total is the minimum between (A + B) and (C + D + A + B - ...? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum total is min( (A + B), (C + D) + ...? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the total possible pairs:\n\nEach left_q can be used in either pairing with right_q or right_c.\n\nEach right_q can be used in pairing with left_q or left_c.\n\nEach left_c can be paired with right_q.\n\nEach right_c can be paired with left_q.\n\nSo, the total possible pairs is:\n\nmin( (A + B), (C + D + A + B - ... )) ?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible is the minimum between (A + B) and (C + D + something?), but I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps the optimal way is to pair as many left_q with right_c and right_q with left_c as possible, and then pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nLet me think: the maximum number of pairs between left_q and right_c is min(A, D). Similarly, between right_q and left_c is min(B, C). However, once we pair these, the left_q and right_q that are used in these pairs can't be used for pairing with each other.\n\nSo, for example, if we pair all left_q with right_c (min(A, D) pairs), and all right_q with left_c (min(B, C) pairs), then the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min( (A - min(A, D)) + (B - min(B, C)), ... )? Not sure.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum total is min(A + B, D + C + min(A, D) + min(B, C))? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of:\n\nnumber of pairs between left_q and right_c (call this p1) +\n\nnumber of pairs between right_q and left_c (call this p2) +\n\nnumber of pairs between left_q and right_q (call this p3) \n\nBut p1 + p2 + p3 can't exceed the total possible pairs, which is min( (A + B), (D + C + ... ? )\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nThe total number of pairs possible is the sum of:\n\n- All left_q can be paired with any of the right_c and right_q.\n\n- All right_q can be paired with any of the left_c and left_q.\n\nBut since each pair uses one left and one right, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum between the total number of left_remaining and right_remaining. However, this is only possible if there are enough combinations.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nIn other words, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of (A + C, B + D) and (A + B, C + D) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum between (A + C) and (B + D), but that's not necessarily true.\n\nBut perhaps, given that each left can be paired with any right, the maximum is the minimum of the total number of left_remaining and right_remaining. Because if you have more left than right, you can pair each right with a left. But how?\n\nBut the problem is that some left and right may not be compatible. For example, if left is left_c (specific color) and right is right_c (specific color), and their colors are different. But in this case, since after step 2, these left_c and right_c cannot be paired. So, the maximum pairs is not min(A + C, B + D).\n\nSo, this brings us back to the original problem of how to pair these.\n\nMaybe there's a way to model this as a bipartite graph and find the maximum matching, but for large n, this is not feasible.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 150000, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nAlternative idea: since the only way to pair left_c and right_c is if they are the same color, which was already handled in step 2, and now after step 2, left_c and right_c can't be paired. Therefore, the only possible pairs are between:\n\nleft_q with any right (right_q or right_c)\n\nright_q with any left (left_q or left_c)\n\nThus, the problem reduces to:\n\nWe have two sets: left_set (left_q and left_c) and right_set (right_q and right_c). We need to pair as many as possible, with the constraints that:\n\n- left_c can only be paired with right_q.\n\n- right_c can only be paired with left_q.\n\n- left_q can be paired with any right.\n\n- right_q can be paired with any left.\n\nSo, the problem becomes a bipartitioned matching problem. But how to model this.\n\nLet me think of it as follows:\n\nWe can pair:\n\n- left_q with right_q â†’ 1 pair per unit.\n\n- left_q with right_c â†’ 1 pair per unit.\n\n- right_q with left_c â†’ 1 pair per unit.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\npairs between left_q and right_q,\n\nplus pairs between left_q and right_c,\n\nplus pairs between right_q and left_c.\n\nBut the sum is constrained by the availability of each component.\n\nBut how to find the maximum.\n\nLet me consider that the number of pairs between left_q and right_c is limited by the number of left_q and right_c. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut since pairing left_q with right_c uses up one left_q and one right_c, and pairing right_q with left_c uses up one right_q and one left_c.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLetâ€™s say we pair as many left_q with right_c as possible. Letâ€™s say that number is x = min(A, D). Then, after that, we pair as many right_q with left_c as possible: y = min(B, C). Then, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as z = min( (A - x) + (B - y), ... ? Well, after pairing x and y, the remaining left_q is A - x, and the remaining right_q is B - y. But also, the remaining right_c is D - x, and left_c is C - y. But since those are already used up, no. Wait, after pairing x left_q with right_c, the right_c are reduced by x. Similarly, after pairing y right_q with left_c, the left_c are reduced by y. But since after step 2, there are no more pairs between left_c and right_c, these are the only possibilities.\n\nSo, after pairing x and y, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min(A - x + B - y, ... ? No, because they can be paired between each other. The maximum possible pairs is min( (A - x) + (B - y), ... ? No, the maximum pairs between left_q and right_q is min( (A - x), (B - y) ). Because each pair uses one left_q and one right_q.\n\nSo the total pairs would be x + y + min( (A - x), (B - y) ).\n\nBut how to choose x and y to maximize this.\n\nBut x is min(A, D), and y is min(B, C). Is this the optimal choice?\n\nFor example, in the earlier case where A=3, B=3, C=3, D=3:\n\nx = min(3,3) =3, y = min(3,3)=3. Then, A-x=0, B-y=0. So total is 3+3+0=6, which is correct.\n\nIn the case where A=2, B=2, C=1, D=1:\n\nx = min(2,1) =1. y = min(2,1)=1. Then, A-x=1, B-y=1. min(1,1)=1. Total is 1+1+1=3, which is better than the previous example where x=1 and y=1.\n\nSo this approach works for those cases.\n\nAnother example: A=3, B=3, C=3, D=1. Then x = min(3,1) =1. y = min(3,3) =3. Then A-x = 2, B-y =0. min(2, 0) is 0. Total is 1+3+0=4. What's the maximum possible? Let's think:\n\nWe have left_q =3, right_q=3, left_c=3, right_c=1.\n\nPairing left_q with right_c (1 pair). Then, pairing right_q with left_c (3 pairs). Now, remaining left_q is 3-1=2, right_q is 3-3=0. So we can pair 0 pairs between left_q and right_q. Total is 1+3+0=4.\n\nAlternatively, if we pair right_q with left_c first (say 3 pairs), then pair left_q with right_c (1 pair). Same result.\n\nAnother possibility is pairing left_q with right_q first. Suppose x=3 pairs between left_q and right_q. Then, left_q is 0, right_q is 0. Then, pair left_q with right_c (0 pairs), and right_q with left_c (0 pairs). Total is 3. Less than 4. So the approach of pairing left_q with right_c and right_q with left_c first gives better results.\n\nSo this suggests that pairing as much as possible between left_q and right_c, and between right_q and left_c, and then pairing the remaining left_q and right_q, gives the maximum possible pairs.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nAfter step 2, collect left_q, left_c, right_q, right_c.\n\nPair as many as possible between left_q and right_c. Let x = min(len(left_q), len(right_c)).\n\nPair as many as possible between right_q and left_c. Let y = min(len(right_q), len(left_c)).\n\nThen, pair as many as possible between the remaining left_q and right_q. Let z = min(len(left_q) - x, len(right_q) - y).\n\nAdd x + y + z to the total.\n\nSo, this seems manageable.\n\nBut how to implement this, and track which boots are paired.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe overall steps are:\n\n1. For each color (excluding '?'), collect the indices of left and right boots.\n\n2. For each color c, pair as many left boots with right boots of the same color. For example, for each c, take the left list and right list, and pair the first min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) pairs. Mark them as used.\n\n3. After this, collect the remaining left boots (those not yet paired) into left_q and left_c. Similarly for right.\n\n   For example, left_remaining is all left boots not yet paired. For each of these, if the color is '?', add to left_q. Else, add to left_c. Similarly for right.\n\n4. Then, proceed with the steps outlined above to pair the remaining left and right boots.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nImplementation Details:\n\nWe need to track which boots are used. Since the input strings can be up to 150,000 characters, we need an efficient way to track used indices.\n\nSo, for each left and right boot, we can have a boolean array indicating whether it's used or not.\n\nBut for the initial pairing (step 2), we can process each color, and for each color, pair the left and right boots.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe can create dictionaries for left and right, mapping color to a list of indices. For example, left_color_map[c] is a list of indices i where l[i] == c.\n\nSimilarly for right_color_map.\n\nThen, for each color c (not '?'), we take the left and right lists. For each pair, we can pair the first k elements, where k is the minimum of the lengths of the two lists.\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, for color c, we have left_list and right_list. For each i in 0 to k-1, we pair left_list[i] with right_list[i].\n\nOnce paired, we mark those indices as used.\n\nBut how to track the used indices.\n\nSo, for the initial pairing:\n\nWe can have two arrays: used_left and used_right, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nFor each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map (excluding '?'):\n\n   left_list = left_color_map[c]\n\n   right_list = right_color_map[c]\n\n   k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in 0 to k-1:\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nThis would pair as many as possible for each color.\n\nOnce this is done, we collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nThen, for the remaining left boots, we collect the ones not used into left_q and left_c. Similarly for right.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair left_q with right_c, then right_q with left_c, then remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to collect the lists for left_q, left_c, right_q, right_c.\n\nFor example:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nleft_c = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nOnce we have these lists, we can proceed with pairing.\n\nNow, pairing left_q with right_c:\n\nTake the first min(len(left_q), len(right_c)) pairs. For each pair, we take left_q[i] and right_c[i], and mark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for pairing right_q with left_c.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q after pairing with right_c.\n\nremaining_right_q = right_q after pairing with left_c.\n\nThen, pair the first min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q)) pairs.\n\nSo, the code for this part would be:\n\n# collect left_q, left_c, right_q, right_c\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nleft_c = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\nright_c = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\n# pair left_q with right_c\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_c))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    a = left_q[i]\n    b = right_c[i]\n    # mark them as used\n    used_left[a] = True\n    used_right[b] = True\n    # add to the answer list\n    pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\n# now, collect the remaining left_q and right_q\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in range(len(left_q)) if i >= num_pairs]\nremaining_left_q = left_q[num_pairs:]\n\nremaining_right_q = [i for i in range(len(right_q)) if i >= ... ? No, wait, after pairing left_q with right_c, the remaining left_q is left_q[num_pairs:], and the remaining right_c is right_c[num_pairs:]. But right_c is now used up for pairing with left_q, so for the next step, we need to collect the remaining right_q.\n\nWait, no. The right_c list is the list of right boots that are not used and have specific colors. When we pair left_q with right_c, we take some of the right_c and mark them as used. So after that, the remaining right_c are those not used. But for the next step, we need to process the right_q (which are not used yet).\n\nWait, the right_q and right_c are separate lists. So, after pairing left_q with right_c, the right_c that were used are marked as used. So the remaining right_q is still the same as before (since we only used some of the right_c).\n\nSo, after pairing left_q with right_c, the remaining right_q is the original right_q list, and the remaining left_q is the original left_q list after removing the first num_pairs elements.\n\nThen, we proceed to pair right_q with left_c.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n# pair right_q with left_c\nnum_pairs2 = min(len(right_q), len(left_c))\nfor i in range(num_pairs2):\n    a = right_q[i] # no, wait, the right_q is the list of right boots with '?', and left_c is the list of left boots with specific colors.\n    # So, for each pair, we pair a right_q with a left_c.\n    # So:\n    a = left_c[i]\n    b = right_q[i]\n    used_left[a] = True\n    used_right[b] = True\n    pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\nThen, collect the remaining right_q and left_c.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[num_pairs:]\nremaining_right_q = right_q[num_pairs2:]\n\nnum_pairs3 = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs3):\n    a = remaining_left_q[i]\n    b = remaining_right_q[i]\n    used_left[a] = True\n    used_right[b] = True\n    pairs.append( (a+1, b+1) )\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut how to collect the lists for left_q, left_c, right_q, right_c.\n\nNow, the problem is that for large n (up to 150,000), creating these lists may take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nBut what about the order of pairing? For example, when pairing left_q with right_c, we can pair the first elements of the lists. But since the problem allows any valid pairing, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as arrays of False.\n\nCreate left_color_map and right_color_map.\n\nFor each color in left_color_map and right_color_map, process the specific colors (excluding '?').\n\nThen collect the remaining left and right boots, and proceed as above.\n\nBut how to create the color maps. For example:\n\nleft_color_map can be a defaultdict(list), where for each character in l, we append the index to the list.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nBut since the problem says that the colors are lowercase letters or '?', we can loop through each character in l and r, and build the maps.\n\nOnce that's done, for each color c (excluding '?'), we process the left and right lists.\n\nBut we need to process all colors except '?', and for each, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\n",
