Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. The city is divided by infinite roads (lines) into regions called blocks. Each block is a region separated by these lines. Moving between blocks is allowed if they share a common border (a segment of some length), not just a point. So, the challenge is to model these blocks and find the shortest path between the home and university blocks.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n roads, each road can be thought of as dividing the plane into two parts. However, with multiple roads, the number of blocks can be very large. For example, with n roads, the maximum number of regions is O(n²), but for n up to 300, that's 90,000 regions. But considering that each step is moving across a road, perhaps we can model the problem using BFS, where each node is a block, and edges exist between blocks that share a common border.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks uniquely? Because each block can be identified by its position relative to all the roads. For example, for each road, the block is on one side or the other. So, for each road, the sign of the equation ax + by + c = 0 can determine which side of the road the block is on. \n\nWait, but the home and university points are not on any road. So, for each road, we can compute whether the home point is on the positive or negative side of the line. Similarly for the university. The question is: how to model the blocks such that two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road's sign (i.e., they are separated by that road). Wait, no. Because two blocks that are adjacent across a single road would differ in exactly one road's sign. But if two blocks are separated by multiple roads, then their signs would differ in more than one road. \n\nWait, but the adjacency condition is that two blocks share a common border. Which means that they are separated by exactly one road. Because if two blocks are separated by two roads, then their common boundary would be the intersection of those two roads, which is a point, not a line. Therefore, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. So, for each block, the state can be represented by the signs of each road's equation evaluated at a point in the block. \n\nSo, the key idea here is that each block can be uniquely determined by the sign vector (s_1, s_2, ..., s_n), where s_i is the sign of a_i x + b_i y + c_i for a point in the block. Since the home and university points are not on any road, their sign vectors are fixed. \n\nBut how do we model the blocks? Well, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign changes needed to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step flips exactly one sign (since crossing a road changes the sign of exactly that road's equation). However, this might not be entirely accurate. Let me think again.\n\nIf two blocks are adjacent across a road, then their sign vectors differ in exactly one component (the road's sign). So, moving from one block to another requires flipping exactly one sign. So, the problem becomes similar to a graph where each node is a sign vector, and edges connect sign vectors that differ in exactly one component. Then, the problem is to find the minimal number of steps (flips) to get from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector.\n\nBut wait, that seems too simplistic. Because each road is a line. If you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. But how do you know that the sign vectors differ in exactly one component?\n\nYes. Suppose you have two blocks that are adjacent across road i. Then, for road i, the sign is different. For all other roads j ≠ i, the sign remains the same. So, the sign vectors differ in exactly one component. Therefore, the adjacency graph is such that each node is connected to others that differ in exactly one component. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign changes (i.e., flipping one sign at a time) needed to transform the home's sign vector into the university's sign vector. However, this is only possible if the two sign vectors differ in an even number of positions? No, because each step flips exactly one sign. So the minimal steps is the number of differing positions between the home and university sign vectors. Wait, no. Because each step can flip a sign. For example, suppose the home's sign vector has s_i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Blocks and Roads**: Each road divides the plane into two regions. A block can be uniquely identified by the sign of its position relative to each road. This sign can be determined by evaluating the road equation at a given point (home or university).\n\n2. **Sign Vectors**: For both the home and university positions, compute a sign vector where each element corresponds to the sign of the result of plugging the coordinates into the respective road equation. This vector helps identify which side of each road the point lies on.\n\n3. **Graph Representation**: Treat each block as a node in a graph. Two nodes (blocks) are connected if they differ in exactly one sign (i.e., adjacent across one road). The problem then reduces to finding the shortest path between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector in this graph.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to explore the shortest path from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector. Each state in the BFS represents a sign vector, and transitions involve flipping one sign at a time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    def get_sign_vector(x, y):\n        vec = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            if val > 0:\n                vec.append(1)\n            else:\n                vec.append(-1)\n        return tuple(vec)\n\n    home_vec = get_sign_vector(x1, y1)\n    univ_vec = get_sign_vector(x2, y2)\n\n    # Check if they are already the same\n    if home_vec == univ_vec:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # BFS setup\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque()\n    queue.append((home_vec, 0))\n    visited.add(home_vec)\n\n    while queue:\n        current, steps = queue.popleft()\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Flip the i-th sign\n            new_vec = list(current)\n            new_vec[i] *= -1\n            new_vec = tuple(new_vec)\n            if new_vec == univ_vec:\n                print(steps + 1)\n                return\n            if new_vec not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_vec)\n                queue.append((new_vec, steps + 1))\n\n    # According to the problem statement, it's guaranteed to have a solution\n    print(-1)  # This line is theoretically unreachable\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for the home and university, followed by the list of roads.\n2. **Sign Vector Calculation**: For both the home and university positions, we compute their sign vectors relative to each road.\n3. **BFS Initialization**: We start BFS from the home's sign vector, initializing a queue with the initial state and a step count of zero.\n4. **BFS Execution**: For each state, we generate new states by flipping each sign in the sign vector (representing crossing a road).
