Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent each block? Since there are n roads, each block is determined by the arrangement of these lines. But directly representing all possible blocks isn't feasible because the number can be exponential in n. However, since we only need to find the shortest path between two specific blocks (home and university), perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of considering each block, think of each region as being defined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, the block lies on one side of the line or the other. So, for each road, the home point will be on one side, and the university on some other side. The key is that moving between adjacent blocks requires crossing exactly one road. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university positions, but with the steps being transitions through adjacent regions.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe using BFS. Each state in the BFS represents the current \"position\" in terms of which side of each road you're on. However, since n can be up to 300, representing the state as a binary vector of length n (for each road, whether you are on the positive or negative side) would be impossible due to memory and computational constraints. Because 2^300 is way too big.\n\nHmm, that's not going to work. So there must be another approach. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: the movement between blocks is allowed if they share a common border. Which means that two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road. Because crossing a single road would take you from one block to another. So, the adjacency between blocks depends on the roads that separate them.\n\nBut how can we model this? Well, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node represents a region (block), and edges connect regions that are adjacent. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home's region and the university's region.\n\nBut how do we represent the regions? Again, the problem is that there are too many regions. However, the key observation here is that the minimal steps required to get from home to university is equal to the minimal number of roads that separate them. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Suppose the home and university are in regions that are separated by k roads. Then, the minimal steps would be k. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of each region as being defined by the sign of each road. For each road, the home is either in the positive or negative half-plane. Similarly for the university. So, the problem is similar to a hypercube graph where each node is a combination of signs, and edges exist between nodes that differ in exactly one sign. Then, the minimal steps between the home and university is the Hamming distance between their sign vectors, but only if each step can flip one bit. However, this is only true if the regions are connected in such a way that each adjacent region differs by exactly one road. But that's not necessarily the case. Because when multiple roads cross, the regions can be adjacent even if they differ by more than one road. Wait, no. Because two regions that are adjacent must share a common border, which is a line (a road). So, they must differ by exactly one road. Because crossing that road takes you from one region to another. Therefore, the regions are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one road. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector. But how?\n\nWait, the home and university are in two different regions. Let's compute for each road whether the home is on the positive or negative side. Similarly for the university. Then, the difference between these two vectors is the number of roads where their signs differ. But since each step allows us to cross a single road, the minimal steps would be the number of differing roads divided by something? Or is it the minimal number of steps to transition through roads?\n\nWait, no. Because each step can cross one road. So, if the home and university are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps is k. Because each step can cross one road. But wait, that's not necessarily true. For example, if the home and university are in regions that differ in exactly two roads, but those two roads are not overlapping. How can you cross them? Well, perhaps you can cross one road, then another. So the minimal steps would be 2. Which is the number of differing roads.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common border between two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Regions and Roads**: Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university positions lie in specific regions determined by their positions relative to these roads.\n2. **Sign Vector Representation**: For each road, determine whether the home and university positions lie on the positive or negative side of the road. This can be represented as a binary vector (sign vector) for each position.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between their sign vectors. This is because each step corresponds to crossing a single road, which changes the sign for exactly one road.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n            idx += 1\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    def get_sign_vector(x, y):\n        vec = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            if val > 0:\n                vec.append(1)\n            else:\n                vec.append(0)\n        return vec\n\n    home_vec = get_sign_vector(x1, y1)\n    univ_vec = get_sign_vector(x2, y2)\n\n    diff = sum(h != u for h, u in zip(home_vec, univ_vec))\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home, university, and the list of roads.\n2. **Sign Vector Calculation**: For both the home and university positions, a sign vector is computed. Each element of this vector indicates whether the point lies on the positive or negative side of the corresponding road.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university positions gives the minimum number of steps required. This is because each differing element in the sign vectors corresponds to a road that needs to be crossed to move from one block to another.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging the properties of linear equations and Hamming distances, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
