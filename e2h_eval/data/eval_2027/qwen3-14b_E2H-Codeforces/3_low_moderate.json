Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l. \n\nFirst, I think the approach here is to sort the lantern positions. Because if they're sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum gap. Then, the required d would be half of that maximum gap. Wait, but why?\n\nLet me think. Suppose there are two adjacent lanterns. Let's say they are at positions a and b, with a < b. The area between them that isn't covered by either lantern would be the middle part. The maximum distance from either lantern to the midpoint between them would be (b - a)/2. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d must be at least half the distance between them. Because if you have a gap between two lanterns, the worst case is the middle of that gap. So the maximum of these half-gap values would be the minimal d needed.\n\nBut wait, what about the ends? Like, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is something. Similarly for the end of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the left end (0) needs to be covered. The distance from a1 to 0 is a1. So the required d must be at least a1. Similarly, if the last lantern is at position an, then the distance from an to l is l - an. So that's another candidate for the maximum d.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the first lantern to 0, and from the last lantern to l. These are initial candidates for max_d.\n3. Then iterate through consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them, divide by two, and compare to the current max_d.\n4. The maximum among all these values is the minimal required d.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for the entire street to be covered, all the gaps between lanterns must be covered, and the ends must be covered as well.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n7 15\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCheck the first lantern: 0. So the distance from 0 to 0 is 0. So that's not a problem. The last lantern is at 15. The distance from 15 to l (which is 15) is 0. So no problem there.\n\nNow the consecutive pairs:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: distance is 3. Half is 1.5. Current max_d is 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and 5: distance is 2. Half is 1.0. Max remains 1.5.\n\nBetween 5 and 7: distance 2 → 1.0. Same.\n\nBetween 7 and 9: same, 1.0.\n\nBetween 9 and 14: distance is 5. Half is 2.5. Now max is 2.5.\n\nBetween 14 and 15: distance 1 → 0.5. So the maximum is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nAnother sample input is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted, they are 2,5.\n\nFirst lantern is at 2. Distance from 0 is 2. So that's a candidate. Last lantern is at 5. Distance from l=5 is 0. Then between 2 and 5, the distance is 3. Half is 1.5. So the maximum is max(2, 1.5) = 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.0.\n\nYes, so the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all lanterns are at 0. For example, n=1, l=5. The lantern is at 0. Then the distance from 0 to 0 is 0, but the other end is l=5. The distance from lantern to end is 5. So the required d is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=0? Wait, no, l is at least 1 according to input constraints. So no.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 0 and 10. Then the gap between them is 10. Half is 5. So d",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ such that all points on a street of length $ l $ are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at various points along the street, and each lantern can illuminate points within a distance $ d $ from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check the Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the end of the street ($ l $) to the last lantern. These distances are initial candidates for the maximum required radius $ d $.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the gap between them. The required radius $ d $ for covering this gap is half the gap's length because the midpoint of the gap will be farthest from either lantern.\n4. **Determine the Maximum Radius**: The required radius $ d $ is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the ends of the street and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    first = a[0]\n    max_d = max(max_d, first)\n    \n    # Check the last lantern\n    last = a[-1]\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - last)\n    \n    # Check between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lanterns**: By sorting the positions of the lanterns, we can systematically check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **End Points Check**: The first lantern's position relative to the start of the street (0) and the last lantern's position relative to the end of the street ($ l $) are checked to ensure these endpoints are covered.\n- **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is divided by two to determine the minimum radius needed to cover the midpoint of the gap. This ensures that the entire street is illuminated without any dark spots.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius $ d $ with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is $ O(n \\log n) $, where $ n $ is the number of lanterns. This is efficient given the constraints $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 1000 $.",
