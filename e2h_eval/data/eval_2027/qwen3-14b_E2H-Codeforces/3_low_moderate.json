Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various points. Each lantern can light up a segment around it with radius d. We need to find the smallest d such that all points on the street are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. So the approach here would be to figure out the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required radius based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the radius needs to cover that gap. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Suppose two consecutive lanterns are at positions a and b. The distance between them is (b - a). The maximum distance from the edge of their coverage areas would be half of that distance. Because if the lanterns are placed such that their coverage areas just touch each other, then the radius needed for each would be (b - a)/2. Wait, no. Let's imagine that between two lanterns, the worst case is the midpoint between them. For example, if two lanterns are at positions 0 and 5, then the middle point is 2.5. So the radius must be at least 2.5 to cover that point. So the maximum of all these gaps divided by two is the required d.\n\nBut wait, what about the ends of the street? Like, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would be a gap. Similarly for the end of the street. So we need to check those as well.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in order.\n2. Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. That's a gap. Similarly, check the distance from the last lantern to l.\n3. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n4. The maximum of all these gaps divided by two is the required d.\n\nWait, but why? Let me think again. For example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to 3 is 3. The radius must be at least 3 to cover the 0 point. Because the lantern's coverage is up to d from it. So if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1 - 0. The radius must be at least a1 - 0, because otherwise the area from 0 to a1 - d would not be covered. Wait, no. Wait, the lantern's coverage is from a_i -d to a_i +d. So for the start of the street (0) to be covered, there must be some lantern whose a_i -d <=0 <=a_i +d. Which implies that d >= a_i -0 (if a_i is the first lantern). Wait, no. Let's say the first lantern is at position a. Then the leftmost point it can cover is a -d. To cover 0, we need a -d <=0. Which implies d >= a. But that's only if the lantern is the first one. So for example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 3. So the radius must be at least 3 to cover 0. Similarly, if the last lantern is at position l - x, then the radius must be at least x to cover the end of the street.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n\n- Compute the maximum of:\n\n   (the first lantern's position - 0), \n\n   (l - last lantern's position),\n\n   and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nBecause between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance between them is (b - a). The worst case is the midpoint between them. So the required radius is (b - a)/2. Because if you have two lanterns at a and b, then the midpoint is (a + b)/2. The distance from a to this point is (b -a)/2. So the radius must be at least that. So for the gaps between consecutive lanterns, the required d is (gap)/2.\n\nSo the overall answer is the maximum between the first gap (first lantern's position), the last gap (l - last lantern's position), and the max of (consecutive gaps)/2.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nSort the array of lanterns.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as the maximum between (a[0] - 0) and (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference between them, divide by 2, and see if that's larger than the current max_d.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum of all those",
