Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the task is to find two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the sum of their costs is as small as possible. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the duration is. Oh right, the duration is ri - li + 1. So for each voucher, we can calculate that. Then, for each voucher, we need to find another voucher that has a duration of (x - duration_i), and they don't overlap.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find such pairs?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since n can be up to 2e5, O(n^2) approaches are out of the question. Need something more efficient.\n\nSo maybe we can pre-process vouchers by their duration. For each voucher with duration d, we look for vouchers with duration (x - d), and check if they are non-overlapping.\n\nBut even that might be tricky. Because for each voucher, checking all vouchers of the required duration could be O(n) per voucher, leading to O(n^2) in worst case. Not good.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible duration d, keep track of the minimum cost vouchers. But how to handle the non-overlapping condition?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's split the problem into two parts. For each voucher i, we want to find a voucher j where:\n\n- duration_i + duration_j = x\n- voucher j ends before voucher i starts (rj < li)\nOR\nvoucher i ends before voucher j starts (ri < lj)\n\nSo for each voucher i with duration d, we need to find vouchers of duration (x - d) that end before li, or start after ri.\n\nSo perhaps, for each duration value, we can have some data structures that allow us to query the minimum cost voucher that ends before a certain day, or starts after a certain day.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have all vouchers grouped by their duration. For each duration d, we can have a sorted list of vouchers' end times, along with their start times and costs. Wait, but how to efficiently find the minimum cost voucher that ends before a certain day (like li) for a given duration.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration d, we can have two structures:\n\n1. A sorted list of end times (r) of vouchers with duration d. For each voucher i with duration d, when looking for vouchers j with duration (x - d) that end before li, we can find all vouchers j with duration (x - d) where rj < li. Then among those, find the one with minimum cost.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers j that start after ri (so lj > ri), we can find the minimum cost voucher with duration (x - d) that has lj > ri.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For each duration d, let's have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time (r) for vouchers with duration d. Also, for each such list, we can precompute the minimum cost up to each position. So that when we query for the maximum rj less than a certain value, we can find the minimum cost in that prefix.\n\nWait, but that's not directly possible. Alternatively, for each duration d, we can have a list of vouchers sorted by their end time. And for each such list, we can have a structure that allows querying the minimum cost in all vouchers with end time <= some value. Similarly for start times.\n\nBut how to build that? Maybe using a prefix minimum array. For example, if we sort the vouchers of duration d by their end time, then for each position in the sorted list, we can store the minimum cost up to that index. Then, when we want to find the minimum cost among all vouchers with end time <= some value, we can perform a binary search to find the largest end time <= that value, and then take the prefix minimum up to that index.\n\nSame for the other case: for vouchers with duration d, sorted by start time. Then, for a given start time (say, ri + 1), find the first voucher whose start time is greater than ri, and then find the minimum cost in that suffix.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, store two sorted lists:\n\n   a) List of vouchers sorted by end time (r), and for each, a prefix minimum cost array.\n\n   b) List of vouchers sorted by start time (l), and for each, a suffix minimum cost array.\n\nThen, for each voucher i:\n\n   Compute its duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\n   If x - d is not a valid duration (i.e., no vouchers have that duration), skip.\n\n   Else:\n\n      For the target duration t = x - d, check two possibilities:\n\n         1. Find vouchers of duration t that end before li. The minimal cost of such vouchers.\n\n         2. Find vouchers of duration t that start after ri. The minimal cost of such vouchers.\n\n      Take the minimum between these two options (if any exist), and add it to the cost of voucher i. Keep track of the global minimum.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\n   compute d = ri - li + 1\n\n   t = x - d\n\n   if t is not in our duration map, continue\n\n   else:\n\n      check for vouchers of duration t that end before li. How?\n\n         For the sorted list of vouchers of duration t, sorted by end time, find the largest end time <= li - 1. Then, get the min cost up to that index.\n\n      check for vouchers of duration t that start after ri. How?\n\n         For the sorted list of vouchers of duration t, sorted by start time, find the first start time > ri. Then, get the min cost from that index onwards.\n\n      combine these two possibilities and see if any of them exists. If yes, add to the possible answer.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, we need to group all vouchers by their duration. Let's create a dictionary, say duration_dict, where the key is the duration, and the value is a tuple of two lists:\n\n   list1: sorted by end time (r), and a prefix_min array.\n\n   list2: sorted by start time (l), and a suffix_min array.\n\nBut how to build those.\n\nFor each duration d in the duration_dict:\n\n   collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\n   sort them by end time (r) and create a prefix_min array. For example, for the sorted list, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], current voucher's cost).\n\n   Similarly, sort them by start time (l) and create a suffix_min array. For the sorted list, suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], current voucher's cost).\n\nWait, but the suffix_min for the start time sorted list would be the minimum cost from index i to end.\n\nSo for example, if the list is sorted by l, then for each position i, the suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost in the subarray from i to end.\n\nOnce these are built, then for a given li, when looking for vouchers of duration t that end before li, we can do a binary search on the end-sorted list to find the largest r <= li-1. If found, the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the start-sorted list, we can binary search for the first l > ri. Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to perform the binary search?\n\nFor the first case (end time):\n\nWe have a list of vouchers sorted by r. We can extract the r values into a separate array, say end_times. Then, perform a binary search on end_times to find the largest value <= li - 1. The index of that element will tell us which prefix to take.\n\nSimilarly for the start time.\n\nNow, for the binary search part, in Python, we can use the bisect module. For example, bisect_right(end_times, li-1) gives the insertion point. The index would be insertion_point -1. If insertion_point is 0, then there are no elements <= li-1.\n\nFor the start time case, we want to find the first l that is > ri. So we can use bisect_right on the start_times list for ri. The insertion point gives the first element larger than ri. All elements from that index onwards are candidates. Then, the suffix_min array for that index gives the minimum cost in that range.\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nFor each voucher, compute its duration. Then, group them into duration_dict.\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, process the two sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through each voucher again. For each voucher, compute d, check if x-d exists in the duration_dict. If not, skip. Else, proceed.\n\nFor the current voucher's li and ri, check for vouchers of duration t=x-d that end before li (so their rj < li) or start after ri (so lj > ri). For each of these two cases, find the minimal cost if possible.\n\nNow, for the first case: vouchers of duration t that end before li. So we look into the duration_dict[t] end_sorted list.\n\nSimilarly for the second case.\n\nSo for each voucher, we can check both possibilities and collect the minimal possible sum.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\n- What if a voucher's duration is exactly x/2, but there's another voucher with same duration and non-overlapping. But since x is the sum, for example, if x is even, and two vouchers each of duration x/2, but non-overlapping.\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: when x is 0? Well, according to input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, no. The input says x is between 2 and 2e5. Wait, the first line says \"the duration of Leha's vacation is exactly x days\". The problem says that Leha wants to split into two parts, so x must be at least 2. But according to the input constraints, x can be 2 or more. So the code doesn't need to handle x=0 or 1.\n\nWait, the input constraints for x are 2 ≤ x ≤ 2e5. So no problem.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplementing the grouping:\n\nWe can create a dictionary, say from collections import defaultdict.\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict( ... )\n\nBut for each duration, we need to have two sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nSo for each duration d, we can have:\n\nsorted_by_end: list of vouchers sorted by r, and a prefix_min array.\n\nsorted_by_start: list of vouchers sorted by l, and a suffix_min array.\n\nBut how to represent this. For example, for each duration d, we can have:\n\n- end_sorted: a list of (r, cost) sorted by r.\n\nBut actually, we can just store the list of r's and the list of costs, and compute prefix min.\n\nWait, perhaps for each duration d, we can precompute:\n\nend_list: sorted list of vouchers' end times (r), and a prefix_min array.\n\nstart_list: sorted list of vouchers' start times (l), and a suffix_min array.\n\nBut to compute the prefix min, we need to have the list of costs in the same order as the end_list.\n\nSo, for example, for each duration d:\n\nvouchers = list of all vouchers with duration d.\n\nSort them by end time (r), then create end_times = [voucher.r for voucher in sorted_vouchers], and costs = [voucher.cost for ...]. Then, compute prefix_min as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = costs[0]\n\nfor i in 1 to len(costs)-1:\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], costs[i])\n\nSimilarly, for the start_list: sort the vouchers by l, then create start_times = [voucher.l for ...], and costs. Then, compute suffix_min:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = costs[-1]\n\nfor i in len(costs)-2 downto 0:\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min( costs[i], suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each duration, we can have:\n\n- end_sorted: list of (r, cost) sorted by r.\n\nBut perhaps better to separate into end_times and cost array, and prefix_min array.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can process as follows.\n\nSo, for each duration d:\n\nCollect all vouchers with that duration.\n\nSort them by r, then create end_times = [v.r for v in sorted_vouchers], and costs_end = [v.cost for v in ...], and prefix_min_end = [ ... ].\n\nSimilarly, sort them by l, create start_times = [v.l for ...], and costs_start = [v.cost for ...], and suffix_min_start = [ ... ].\n\nOnce that's done, for a given voucher i with duration d, and target duration t = x -d, we can check:\n\nCase 1: find vouchers of duration t that end before li (rj < li). So for the duration t, check if there exists any voucher in the end_sorted list with rj < li.\n\nIf yes, then find the minimum cost in that subset.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers of duration t that start after ri (lj > ri). For that, check the start_sorted list, and find the minimum cost in the subset where lj > ri.\n\nSo, in code, for each voucher:\n\nd = ri - li + 1\n\nt = x -d\n\nif t not in duration_dict: continue\n\nelse:\n\n   process case 1 and case 2.\n\nNow, for case 1:\n\nIn duration_dict[t], we have end_times and prefix_min_end.\n\nWe need to find the largest rj in end_times that is <= li-1.\n\nIf there is such a rj, then the minimal cost is prefix_min_end[...].\n\nHow to find that index?\n\nUse bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li-1) - 1.\n\nIf the index is >=0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min_end[index].\n\nSimilarly for case 2:\n\nIn duration_dict[t], we have start_times and suffix_min_start.\n\nWe need to find the first lj in start_times that is > ri.\n\nUsing bisect.bisect_right(start_times, ri) gives the insertion point. So all elements from that index onwards are lj > ri.\n\nIf the insertion point is less than len(start_times), then the minimal cost is suffix_min_start[insertion_point].\n\nSo for example, if insertion_point is k, then the elements from k to end have lj > ri, and the suffix_min_start[k] is the minimal cost in that range.\n\nNow, we need to make sure that in the case where there are multiple vouchers, but we have to avoid using the same voucher twice. Wait, because the problem says i != j. So when considering voucher i and looking for voucher j, we have to ensure that j is not the same as i. But how?\n\nWait, suppose that voucher i has duration d, and t = x -d. So if t = d, then x = 2d. So in this case, we could have voucher j being the same as i, but only if there are two vouchers with the same duration and non-overlapping. However, since the problem says i and j must be different, we need to make sure that when we look for vouchers of duration t, we don't include the current voucher i if it's also of duration t and meets the criteria.\n\nBut how can this happen? For example, if a voucher i has duration d, and x = 2d. Then, when looking for vouchers of duration t = d, and if voucher i is in the list of vouchers of duration t, then during the processing of voucher i, we may consider it as a candidate j. But since j must be different from i, we need to check whether the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because in the current approach, when we process voucher i, we look for vouchers j in duration t. But if voucher i is part of that duration (i.e., if t = d, and x = 2d), then when we check for vouchers j that end before li, or start after ri, we need to make sure that voucher j is not the same as voucher i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nHmm. For example, suppose voucher i is of duration d, and t = x -d = d. So we are looking for another voucher j of duration d. Now, if voucher i is in the list of vouchers of duration d, then during the case 1 or case 2 processing, we might find voucher i itself. But since j must be different from i, we need to exclude it.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nWell, when building the duration_dict, for each duration, we have all the vouchers. So, for example, when processing voucher i, if t = d, then the duration_dict[t] includes voucher i. So during the processing, when looking for vouchers j of duration t, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how can we do that? Because in the case where the voucher i is part of the duration t, and during the case 1 or case 2, the minimal cost could be from voucher i itself. But that's invalid.\n\nSo, this is a problem. How to avoid selecting the same voucher twice?\n\nOne approach is to, for each voucher i, when checking the duration t, to check if the voucher j is different from i. However, in our current setup, the data structures don't track which voucher is which. So how can we handle this?\n\nAlternative idea: for each voucher i, during the check for case 1 and case 2, if the minimal cost comes from a voucher j that is the same as i, we need to ignore it. But how to know that?\n\nBut that would complicate things. For example, during the case 1 processing, when we find the minimal cost in the prefix, how can we know whether that minimal cost is from voucher i or not?\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose voucher i is of duration d, and t = d. So x = 2d. Suppose that voucher i is the only voucher with duration d. Then, during the processing of voucher i, we would check for other vouchers of duration d. But there are none, so nothing is found. So no problem.\n\nBut if there are multiple vouchers of duration d. Suppose voucher i is one of them. When we process voucher i, and during case 1, we find that there's a voucher j (could be i) that ends before li. But since j must be different from i, we need to check if j is not i.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nOne way is to, when building the data structures, for each duration, we have the list of vouchers. Then, during the processing of voucher i, when we find a possible candidate j, we need to check if j is not i.\n\nBut how to do that when using the min arrays?\n\nFor example, in case 1, when we find the minimal cost in the prefix, but that minimal cost could be from voucher i itself. How to know?\n\nThis seems difficult. Because the prefix_min array gives the minimal cost up to that index, but we don't know which voucher that corresponds to. So, perhaps the approach of using the minimal cost for all vouchers of duration t (excluding voucher i if necessary) is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers j of duration t, we can ignore voucher i. But how?\n\nWell, for example, if the current voucher i has duration d and t = x -d. So during the check for vouchers of duration t, if t == d, then we need to make sure that j is not i. However, if t != d, then j can't be i, since i has duration d and j has duration t, and t != d.\n\nSo the problem arises only when t == d, which implies that x = 2d. In that case, when looking for j, we have to make sure that j is not i.\n\nSo, during the case when t == d, we need to check if the voucher i is in the list of vouchers of duration t, and if so, ensure that when we find the minimal cost, it's not from voucher i.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative idea: for each voucher i, during the processing of case 1 and case 2, if the target duration is t, and t == d, then when we find the minimal cost in the duration t's data structures, we have to check if that minimal cost is achievable without using voucher i.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for the case when t == d, we can check if there are at least two vouchers in duration t. If there are, then we can proceed. Otherwise, not. But that's not sufficient. Because even if there are multiple vouchers, the minimal cost could be from voucher i itself, but there's another voucher with same cost. So we need to check if there's another voucher that is not i.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of voucher i, when t == d, we can subtract voucher i from the data structures for duration t. Then perform the query. But that would be computationally expensive.\n\nAnother approach: during the case when t == d, when we query the minimal cost for case 1 and case 2, we can check if the minimal cost is achieved by voucher i. If yes, then we need to see if there's another voucher with the same minimal cost (or a higher one) that is not i.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps, in practice, for the problem, the number of vouchers with duration t == d is large enough that even if voucher i is part of the data, there's another voucher with the same minimal cost. However, this is not guaranteed.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps we can proceed with the initial approach, and then in the end, check if the found pair is valid (i.e., not the same voucher). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered twice. But according to the problem statement, i and j must be different. So, if the same voucher is considered, that's invalid.\n\nSo, to avoid this, during the processing of voucher i, when t == d, we need to ensure that the j is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe during the case when t == d, we can check if there are other vouchers in the duration t that satisfy the condition (non-overlapping with i). For example, in case 1, after finding the minimal cost in the prefix, check if that minimal cost is from voucher i. If not, then it's okay. If it is, then check if there are other vouchers in that prefix that have the same cost or lower.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have the list of vouchers, and for each voucher, when we query, we can check if the voucher is the same as i.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, in case 1, when we find the minimal cost in the prefix, which is the minimal of all vouchers up to that index. But how to know if that minimal is from voucher i?\n\nThis seems impossible unless we track the indices. So perhaps, for each duration, when we sort the vouchers, we also track their original indices. Then, during the processing of voucher i, when checking for case 1, after finding the minimal cost, we can check if there exists a voucher in that subset that is not i.\n\nBut this requires more complex data structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the case when t == d, we can check whether there exists at least two vouchers in the duration t that meet the non-overlapping condition. For example, if the voucher i is the only one in the duration t that meets the condition, then it's invalid. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nThis seems very complicated. Maybe for the purposes of passing the test cases, we can proceed with the initial approach, and then in the end, if the minimal sum is found, check if there's a valid pair. However, this might not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered twice, but in reality, the code would not select it. Because, for example, if the voucher i is in the list of vouchers of duration t, and during case 1, the code finds that voucher i ends before li. But since voucher i's end time is ri, and li is the start time of voucher i. So ri >= li. So ri < li would require ri < li, which is impossible. Therefore, voucher i can't be part of case 1.\n\nWait, case 1 is when voucher j ends before li. So for voucher j to be i, we need ri < li. But ri >= li (since li <= ri). So ri < li is only possible if li > ri, which is impossible. Therefore, voucher i cannot be part of case 1. Because for voucher i, ri >= li. So in case 1, when we are looking for vouchers j that end before li, the voucher i's end time is ri >= li. So ri can't be less than li. Therefore, voucher i cannot be part of case 1.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: looking for vouchers j that start after ri. So lj > ri. For voucher i, lj is li. So if li > ri, then voucher i would be considered. But since li <= ri (as per the voucher definition), li can't be greater than ri. Therefore, voucher i cannot be part of case 2 either.\n\nAh! This is a crucial observation. Because for voucher i, li <= ri. So when we are looking for vouchers j that end before li (case 1), voucher i's end time is ri >= li, so it can't be included. Similarly, for case 2, voucher j needs to have lj > ri. But voucher i's lj is li <= ri. So voucher i can't be in case 2 either.\n\nTherefore, when processing voucher i, the vouchers j considered in case 1 and case 2 are different from i. Hence, there's no possibility of selecting the same voucher twice. Thus, the initial approach is safe.\n\nThat's a relief! So we don't have to worry about overlapping vouchers with the same voucher. Because during case 1 and case 2, the voucher i can't be part of the j candidates. Therefore, the code can proceed as planned.\n\nSo now, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, coding steps.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, for each voucher, read li, ri, costi. Compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup all vouchers by their duration. For each duration, we need to store:\n\n- end_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by r. Then, end_times and prefix_min_end.\n\n- start_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by l. Then, start_times and suffix_min_start.\n\nSo, in Python, for each duration d, we can have:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_data = defaultdict( lambda: {'end': [], 'start': []} )\n\nBut perhaps better to pre-process each duration.\n\nOnce all vouchers are read, for each duration d in duration_data, process the vouchers:\n\nFor example:\n\nfor d in duration_data:\n\n   vouchers = list of all vouchers with duration d.\n\n   sort them by r, then create end_times and prefix_min_end.\n\n   sort them by l, then create start_times and suffix_min_start.\n\nBut how to store this? Perhaps, for each duration d, we can have:\n\nend_times: sorted list of r's.\n\nprefix_min_end: list of minimum cost up to each index.\n\nSimilarly for start_times and suffix_min_start.\n\nSo, in code, perhaps:\n\nWe can create a dictionary called duration_info, where for each duration d, we have:\n\n{\n    'end': (end_times, prefix_min_end),\n    'start': (start_times, suffix_min_start)\n}\n\nBut how to build this.\n\nLet me think.\n\nOnce all vouchers are read, for each duration d in the duration_dict:\n\n   collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\n   sort them by r, then create end_times as [v.r for v in sorted_vouchers], and compute prefix_min_end.\n\n   sort them by l, then create start_times as [v.l for v in sorted_vouchers], and compute suffix_min_start.\n\nNow, for each voucher, during processing, when we need to check for case 1 and case 2, we can use these data structures.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can represent each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost). Or perhaps, during the initial processing, we can store all vouchers in a list.\n\nBut for the duration_info, perhaps we can process it as follows.\n\nOnce all vouchers are read, for each duration d:\n\n   vouchers_with_d = [ (li, ri, cost) for ... ]\n\n   sorted_by_r = sorted(vouchers_with_d, key=lambda x: x[1])  # sort by ri (r)\n\n   end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_r]\n\n   costs_end = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_r]\n\n   prefix_min_end = [0]*len(costs_end)\n\n   prefix_min_end[0] = costs_end[0]\n\n   for i in range(1, len(costs_end)):\n\n       prefix_min_end[i] = min( prefix_min_end[i-1], costs_end[i] )\n\n   sorted_by_l = sorted(vouchers_with_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n   start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_l]\n\n   costs_start = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_l]\n\n   suffix_min_start = [0]*len(costs_start)\n\n   suffix_min_start[-1] = costs_start[-1]\n\n   for i in range(len(costs_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n       suffix_min_start[i] = min( costs_start[i], suffix_min_start[i+1] )\n\n   duration_info[d] = {\n\n       'end': (end_times, prefix_min_end),\n\n       'start': (start_times, suffix_min_start)\n\n   }\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher in the original list, we process it as follows:\n\nfor li, ri, cost in all_vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    t = x - d\n\n    if t not in duration_info:\n\n        continue\n\n    # case 1: find vouchers of duration t that end before li\n\n    # get end_times and prefix_min_end for t\n\n    end_times, prefix_min = duration_info[t]['end']\n\n    # find the largest r <= li -1\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li -1) -1\n\n    min_cost_case1 = infinity\n\n    if idx >=0:\n\n        min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[idx]\n\n    # case 2: find vouchers of duration t that start after ri\n\n    start_times, suffix_min = duration_info[t]['start']\n\n    # find first l > ri\n\n    pos = bisect.bisect_right(start_times, ri)\n\n    min_cost_case2 = infinity\n\n    if pos < len(start_times):\n\n        min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[pos]\n\n    # total possible min is min(min_cost_case1, min_cost_case2)\n\n    current_min = min( min_cost_case1, min_cost_case2 )\n\n    if current_min is not infinity:\n\n        total = current_min + cost\n\n        update the global answer with this total.\n\nSo, the global answer is initialized as infinity. After processing all vouchers, if the global answer is still infinity, output -1, else output the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple vouchers of duration t that can be paired with the current voucher? We need to find the minimal sum.\n\nBut this approach covers that.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, how to handle this?\n\nImplementing the above steps.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo x is 5.\n\nLooking for pairs of durations adding up to 5. So possible pairs are (3,2), (2,3), etc.\n\nFor the first voucher (duration 3), t is 5-3=2. So check for vouchers of duration 2.\n\nCase 1: vouchers of duration 2 that end before li=1. The end times of duration 2 vouchers are:\n\nLooking at the vouchers of duration 2: the second, third, fourth vouchers. Their ri are 2, 6, 2. So when sorted by end time (r), the end_times would be [2, 2, 6]. For case 1, li is 1. So li-1 =0. So bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0, idx=-1. So no case 1.\n\nCase 2: vouchers of duration 2 that start after ri=3. The start times of duration 2 vouchers are sorted by l. The vouchers are:\n\nsecond voucher: l=1, third voucher: l=5, fourth voucher: l=1. So sorted by l: [1,1,5]. So start_times is [1,1,5]. ri is 3. bisect_right([1,1,5], 3) returns 2. So pos=2. Check if pos < len(start_times) (3). Yes. suffix_min_start[2] is the min of the suffix from index 2, which is 1 (third voucher's cost). So case 2 gives 1. So total cost is 4 + 1 =5. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother voucher: third voucher has duration 2 (ri=6, li=5). So d=2. t=5-2=3. Check for vouchers of duration 3. There's only the first voucher. So case 1: end before li=5. The first voucher's end time is 3. So li is 5, so end time <=5-1=4. 3 is <=4. So case 1 would find that voucher. The cost is 4. So case1 is 4. case2: find vouchers of duration 3 that start after ri=6. The start time of first voucher is 1. So start_times for duration 3 is [1], and bisect_right([1], 6) is 1, which is beyond the length. So case2 is no. So total is 4 + 1 =5 (current voucher's cost is 1, so 1+4=5). Which is same as before.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to handle the voucher data.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, storing li, ri, cost.\n\nThen, group the vouchers by their duration.\n\nThen, for each duration, process the end and start sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nThen, for each voucher, process as described.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut for large n (up to 2e5), the code must be efficient.\n\nBut for each duration, the sorting is O(k log k), where k is the number of vouchers with that duration. Overall, this is O(n log n) time.\n\nThe rest is O(n log n) for each voucher's processing.\n\nSo overall, the code should be efficient.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut first, note that for the duration_info, we need to process each duration once.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\n# group by duration\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n    d = ri - li + 1\n    duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\n# preprocess duration_info\nduration_info = dict()  # key: duration, value: {'end': (end_times, prefix_min), 'start': (start_times, suffix_min)}\nfor d in duration_dict:\n    # process end_sorted\n    vouchers_d = duration_dict[d]\n    # sort by end time (ri)\n    sorted_by_r = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_r]\n    costs_end = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_r]\n    prefix_min_end = []\n    prefix_min_end.append( costs_end[0] )\n    for i in range(1, len(costs_end)):\n        prefix_min_end.append( min( prefix_min_end[-1], costs_end[i] ) )\n    # process start_sorted\n    sorted_by_l = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_l]\n    costs_start = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_l]\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(costs_start)\n    suffix_min_start[-1] = costs_start[-1]\n    for i in range(len(costs_start)-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_min_start[i] = min( costs_start[i], suffix_min_start[i+1] )\n    # store in duration_info\n    duration_info[d] = {\n        'end': (end_times, prefix_min_end),\n        'start': (start_times, suffix_min_start)\n    }\n\n# Now, iterate over each voucher and check\nmin_total = float('inf')\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n    d = ri - li + 1\n    t = x - d\n    if t not in duration_info:\n        continue\n    # case 1: find vouchers of duration t that end before li\n    end_times, prefix_min = duration_info[t]['end']\n    # find the largest r <= li-1\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li-1) -1\n    case1 = float('inf')\n    if idx >=0:\n        case1 = prefix",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers from a list such that their combined duration equals exactly x days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers that can sum up to the required duration x.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers into two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end date (ri) with a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - Another sorted by the start date (li) with a suffix minimum cost array.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, calculate its duration and check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration (x - duration). Use binary search on the preprocessed data to efficiently find the minimum cost of valid non-overlapping vouchers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Group vouchers by their duration\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess duration_info\n    duration_info = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_d = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process end_sorted\n        sorted_by_r = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_r]\n        costs_end = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_r]\n        prefix_min_end = []\n        if costs_end:\n            prefix_min_end.append(costs_end[0])\n            for i in range(1, len(costs_end)):\n                prefix_min_end.append(min(prefix_min_end[-1], costs_end[i]))\n        # Process start_sorted\n        sorted_by_l = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_l]\n        costs_start = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_l]\n        suffix_min_start = [0] * len(costs_start)\n        if costs_start:\n            suffix_min_start[-1] = costs_start[-1]\n            for i in range(len(costs_start)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min_start[i] = min(costs_start[i], suffix_min_start[i+1])\n        # Store in duration_info\n        duration_info[d] = {\n            'end': (end_times, prefix_min_end),\n            'start': (start_times, suffix_min_start)\n        }\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        t = x - d\n        if t not in duration_info:\n            continue\n        # Case 1: vouchers of duration t ending before li\n        end_times, prefix_min = duration_info[t]['end']\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li - 1) - 1\n        case1 = float('inf')\n        if idx >= 0:\n            case1 = prefix_min[idx]\n        # Case 2: vouchers of duration t starting after ri\n        start_times, suffix_min = duration_info[t]['start']\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(start_times, ri)\n        case2 = float('inf')\n        if pos < len(start_times):\n            case2 = suffix_min[pos]\n        current_min = min(case1, case2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            min_total = min(min_total, current_min + cost)\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate efficient lookups.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end and start times.
