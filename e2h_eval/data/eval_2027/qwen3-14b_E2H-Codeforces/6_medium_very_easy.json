Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about finding two non-overlapping vouchers whose total duration equals exactly x days, and their combined cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, return -1.\n\nSo the input is n vouchers, each with li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration of a voucher is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j (i≠j) such that their durations sum to x, and they don't overlap. And find the minimum total cost.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently. Since n can be up to 2e5, O(n²) approaches are definitely out of the question. So we need something smarter.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For two vouchers to not overlap, one must end before the other starts. So for voucher A and voucher B, either A ends before B starts (ri < lj) or B ends before A starts (rj < li).\n\nThe key here is that for each voucher, we need to find another voucher that has a duration of (x - duration of current voucher), and that doesn't overlap with it. And then track the minimal cost.\n\nSo here's an idea: for each voucher, compute its duration. Let's say the duration is d. Then, we need another voucher with duration (x - d). But since the two vouchers must not overlap, we need to find for each voucher with duration d, the minimal cost of a voucher with duration (x-d) that starts after the first one ends, or starts before the first one starts.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find those?\n\nLet me think about pre-processing. For each possible duration, we can keep track of the minimal cost vouchers that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day.\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher, we can check if there exists a voucher with duration (x - d) that ends before li, or starts after ri. Then, for each voucher, we can look for the minimal cost in these two cases.\n\nBut how do we quickly find the minimal cost for vouchers of a certain duration that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day?\n\nLet me break it down. Suppose we have a voucher A with duration d. Then, we need vouchers B with duration (x - d), and B does not overlap with A.\n\nSo for voucher A, the possible B's are:\n\nCase 1: B ends before A starts. So B's ri < A's li.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A ends. So B's li > A's ri.\n\nSo for each voucher A, we need to find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration (x - d) that satisfy either case 1 or case 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess for each possible duration, the list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time (for case 1) and sorted by their start time (for case 2). Also, for each duration, we can precompute prefix minima for the end times and suffix minima for the start times.\n\nWait, but for each duration, we can have multiple vouchers. For example, if we have a duration of k, and we want to find the minimal cost voucher with that duration that ends before some day. How can we do that quickly?\n\nLet me think. For each duration k, we can have two structures:\n\n1. A sorted list of all vouchers with duration k, sorted by their ri (end time). Then, for a given day (say, li of voucher A), we can find all vouchers with end time < li, and take the minimum cost among them. To do this efficiently, we can pre-process for each duration k, the sorted list of end times, and also a prefix min array. Then, for any query of \"find the minimal cost voucher with duration k where ri < X\", we can perform a binary search on the sorted end times to find the largest end time less than X, and then get the min cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the case where we need vouchers with duration k that start after a certain day (say, ri of voucher A). For this, we can have a sorted list of start times (li) for vouchers of duration k, and a suffix min array. Then, for a query of \"find the minimal cost voucher with duration k where li > Y\", we can binary search for the first start time greater than Y, and then take the min from that index onwards.\n\nBut how do we handle this for all possible durations?\n\nFirst, we can create a dictionary, say, for each duration d, we have:\n\n- A list of vouchers with that duration. Each voucher has li, ri, cost.\n\nThen, for each such list, we sort them by their ri (for case 1) and also sort them by their li (for case 2). Then, for each sorted list, we can precompute prefix minima and suffix minima.\n\nFor example, for the case of vouchers with duration d, sorted by ri:\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(cost of first i vouchers in the sorted list)\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted list by li, we can have a suffix_min[i] = min(cost of vouchers from i to end).\n\nSo when processing voucher A with duration d, and looking for a voucher B with duration (x - d):\n\nWe first check if (x - d) is a valid duration (i.e., exists in our dictionary). If not, skip.\n\nThen, for case 1 (B ends before A starts):\n\nWe need to find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration (x - d) where ri < li_A.\n\nTo find that, for the duration (x - d), we can take the sorted list of ri's, and find the largest ri that is less than li_A. Then, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2 (B starts after A ends):\n\nWe need vouchers with duration (x - d) where li > ri_A.\n\nIn this case, we take the sorted list of li's for duration (x - d), find the first li that is greater than ri_A, and then take the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary grouped by their duration.\n\n   For each duration d, store:\n\n   - list of vouchers sorted by ri (for case 1)\n   - prefix min array for that list\n   - list of vouchers sorted by li (for case 2)\n   - suffix min array for that list\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, for each voucher, compute its duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\nWe can create a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where the key is d, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. For each such list, we can sort them by ri and create a prefix min array, and also sort them by li and create a suffix min array.\n\nWait, but for the same duration, the vouchers may have different li and ri. So for each duration d, we need two separate sorted lists:\n\nsorted_by_ri: sorted by ri, then for each position, the prefix min is the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nsorted_by_li: sorted by li, then for each position, the suffix min is the minimum cost from that position onwards.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher A, we can:\n\nCompute d = duration of A.\n\ntarget_duration = x - d.\n\nIf target_duration is not present in the duration_dict, skip.\n\nElse, for the target_duration, check both cases:\n\nCase 1: find vouchers with target_duration that end before A's li.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers with target_duration that start after A's ri.\n\nFor each case, if found, get the minimal cost, and combine with A's cost to see if it's the overall minimum.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we need to check both cases, and collect the possible candidates.\n\nNow, the problem is how to perform the binary search steps.\n\nFor case 1:\n\nsorted_by_ri is a list of vouchers sorted by ri. So, for each such voucher, their ri is in increasing order. We need to find the largest ri that is less than li_A. Then, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2:\n\nsorted_by_li is a list of vouchers sorted by li. We need to find the first li that is greater than ri_A. All vouchers from that index onwards have li > ri_A. The suffix min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSo, for each of these steps, we can perform a binary search.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in case 1:\n\nsorted_ri_list = list of (ri, cost) for target_duration, sorted by ri.\n\nWe can extract the list of ri's as a separate array, say, ri_values, and then perform a binary search for the maximum value less than li_A.\n\nOnce we find the index, we can get the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nBut how to handle the prefix_min? For example, the prefix_min array for the sorted_by_ri list is built as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = cost of first voucher in the list.\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], cost of ith voucher).\n\nSo, for the sorted_ri list, the prefix_min array allows us to get the minimum cost for all vouchers up to a certain index.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration d, we have:\n\nsorted_by_ri = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nthen, for this list, we can create a prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_li is sorted by li, and suffix_min array is created.\n\nNow, for case 1, for a given li_A:\n\nWe can perform a binary search on the ri_values of the sorted_by_ri list to find the largest ri that is less than li_A. Let's say the index is idx. Then, if idx >=0, the minimal cost is prefix_min[idx]. If there are no such elements (idx is -1), then this case is not possible.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, for a given ri_A:\n\nWe can perform a binary search on the li_values of the sorted_by_li list to find the first li that is greater than ri_A. Let's say the index is idx. Then, if idx < len(list), the minimal cost is suffix_min[idx]. Else, no such element.\n\nNow, the question is how to perform these binary searches.\n\nFor case 1, the binary search is for the maximum value in ri_values that is less than li_A.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can help. For example, using bisect_left to find the insertion point. Then, the index is insertion_point -1.\n\nFor example:\n\nimport bisect\n\nri_values = [ ... ] # sorted in ascending order\n\ninsertion_point = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, li_A)\n\nif insertion_point == 0:\n\n    no elements < li_A\n\nelse:\n\n    idx = insertion_point - 1\n\n    min_cost = prefix_min[idx]\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, we want the first li in the sorted_by_li list that is > ri_A.\n\nThe sorted_by_li list is sorted in ascending order. So, we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point for ri_A. Then, all elements from that insertion point onwards are > ri_A.\n\nFor example:\n\nli_values = [ ... ] # sorted in ascending order\n\ninsertion_point = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, ri_A)\n\nif insertion_point < len(li_values):\n\n    min_cost = suffix_min[insertion_point]\n\nelse:\n\n    no such element.\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, the next step is to code this.\n\nBut first, let's think about edge cases.\n\nFor example, when x is 2, and each voucher has duration 3, then it's impossible. Like the second example in the problem.\n\nAnother case: when two vouchers have durations adding up to x, but they overlap. So, we need to make sure that the two vouchers are non-overlapping.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read n vouchers, compute their duration.\n\nGroup them into duration_dict, which maps duration to a list of vouchers.\n\nFor each duration d in duration_dict, process the list of vouchers:\n\nSort them by ri, and compute prefix_min array.\n\nSort them by li, and compute suffix_min array.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list:\n\nCompute its duration d. Check if x -d is present in the duration_dict.\n\nIf not, continue.\n\nElse, process both cases.\n\nFor case 1: find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration (x -d) that end before li of current voucher.\n\nFor case 2: find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration (x -d) that start after ri of current voucher.\n\nFor each case, if found, add the current voucher's cost to the found minimal cost, and track the global minimum.\n\nBut wait, we have to ensure that the two vouchers are different. For example, if a voucher is in the target_duration group, but it's the same voucher as the current one. But since we need two different vouchers, how to handle that?\n\nAh, right! Because in the problem statement, the two vouchers must be different. So, when checking for case 1 and case 2, we need to make sure that the voucher we find in the target_duration is not the same as the current voucher.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Because for example, suppose there is a voucher A with duration d, and another voucher B with duration (x -d), and B is the same as A. But since the problem requires two different vouchers, we can't choose the same voucher twice.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the vouchers are given as a list, and i and j must be different. So, for example, if there is a voucher with duration d, and x -d is equal to d (so x = 2d), then we need to have at least two vouchers with duration d, which are non-overlapping.\n\nSo, during the processing, when we are looking for the target_duration, which is (x -d), and the current voucher is part of that target_duration, we need to make sure that the voucher found in the target_duration is not the same as the current voucher.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nThis seems tricky. Because, for example, when processing voucher A, which is part of duration d, and target_duration is (x -d) = d. So, we need to find another voucher in the same duration group that is non-overlapping with A.\n\nSo, during the case processing, when we look for vouchers in the target_duration, we need to exclude the current voucher.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, perhaps during the case 1 and case 2 checks, when we find the minimal cost, we need to check if that voucher is the same as the current one. But since the minimal cost could be from multiple vouchers, how can we ensure that there is at least one other voucher?\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we handle this?\n\nAlternative approach: for each voucher, when considering the target_duration, we can check if the target_duration is equal to d. If so, then when looking for the other voucher, we need to make sure that it's not the same voucher. However, even if there are multiple vouchers in the same duration, we can have at least one that is non-overlapping.\n\nBut how to handle that during the binary search steps?\n\nFor example, when we find the minimal cost in the target_duration group, which includes the current voucher, we need to check whether that minimal cost comes from a different voucher.\n\nBut how can we know that?\n\nThis seems challenging. One possible way is to pre-process for each duration, the sorted lists, and during the binary search steps, when the current voucher is part of the target_duration group, we need to exclude it.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of each voucher, when the target_duration is equal to d, then when looking for the minimal cost in case 1 and case 2, we need to ensure that the voucher found is not the same as the current voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the current voucher is A, and the target_duration is d. So, we need to find another voucher B in the same duration group (d) that does not overlap with A.\n\nIn this case, during the case 1 processing (B ends before A starts), the sorted_by_ri list for duration d contains all vouchers with duration d. When we find the minimal cost in that list, we need to make sure that the voucher is not A.\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nThis seems complicated. For example, the minimal cost could be from voucher A itself. But since we need two different vouchers, we need to find another voucher in that group.\n\nSo, during the processing of the current voucher, when the target_duration is d, we need to find the minimal cost in the target group, but excluding the current voucher.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nOne approach is to, for each voucher, when processing case 1 and case 2, check if the target_duration is same as current voucher's duration. If yes, then during the binary search steps, we need to find the minimal cost in the group, but not including the current voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me think. Suppose that for the target_duration, which is same as current voucher's duration (d), we have a sorted_by_ri list. When we perform the binary search to find the minimal cost in case 1 (B ends before A starts), we can find the minimal cost, but if that minimal cost is achieved by the current voucher, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the group that meet the condition.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can store the sorted lists, and during the binary search, when the current voucher is part of the target group, we can adjust the search to exclude it.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems quite involved. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternative idea: during the initial grouping, for each duration, we can have all vouchers. Then, when processing a voucher A, when looking for vouchers in the target_duration group, we can check if the target_duration is same as A's duration. If yes, then during the case 1 and case 2 processing, we need to find the minimal cost in the group excluding A. Otherwise, the group is okay.\n\nBut how to efficiently find that?\n\nFor example, in case 1, when the target_duration is same as A's duration, we need to find the minimal cost in the group of vouchers with duration d (same as A's) that end before A's li, and are not A.\n\nSo, during the binary search steps, perhaps we can find the minimal cost, and then check if that minimal cost is from a voucher that is not A. But how?\n\nThis seems difficult. Because the prefix_min array may include the current voucher. So, for example, if the current voucher is the only one that ends before A's li, then we can't use it. But if there are others, then maybe we can.\n\nBut how to track this?\n\nThis seems very complicated. Perhaps there's a way around.\n\nLet me think: what if we allow the same voucher to be considered, but then during the final check, we ensure that the two vouchers are different.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, during the processing, when we find a candidate pair (A and B), we need to ensure that they are different vouchers.\n\nBut in the case where the target_duration is same as A's duration, and B is A, then that's invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps during the processing, when we find the minimal cost in the target group (which may include A), we need to check if there exists another voucher in that group that meets the criteria.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, during the case processing, when the target_duration is same as A's duration, we can check whether the current voucher is in the group that satisfies the condition (case 1 or case 2). If yes, then we can subtract it from the group, and find the next minimal.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be handled by allowing the same voucher to be considered, but then during the final answer selection, we check that the two vouchers are different.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, during the case processing, when we find a minimal cost for B, we can check if B is different from A. But how to know that?\n\nThis seems like a problem because during the binary search steps, we can't know which voucher in the group gives the minimal cost. Unless we have more information.\n\nHmm. This seems like a significant hurdle. How can we handle this?\n\nAlternative idea: for each voucher, when considering the case where the target_duration is same as its own duration, we can check if there exists another voucher in the group that meets the condition (non-overlapping). For example, in case 1, we can find the minimal cost of vouchers in the group with duration d, ending before A's li, and not being A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nPerhaps during the binary search, we can find the minimal cost, and then check if that minimal cost is achieved by a voucher that is not A.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nThis seems difficult. However, perhaps the number of vouchers with the same duration and same ri and li is small. So, maybe in practice, even if the minimal cost includes the current voucher, there might be another voucher with the same cost. Or perhaps we can find the minimal cost excluding the current voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach: during the preprocessing, for each duration d, we can have the sorted_by_ri list, and for each voucher in that list, we can have their cost. Then, during the case processing, when we find the minimal cost in the sorted list (prefix_min), we can check if the minimal cost is achievable by a voucher that is not the current one.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose during case 1 processing, the current voucher is A. We are looking for vouchers in the target_duration (same as A's duration) that end before A's li. The prefix_min gives the minimal cost. Now, if the minimal cost is achieved by voucher A, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the group that end before A's li. If there are, then we can take the next minimal cost. Otherwise, this case is not valid.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps this is not feasible for a coding competition problem. So maybe there's a way to avoid this problem.\n\nWait, what if we allow the same voucher to be considered, but then during the final check, we ensure that the two vouchers are different. But how?\n\nFor example, when processing voucher A, and during the case 1 processing, we find a voucher B (could be A itself) that meets the conditions. Then, when combining the costs, we need to check if B is not A.\n\nBut how can we know that B is not A?\n\nWell, during the binary search steps, we can't directly know. Because the prefix_min array just gives the minimal cost. It doesn't tell us which voucher(s) achieve that cost.\n\nSo this seems impossible unless we have more information.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be used twice. But according to the problem statement, the two vouchers must be different. So, we have to ensure that.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have multiple copies of the vouchers. Then, during the processing, when considering the case where the target_duration is same as current voucher's duration, we can check whether the current voucher is part of the group and exclude it.\n\nBut again, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that even if the same voucher is considered, but there's another voucher with the same cost, then the code would still work. However, this is not guaranteed.\n\nBut given that the problem is from a programming competition, perhaps the test cases are designed such that the same voucher is not used twice. Or perhaps the code can proceed without considering this, and then in the final answer, if there's a case where the same voucher is considered, it will be rejected.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the case processing, when the target_duration is same as current voucher's duration, we can check whether the current voucher meets the condition (case 1 or case 2). For example, in case 1, if the current voucher's ri is < li_A (which is its own li?), no. Wait, case 1 is when B ends before A starts. So, for the current voucher A, B is another voucher. So, if B is the same as A, then B's ri must be < A's li. But since B is A, then ri_A < li_A. Which is only possible if ri < li, which is not possible since li <= ri. So, this is impossible. Therefore, the same voucher cannot be part of case 1 or case 2.\n\nWait, this is a crucial observation!\n\nBecause, for the same voucher A, the case 1 requires that B ends before A starts. But B is A. So, ri_A < li_A. But since li_A <= ri_A (as per the input constraints), this is impossible. Similarly for case 2: B starts after A ends. B is A, so li_A > ri_A. Again, impossible.\n\nTherefore, when the target_duration is same as current voucher's duration, during case 1 and case 2 processing, the current voucher cannot be part of the group that meets the conditions. Therefore, even if the minimal cost is achieved by the current voucher, it's not possible, so the code can safely ignore that possibility.\n\nThis is a key insight. So, during the case processing, when the target_duration is same as current voucher's duration, the current voucher cannot be part of the group that meets the case 1 or case 2 conditions. Therefore, the minimal cost found in the group is from a different voucher. Hence, no need to worry about the same voucher being considered.\n\nThat's brilliant! So, this means that during the case processing, even if the target_duration is same as current voucher's duration, the current voucher can't be part of the group that meets the case 1 or case 2 conditions. Therefore, the code can proceed normally, without worrying about overlapping vouchers.\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. Because now, when processing a voucher A, and looking for vouchers in the target_duration group, the current voucher A is not part of the group that meets the case conditions, hence no need to check for duplicates.\n\nSo, this resolves the earlier problem. Thus, during the case processing, even if the target_duration is same as current voucher's duration, the current voucher is not part of the group that meets the conditions. Hence, the code can proceed as before.\n\nThis is a critical realization. So, the code can proceed without worrying about duplicate vouchers.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nNow, back to the code.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead all the vouchers, compute their durations.\n\nCreate a dictionary mapping duration to list of vouchers.\n\nFor each duration in the dictionary, pre-process:\n\nsorted_by_ri: sorted by ri, and compute prefix_min array.\n\nsorted_by_li: sorted by li, and compute suffix_min array.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d = duration of voucher.\n\n   target_d = x - d.\n\n   if target_d not in the duration_dict, continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      process case 1 and case 2.\n\nFor case 1:\n\n   we need to find vouchers in target_d that end before voucher's li.\n\n   For that, look into the sorted_by_ri list for target_d.\n\n   Perform binary search to find the largest ri < voucher's li.\n\n   if found, get the prefix_min up to that index. Add to current voucher's cost.\n\nFor case 2:\n\n   look into the sorted_by_li list for target_d.\n\n   find the first li > voucher's ri.\n\n   if found, get the suffix_min from that index. Add to current voucher's cost.\n\nKeep track of the global minimum.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nNow, code structure in Python:\n\nBut first, note that for each duration in the duration_dict, we need to have:\n\nsorted_by_ri and prefix_min.\n\nsorted_by_li and suffix_min.\n\nSo, for each duration d in duration_dict:\n\n   list_vouchers = duration_dict[d]\n\n   sorted_by_ri = sorted(list_vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\n   sorted_by_li = sorted(list_vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\n   Then, create prefix_min for sorted_by_ri:\n\n   prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_ri)\n\n   prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_ri[0].cost\n\n   for i in 1 to len(sorted_by_ri)-1:\n\n       prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_ri[i].cost)\n\n   Similarly, for sorted_by_li, create suffix_min:\n\n   suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_li)\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_li[-1].cost\n\n   for i in range(len(sorted_by_li)-2, -1, -1):\n\n       suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_li[i].cost)\n\nBut how to store this? Perhaps for each duration, we can store:\n\n- a list of ri's for sorted_by_ri, and the prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_li and suffix_min.\n\nAlternatively, during preprocessing, for each duration, we can store:\n\nsorted_ri_list: list of (ri, cost) sorted by ri.\n\nprefix_min_ri: list of min costs up to each index.\n\nsorted_li_list: list of (li, cost) sorted by li.\n\nsuffix_min_li: list of min costs from each index onwards.\n\nBut in Python, we can represent vouchers as tuples or objects. Let's think of vouchers as tuples (li, ri, cost).\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor each voucher:\n\n   li, ri, cost = ...\n\n   d = ri - li + 1\n\n   duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration d in duration_dict:\n\n   sorted_by_ri = sorted(duration_dict[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n   sorted_by_li = sorted(duration_dict[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n   create prefix_min_ri:\n\n   prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_ri)\n\n   prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_ri[0][2]\n\n   for i in 1 to len-1:\n\n       prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_ri[i][2])\n\n   similarly for suffix_min_li:\n\n   suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_li)\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_li[-1][2]\n\n   for i in range(len(sorted_by_li)-2, -1, -1):\n\n       suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_li[i][2] )\n\n   then, store for duration d:\n\n   (sorted_by_ri_ri, prefix_min_ri), (sorted_by_li_li, suffix_min_li)\n\nBut perhaps we can store for each duration d, two separate structures:\n\n- a list of ri's (for case 1) and the prefix_min array.\n\n- a list of li's (for case 2) and the suffix_min array.\n\nBut for the binary search steps, we need the actual values of ri and li. So, for case 1, we need the list of ri's from the sorted_by_ri list. So, for example, for duration d, sorted_ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_ri].\n\nSimilarly, sorted_li_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li].\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration d, we can store:\n\n- sorted_ri_values: list of ri's, sorted.\n\n- prefix_min_ri: list of prefix minima.\n\n- sorted_li_values: list of li's, sorted.\n\n- suffix_min_li: list of suffix minima.\n\nOnce that is done, during processing of each voucher:\n\ncurrent_li, current_ri, current_cost = voucher's data.\n\nd = current_ri - current_li + 1\n\ntarget_d = x - d.\n\nif target_d not in duration_dict: continue.\n\nelse:\n\n   process case 1 and case 2.\n\nFor case 1:\n\n   target_duration_data = duration_dict[target_d]\n\n   sorted_ri_values = target_duration_data's sorted_ri_values.\n\n   prefix_min_ri = target_duration_data's prefix_min_ri.\n\n   perform bisect_left on sorted_ri_values for current_li.\n\n   insertion_point = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_ri_values, current_li)\n\n   if insertion_point > 0:\n\n       min_case1 = prefix_min_ri[insertion_point -1]\n\n       total = current_cost + min_case1\n\n       update the global minimum.\n\nFor case 2:\n\n   target_duration_data = duration_dict[target_d]\n\n   sorted_li_values = target_duration_data's sorted_li_values.\n\n   suffix_min_li = target_duration_data's suffix_min_li.\n\n   insertion_point = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_li_values, current_ri)\n\n   if insertion_point < len(sorted_li_values):\n\n       min_case2 = suffix_min_li[insertion_point]\n\n       total = current_cost + min_case2\n\n       update the global minimum.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to store the data for each duration?\n\nWe can create for each duration d, a tuple containing:\n\n(sorted_ri_values, prefix_min_ri), (sorted_li_values, suffix_min_li)\n\nBut during preprocessing, for each duration d, we can compute these.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this:\n\nWe'll need to process each duration in the duration_dict.\n\nSo, in code:\n\npreprocessing:\n\nfrom bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c) )\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\nfor l, r, c in vouchers:\n    d = r - l + 1\n    duration_dict[d].append( (l, r, c) )\n\n# preprocess for each duration\nprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li_values, suffix_min_li)\nfor d in duration_dict:\n    # process sorted by ri\n    sorted_by_ri = sorted( duration_dict[d], key=lambda x: x[1] )\n    sorted_ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n    prefix_min_ri = [0]*len(sorted_by_ri)\n    prefix_min_ri[0] = sorted_by_ri[0][2]\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_by_ri)):\n        prefix_min_ri[i] = min( prefix_min_ri[i-1], sorted_by_ri[i][2] )\n    # process sorted by li\n    sorted_by_li = sorted( duration_dict[d], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n    sorted_li_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li]\n    suffix_min_li = [0]*len(sorted_by_li)\n    suffix_min_li[-1] = sorted_by_li[-1][2]\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_li)-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_min_li[i] = min( suffix_min_li[i+1], sorted_by_li[i][2] )\n    # store in processed\n    processed[d] = (sorted_ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li_values, suffix_min_li)\n\nNow, for each voucher in vouchers:\n\nInitialize min_total = infinity.\n\nfor l, r, c in vouchers:\n    d = r - l + 1\n    target_d = x - d\n    if target_d not in processed:\n        continue\n    # case 1: find vouchers with target_d that end before l\n    # get the data for target_d\n    sorted_ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li_values, suffix_min_li = processed[target_d]\n    # case 1: find in sorted_ri_values\n    insertion_point = bisect_left(sorted_ri_values, l)\n    if insertion_point > 0:\n        min_case1 = prefix_min_ri[insertion_point -1]\n        total = c + min_case1\n        if total < min_total:\n            min_total = total\n    # case 2: find vouchers with target_d that start after r\n    insertion_point = bisect_right(sorted_li_values, r)\n    if insertion_point < len(sorted_li_values):\n        min_case2 = suffix_min_li[insertion_point]\n        total = c + min_case2\n        if total < min_total:\n            min_total = total\n\nAfter processing all vouchers, if min_total is still infinity, output -1, else output min_total.\n\nBut wait, the processed dictionary is built from duration_dict, which is built from the vouchers. However, in the code above, processed is built for each duration d in duration_dict. But during the preprocessing step, the processed dictionary is built with keys as the durations present in duration_dict.\n\nBut when we check if target_d is in processed, it's equivalent to checking if target_d is in duration_dict.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when target_d is zero or negative? Well, since x is at least 2, and each voucher's duration is at least 1 (since li <= ri). So, for x >= 2, target_d can be zero only if d is x. But since d is the duration of a voucher, which is at least 1. So target_d can be zero only if x is 1, but x is at least 2. So no, for the given constraints, target_d can't be negative. Because x is >=2, and d is >=1, so target_d = x -d can be as low as x - (max duration). But max duration can be up to 2e5 (since ri can be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches Leha's vacation duration, `x`, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of vouchers and the vacation duration `x`.\n2. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: Use a dictionary to group vouchers by their duration.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, sort vouchers by their end date (for checking non-overlapping before) and start date (for checking non-overlapping after). Also, compute prefix minimum costs for sorted end dates and suffix minimum costs for sorted start dates.\n4. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, determine if there exists another voucher with the required complementary duration that does not overlap. Use binary search to efficiently find these pairs and calculate the minimum cost.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l, r, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        vouchers.append((l, r, c))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, c in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((l, r, c))\n    \n    processed = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        # Process sorted by ri\n        sorted_by_ri = sorted(duration_dict[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n        prefix_min_ri = [0] * len(sorted_by_ri)\n        prefix_min_ri[0] = sorted_by_ri[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_by_ri)):\n            prefix_min_ri[i] = min(prefix_min_ri[i-1], sorted_by_ri[i][2])\n        \n        # Process sorted by li\n        sorted_by_li = sorted(duration_dict[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_li_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li]\n        suffix_min_li = [0] * len(sorted_by_li)\n        suffix_min_li[-1] = sorted_by_li[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_li)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min_li[i] = min(suffix_min_li[i+1], sorted_by_li[i][2])\n        \n        processed[d] = (sorted_ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li_values, suffix_min_li)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for l, r, c in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        target_d = x - d\n        if target_d not in processed:\n            continue\n        \n        sorted_ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li_values, suffix_min_li = processed[target_d]\n        \n        # Case 1: find vouchers ending before l\n        insertion_point = bisect_left(sorted_ri_values, l)\n        if insertion_point > 0:\n            min_case1 = prefix_min_ri[insertion_point - 1]\n            total = c + min_case1\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n        \n        # Case 2: find vouchers starting after r\n        insertion_point = bisect_right(sorted_li_values, r)\n        if insertion_point < len(sorted_li_values):\n            min_case2 = suffix_min_li[insertion_point]\n            total = c + min_case2\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and stored in a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end and start dates.
