The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. And each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, we take the perimeter of that rectangle. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width w and height h is 2*(w + h - 2). Because each side contributes (w) and (h), but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Wait, for example, a rectangle of 3x3. The perimeter cells would be 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Or maybe more straightforwardly: the perimeter is 2*(width + height) - 4, because each side has length, but the four corners are counted once each. Wait, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(m + n) - 4. Because each of the four sides contributes m or n cells, but subtracting the four corners which are counted twice. So for example, 3x3: 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which matches the first example input where output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), but only if that rectangle exists. But wait, how do we know when to stop? Because for each i, the rectangle must have at least 3 rows and columns? Or maybe the problem ensures that k is chosen such that all rings are possible. Because the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me check. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense, because for a 3x3, the first ring is possible, but the next would require 3-4*(2-1) = 3-4= -1, which is invalid. So the input constraints ensure that for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring are valid. So we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum them all.\n\nWait, but how to calculate the perimeter for each ring? Let's think. For the i-th ring, the rectangle has width w_i = w - 4*(i-1) and height h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then the perimeter is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Because as discussed earlier. So for each i from 1 to k, compute that and add to the total.\n\nSo the formula for each ring is 2*( (w_i + h_i) - 2 ), which simplifies to 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Let me check with the first example:\n\nSample input 3 3 1. So i=1, w_i = 3, h_i=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is 7 9 2. Let's see. For i=1: w_i=7, h_i=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. For i=2: w_i=7 -4*(1) =3, h_i=9-4*(1)=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the third sample output. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize total =0\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   add perimeter to total\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. Because the maximum allowed k is floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see: for example, if min(w,h) is 5. Then (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, the current_w and current_h are w-0 and h-0, which are >=3. For i=2, it would be w-4*(1) = w-4. If min(w, h) is 5, then say w=5, then current_w would be 5-4=1, which is less than 3. But the input constraints ensure that k is such that for all i up to k, the current_w and current_h are valid. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h -2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's check the second sample input. Input is 7 9 1. So the perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the sample output. So yes.\n\nAnother example: the third sample input is 7 9 2. Which gives 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, we can read the input as three integers. Then loop from 1 to k inclusive. For each iteration, compute current_w and current_h, then calculate the perimeter and add to total.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead input line as w, h, k.\n\nThen:\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst input: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSecond input: 7 9 1 → 28. Correct.\n\nThird input: 7 9 2 → 28 + 12 =40. Correct.\n\nEdge cases: What if k is 0? Well, according to input constraints, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. If k=2, then current_w =5-4=1, which is invalid. But according to the input constraints, k is floor( (min(5,5)+1)/4 ) = (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother example: w=7, h=7, k=2. Then for i=1: current_w=7, current_h=7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2)=2*12=24. For i=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=7-4=3 → perimeter 2*(3+3-2)= 8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nYes. So code works.\n\nSo the code is simple. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nRead input line as three integers. Split the input line into w, h, k. Then compute as above.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code. Let me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: '3 3 1' → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: '7 9 1' → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: '7 9 2' → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12=40. Correct.\n\nLooks good. So this should be the solution.\n",
