The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, we take the perimeter of that rectangle. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width w and height h is 2*(w + h - 2). Because each side contributes (w) and (h), but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Wait, for example, a rectangle of 3x3. The perimeter would be 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. The perimeter in terms of cells: for a rectangle of width w and height h, the number of cells in the perimeter (the outer ring) is 2*w + 2*(h-2). Because the top and bottom rows have w cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the top and bottom) have (h-2) each. So total is 2w + 2(h-2) = 2(w + h -2). Alternatively, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter is 2*(m + n) - 4. Because each side has m or n cells, but subtracting 4 for the four corners that are counted twice. So yeah, 2*(m + n - 2).\n\nSo for each ring i, the rectangle is of size (w' × h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). Then the perimeter for that ring is 2*(w' + h' - 2). But wait, the problem says that each ring is the bordering cells of that inner rectangle. So for each i-th ring, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle. But then, we need to sum this for all i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each ring, the rectangle must be at least 3x3? Because otherwise, you can't have a perimeter. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. Because the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me check. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so floor is 1. So k can be 1. For a 3x3, the first ring is perimeter of 3x3. Then for the next ring, the rectangle would be 3-4*(2-1) = 3-4= -1, which is invalid. So the input ensures that for the given k, each i-th ring is possible.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), then sum all these perimeters.\n\nWait, but let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. The perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input:7 9 1. The perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output of 28.\n\nThird example:7 9 2. So first ring is perimeter of 7x9: 2*(7+9-2)=28. Second ring: i=2, so subtract 4*(2-1)=4. So new dimensions are 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. Sum 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct. So the plan is:\n\nLoop for each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nsum all perimeters.\n\nSo the code would read w, h, k, then compute the sum.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So for the given input, the parameters are valid. So we don't need to check for that.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    sum += perimeter\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, but let me test another case. Let's say for i=2, the current_w and current_h must be at least 3? For example, if the original w and h are 7 and 9, then for i=2, current_w is 7-4=3, current_h is 9-4=5. Which is okay. So the perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 12. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: Let's say w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7, perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. Perimeter 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Total sum 24+8=32.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward. Now, let's code that.\n\nIn Python, read the input as three integers. Then loop from 1 to k, inclusive. For each i, compute current_w and current_h, then add 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) to the total.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. Split into integers.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    total += 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. Let me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Correct.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2)= 16. Which is correct. If k=2, then current_w = 5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. But that would be 2*(1+1-2) = 0. But according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For w=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead input from stdin. The input is a single line with three integers. So:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the sum as explained.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n    total += 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code. Let me check the sample inputs again.\n\nFor example, the third sample input is 7 9 2. Let's compute:\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=9 → 2*(7+9-2)=2*14=28.\n\ni=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5 → 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nYes. Looks good. So this should be the solution.\n",
