Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from the first two strings (guest and host), they should exactly match the letters in the third string (the pile). And the order doesn't matter because it's a permutation.\n\nSo, the approach here is to check if the combined letters of the first two strings, when counted, match exactly with the count of letters in the third string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nHmm. So, for each test case, we have three lines. Let me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines. Let's call them guest, host, pile.\n2. Combine guest and host into a single string.\n3. Check if the combined string's character counts are exactly the same as the pile's character counts.\n\nBut how to check that? Well, one way is to concatenate the guest and host, then sort the characters, and compare it to the sorted pile. Because if the counts are the same, then when sorted, the two strings should be equal.\n\nYes, that's a straightforward method. Let me think about possible issues. For example, if the lengths are different. Oh right, first check if the total length of guest + host is equal to the length of the pile. If not, immediately return 'NO'. Otherwise, proceed to compare sorted strings.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Combine guest and host into combined = guest + host.\n- If len(combined) != len(pile), output 'NO'.\n- Else, check if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile). If yes, output 'YES', else 'NO'.\n\nThat seems simple enough. Let me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count the letters. Let me see. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check the lengths.\n\nWait, the combined length is len(\"SANTACLAUS\") + len(\"DEDMOROZ\") = 10 + 8 = 18? Let me check:\n\nSANTACLAUS is S A N T A C L A U S → that's 10 letters. DEDMOROZ is D E D M O R O Z → 8 letters. Total 18. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me count the letters. Let me see, maybe the length is 18. So sorted combined and sorted pile should be same. So the first example outputs YES.\n\nSecond example:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL\nHost: JOULUPUKKI\nPile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\". Let's check the length. Guest is 9 letters, host is 10 letters. Total 19. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count letters. Let me see, the pile's length is len(\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\") — let's count:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → let me count each letter. But maybe the code will handle that. But according to the note, the pile is missing a P and has an extra L. So when sorted, the combined string would have a certain count, and the pile would have different counts. So the code would catch that.\n\nThird example:\n\nGuest: BABBONATALE\nHost: FATHERCHRISTMAS\nPile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nCombined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. Let me check the length. Let's see:\n\nBABBONATALE is 10 letters (B A B B O N A T A L E → 11 letters? Wait, let me count again. B A B B O N A T A L E → that's 11 letters. FATHERCHRISTMAS is F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → 14 letters. Total 11+14=25. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters. Let me see, the pile's length is len(\"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\") — let me count:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the character counts of the combined names match exactly with the character counts of the pile of letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths**: If the combined length of the guest and host names does not match the length of the pile of letters, immediately return \"NO\".\n4. **Sort and Compare**: Sort the characters of both the combined names and the pile of letters. If the sorted strings are identical, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(input), 3):\n        guest = input[i]\n        host = input[i+1]\n        pile = input[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if len(combined) != len(pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of lines. Each set of three consecutive lines represents one test case.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated to form a single string which is then compared against the pile of letters.\n- **Length Check**: Before sorting, we check if the lengths of the combined string and the pile are the same. If they are not, it's impossible for them to be permutations of each other, so we immediately return \"NO\".\n- **Sorting and Comparing**: By sorting both the combined string and the pile of letters, we can easily check if they contain the same characters in the same frequencies. If the sorted versions are equal, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the required conditions using sorting, which is straightforward and effective for the given problem constraints.",
