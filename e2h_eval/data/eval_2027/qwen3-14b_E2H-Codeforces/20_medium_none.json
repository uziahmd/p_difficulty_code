For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to compute the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to output this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. The condition is that for every binary string s (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. So, the problem is about choosing the c_s values such that when you construct a multiset, the maximum size of such a multiset is exactly f.\n\nBut our goal is not to construct the multiset, but to count the number of valid c_s assignments where the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The key is to find for each possible assignment of c_s values, what is the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. Then, we need to count all assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum? Let's think about the constraints on the c_s values. For the multiset to be beautiful, for every s (prefix of any string in the multiset), the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum size of such a multiset depends on the constraints imposed by the c_s values. How can we model this maximum?\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where we have to find the maximum number of elements in a set that satisfies certain constraints. For example, each node (binary string) has a capacity, and adding an element contributes to the capacities of all its prefixes.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled with a trie structure. Each binary string s of length up to n is a node. For a given multiset of strings of length n, each string contributes +1 to all its prefixes. The constraints are that for each prefix s, the sum over all strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum size of such a multiset would then be the minimum over all possible constraints. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow problem. But perhaps there's a way to model it using inclusion-exclusion or dynamic programming.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the minimal constraints along the paths from the root to the leaves. Because each string in the multiset contributes to all prefixes. So, for example, if a string is of length n, it contributes to all its prefixes of lengths 1 to n.\n\nSo, for each string in the multiset, we have to ensure that for all prefixes of that string, the count doesn't exceed their respective c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is limited by the constraints of the prefixes of each string. \n\nBut how do we find the maximum possible size of such a multiset given the c_s values?\n\nThis seems like a problem where the maximum possible size is the sum over all nodes (binary strings) of the minimum of the c_s values along the path from the root to that node. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we model this as a tree where each node represents a binary string. The root is the empty string (but maybe not considered here). Each node has two children: appending a 0 or a 1. The leaves are the strings of length n.\n\nEach leaf (string of length n) can be included in the multiset. However, including it adds 1 to all its prefixes. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is constrained by the c_s values of all prefixes. \n\nTo maximize the number of strings in the multiset, we need to select as many as possible without violating any constraints. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of leaves such that for each prefix s, the number of leaves whose prefix is s is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where each node has a capacity, and the total number of leaves passing through it can't exceed the capacity. The maximum number of leaves is then determined by the capacities of the nodes along their paths.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of items that can be placed in a trie, where each node has a capacity, and each item (leaf) contributes 1 to all nodes along its path. The maximum number of items is the minimum over all nodes of the capacity multiplied by some factor?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where each node s has a capacity c_s, and the number of leaves that pass through s is at most c_s. The maximum number of leaves that can be chosen is the maximum x such that for all s, the number of leaves that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to compute this x? It seems like a problem where we need to assign to each node a value that represents how many times it can be used, but considering that each leaf contributes to all its ancestors.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, the maximum x is determined by the minimal sum of capacities along certain paths. Wait, but how?\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a flow network. But with n up to 15, the number of nodes is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 32766 nodes. Which might be manageable for some algorithms, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nBut since we need to compute for all possible c_s configurations, this approach might not be feasible. Instead, perhaps we can find for a given set of c_s values, what is the maximum possible x (the maximum size of the beautiful multiset).\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can pass through it is limited by c_s. However, each leaf passes through all its ancestors. So, for the entire tree, the maximum x is the minimum over all nodes s of (the sum of capacities of s's descendants?), no, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a constraint that for any node s, the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s cannot exceed c_s. Because each leaf in the subtree of s has s as a prefix. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s divided by something? No, perhaps not.\n\nWait, for each node s, the number of leaves in the subtree of s is 2^{n - len(s)}. So, for example, if s is a node of length l, then there are 2^{n - l} leaves in its subtree. However, the number of leaves that can be selected in this subtree is limited by c_s. Therefore, for the entire tree, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * something?).\n\nBut how does this relate to the constraints? Suppose for a node s, the number of leaves in its subtree that are selected can't exceed c_s. But also, for its children, their constraints must be satisfied. So this seems like a hierarchical problem. For example, the root has a capacity of c_root. The maximum number of leaves that can be selected is <= c_root. But each of those leaves must also satisfy the constraints of their children, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum possible x is determined by the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s divided by ... no, maybe not. Let's think of it as follows: For each node s, the number of leaves in the subtree of s that are selected can't exceed c_s. Also, for each child t of s, the number of leaves in the subtree of t that are selected can't exceed c_t. So, the maximum x is the minimum of all c_s multiplied by the number of leaves that can be selected under their constraints. But how?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved by considering the constraints in a bottom-up manner. For example, for each node s, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is min(c_s, the sum of the maximum leaves allowed by its children). Wait, that might be the case. For example, the root can have up to c_root leaves. But each of those leaves must be in the subtrees of its children, which each have their own constraints. So for the root's children, the maximum number of leaves they can contribute is min(c_child, ...). \n\nThis is similar to the problem of scheduling where each node has a capacity, and the leaves are the resources. The maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimum capacities along the paths. \n\nWait, here's a key insight: For any node s, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is min(c_s, 2 * max_leaves_in_children). Because the subtree of s has two children (assuming s is not a leaf). Each child can contribute up to their own max leaves. However, the total number of leaves in the subtree of s is the sum of the leaves from the left and right children. But since the capacity of s is c_s, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves from the children.\n\nWait, no. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a node s. The maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves that can be selected in the left and right children. Because, for the leaves in the subtree of s, each leaf is in the subtree of either the left or right child. But the capacity of s limits the total number of leaves in its subtree. So, the maximum number of leaves in s's subtree is the minimum of (c_s, (max_left + max_right)), where max_left is the maximum number of leaves in the left child's subtree, and max_right is the same for the right child.\n\nBut this seems like a recursive formula. For example, for a leaf node (length n), the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1 (since it's a single leaf), but it's limited by c_s. So for a node s of length n, the maximum is min(c_s, 1). For a node of length l < n, the maximum is min(c_s, left_max + right_max).\n\nSo, the maximum x for the entire tree is the value computed by this recursive formula starting from the root (empty string?), but wait, the root here would be the empty string. However, the problem considers all strings of length from 1 to n. So perhaps the root is not considered here. Wait, the problem says that the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So the root (empty string) is not part of the problem. But the constraints apply to all prefixes of the strings in the multiset, which includes all strings of length from 1 to n.\n\nSo, the root (empty string) is a prefix of all strings. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected is limited by the capacity of the empty string. But how do we model the tree?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the root is the empty string, and each node represents a binary string. For a node s of length l, its children are s0 and s1 (appending 0 or 1). The leaves are the nodes of length n.\n\nSo, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is determined by the root's capacity and the constraints of all nodes along the way.\n\nThus, the recursive formula for the maximum number of leaves is:\n\ndef max_leaves(s):\n    if s is a leaf (length n):\n        return min(c_s, 1)\n    else:\n        left = max_leaves(s0)\n        right = max_leaves(s1)\n        return min(c_s, left + right)\n\nSo, the maximum x is the value returned by max_leaves(root), where root is the empty string. Wait, but the empty string isn't part of the problem's c_s. Wait, the problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, we have a c_s. But the empty string isn't considered. So perhaps the root is not considered here. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, the problem states that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. So, for example, the empty string is not considered here. But any string in the multiset (which is of length n) has the empty string as a prefix. Therefore, the count of such strings is the total number of strings in the multiset, which must be ≤ c_{empty string}. But according to the problem statement, the empty string is not part of the c_s variables. Oh wait, the problem says that the c_s are chosen for every binary string of length from 1 to n. So, the empty string is not considered. Therefore, the problem statement's example may have a mistake, but according to the problem description, the c_s are for strings of length 1 to n. Therefore, the empty string is not part of the constraints. But that can't be right because the empty string is a prefix of all strings. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"For every such string s with length from 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset such that s is their prefix is not exceeding c_s.\"\n\nAh, so the empty string is not considered here. Therefore, the count of strings in the multiset (which is of length n) is not bounded by any c_s. Wait, but that's impossible. Because the empty string is a prefix of all strings. So the count of strings in the multiset would be the number of strings in the multiset, which must be ≤ c_{empty string}, but since the empty string is not part of the c_s variables, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the c_s are chosen for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So the empty string is not part of the s's. Therefore, the problem's constraints don't include the empty string. Therefore, the count of strings in the multiset (which is the total number of elements) is not bounded by any c_s. But that can't be correct. For example, in the first sample input, n=1, k=42, f=2. The sample output says that there are 3 ways. In that case, the c_0 and c_1 are chosen. The maximum beautiful multiset size is 2, which would be achieved by having two strings of length 1 (either 0 or 1, or both). But since the empty string is not considered, the count of the multiset is allowed to be as large as possible as long as all prefixes of length 1 are respected. Wait, but the empty string is a prefix of all strings, but since it's not part of the c_s, there's no constraint on the total number of strings. That seems contradictory. How can the multiset be of any size, as long as for each prefix of length ≥1, the count is within c_s?\n\nWait, but in the first example, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is 2. How is that possible? Because the multiset can have two elements. For example, {0, 0}, but then for the prefix '0', the count is 2, which must be ≤ c_0. Similarly, if the multiset is {0, 1}, then for the prefix '0' the count is 1 (if the multiset has one 0 and one 1), but that's allowed. But why can't the multiset be larger than 2? Because the c_0 and c_1 are chosen to be such that their sum is 2. For example, if c_0 is 2 and c_1 is 0, then the maximum multiset is {0, 0}, which has size 2. If c_0 is 1 and c_1 is 1, then the maximum is {0, 1} with size 2. If c_0 is 0 and c_1 is 2, then the maximum is {1, 1} with size 2. So in these cases, the maximum is 2. But if the c_0 and c_1 are higher, say c_0 = 3 and c_1 = 3, then the maximum multiset could be of size 3 (e.g., three 0s, or two 0s and one 1, etc.), but the problem requires that the maximum is exactly f. Therefore, the problem requires that for the chosen c_s values, the maximum possible multiset size is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this maximum possible size? It seems that the maximum possible size is determined by the constraints on all prefixes. For example, if you have a string s of length l, then the number of times it appears as a prefix in the multiset is the number of elements in the multiset that start with s. For each such s, this count must be ≤ c_s.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible size of the multiset is the maximum number of elements that can be added without violating any of the constraints. How can we compute this value given the c_s values?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of elements (each of length n) such that for every prefix s of length 1..n, the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled as a tree with capacities. Each node represents a binary string of length l (from 1 to n). The root is the empty string (but not part of the c_s), but the leaves are the strings of length n. Each node has two children (appending 0 or 1). The capacity of each node is c_s. The problem is to select as many leaves as possible such that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of the capacity multiplied by some factor. But how?\n\nLet me think recursively again. For a node s of length l, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves that can be selected in the subtrees of its children. Because each leaf in the subtree of s must pass through s, so the total number of leaves in the subtree of s is the sum of the leaves in the left and right subtrees, but this can't exceed c_s. So for a node s, the maximum is min(c_s, left_max + right_max).\n\nBut for a node s of length n, it's a leaf. Its subtree contains only itself. So the maximum is min(c_s, 1).\n\nSo, this recursive formula gives us the maximum possible x. Therefore, the maximum x is determined by this formula, starting from the root (empty string). Wait, but the empty string is not part of the c_s. However, the empty string's subtree includes all strings of length n. So, according to this formula, the maximum x is min(c_empty, ...), but c_empty is not defined. Therefore, there's a problem here. \n\nAh! Wait, the empty string is not part of the c_s. So, the constraints for the empty string are not considered. Therefore, the maximum x is not limited by the empty string. But that's impossible. Because the empty string is a prefix of all elements in the multiset, so the count of elements in the multiset is the number of elements in the multiset, which is x. However, since the empty string is not part of the c_s variables, there is no constraint on x. Therefore, the maximum x is determined by other constraints. \n\nBut how can that be? Because, for example, consider n=1. Then the multiset consists of strings of length 1. The constraints are that for each string of length 1 (i.e., '0' and '1'), the number of times they appear in the multiset is ≤ c_0 and c_1 respectively. The maximum x is then the minimum between c_0 + c_1 (if you can take all elements) but that's not correct. Because the count for each individual string is limited by their respective c_s. So the maximum x is the sum of the counts of each individual string, but each count is limited by their c_s. However, the sum of the counts is the total number of elements in the multiset. For example, if you have c_0 = 2 and c_1 = 3, then the maximum x is 2+3 =5. But according to the earlier formula, for the root (empty string), which is not part of the c_s, the formula would have left and right children (the '0' and '1' nodes). For the root, the maximum would be min(?, left_max + right_max). But since the root's capacity is not defined, the formula would be left_max + right_max. So in this case, the maximum x is 2 + 3 =5. Which is correct. \n\nAh! So the empty string is not part of the c_s variables, but for the purpose of calculating the maximum x, the root node (empty string) has no capacity constraint, so the maximum is the sum of the capacities of its children. But for the children (nodes of length 1), their capacities are c_0 and c_1. Therefore, the maximum x is the sum of the capacities of the leaves, but constrained by the capacities of their parents. Wait, no. For example, if you have a node of length 1 (say '0'), and its capacity is 2. Then the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_0, 1), since the subtree of '0' (for n=1) is just the string '0'. So for n=1, the formula would give for the root's left child (node '0') min(c_0, 1), and similarly for the right child. Then the root's maximum is the sum of the left and right maxima. Which is min(c_0, 1) + min(c_1, 1). Which for the case where c_0=2 and c_1=3 would be 1+1=2. But that contradicts the earlier thought that the maximum x would be 5. So clearly, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, this indicates that my previous reasoning is incorrect. So what's wrong here?\n\nLet me take the example of n=1, c_0=2, c_1=3. What is the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset? Since the multiset can consist of any number of 0s and 1s, as long as the count of 0s is ≤2 and count of 1s is ≤3. The maximum x is 2+3=5. However, according to the formula I thought of earlier, the root node (empty string) would have left and right children (nodes '0' and '1'). For each of those nodes, since they are leaves (n=1), their maximum is min(c_s, 1). For '0' node, that's min(2,1)=1. For '1' node, min(3,1)=1. Then the root's maximum is 1+1=2. Which is wrong. So clearly, my previous approach is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the formula is wrong. So what is the correct way to model this?\n\nLet me think again. The maximum number of leaves that can be selected is the maximum x such that for every node s, the number of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nIn the case of n=1, the only nodes are '0' and '1' (length 1). The number of leaves in the multiset with prefix '0' is the count of '0's in the multiset, which must be ≤ c_0. Similarly for '1's. The total number of leaves is the sum of the counts. Therefore, the maximum x is c_0 + c_1. Which is correct. So how to model this with the tree?\n\nAh! The previous approach was wrong because the formula assumed that for a node s, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, ...). But in reality, for a node s, the number of leaves in its subtree that are selected is the number of leaves in the multiset that start with s. Which is the sum of the counts of all leaves in the subtree of s. For example, for the root (empty string), the number of leaves in the multiset that have it as a prefix is x, the total number of elements. But since the root is not part of the constraints, this count is not limited. However, for the children of the root (nodes of length 1), the count of leaves in their subtree is the count of that particular string. Which must be ≤ c_s. \n\nSo, the problem is that the formula I thought of earlier is not correct. So what's the correct way to model the maximum x?\n\nLet me think recursively. For a node s, let’s define m(s) as the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s, given the constraints of s and its descendants. Then, for a node s of length l:\n\nIf l == n (a leaf), then the maximum is min(c_s, 1). Because the subtree of s contains only the string s itself. So selecting it contributes 1 to the count, but it can't exceed c_s.\n\nIf l < n, then the subtree of s consists of all strings of length n that start with s. The number of such strings is 2^{n - l}. However, the constraints are that for s itself, the number of selected leaves in its subtree (which is the sum of the leaves selected in the left and right children) must be ≤ c_s. Also, the children have their own constraints.\n\nSo, for a non-leaf node s, m(s) is the minimum between c_s and (m(left_child) + m(right_child)).\n\nWait, let's test this with the previous example where n=1. For the root (empty string), which is not part of the c_s. But in this case, the root's children are the nodes of length 1. Let's assume that the root is treated as a special node with infinite capacity. Then, m(root) = min(inf, m('0') + m('1')) = m('0') + m('1'). For the nodes '0' and '1', m('0') is min(c_0, 1), m('1') is min(c_1, 1). So in the case where c_0=2 and c_1=3, m('0') is 1, m('1') is 1. Then m(root) = 2, which is wrong. Because the maximum x is 5, not 2. So clearly, this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the model is not capturing the correct constraints. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is that for a node s of length l < n, the number of leaves in its subtree that are selected is the sum of the leaves selected in its children's subtrees. However, this sum must not exceed c_s. But for the children, their own constraints may allow more leaves than what their parent allows. For example, if s is a node with c_s = 5, and its children have capacities that allow their subtrees to have 3 and 4 leaves respectively. Then, the maximum number of leaves in s's subtree is min(5, 3 + 4) = 5. But that would mean that the children's subtrees can contribute 5 leaves. However, the children's own capacities may not allow that. For example, the left child has a capacity of 3. So the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 3. The right child has a capacity of 4. So the maximum is 4. Summing them gives 7, which is larger than the parent's capacity of 5. Hence, the parent's capacity limits the sum to 5. So the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min(c_s, left_max + right_max). \n\nBut this would imply that in the previous example where n=1, the root is treated as having infinite capacity. Its children are '0' and '1', which have capacities c_0 and c_1. For each of these children, since they are leaves (l = n=1), their m(s) is min(c_s, 1). So for the root, m(root) = min(inf, m('0') + m('1')) = m('0') + m('1') = min(c_0,1) + min(c_1, 1). Which for c_0=2 and c_1=3 gives 1+1=2. But the actual maximum x is 2+3=5. So this is clearly wrong. What's the issue here?\n\nAh! Because for the children of the root (the nodes of length 1), their m(s) is the maximum number of leaves in their subtree, which is 1 (since they are leaves), but their capacity is c_s. So the actual maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of the node '0' is min(c_0, 1). But this would imply that you can't select more than one '0' in the multiset. However, in reality, the multiset can contain multiple copies of '0' as long as the count is ≤ c_0. \n\nWait, this is a critical misunderstanding. The problem says that the multiset is a multiset of binary strings of length exactly n. So, for example, if n=1, the multiset can contain multiple copies of '0' and '1'. However, the constraints for the prefixes are that for each prefix s (like '0'), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. For '0', the number of such strings is the count of '0's in the multiset. So, if c_0 is 2, then the multiset can contain up to 2 copies of '0'. Similarly for '1's. \n\nSo, for the node '0' (length 1), the maximum number of leaves in its subtree (which is the number of '0's in the multiset) is min(c_0, ...). But what is the upper bound here? It's c_0. Because the subtree of '0' contains only the string '0'. So, the number of leaves in the subtree of '0' is equal to the number of '0's in the multiset. This must be ≤ c_0. So the maximum is c_0. However, the earlier formula said min(c_s, 1), which is wrong. \n\nAh! So the formula is incorrect. The error was assuming that the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of a node s is min(c_s, 1) for leaves. But that's not correct. For a leaf node s (length n), the number of leaves in its subtree is the number of times s appears in the multiset. Which can be any number up to c_s. So the maximum is c_s. However, since the subtree of s contains only s, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree is c_s. \n\nWait, but this seems to contradict the earlier idea that the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min(c_s, ...). Because for a leaf node s, there are no children. So the formula for m(s) should be min(c_s, ...). But what is the ...?\n\nLet me think again. For a node s of length l < n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the sum of the maximum leaves in its children's subtrees, but not exceeding c_s. For a node s of length l = n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is c_s, since you can have up to c_s copies of s in the multiset. \n\nSo, the correct formula for m(s) is:\n\nif s is a leaf (l = n):\n    m(s) = c_s\nelse:\n    m(s) = min(c_s, m(left_child) + m(right_child))\n\nWait, let's test this with the earlier example. For n=1, the nodes '0' and '1' are leaves. Their m(s) is c_0 and c_1. The root (empty string) has m(root) = min(inf, m('0') + m('1')) = c_0 + c_1. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=2, and for node '0' (length 1), its children are '00' and '01'. Suppose c_0 is 3, c_00 is 1, c_01 is 2. Then for the node '00', m('00') is 1. For '01', m('01') is 2. Then m('0') = min(3, 1 + 2) = 3. So the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of '0' is 3. Which means that the number of strings in the multiset that start with '0' is 3. This would include 1 '00' and 2 '01's, or any combination that sums to 3. However, the constraints for '00' and '01' are satisfied. \n\nYes, this makes sense. For the node '0', the capacity is 3, so the total number of strings in the multiset that start with '0' can be up to 3. These strings are the ones in the subtree of '0', which are '00' and '01'. The sum of their maximums is 1+2=3, which is equal to the capacity of '0', so m('0') is 3. \n\nSo this seems correct. So the formula is:\n\nFor each node s:\n\nif s is a leaf (length n):\n    m(s) = c_s\nelse:\n    m(s) = min(c_s, m(left_child) + m(right_child))\n\nAnd the maximum x is m(root), where root is the empty string (with infinite capacity). \n\nBut how do we compute this for all possible c_s configurations?\n\nThe problem now is to find the number of ways to assign c_s values (each between 0 and k) to all binary strings of length 1 to n, such that when we compute m(root) as described, it equals exactly f.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. For each possible assignment of c_s values (each c_s is between 0 and k), compute m(root) using the above recursive formula. Count how many assignments result in m(root) = f.\n\nBut with n up to 15, the number of nodes is O(2^n), which for n=15 is 32766. So for each assignment, the number of nodes is manageable. However, the total number of possible assignments is (k+1)^{2^n - 1} (since there are 2^1 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2 nodes, minus 1 for the root?), but for n=15, this is way too big. For example, even for n=15, the number of nodes is 2^16 - 2 = 65534. And k can be up to 2e5. So enumerating all possible assignments is impossible. Therefore, we need a dynamic programming approach or combinatorial method to count the valid assignments.\n\nSo, we need to find a way to compute the number of c_s assignments that lead to m(root) = f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's consider the tree structure. Each node contributes to the computation of m(s), and the value of m(s) depends on the values of its children. This suggests that we can use dynamic programming on the tree, processing nodes from the leaves up to the root.\n\nFor each node, the value of m(s) depends on the values of its children. However, the children are processed before the parent. So, we can process the nodes in order of increasing length.\n\nFor example, for n=2, the nodes are of length 1 and 2. We process the length-2 nodes first, then the length-1 nodes, then the root.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each node, compute the possible values of m(s) based on the possible values of its children.\n\nBut since the c_s values are variables, we need to find for each node, the number of ways to assign c_s values such that the m(s) is a certain value, considering the constraints from the children.\n\nBut this seems complex. Let's think recursively. For a node s, the value of m(s) is min(c_s, left_m + right_m). So, for a node s, given the possible values of left_m and right_m, the value of m(s) is determined by c_s. \n\nBut how can we model this for all possible combinations?\n\nLet me consider that for each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s values such that m(s) equals a certain value, given the constraints on the children.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem where for each node, we track the possible values of m(s) and the number of ways to achieve them.\n\nLet's formalize this. Let's denote for each node s, and for each possible value v, dp[s][v] = number of ways to assign c_s and the children's c values such that m(s) = v.\n\nFor a leaf node s (length n), m(s) = c_s.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign values to each binary string prefix such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset of binary strings of length exactly `n` is exactly `f`. The solution involves dynamic programming on a tree structure representing all possible binary strings of lengths from 1 to `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: Represent all binary strings as nodes in a tree where each node has two children (appending '0' and '1'). Nodes of length `n` are leaves.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a bottom-up approach to compute the number of valid configurations for each node. For each node, track the number of ways to achieve different values of `m(s)`, which represents the maximum number of strings in the multiset that can have the node's string as a prefix.\n3. **Recursive Calculation**: For each node, calculate the possible values of `m(s)` based on its children. If a node is a leaf, `m(s)` is directly determined by its assigned value. For non-leaf nodes, `m(s)` is the minimum of its capacity and the sum of the values from its children.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx +=3\n        \n        # Precompute all binary strings of length 1..n\n        # We need to process nodes in order of increasing length\n        # For each length l, there are 2^l nodes\n        # We can represent nodes as tuples (length, string)\n        # But since the actual string isn't needed, just the hierarchy, we can use a trie-like approach\n        \n        # Let's build a tree structure where each node is represented by its depth (length)\n        # For each depth l (from 1 to n), we have 2^l nodes\n        # We can process nodes in order of increasing depth\n        \n        # For each node, we need to know its left and right children\n        # However, since the actual string isn't needed, we can represent the tree with indices\n        # For each depth l, the nodes can be numbered from 0 to 2^l -1\n        # For a node at depth l with index i, its left child is at depth l+1, index 2*i, and right is 2*i+1\n        \n        # However, for dynamic programming purposes, we can process nodes in order of increasing depth\n        # For each node, we'll compute the dp table for that node\n        \n        # The root is not part of the c_s, but we treat it as a node with infinite capacity\n        \n        # Let's precompute for each depth l, the number of nodes\n        max_depth = n\n        # For each depth from 1 to n, the nodes are processed\n        \n        # dp is a dictionary where for each node, we store a dictionary of possible m(s) values and their counts\n        # But since nodes are processed in order, we can use arrays for each depth\n        \n        # For each depth l, we can compute the dp for nodes at that depth based on their children (depth l+1)\n        \n        # Initialize dp for leaves (depth n)\n        # Each leaf node can have m(s) = c_s, which ranges from 0 to k\n        # So for each leaf node, the number of ways to get m(s) = v is 1 if 0 <= v <=k, else 0\n        # However, since all leaf nodes are independent, we need to combine them\n        \n        # But since the root's m depends on the sum of children's m, we need to compute for each node\n        \n        # Let's use memoization for each node's possible m values\n        \n        # We can represent each node by its depth and index (but since the actual index doesn't matter except for children, we can process all nodes of the same depth together)\n        \n        # For each depth l from n down to 1:\n        #   for each node at l:\n        #       if l == n: dp is {v: 1} for v in 0..k\n        #       else: dp is min(c_l, left_dp + right_dp)\n        \n        # However, since the c_l can be any value between 0 and k, and for each node, we need to consider all possibilities of c_l and the combinations of left and right dp\n        \n        # This seems computationally heavy, but for n up to 15, it's manageable with some optimizations\n        \n        # Let's think recursively.

So for current_m =3, the c must be in [3, 5], because when c is between 3 and 5, min(c,5) is min(c,5) which is c if c <=5. So if current_m is 3, then it can be achieved by c=3 (min(3,5)=3), or c=4 (min(4,5)=4 !=3). So this approach is incorrect.\n            \n            # Wait, this suggests that my previous idea is wrong.
