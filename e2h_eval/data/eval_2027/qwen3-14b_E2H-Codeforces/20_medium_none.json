For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem seems a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo the task is to compute the number of ways to assign values c_s for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for each binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. The multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. So, the beautiful multiset's size is the total number of strings in it, and we want the maximum possible such size to be exactly f.\n\nThe question is about counting the number of valid assignments of c_s values such that when you choose them, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each assignment of c_s, there's a maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. We need to count the assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute that maximum?\n\nThis feels like a problem involving constraints on prefixes. Maybe we can model this with some kind of trie structure, where each node represents a binary string, and the constraints are on how many times each prefix can be used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by some constraints on the c_s values. For example, if we think of the problem as building a trie where each node has a capacity c_s, then the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the capacities along the paths.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is the minimum over all possible constraints. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nEach string in the multiset is of length n. For each such string, it contributes 1 to the count of all its prefixes. For example, the string '01' contributes to the counts of '0', '01', and also (if n is larger than 2) longer prefixes. But since the multiset is of length exactly n, each string has exactly n prefixes (from length 1 up to n).\n\nThe problem requires that for every prefix s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum possible size of such a multiset is determined by the constraints. How can we find this maximum?\n\nThis seems similar to a flow problem or some kind of constraint satisfaction. For example, for each node (prefix), the number of strings passing through it cannot exceed c_s. But since each string contributes to all its prefixes, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined by the sum of constraints in a way that they form a hierarchy.\n\nWait, here's a key observation: For any two prefixes s and t, if s is a prefix of t, then the capacity of s must be at least as large as the capacity of t. Because, for example, suppose s is a prefix of t. Then, any string that has t as a prefix must also have s as a prefix. Therefore, the number of such strings is ≤ c_t, which must also be ≤ c_s. Otherwise, if c_s < c_t, then the count for s would be more than c_s. So for the multiset to be valid, the capacities must satisfy that for any s and t where s is a prefix of t, c_s ≥ c_t. Otherwise, even if you choose c_s and c_t such that c_s < c_t, you can't have a valid multiset because the count for s would be constrained by the count of t's.\n\nWait, but the c_s values are chosen by us. So when choosing the c_s values, we need to ensure that for all s, if s is a prefix of t, then c_s ≥ c_t. Because otherwise, if s is a prefix of t and c_s < c_t, then when considering the multiset, the count of strings with prefix s would include all those with prefix t. So if you have c_t ≥ 1, then the count for s would be at least the count for t. But since c_s < c_t, then the count for s could be up to c_s, which is less than c_t. So maybe that's allowed? Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps the constraints are not required to be hierarchical. But the problem allows any choice of c_s, but when building a beautiful multiset, the constraints must be satisfied.\n\nBut for the maximum possible size of the multiset, perhaps the c_s values must be such that they form a hierarchy. Otherwise, the maximum size would be limited by some constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves. For example, imagine that each string in the multiset corresponds to a path from the root (empty string?) to a leaf (length n). Each node along this path has a capacity. The maximum number of strings that can be placed is the sum over all leaves of the minimum capacity along their path. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a tree where each node is a binary string, and the children are the extensions by 0 or 1. The root is the empty string. Then, each node has two children (except for the leaves of length n). Now, for any node, the number of strings in the multiset that pass through it is limited by c_s. However, each string contributes exactly once to each node along its path.\n\nBut the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the maximum number of strings such that for every node, the number of strings that pass through it is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis problem resembles the problem of finding the maximum number of paths in a tree where each node has a capacity, and each path starts at the root and ends at a leaf (depth n). Each path contributes 1 to each node along its path. The maximum number of such paths is the maximum number of paths such that for each node, the number of paths passing through it is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using the concept of the minimum capacity along the path. For example, if you have a node with capacity c, then the number of paths passing through it can't exceed c. However, since each path passes through all ancestors of the node, the capacities of the ancestors must also be considered.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum number of paths is the sum over all leaves of the minimum capacity along the path from the root to that leaf. However, this seems incorrect because the same path can be counted multiple times. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimal capacities in the tree. For example, for each node, the number of paths that pass through it can't exceed c_s. But since each path goes through all nodes along its path, the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimal capacity in each path.\n\nBut this seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming. Let me think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of paths that can be added through it is determined by the capacities of its children. For example, the root can have two children. The number of paths that can go through the root is limited by c_root. But each path goes through the root and then through one of its children. So the maximum number of paths is the sum of the maximum number of paths that can be added in each subtree, but constrained by the capacities.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. For each node, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the capacities of its children's maximum paths. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a node s with two children, left and right. The number of paths that can pass through s is the sum of the number of paths in the left subtree and the number of paths in the right subtree. But each of these paths must not exceed the capacity of s. Also, each path in the left subtree must not exceed the capacity of the left child, etc.\n\nThis suggests that for each node, the maximum number of paths that can be routed through it is min(c_s, the sum of the maximum number of paths that can be routed through each of its children). Because each path that goes through the node must go through one of its children. So the total number of paths through the node is the sum of the paths through each child. But this sum can't exceed c_s. So the maximum number of paths that can pass through the node is min(c_s, sum of children's max paths).\n\nBut this seems recursive. So, for a node at depth d (with depth n being the leaves), the maximum number of paths that can be routed through it is min(c_s, sum of the max paths of its children). For the leaves (depth n), they have no children. So their maximum is c_s (since each path ends at the leaf, and there's no further nodes to consider).\n\nWait, but for a leaf node (depth n), the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is c_s. Because each path that ends at that node contributes exactly once to the count of that node. So, for the leaf nodes, the maximum is c_s. Then, for their parent nodes, the maximum number of paths through the parent is min(c_parent, sum of the max paths of the children). This seems to make sense.\n\nSo the total maximum number of paths (the size of the beautiful multiset) is equal to the maximum number of paths that can be routed through the root node. Which is min(c_root, sum of the max paths of its children). But the root here is the empty string, which isn't part of the problem's constraints. Wait, the problem says that for all strings s of length from 1 to n. So the root (empty string) isn't considered. Wait, but the problem says that for every string s of length from 1 to n. So the root (empty string) is not part of the constraints. However, the root is a prefix of all strings. But since the empty string is not considered in the constraints, perhaps the root's capacity isn't part of the problem. Wait, the problem says that the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n, and for every s of length from 1 to n, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be <= c_s. So the empty string isn't considered here. Wait, but the empty string is a prefix of all strings. However, the problem states that s ranges from length 1 to n. So the empty string is not included. Therefore, the constraints are only on the non-empty prefixes. Therefore, the root node (empty string) doesn't have a c_s value. So perhaps the root node isn't part of the problem.\n\nBut how does that affect the calculation? Let's think again. The maximum number of paths (strings in the multiset) is determined by the constraints on all prefixes. So for the root node (empty string), which is a prefix of all strings, the count of strings in the multiset that have it as a prefix is exactly the total number of strings in the multiset. But the problem does not have a c_s for the empty string. Therefore, there's no constraint on the total number of strings. However, the problem says that for all s of length from 1 to n, the count of strings with s as a prefix is <= c_s. So the total number of strings in the multiset can be any number, as long as for each s of length 1 to n, the count is <= c_s.\n\nBut how do we find the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s values? Well, the maximum size is determined by the constraints. It's the maximum number m such that there exists a multiset of m strings of length n, where for every s of length 1..n, the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using the trie structure and the earlier recursive approach. For each node (binary string of length l, where 1 <= l <=n), the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is min(c_s, sum of the max paths of its children). The leaves (nodes of length n) have their max paths equal to c_s. Then, the maximum size of the multiset is the sum of the max paths of the root's children (but wait, the root is the empty string, which isn't part of the constraints. So perhaps the root is treated as a node with two children (0 and 1), and the maximum number of paths is the sum of the max paths of the root's children. But since the root's own capacity isn't considered, the sum is not constrained by any c_s. Wait, but the root's children (the strings of length 1) have their own c_s values. Let me think again.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the constraints on the prefixes. For each node (string s of length l), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. For the root (empty string), which is a prefix of all strings, the count is the total number of strings in the multiset, but there's no constraint on it. However, the count for the root's children (strings of length 1) must be <= their respective c_s values. So, the maximum possible m is the maximum number of strings such that for each node s (of length 1..n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nTo compute this m, we can model the trie as follows. For each node, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the max paths of its children. For leaves (nodes of length n), the maximum number of paths through them is c_s. Then, the total maximum m is the sum of the max paths of the root's children (i.e., the sum of the max paths of the two nodes of length 1). However, the root's children are the nodes of length 1. For each such node, their max paths is min(c_s, sum of their children's max paths). \n\nBut how do we compute this recursively?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose n=1. Then, the multiset consists of strings of length 1. The constraints are on the strings of length 1. The maximum m is the sum of the c_s for each string (but since each string is a single element, the count for each s is the number of times it appears in the multiset. Since each string is of length 1, the count for each s is exactly the number of times it's present. So the maximum m is the sum of the counts for each s, but each count can't exceed c_s. Therefore, the maximum m is the sum of c_0 and c_1. But according to the formula above, for each node (s of length 1), the max paths is c_s. Then, the total is the sum of the max paths of the root's children, which is c_0 + c_1. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother example: n=2. The nodes of length 1 are 0 and 1. Each has two children (00, 01 for node 0; 10, 11 for node 1). For each node of length 2, the max paths is c_s. For the nodes of length 1, their max paths is min(c_s, sum of their children's max paths). For example, node 0's max is min(c_0, c_00 + c_01). Similarly for node 1. Then, the total maximum m is the sum of the max paths of the root's children (node 0 and node 1's max paths).\n\nSo in general, the maximum m is computed recursively by:\n\nFor a node s of length l:\n\nif l == n: max_paths[s] = c_s\n\nelse: max_paths[s] = min( c_s, sum( max_paths[child] for child in children of s ) )\n\nThen, the total m is the sum of max_paths for the root's children (the nodes of length 1).\n\nBut how do we compute this for all possible c_s assignments?\n\nOur problem is to count the number of assignments of c_s (each c_s can be between 0 and k, inclusive) such that when we compute this m as described, it equals exactly f.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 15, the number of nodes (binary strings of length 1 to n) is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16 - 2 = 65534 nodes. So for each node, we have to track some value. However, considering that the constraints on the c_s values are that for any node s, all of its descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) must have c values <= c_s. Because otherwise, when computing the max_paths for s, the sum of children's max_paths could be larger than c_s, leading to a min that is c_s. But if a child has a higher c value than its parent, then the parent's max_paths could be limited by the sum of the children's max_paths. However, if the parent's c is smaller than the sum, then the parent's max_paths is c. But in that case, the child's max_paths could be larger than the parent's c. However, the constraints on the c_s values are not necessarily hierarchical. For example, a parent can have a c_s less than its child. But in that case, when calculating the max_paths for the parent, the sum of the children's max_paths may be larger than c_s, so the parent's max_paths is c_s. However, the children's max_paths are computed based on their own c and their children.\n\nBut in order for the maximum m to be f, the assignments of c_s must be such that the computed m equals f. However, how can we model this?\n\nThis seems very complex. Let's think of it as a dynamic programming problem. For each node, the value of max_paths depends on the c_s of that node and the max_paths of its children.\n\nBut since the nodes form a tree structure, perhaps we can model this recursively. However, given that n can be up to 15, and the number of nodes is manageable (for n=15, 65534 nodes), perhaps we can precompute for each node the possible contributions.\n\nBut how to model the dependencies between the nodes. For example, the max_paths for a node depends on the c_s of that node and the max_paths of its children. So for each node, the value of max_paths is min(c_s, sum_children). Thus, the max_paths of a node is a function of c_s and the sum of the max_paths of its children.\n\nBut since the children are processed before the parent (since the tree is built from the root down), we can process nodes in order of increasing length. For example, nodes of length n are leaves, then their parents are of length n-1, etc.\n\nSo, for each node s of length l, we can compute the max_paths[s] as follows:\n\nif l == n: max_paths[s] = c_s\n\nelse: max_paths[s] = min(c_s, sum of max_paths for children of s)\n\nThe total m is then the sum of max_paths for the two nodes of length 1.\n\nNow, the problem is to count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k, inclusive) such that the resulting m is exactly f.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the constraints on the c_s values. For the max_paths to be correctly computed, there's no requirement that the c_s values are in a certain order. However, for the max_paths to be as computed, the c_s can be anything between 0 and k. However, the way the max_paths is computed may lead to some dependencies between the c_s values. For example, if a node's c_s is larger than the sum of its children's max_paths, then the max_paths for that node is the sum. Otherwise, it's c_s.\n\nBut the problem is that for each node, the value of max_paths depends on the c_s of that node and the max_paths of the children. However, the max_paths of the children depend on their own c_s and their children, etc. So this seems like a recursive problem that's difficult to model directly.\n\nBut given that n is small (up to 15), perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, memoizing for each node the possible values of max_paths and how they contribute to the total m.\n\nBut even for n=15, the number of nodes is 65534, and for each node, the max_paths can be up to k. However, k can be up to 2e5, so it's impossible to track for each node all possible max_paths values.\n\nAlternative approach: notice that for the entire tree, the maximum m is determined by the constraints on the c_s values. However, the problem requires that the maximum m is exactly f. So perhaps we can model this as a problem where for each node, we need to choose c_s such that the constraints on the max_paths are satisfied, and the total m is exactly f.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, the max_paths for that node is either c_s or the sum of the max_paths of its children. Let's think of the max_paths for a node as x. Then, x can be either:\n\nx = min(c_s, sum_children)\n\nBut sum_children is the sum of the max_paths of the children. However, the sum_children depends on the children's c values.\n\nBut for the purpose of counting, perhaps we can model for each node, the possible range of values that the max_paths can take, given that the children's max_paths are fixed.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternative idea: For the entire tree, the maximum m is determined by the root's children. Let's think of the tree as a hierarchy. For each node, the max_paths is determined by c_s and the sum of the children's max_paths. But the sum of the children's max_paths is determined by their own c values and their children.\n\nBut perhaps for each node, we can model the possible contribution to the total m. Let's think about the nodes in reverse order, starting from the leaves.\n\nFor example, for a node of length l, if l == n, then its max_paths is exactly c_s. So for each such node, the contribution is c_s, and the possible value is between 0 and k.\n\nFor a node of length l < n, the max_paths is min(c_s, sum_children). However, the sum_children is the sum of the max_paths of the children. So for this node, the max_paths can be either c_s (if sum_children >= c_s) or sum_children (if sum_children < c_s).\n\nBut how can we model this for all nodes?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible values of the max_paths and the number of ways to choose the c_s values for the subtree rooted at that node that result in that max_paths value.\n\nBut considering that for each node, the max_paths can be up to the sum of the children's max_paths (which for a node with two children, each of which can be up to k, the sum could be up to 2k, but for deeper nodes, the sum could be larger. However, since the max_paths is min(c_s, sum_children), and c_s can be up to k, the max_paths for a node can be up to k. Wait, no. For example, if sum_children is larger than c_s, then the max_paths is c_s. If sum_children is smaller than c_s, then the max_paths is sum_children. So the maximum possible value for max_paths of a node is min(k, sum_children). But sum_children can be up to 2k for a node with two children (each of which is up to k). However, for nodes higher up in the tree, the sum_children can be larger than k, but the max_paths would be capped at k. So for any node, the max_paths can be up to k. Therefore, for each node, the possible max_paths values are between 0 and k.\n\nThis is a crucial observation. Because for any node, the max_paths can be at most k. Because if sum_children is larger than k, then the max_paths is min(c_s, sum_children). Since c_s can be up to k, the max_paths is at most k. If sum_children is less than or equal to k, then the max_paths is sum_children, which is up to sum_children (but sum_children can be up to something else). However, for the root's children, their max_paths can be up to k, and their sum can be up to 2k. But the total m is the sum of the two max_paths of the root's children. Which can be up to 2k. However, the problem says that the maximum m should be exactly f. So for the problem, f can be up to 2k (but given that k can be up to 2e5, and n up to 15, this seems manageable).\n\nBut how to model this with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, the number of ways to assign c_s values in its subtree such that the max_paths for this node is x, and the constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me define dp[node][x] as the number of ways to assign c_s values in the subtree rooted at node (including node itself) such that the max_paths for node is x.\n\nThen, for the leaves (nodes of length n), dp[leaf][x] = 1 if x is between 0 and k, because the max_paths is exactly c_s, which can be chosen as x. So for each leaf, the number of ways to have max_paths x is 1 (since c_s must be x, and x can be between 0 and k). Wait, no. For a leaf node, the max_paths is c_s. So for a given x (the value of max_paths), the number of ways is 1 (since c_s must be exactly x). So for each leaf, the number of ways is 1 if x is between 0 and k, otherwise 0.\n\nFor non-leaf nodes, the max_paths is min(c_s, sum_children). Let's denote that sum_children is S, and the node's c_s is C. Then, the max_paths is min(C, S). But S is the sum of the max_paths of the children. However, the children's max_paths can vary. So for a non-leaf node, we need to consider all possible combinations of the children's max_paths that sum to S, and then for each possible C (between 0 and k), determine whether min(C, S) equals x.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible x.\n\nLet me think. For a non-leaf node, it has two children (since it's a binary tree). Let's say the children are left and right. For the node, the max_paths is min(C, S), where S is the sum of the max_paths of the left and right children. For each possible value of S, and for each possible C, the value of min(C, S) is determined.\n\nBut for the DP approach, we need to consider all possible combinations of the left and right children's max_paths, compute S = left_val + right_val, then for the current node, for each possible C (which is the c_s of this node), the max_paths is min(C, S). Then, for each possible x (the desired max_paths for this node), we need to count the number of ways to choose C and the children's configurations such that min(C, S) = x.\n\nBut how to combine this into the DP.\n\nLet me formalize this. For a non-leaf node, the DP for this node is computed based on the DPs of its children. For each possible value of left_val and right_val, we can compute S = left_val + right_val. Then, for this node, the max_paths is min(C, S), where C is the c_s of this node (ranging from 0 to k). For each possible x (the desired max_paths for this node), we need to count the number of (C, left_val, right_val) combinations such that min(C, S) = x. And multiply by the number of ways for the left and right children to have their respective max_paths.\n\nSo, for the current node, the DP is:\n\ndp[node][x] = sum_{all possible left_val, right_val} [ (number of ways for left child to have left_val) * (number of ways for right child to have right_val) * (number of C values such that min(C, left_val + right_val) = x) ) ]\n\nThis seems feasible. Because for each node, we can precompute for all possible x (up to k) the number of ways.\n\nBut the problem is that for each node, the possible left_val and right_val can be up to k. For example, for a node at depth l, each of its children can have max_paths up to k. So the sum S can be up to 2k. However, for the current node, the max_paths is min(C, S), which is up to k. So for each x, we need to find the number of (S, C) pairs where min(C, S) = x.\n\nBut for each S and x, what is the number of C values that satisfy min(C, S) = x?\n\nLet me think. For a given S and x, min(C, S) = x implies that:\n\nCase 1: x <= S. Then, min(C, S) = x implies that C >= x and C <= x. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf min(C, S) = x, then x is the minimum between C and S.\n\nSo, two possibilities:\n\nEither:\n\n- x = C and C <= S. Then, S >= x.\n\nOr:\n\n- x = S and C >= S.\n\nSo combining these:\n\nmin(C, S) = x iff:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1: C = x and S >= x.\n\nOR\n\nCase 2: S = x and C >= x.\n\nBut note that these two cases are not mutually exclusive. For example, if C = x and S = x, then both cases apply. However, in that case, min(C, S) is x regardless.\n\nSo, the total number of C values (for a given S) that satisfy min(C, S) = x is:\n\nIf x <= S: the number of C values where C = x (so 1 possibility) plus the number of C values where C >= x and S = x. Wait, no. For a given S, the number of C's that make min(C, S) equal to x depends on S and x.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nFor fixed S, min(C, S) = x can happen in two scenarios:\n\n1. C = x and S >= x. Then, min(x, S) = x.\n\n2. S = x and C >= x. Then, min(C, x) = x.\n\nBut if S = x and C >= x, then min(C, x) = x.\n\nBut if S is not x, then scenario 2 is not possible.\n\nSo, for a given S and x, the number of C's is:\n\nIf x < S: then scenario 1 applies. The number of C's is 1 (C=x). Because for scenario 2, S is not x.\n\nIf x = S: then scenario 1 (C=x) and scenario 2 (C >=x) both apply. But scenario 1 is C=x, scenario 2 is C >=x. However, scenario 2 includes C=x. So the total number of C's is (k - x + 1) (since C can be x, x+1, ..., k). But scenario 1 is already included in scenario 2. So the total is (k - x + 1) possibilities.\n\nIf x > S: then scenario 1 requires that C=x and S >=x, which is impossible. Scenario 2 requires S=x, which is also impossible. So no solutions.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor a given S and x, the number of C's is:\n\nif x > S: 0\n\nelif x == S: (k - x + 1) (since C can be from x to k)\n\nelse (x < S): 1 (C=x)\n\nWait, but in the case x < S, scenario 1 applies (C=x). However, scenario 2 would require S=x, which is not the case. So yes, only 1 possibility.\n\nSo, for each x and S, the number of C's is:\n\nif x > S → 0\n\nelif x == S → (k - x + 1)\n\nelse (x < S) → 1\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nWell, for each node, when we compute dp[node][x], we need to iterate over all possible left_val and right_val, compute S = left_val + right_val. Then, for each x, we compute the number of C's that would make min(C, S) = x. Multiply that by the number of ways for left and right children, and accumulate into dp[node][x].\n\nThis seems manageable. The key is that for each node, the DP depends on the DPs of its children, and for each possible combination of left and right values, we can calculate the contribution to the current node's DP.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this DP for the entire tree, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root's children. Finally, the answer is the number of ways where the sum of the max_paths of the root's children (which are the two nodes of length 1) equals exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Generate all the nodes in the tree, ordered by their length from n down to 1. For each node, we process its children first.\n\n2. For each node, compute the DP table for that node. The DP for a node is a dictionary (or array) where dp[x] is the number of ways to assign c_s values in the subtree rooted at this node such that the max_paths for this node is x.\n\n3. For leaves (nodes of length n), the DP is straightforward: dp[x] = 1 if 0 ≤ x ≤ k, else 0.\n\n4. For non-leaves, compute the DP as per the formula discussed earlier.\n\nOnce all DPs are computed, the root's children are the two nodes of length 1. The total m is the sum of their max_paths. So, we need to find the number of ways where the sum of the max_paths of the two nodes is exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute this sum? For the two nodes (left and right children of the root), their DP tables are each for their own max_paths. Let's call them A and B. The total number of ways is the convolution of A and B, i.e., for each a in A's possible values and b in B's possible values, if a + b = f, then multiply the counts and add to the total.\n\nThus, the final answer is the sum over all a and b such that a + b = f of (dp_left[a] * dp_right[b]).\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this DP approach efficiently.\n\nBut for n up to 15, the number of nodes is 2^(n+1) - 2. For each node, the DP table has size up to k+1. However, for n=15 and k=2e5, this would be O( (2^16) * 2e5 ) = 65534 * 2e5 ≈ 1.3e10 operations. Which is way too big for Python to handle in reasonable time.\n\nWait, this is impossible. There's no way to compute this for n=15 and k=2e5 in Python with such a high complexity. Therefore, there must be a smarter way to model this.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. Perhaps there's a way to find that the maximum m is determined by the minimum of certain values. Or perhaps there's a way to model the problem with inclusion-exclusion or generating functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum m is equal to the sum over all nodes of the c_s multiplied by some factor, but I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, think of the constraints for the max_paths. For the max_paths of a node to be x, we must have that x is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the children's max_paths. But for the entire tree, the maximum m is the sum of the two root children's max_paths.\n\nBut perhaps the constraints for the c_s values are that for each node, the c_s must be at least the max_paths of its children. Because, suppose that the sum of the children's max_paths is S. Then, if c_s is less than S, then the max_paths for this node is c_s. However, if c_s is greater than or equal to S, then the max_paths is S. Therefore, the c_s can be any value >= the max_paths of the children. Wait, no. Because the max_paths of the children depends on their own c values and their children. So this seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps the c_s can be any value >= the max_paths of the children, or any value. Wait, no. For example, if the sum of the children's max_paths is S, then the max_paths for the node is min(c_s, S). So for the node's max_paths to be x, there are two possibilities:\n\nEither x = c_s and c_s <= S, or x = S and c_s >= S.\n\nBut in any case",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign values to binary strings such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) and combinatorial counting on a binary tree structure representing all binary strings of lengths from 1 to `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: Represent all binary strings as nodes in a binary tree where each node corresponds to a binary string. Nodes at depth `l` (from 1 to `n`) have two children each, representing the extension by '0' or '1'.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use DP to compute the number of valid configurations for each node. For each node, we maintain a DP table where `dp[x]` represents the number of ways to assign values such that the maximum number of paths through the node is `x`.\n3. **Leaf Nodes**: For leaf nodes (strings of length `n`), the DP is straightforward since their value is directly determined by the assigned `c_s`.\n4. **Non-leaf Nodes**: For non-leaf nodes, compute the DP based on their children's DP values, considering the constraints on the maximum number of paths through the node.\n5. **Combining Results**: After computing the DP tables for all nodes, combine the results from the root's children to determine the total number of valid configurations that yield exactly `f` as the maximum size of the beautiful multiset.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    k = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    f = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    \n    # Precompute all nodes in order of increasing length\n    # We can represent each node by its string, but for efficiency, we can use a trie-like structure\n    # However, for small n (up to 15), we can generate all possible binary strings of length 1..n\n    # and process them in order of increasing length\n    \n    # First, generate all nodes in order of increasing length\n    nodes_by_length = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]  # nodes_by_length[l] contains all nodes of length l\n    for l in range(1, n+1):\n        for s in range(2**l):\n            nodes_by_length[l].append(s)\n    \n    # For each node, we'll store its left and right children\n    # Since each node of length l has children of length l+1\n    # For example, node s (binary string of length l) has children s*0 and s*1\n    # To map s to its children, we can compute:\n    # left_child = s * 2\n    # right_child = s * 2 + 1\n    # But since we are using integers to represent the binary strings, we need to handle that.\n    # For example, for a node with integer value s (representing a binary string of length l), \n    # the left child is s << 1, and the right is (s << 1) | 1\n    \n    # Now, build the DP for each node\n    # We'll use memoization with a dictionary for each node's dp\n    # But since Python is not efficient with nested dictionaries, perhaps we can use arrays\n    \n    # We can process nodes in reverse order, starting from the leaves (length n) up to length 1\n    # For each node, compute its dp array\n    \n    # For each node, we need to know its children\n    # So, for each node of length l < n, we can find its children in the nodes_by_length[l+1]\n    # But how to map a node's value to its children?\n    # Let's think of each node as an integer.

And each of those children's max_paths depends on their own children.\n    \n    # Let's think recursively. For each node, the max_paths is min(c_s, sum_children). So for a node, the max_paths is either c_s or sum_children.\n    \n    # However, the choice of c_s for a node is between 0 and k. So, for a node, the number of ways to choose c_s such that the max_paths is x is:\n    \n    # If x is the sum of children's max_paths, then c_s must be >= x. So the number of choices for c_s is (k - x + 1).\n    \n    # If x is the c_s, then the sum of children's max_paths must be >= x, and c_s is exactly x. So the number of choices for c_s is 1.\n    \n    # So, for a node, the total number of ways to get x as max_paths is:\n    # (number of ways for children to have sum_children = x) * (k - x + 1) + (number of ways for children to have sum_children >= x) * 1\n    \n    # Wait, no. Because for a node, the max_paths is x, which can be achieved in two scenarios:\n    \n    # 1. c_s = x and sum_children >= x. In this case, the number of ways is (number of ways for children to have sum_children >= x) * 1 (since c_s = x).\n    \n    # 2. sum_children = x and c_s >= x. In this case, the number of ways is (number of ways for children to have sum_children = x) * (k - x + 1) (since c_s can be any value from x to k).\n    \n    # However, these two cases might overlap when sum_children = x and c_s = x.\n    \n    # But combining them, the total number of ways for the node to have max_paths x is:\n    # (ways_children_sum_ge_x) * 1 + (ways_children_sum_eq_x) * (k - x + 1) - (ways_children_sum_eq_x) * 1)\n    # Because the overlapping case (sum_children=x and c_s=x) is counted twice.\n    \n    # This simplifies to:\n    # (ways_children_sum_ge_x) * 1 + (ways_children_sum_eq_x) * (k - x)\n    \n    # But this seems complex to compute.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps the original approach is not feasible, and we need to find another way.\n    \n    # Alternative idea: The maximum m is equal to the minimum between the sum of all c_s for the leaves and some other constraints. But I'm not sure.\n    \n    # Given the time, perhaps refer to the example and see for small n.\n    \n    # For example, in the first sample input n=1, k=42, f=2. The answer is 3. The possible c_0 and c_1 are such that their sum is 2. Since for n=1, the max m is c_0 + c_1. So the number of pairs (c_0, c_1) where c_0 + c_1 = 2, and 0 ≤ c_0, c_1 ≤ 42. This is 3 (0+2, 1+1, 2+0).\n    \n    # This suggests that for n=1, the answer is the number of ways to choose c_0 and c_1 such that their sum is f, and each is between 0 and k.\n    \n    # For general n, the max m is the sum of the max_paths of the root's children. Each of these is determined by their subtree.\n    \n    # However, it's unclear how to generalize this.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach, but optimize it by noting that for each node, the DP can be represented as a list, and we can use memoization with recursion.\n    \n    # Let's proceed with the code, even if it may not pass for large n and k.\n    \n    # But for the given constraints, n is up to 15, and k up to 2e5. Even for n=15, the number of nodes is 65534. For each node, the DP requires iterating over all possible combinations of left and right values. This is computationally intensive, but perhaps manageable with optimizations.\n    \n    # Let's proceed with the code.\n    \n    # First, generate all nodes in order from length n downto 1\n    # For each node, store its left and right children\n    \n    # We can represent nodes as integers, where the integer represents the binary string in binary form.\n    \n    # For example, for length 1, 0 and 1.\n    # For length 2, 00 (0), 01 (1), 10 (2), 11 (3), etc.\n    \n    # So for a node with value s of length l, its children are 2*s and 2*s + 1, which are of length l+1.\n    \n    # Now, we'll use memoization with a dictionary for each node's dp.\n    \n    # However, for Python, even with n=15, it's challenging.
