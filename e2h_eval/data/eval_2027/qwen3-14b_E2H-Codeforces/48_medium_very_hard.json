He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. Oh right, and there's some edge cases to handle. Let's think about the steps needed here.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the second line is the number c in base a. So the plan is: convert c from base a to decimal (integer), then convert that integer to base b, which could be a regular base or Roman numerals.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n1. Convert the input string c (in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. If the target base is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n3. Else, convert the decimal integer to base b as a string, using letters for digits above 9 (like A for 10, etc.)\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFor step 1: converting c from base a. The input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, if a is 10 and c is '001', it's 1. How to handle that? Well, for each character in the string, we can convert it to its value. But note that for bases larger than 10, the letters A-Z are used. Wait, but the input c is given in base a. So the input c may contain digits from 0 to a-1. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F. But the problem says that the input c may contain letters? Wait, the problem says that the input is a non-negative integer in base a. But how is that represented? For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A, B? Or maybe the input uses letters for digits >=10? Like, for example, if the input is 'A', that represents 10 in base a. But the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3.\n\nSo, the input c is a string that represents a number in base a. So, for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9, A-F (uppercase?), but the problem says that the input is given as a string. However, the problem says that in the case where Roman numerals are involved, the input c is guaranteed to be non-zero and less than or equal to 3000 in decimal. But for other cases, the input c is up to 1e15 in decimal.\n\nSo, to convert c from base a to decimal, I need to process each digit in the string. For example, if the input is 'A', then in base a (say 12), it's 10. But how are the digits represented in the input? The problem says that the input is a non-negative integer in base a. So, for bases greater than 10, the digits would be represented with letters. For example, in base 12, the digits would be 0-9, A, B. But the problem says that the input c may contain letters? Well, the problem says that the input is given as a string, and the note says that for bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So I think that when converting from base a, the input c's digits can be 0-9 and letters A-Z (uppercase?), representing values 10 and up.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a string. So for example, if a is 12, then the input could be something like 'B' which is 11 in decimal. So when processing the input, I need to convert each character in the string to its corresponding value. So for each character in the string, if it's a digit, then it's the value. If it's a letter, then it's 10 + (letter - 'A').\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input c is given as a non-negative integer in base a. So the input c may have letters only if a is larger than 10. So, for example, if a is 10, then the input c can't have letters. But if a is 16, then the input can have letters up to F.\n\nSo, the first step is to parse the input string c into a decimal integer. Let's think about writing a helper function to do that.\n\nSo, for the input c, each character is a digit in base a. So, for example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So the code needs to process each character, convert to its numerical value, then compute the decimal value.\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the input has letters in lowercase? Well, the problem says that the input is given as a string. But the sample input shows that in the third example, input is '4' which is converted to IV. So perhaps the input c is given with uppercase letters? Or maybe the problem expects that the input is in uppercase letters. But since the problem says that the input is given as a string, perhaps the code should handle both upper and lower case? However, the problem says that the input is correct, so perhaps the input c is properly formatted with uppercase letters for digits above 9. But the problem statement says that the input is given as a non-negative integer in base a, which may contain leading zeros. So for example, in base 16, the input could be 'A' or 'a'? Well, the problem probably expects that the input is in uppercase letters. But since the problem's examples don't have such cases, perhaps the code should process the input as uppercase letters. But in practice, perhaps the code should convert the input to uppercase first, to handle any case.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input examples, for example, the input 'A' is given in the fifth example. So in the input, the code must read the string as is. So, for example, if the input is 'a', then in base 12, that would be 10. So the code should process the letters regardless of their case. So, the code should convert the character to uppercase, then compute the value.\n\nSo, the helper function for converting from base a to decimal is:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            d = int(ch)\n        else:\n            d = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + d\n    return num\n\nBut what about leading zeros? Well, the problem says that the input may have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, '001' in base 10 is 1.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then we need to convert it to base b. Now, if b is 'R', then we need to convert the decimal number to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b, using letters for digits >=10.\n\nSo, the next part is to handle converting the decimal number to base b (if not R) or to Roman numerals.\n\nLet me think about the conversion to base b. For example, if the decimal number is 10, and the target base is 16, then it's 'A'. For base 2, it's 1010.\n\nThe steps for converting a decimal number to another base:\n\n- Handle 0? Well, the problem says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the input can be zero? Wait, the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer. So if c is zero, then the output would be zero. But the note says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is not zero. So for other cases, the input can be zero. But the problem says that the input c may be zero, but when Roman is involved, it's not zero.\n\nSo, when converting to base b (non-R), we need to handle zero. For example, if the decimal number is zero, output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must omit leading zeros. So for zero, the output is '0'.\n\nSo for the conversion to base b (non-R):\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            # convert to letter: 10 -> A, 11->B, etc.\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    # digits are in reverse order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but what if the input is zero? Then the function returns '0'.\n\nBut in the case where the input is zero and the target base is R, but the problem says that when R is involved, the input is not zero. So we don't have to handle that case.\n\nNow, the Roman numeral conversion. How to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nRoman numerals have specific rules. The standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For example:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nSo the function would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is guaranteed to be <= 3000 and not zero. So this function should handle numbers from 1 to 3000.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input. The first line is two elements: a and b. But b can be 'R'. The second line is the string c.\n\nSo for each test case (the problem's input seems to have multiple test cases, but looking at the sample input, perhaps the input is given as multiple lines. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example input, it's given as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut the actual input is read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (or R). The next line contains the number c.\n\nSo each test case is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of input lines, but the problem says that the input is read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case per run. Wait, no, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as multiple lines, but perhaps the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the sample input would be multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given as two lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case per run. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the code is supposed to read two lines of input. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. Wait, the sample input shows that the outputs are a list of outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description is unclear. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the code is supposed to read two lines of input. But in the sample input, there are multiple test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as two lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nSecond test case is:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nThird test case is:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nEtc. So the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how does the code know when to stop reading input? Because in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to read until EOF.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the outputs are given as a list of outputs, which suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, reading from stdin, perhaps the code reads all lines at once and processes them in pairs. But the problem's input format is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWhich suggests that each test case is two lines. So the code needs to process multiple test cases. But how to read them? Because in programming competition problems, the input is usually given as multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines, and the code needs to read until EOF.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, it's not clear. However, looking at the sample input, the code must read multiple test cases. But the original problem's input description says \"the first line contains...\" which implies one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, which suggests that the code must read multiple test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that the input is as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, which is confusing. However, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. But that's not possible. For example, in the sample input, the first test case's output is '1', which corresponds to converting 1 (base 10) to base 2, which is 1.\n\nBut how to reconcile that with the sample input being a list of test cases? Maybe the problem's sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the problem's purposes, is one test case. However, that would not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's input is multiple test cases, and the code is supposed to process all of them. But how?\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me check the problem's sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nEach of these entries is a separate test case. So for example, the first test case is:\n\nInput lines:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nSecond test case:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nOutput is V.\n\nSo the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. So the code should read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nBut in practice, how to read that in Python? For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them two at a time.\n\nBut in programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, and the code is supposed to read until EOF. So for example, the code can read lines until there are no more lines left.\n\nSo, for example, the code can read all lines into a list, then process them in pairs. For example, lines[0] and lines[1] form the first test case, lines[2] and lines[3] form the second, etc.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all lines from stdin as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n   process lines[i] and lines[i+1]\n\nBut perhaps the input is such that each test case is two lines. So the code must read two lines per test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description is ambiguous. However, the sample input and output suggest that multiple test cases are present.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement, the user says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code must read from stdin. So, for example, the code must process multiple test cases. But how to determine when to stop? Well, the code can read all lines until EOF, and process them in pairs.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nFor each pair of lines (a and b line, then c line):\n\n   process the test case.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, the first line is a and b, the second is c, then third line is a and b again, fourth is c, etc.\n\nSo the code can process the input as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        # process a_b_line and c_line\n\nBut what if the number of lines is odd? Well, the problem says that the input is correct, so it's guaranteed that the lines are even.\n\nNow, the code for each test case:\n\nParse a and b from the first line. For example, split into parts. For example, a_b_line.split() gives two elements. The first is a, the second is b. But b can be 'R'.\n\nThen, parse c_line as the string c.\n\nOnce we have a, b, c, then:\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal.\n\nIf b is 'R', convert decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert decimal to base b, using letters for digits >=10.\n\nThen output the result.\n\nNow, handling the conversion from base a to decimal. For example, in the case of a=5, c=4, then the decimal is 4. If a=5 and c is '4', then decimal is 4. If a=12 and c is 'A', then decimal is 10.\n\nNow, the code for converting c to decimal. Let's implement the function.\n\nBut what about leading zeros? For example, if c is '000', then it's zero. Which is handled correctly.\n\nNow, for the case when the target is Roman numerals, the decimal number is between 1 and 3000.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the functions:\n\nto_decimal(s, base): converts s from base to decimal.\n\ndecimal_to_base(n, base): converts decimal to base, returns string.\n\ndecimal_to_roman(n): returns the roman numeral.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut let's think about possible errors.\n\nFor example, when converting from base a, the input c may have characters that are invalid for the base. However, the problem says that the input is valid. So we don't need to handle that.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing to_decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            d = int(ch)\n        else:\n            d = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + d\n    return num\n\nBut what if the base is 1? Well, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25, except for b which can be R. So the base a is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nNow, for the decimal_to_base function:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nBut what if the input is zero? The function returns '0', which is correct.\n\nNow, the Roman function.\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nFor each test case:\n\na_b_line = lines[i]\n\nsplit into parts. For example, parts = a_b_line.split()\n\na = int(parts[0])\n\nb_part = parts[1]\n\nif b_part == 'R':\n\n   target is Roman.\n\nelse:\n\n   target base is int(b_part)\n\nThen, c_line is the string.\n\nConvert c_line to decimal using to_decimal(c_line, a).\n\nThen, if target is R, convert decimal to roman.\n\nElse, convert decimal to base b_part.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the case where the target base is 1? Well, according to the problem statement, the target base is between 2 and 25, except for R. So no problem.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nConvert c (1 in base 10) to decimal is 1. Then convert to base 2: 1. Output is '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nConvert 5 from base 16 to decimal: 5. Convert to Roman: V.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nConvert 4 from base 5 to decimal: 4. Convert to Roman: IV.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\nConvert 1111001 in base 2 to decimal: let's see. The binary is 1111001 which is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 +32 +16 +8 + 1 = 121. Then convert to base 2: same as input, 1111001. Output is same.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA\n\nConvert A (which is 10 in base 12) to decimal: 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. So output is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the converted number is zero, output is '0'. For other cases, leading zeros are omitted. For example, if converting decimal 0 to base 2, output is '0'.\n\nAnother test case: input is a=10, b=10, c=0. Output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the input is not zero. So for other cases, zero is allowed.\n\nNow, what about when converting to base b which is larger than 10. For example, decimal number 10, base 11: output is 'A'.\n\nAnother example: decimal 35, base 16: 23 (hex), which is '23'.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal is zero? The code returns '0'.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut need to handle the case where the input c is zero. For example, if c is '0' in base a, then decimal is zero. Then, if target is base b (non-R), output is '0'.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when converting to base b, the function returns '0' when n is zero. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement all functions and read input accordingly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            d = int(ch)\n        else:\n            d = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + d\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        parts = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(parts[0])\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        # process c_line\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b_part)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if the input has multiple test cases, and the lines are not even? But the problem says that the input is correct, so we can assume that.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input lines:\n\nFirst line: '10 2' → a=10, b=2. c_line is '1'. decimal is 1. converted to base 2 is '1'.\n\nSecond line: '16 R' → a=16, b=R. c_line is '5' → decimal is 5 → Roman is 'V'.\n\nThird line: '5 R' → a=5, c_line is '4' → decimal is 4 → Roman is 'IV'.\n\nFourth line: '2 2' → a=2, c_line is '1111001' → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nFifth line: '12 13' → a=12, c_line is 'A' → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: input is '2 10\\n10' → which is 2 in base 2 → decimal is 2 → converted to base 10 is '2'.\n\nAnother case: input is '10 R\\n3' → decimal is 3 → Roman is 'III'.\n\nWhat about a case where the decimal is zero? For example, input is '10 10\\n0' → output is '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the input is not zero. So the code doesn't need to handle that case for Roman.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the converted value is zero, output is '0'. For other cases, the code returns the correct string without leading zeros. For example, converting 5 to base 10 is '5'.\n\nNow, what about when converting to base 1? Well, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25, so that's not possible.\n\nNow, what about when the input c is zero and the target base is not Roman? For example, a=10, b=2, c=0 → output is '0'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the input is in a base higher than 10 and contains letters. For example, a=16, c='A' → decimal is 10.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=12, c='B', which is 11 in decimal. Converting to base 13: 11 is 'B' in base 13. So output is 'B'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where the decimal is zero, output is '0'.\n\nCase where the target base is 2 and the decimal is 0 → output is '0'.\n\nCase where the decimal is 1, target base is 2 → '1'.\n\nCase where the decimal is 10, target base is 16 → 'A'.\n\nCase where the decimal is 3000 → Roman is MMM.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base 25, which uses letters up to O (since 10 is A, 15 is F, 20 is K, 24 is O).\n\nBut the code handles that.\n\nNow, what about when converting to base 25 and the number is 25? Then 25 in base 25 is 10 → '10'?\n\nWait, 25 in base 25 is 1*25^1 + 0*25^0 → so the decimal number is 25. So converting decimal 25 to base 25 would be 10. So the code would generate '10'.\n\nYes. Because 25 divided by 25 is 1, remainder 0. Then digits are [0], then 1. So reversed gives '10'.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother example: decimal 26, base 25 → 1*25 + 1 → '11'.\n\nSo code works.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's write the code as per the problem's requirements. Also, note that the code must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nBut in the code above, the main function reads all lines and processes them in pairs. So that should work.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function should handle that.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), which reads all lines, including empty ones. But the problem says that the input is correct, so each test case has two lines.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which could be a standard numerical base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base `b`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert from Base `a` to Decimal**: This step involves interpreting the input string `c` as a number in base `a` and converting it to its decimal equivalent.\n2. **Convert from Decimal to Target Base `b`**:\n   - If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a standard mapping of values to Roman symbols.\n   - If `b` is a numerical base, convert the decimal number to the specified base using standard base conversion techniques, with letters used for digits greater than 9.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            d = int(ch)\n        else:\n            d = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + d\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        parts = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(parts[0])\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b_part)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines. Each pair of lines represents a test case, where the first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, and the second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input string `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and converting it to its corresponding value.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: \n   - If the target base is 'R', the function `decimal_to_roman` converts the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs.\n   - If the target base is a numerical value, the function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the specified base, using letters for digits greater than 9.\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code ensures that leading zeros are omitted in the output, except for the case when the number is zero, which is directly returned as '0'.",
