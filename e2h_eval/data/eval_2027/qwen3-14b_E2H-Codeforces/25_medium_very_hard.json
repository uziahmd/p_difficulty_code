При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that some positive number of characters (but less than the length of s) are overlapping. Also, the full overlap (where one message is entirely on top of the other) isn't considered an error. Similarly, just concatenating two messages without any overlap isn't considered an error either.\n\nSo, the task is to check if the given string t can be formed by such an error. If yes, output YES and a possible s. Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, the key idea here is that the original string t must be formed by merging two copies of s. So, the length of t must be equal to 2*len(s) - k, where k is the overlap length. Since k is between 1 and len(s)-1, inclusive.\n\nBut since we have two copies of s, the merged string would be s concatenated with s, but with some overlapping part. For example, if s is 'abc' and the overlap is 1 character, then the merged string would be 'abca' (overlap of 'a').\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first message is s, and the second message is also s. When they merge, the end of the first overlaps with the beginning of the second. So for example, if the first ends with 'a' and the second starts with 'a', they merge into a single string that's s[0...n-k-1] + s[k...n], where n is the length of s. Because the overlapping part is k characters. So the total length of t would be len(s) + len(s) -k = 2n -k. So for the given t, we need to find a possible n and k such that 2n -k = len(t), and that the overlapping part is valid.\n\nBut how do we find s?\n\nAlternatively, the merged string t must be such that there exists a k (1 <=k < len(s)) where the first part of t (the first s) and the second part (the second s) overlap correctly.\n\nBut since the original s is the same for both parts, perhaps we can find possible candidates for s by considering possible splits of t into a form where the first part and the second part share some overlapping part.\n\nLet me think. Let's assume that the original string t was formed by merging two copies of s. Then, the length of t must be 2n -k, where n is the length of s and k is the overlap. But since k can be from 1 to n-1, then 2n -k can be from n+1 to 2n-1.\n\nSo the length of t must be between n+1 and 2n-1. However, since n is the length of s, which is unknown, perhaps we can express this in terms of len(t).\n\nLet me denote len(t) as m. Then, m = 2n -k. Since k is between 1 and n-1, substituting gives:\n\nm = 2n -k → k = 2n -m.\n\nBut since 1 ≤k ≤n-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2n -m ≤n-1.\n\nRearranging:\n\nFrom 2n -m ≥1 → 2n ≥ m +1 → n ≥ (m +1)/2.\n\nFrom 2n -m ≤n-1 → 2n -m ≤n-1 → n ≤ m-1.\n\nSo combining these two inequalities: (m+1)/2 ≤n ≤m-1.\n\nBut since n must be an integer, we can find possible values of n in this range.\n\nMoreover, since m = 2n -k and k is positive, then m must be less than 2n. Which is always true because k is at least 1. Also, since k is less than n, m = 2n -k > 2n - (n-1) = n+1. So m must be greater than n+1? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIf k is between 1 and n-1, then m = 2n -k. So when k is 1, m = 2n-1. When k is n-1, m = 2n - (n-1) = n +1. So m ranges from n+1 to 2n-1. Therefore, for a given m (the length of t), possible n must satisfy n+1 ≤ m ≤ 2n-1. Solving for n:\n\nFrom m ≥ n+1 → n ≤ m-1.\n\nFrom m ≤ 2n-1 → n ≥ (m+1)/2.\n\nSo possible n's are integers between ceil( (m+1)/2 ) and m-1, inclusive.\n\nSo for example, if the length of t is m, then for each possible n in this range, we can check if there exists a k such that k = 2n -m, and that 1 ≤k ≤n-1. Since k is calculated as 2n -m, we can check if that value is in the allowed range.\n\nOnce we have possible n's, for each n, we can check if the first part of t (of length n) and the second part (of length n) can overlap in such a way that their overlapping part is exactly k characters.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nLet me think. The merged string t would be the first s (length n) and the second s (length n) merged with an overlap of k characters. So the first s's last k characters must be equal to the second s's first k characters. But since both are s, the first s's last k characters must be equal to the first s's first k characters. Wait, no. Because the second s is the same as the first s. So the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s and the first k characters of the second s. Since both s's are the same, this means that the first s's last k characters must be equal to its first k characters. Therefore, the string s must have a prefix of length k equal to a suffix of length k.\n\nSo, for each candidate n (possible length of s), we can compute k = 2n -m. Then, check if the first k characters of s (which is the first n characters of t) equals the last k characters of s (the last k characters of the first n characters of t). But wait, the s here would be the original message. But how do we get s?\n\nWait, the merged string t is formed by taking the first s, overlapping with the second s. So the merged string is s[0 ... n -k -1] + s[k ... n-1] + s[k ... n-1] ?\n\nNo, wait. Let me think again. Suppose s is of length n. The first message is s, the second message is s. They overlap by k characters. So the merged string would be s concatenated with s, but with the overlapping part removed once. So the merged string is s + s[k:] (since the first s's last k characters overlap with the second s's first k characters). So the total length is len(s) + len(s) -k = 2n -k.\n\nBut the merged string t is given. So t must be equal to s + s[k:].\n\nBut since s is the original message, then the first part of t is s, and the second part is s[k:] (but how does that fit into t?).\n\nAlternatively, the entire merged string t must be equal to s + s[k:] (since the first s is fully present except for the overlapping part, which is covered by the second s). So the length of t is 2n -k, which is m.\n\nBut how can we find s from t? Well, s must be a string of length n such that when you take the first n characters of t (s), and then the next part of t (from position n -k onwards) must be equal to the s[k:] part. But since the entire merged string is s concatenated with s[k:], then the entire string t must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:]. Therefore, the entire string t must be equal to s + s[k:]. But since the length of t is 2n -k, the s[k:] part has length n -k. So the length of t is n + (n -k) = 2n -k, which matches.\n\nBut how can we find s? Well, the first part of t is s. But perhaps not. Because when the two s's are merged, the first part of t is s, but the overlapping part may be in the middle. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the first s is s, and the second s is s. The overlapping is k characters. So the merged string is s[0 ... n -k -1] + s[k ... n-1] + s[k ... n-1]. Wait, no. Let me think of an example. Suppose s is 'abcd', and k is 2. Then the first s is 'abcd', the second is 'abcd'. The overlapping is 2 characters. So the first s's last 2 characters are 'cd', and the second's first 2 are 'ab'? No, that's not matching. Wait, the overlapping can only happen if the last k characters of the first s match the first k of the second s. So in this example, for k=2, the first s ends with 'cd' and the second s starts with 'ab' — they don't match. So that's not possible. So the example would be if s is 'abab', and k=2. Then the first s ends with 'ab', and the second starts with 'ab', so overlapping gives 'abab' (the first s) merged with the second s (abab) with overlapping 2 chars. So the merged string would be 'abab' + 'ab' (since the overlapping part is 2 characters, the second s contributes the remaining 2 characters after the overlapping part). So the merged string is 'ababab' (length 6). Which is 4 + 4 - 2 = 6. So yes.\n\nSo for the merged string t, the first part is the first s (length n), but overlapped with the second s. But in reality, the merged string t is s concatenated with s[k:]. So the entire string t is s + s[k:]. Therefore, the length of t is n + (n -k) = 2n -k. So for a given t, if we can find an n and k such that this holds, and that the first n characters of t is s, and the rest of the string (from position n -k onwards) is s[k:].\n\nBut how can we find s? Well, s would be the first n characters of t. But we also need to check that the rest of t (after the first n characters) is equal to s[k:] (i.e., the part of s starting from index k). But the rest of the string is t[n:] (since the total length is 2n -k). Let me think:\n\nt = s + s[k:] → len(t) = n + (n -k) = 2n -k → t is of length m = 2n -k.\n\nSo for the given t, if we suppose that s is the first n characters, then the rest of the string (t[n:]) must be equal to s[k:] (since s[k:] is the part of s after the first k characters). But the length of t[n:] is m -n = (2n -k) -n = n -k, which is exactly the length of s[k:] (since s has length n, s[k:] has length n -k). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the steps to check for a given n would be:\n\n1. Compute k = 2n - m. Since m is the length of t, and n is the candidate length for s.\n\n2. Check that k is between 1 and n-1 (inclusive). Because the problem says that the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message.\n\n3. Then, check if the first n characters of t (call it s_candidate) has its prefix of length k equal to its suffix of length k. Because the overlapping part requires that the last k characters of the first s_candidate (which is the same as the first s) is equal to the first k characters of the second s_candidate (which is the same as the first s_candidate's first k characters). Wait, no. Wait, the overlapping part is that the last k characters of the first s_candidate must equal the first k characters of the second s_candidate. But since the second s_candidate is the same as the first, this implies that the last k characters of s_candidate must equal the first k characters of s_candidate. So, s_candidate's prefix of length k must equal its suffix of length k.\n\nSo, for example, if s_candidate is 'ababa', and k is 2, then the first two characters are 'ab', the last two are 'ba' — not equal. But if k is 3, then the first three is 'aba', last three is 'aba' — equal.\n\nSo, once we have s_candidate (the first n characters of t), we need to check whether the first k characters of s_candidate equal the last k characters of s_candidate. If that is true, then the merged string would be s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:], which is exactly the t string. So, the t string should be s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:], which is the same as the first n characters plus the rest of the string. But how do we check that?\n\nBecause t is supposed to be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. So, the entire string t must be equal to that. But since the length of t is m = 2n -k, then the length of s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] is n + (n -k) = 2n -k, which matches. So, the t string must be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. Therefore, the t string should be equal to the first n characters of t (s_candidate) plus s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut since the s_candidate is the first n characters of t, the rest of the string (t[n:]) must be equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo, for a given n, we can compute k = 2n - m. Then check if 1 <=k <=n-1. If yes, then check if the first k characters of s_candidate (s_candidate[0:k]) equals the last k characters of s_candidate (s_candidate[-k:]). Also, check if the rest of the string (t[n:]) equals s_candidate[k:]. If all those conditions are met, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor the given t, compute m = len(t). Then iterate over possible n values from ceil((m+1)/2) to m-1 (inclusive). For each n:\n\n- compute k = 2n -m.\n\n- check if 1 <=k <=n-1.\n\nIf yes, proceed.\n\nThen, take s_candidate as the first n characters of t.\n\nCheck if the first k characters of s_candidate == last k characters of s_candidate.\n\nAlso, check if the rest of the string (t[n:]) is equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf both conditions are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the possible n's work, then return NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible edge cases.\n\nFor example, in the sample input 'abcabc', the output is NO. Let's see why. The length of t is 6.\n\nPossible n's are between (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4, up to m-1 =5.\n\nSo n can be 4,5.\n\nCheck n=4: m=6, k=2*4 -6 = 8-6=2. Check if 1<=2 <=3 (yes). Then s_candidate is first 4 characters: 'abca'.\n\nCheck if first 2 characters of s_candidate ('ab') equals last 2 ('ca')? No. So invalid.\n\nThen check n=5. k=2*5 -6 = 4. Check if 1<=4 <=4 (since n-1 is 4). So yes. Then s_candidate is first 5 characters: 'abcab'.\n\nCheck if first 4 characters of s_candidate is 'abca' and last 4 is 'bcab'? Not equal. So invalid. Hence, no solution, output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (the first sample input). The output is YES with s being 'abrakadabra'.\n\nLet me compute m = len(t). Let's count the letters. The input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let's see, the original example says that the first case is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the merged string. The original s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Then m = len(t) is 2*11 -k. Let's say k=1. Then m=22-1=21. Let's check the length of the first input. The input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nOriginal s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). Merged with k=1: the merged string is s + s[1:] → length 11 + 10 =21. So the input has length 21. So m=21.\n\nSo for n=11, possible. Let's compute for n=11. m=21. k= 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. Which is between 1 and 10 (n-1=10). So valid. Then s_candidate is first 11 letters of t. Let's see: the first 11 letters of the input is 'abrakadabra' (the original s). Then check if first k=1 character of s_candidate is 'a' and last 1 is 'a' — yes. Then check if the rest of the string (t[11:]) equals s_candidate[1:] (s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra'). The t[11:] is 'abrakadabra' — wait, no. Wait the original merged string is s + s[1:]. So for s_candidate being 'abrakadabra', the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → which is 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → which is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 11 + 10 = 21). So t[11:] is 'brakadabra' (the s_candidate[1:] part). But the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — the first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra', then the next 10 letters are 'brakadabra'? Let me check:\n\nOriginal input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — split into first 11 letters: 'abrakadabra', then the next part is 'abrakadabra' (but that's 11 letters again). Wait, no. Wait the merged string is s + s[1:] which is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. So the input is 21 letters long. So t[11:] is the last 10 letters. Which would be 'brakadabra'.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let me count the letters. Let me write it out:\n\nOriginal s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). Merged with k=1: the merged string is s + s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → which is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. So the merged string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — which is the first input. So the first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra', the next 10 are 'brakadabra'.\n\nSo for the check, t[11:] is 'brakadabra', which is s_candidate[1:] → which is correct. So the check passes.\n\nSo the code would find that for n=11, the conditions are met, and return YES and the s_candidate.\n\nAnother example is the second sample input: 'acacacaca' → output is 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\nLet's see. The length m is 9. Possible n's are from (9+1)/2 =5 up to 8.\n\nSo possible n's are 5,6,7,8.\n\nCheck for each n:\n\nn=5 → k=2*5 -9 =10-9=1. Check 1<=1<=4 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 letters: 'acaca'.\n\nCheck if first 1 character (a) equals last 1 (a) → yes.\n\nCheck if the rest of the string (t[5:] is 'cacaca') equals s_candidate[1:] → 'caca'.\n\nWait, s_candidate is 'acaca', s_candidate[1:] is 'caca'. But t[5:] is 'cacaca' (length 4?), wait m=9, n=5. So t[5:] is length 9-5=4. So 'cacaca'? Let me check the original input. The input is 'acacacaca' which is 9 letters. For n=5, the first 5 letters are 'acaca', then the rest is 'cacaca'? Wait, the original input is:\n\nIndices 0-4: a c a c a\n\nIndices 5-8: c a c a → which is 4 letters. So t[5:] is 'caca'.\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'caca' (since s_candidate is 'acaca' → [1:] is 'caca'). So t[5:] is 'caca' which equals s_candidate[1:]. So the conditions are satisfied. So this is a valid case. So the answer is YES and 'acaca'.\n\nBut the sample output says that another possible answer is 'acacaca' (length 7). Let's check that.\n\nFor n=7, m=9. k=2*7 -9= 14-9=5. Check 1<=5<=6 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 7 letters: 'acacaca'.\n\nCheck if first 5 characters of s_candidate is 'acaca' and last 5 is 'cacaca'? Wait, s_candidate is 'acacaca' (length 7). The first 5 is 'acaca' (positions 0-4), the last 5 is positions 2-6: 'cacaca'. Are these equal? 'acaca' vs 'cacaca'? No. So that's not equal. So why is the sample output allowing 'acacaca'?\n\nWait maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait the sample input is 'acacacaca' (length 9). The output says that 'acaca' is a possible s, but also 'acacaca' is possible. Let me check for n=7.\n\nn=7, m=9 → k=2*7 -9 = 5. So k=5. Check if 1<=5 <=6 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 7 letters: 'acacaca'.\n\nCheck if the first 5 letters of s_candidate (positions 0-4) equal the last 5 letters (positions 2-6). Let's see:\n\nFirst 5 letters: a c a c a → 'acaca'\n\nLast 5 letters: positions 2-6: a c a c a → same as first 5 letters? Wait, the s_candidate is 'acacaca' (indices 0-6):\n\nindex 0: a\n\n1: c\n\n2: a\n\n3: c\n\n4: a\n\n5: c\n\n6: a\n\nSo the last 5 letters are indices 2-6: a c a c a → which is 'acaca' — same as the first 5 letters. So yes, the prefix and suffix of length 5 are equal. Then, check if t[7:] equals s_candidate[5:].\n\nt[7:] is the substring starting at index 7. But the length of t is 9. So t[7:] is 'ca' (positions 7 and 8). s_candidate[5:] is s_candidate from index 5 to end: 'ca' (since s_candidate is 'acacaca' → indexes 5 and 6 are 'c' and 'a'). So yes, t[7:] is 'ca' which equals s_candidate[5:]. Therefore, this is valid. So the code would find this as well.\n\nSo for n=5 and n=7, both are valid. So the code can return any of them.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all possible n values in the range [(m+1)/2, m-1], check for each n, compute k, check the constraints, then check the prefix/suffix equality and the t[n:] equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string t. Then compute m = len(t).\n\nThen, for each possible n in the range from ceil((m+1)/2) to m-1 inclusive.\n\nBut how to compute the lower bound. For example, (m+1)/2 may not be integer. So for example, m=9 → (9+1)/2 =5 → which is integer. For m=8, (8+1)/2=4.5 → ceil is 5.\n\nSo the lower bound is (m +1 +1)//2? Or perhaps using math.ceil((m+1)/2). But since in Python, integer division can be handled with math.ceil.\n\nBut perhaps we can compute the lower bound as (m +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example, m=9 → (9+1)/2=5 → floor is 5. So lower bound is 5.\n\nFor m=8 → (8+1)/2=4.5 → ceil is 5.\n\nSo in code, the lower bound is (m +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, (m +1) divided by 2, rounded up. Which can be written as (m +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, math.ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo for (m+1)/2, the ceil is (m+1 + 2-1) // 2 → (m+2) // 2.\n\nYes. So the lower bound is (m + 2) // 2.\n\nSo for n in range from lower_bound to m-1 inclusive.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor n in range( (m + 1) // 2 + ... ? Wait, perhaps better to compute lower_n = (m +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, let me think again. The lower bound for n is ceil( (m+1)/2 ). For example:\n\nm=9 → (9+1)/2 =5 → ceil is 5 → lower_n=5.\n\nm=8 → (8+1)/2=4.5 → ceil is 5 → lower_n=5.\n\nWhich is (m +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nYes. Because (m +1) / 2 → ceil is (m +1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, (m+1 +1) // 2 is (m+2)//2. Let me check for m=9: (9+2)//2 = 11//2=5.5 → 5 as integer division. Wait, in Python, 11//2 is 5. So for m=9, (m+2)//2 is 5.5 → no, 9+2 is 11, divided by 2 is 5.5, but integer division in Python truncates towards negative infinity. So 11//2 is 5. Which is correct for the lower bound.\n\nFor m=8, (8+2)//2 = 10//2=5 → correct.\n\nFor m=5, (5+1)/2=3 → ceil(3) is 3. (m+2)//2 = (5+2)/2=3.5 → 3.5 in integer division is 3. So yes.\n\nSo the lower_n is (m + 2) // 2.\n\nWait, for m=6: (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4. (6+2)//2 is 8//2=4 → correct.\n\nYes. So the code can loop n from lower_n to m-1 inclusive.\n\nOnce that is done, for each n, compute k = 2n -m. Then check if 1<=k <=n-1. If not, skip.\n\nElse, check the s_candidate.\n\ns_candidate is t[:n].\n\nCheck if the first k characters of s_candidate == last k characters of s_candidate.\n\nThen check if t[n:] == s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf both conditions are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nRead t from input. Then m = len(t).\n\nIf m is 0, but according to the problem statement, input is non-empty.\n\nThen, for n in range( (m+2)//2 , m ):\n\nWait, the upper limit is m-1. So in Python, the range is from lower_n to m (exclusive). So:\n\nfor n in range( lower_n, m ):\n\nBut wait, in Python, range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, to loop from a to b inclusive, use range(a, b+1).\n\nBut in this case, the upper bound is m-1. So:\n\nlower_n = (m + 2) // 2\n\nfor n in range(lower_n, m):\n\nWait, if m is 5, then m-1 is 4. So for lower_n= (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5 in integer division is 3 (since 7//2=3). So for m=5, lower_n is 3, and the loop is from 3 to m (5) → but m is 5, and the upper bound is m. So the range is 3,4,5? No, because range(3,5) is 3,4. Which is correct (n can be 3,4).\n\nYes. So the code:\n\nfor n in range( lower_n, m ):\n\nBut in Python, the upper bound is exclusive. So for example, if m is 5, and we want to loop up to m-1=4, then range(lower_n, m) will do that.\n\nSo:\n\nlower_n = (m + 2) // 2\n\nfor n in range(lower_n, m):\n\n   compute k = 2 * n - m\n\n   if k < 1 or k >=n:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       s_candidate = t[:n]\n\n       if s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]:\n\n           if t[n:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n               print(\"YES\")\n\n               print(s_candidate)\n\n               exit()\n\nOnce all possibilities are checked, if none found, print \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, what about the case where multiple n's are possible? The code returns the first one found. Which is acceptable since any correct answer is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' (length 9). Let's see.\n\nlower_n is (9+2)//2 = 11//2=5. So n ranges from 5 to 8 (since m=9, range(5,9) → 5,6,7,8).\n\nFor n=5:\n\nk=2*5 -9 = 1. Check 1<=1 <=4 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[:5] = 'acaca'.\n\nCheck s_candidate[:1] is 'a', s_candidate[-1:] is 'a' → equal. Then check t[5:] is 'cacaca'? Wait, t is 'acacacaca' → indices 0-8. t[5:] is from index 5 to end: 'c a c a' → 'caca' (length 4). s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'caca'. So yes. So condition is met. So return 'acaca'.\n\nSo code would output this, which is correct.\n\nAnother possible n is 7, which would also be checked. But since the code returns the first valid n, it may return 5 first.\n\nBut the sample says that 'acacaca' is also a possible answer. So the code may return either, depending on which n is checked first.\n\nBut the code is correct as long as it returns any valid s.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input 'abababab' (output is YES and 'ababab').\n\nLet me check. The input is 'abababab' → length 8.\n\nlower_n is (8+2)//2 = 5. So n ranges from 5 to 7.\n\nCheck for n=5:\n\nk=2*5 -8 = 2. Check 1<=2 <=4 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 letters: 'ababa'.\n\nCheck first 2 letters 'ab' and last 2 letters 'ba' → not equal. So invalid.\n\nn=6:\n\nk= 2*6 -8 = 4. Check 1<=4 <=5 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'.\n\nCheck first 4 letters 'abab' and last 4 letters 'baba'? No. So invalid.\n\nn=7:\n\nk=2*7 -8 =6. Check 1<=6 <=6 (since n-1 is 6). So yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 7 letters: 'abababa'.\n\nCheck first 6 letters: 'ababab' and last 6 letters: 'bababa' → not equal. So invalid.\n\nHmm, but sample output says that for input 'abababab' the output is YES and 'ababab'.\n\nWait, let me check. What's the correct scenario here?\n\nThe sample output for input 'abababab' is 'YES' and 'ababab'.\n\nLet me think. The original s is 'ababab' (length 6). Then m is 8. So 2n -k = m → 2*6 -k =8 → k=4. Which is between 1 and 5 (n-1=5). So yes.\n\nSo for this case, n=6. Let's see why in the code above, when n=6, the code would process it.\n\nWait, in our earlier calculation for n=6, the code would check for k=4. s_candidate is 'ababab' (first 6 letters of 'abababab').\n\nCheck if first 4 letters (abab) equal last 4 letters (baba)? No. So why is the sample output correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the merged string t is formed by overlapping two copies of s. So the merged string is s + s[k:].\n\nIn this case, s is 'ababab' (length 6), k=4. So s[k:] is s[4:] → 'ab'.\n\nSo the merged string is 'ababab' + 'ab' → 'abababab' which is the input. So the code must find this.\n\nBut according to the code's checks:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (n=6, m=8). k=4. Check if first 4 characters of s_candidate is 'abab' and last 4 is 'baba'? No. So why is this case passing?\n\nWait, there's a mistake here. Because the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s_candidate (s) and the first k of the second s_candidate (s). So for the overlapping to be valid, the last k characters of s_candidate must equal the first k of s_candidate. So for s_candidate = 'ababab', k=4. The last 4 characters are 'baba' (positions 2-5?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (indices 0-5):\n\nindices 0:a, 1:b, 2:a, 3:b, 4:a, 5:b.\n\nlast 4 characters are indices 2-5: a, b, a, b → 'abab'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the last 4 characters of s_candidate (length 6) is s_candidate[-4:] → which is from index 2 to 5 (since 6-4=2). So s_candidate[2:6] is 'abab'.\n\nThe first 4 characters of s_candidate is s_candidate[0:4] → 'abab'.\n\nSo they are equal! Oh right! So my previous calculation was wrong. So for s_candidate = 'ababab', the first 4 is 'abab' and the last 4 is 'abab' → equal. So the code would pass that check.\n\nThen, check if t[n:]",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that some positive number of characters (but less than the length of `s`) are overlapping.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Overlap Constraints**: The merged string `t` must be formed by two identical messages `s` overlapping by a positive number of characters `k` (where `1 ≤ k < len(s)`).\n2. **Determine Possible Lengths for `s`**: For a given length of `t` (denoted as `m`), the possible lengths of `s` (denoted as `n`) range from `(m + 2) // 2` to `m - 1`.\n3. **Check Valid Overlaps**: For each possible length `n`, calculate the overlap `k = 2n - m`. Check if `k` is within valid bounds and if the first `k` characters of the candidate `s` match the last `k` characters.\n4. **Validate the Merged String**: Ensure that the rest of the string `t` after the first `n` characters matches the substring of `s` starting from index `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nm = len(t)\nfound = False\n\nlower_n = (m + 2) // 2\n\nfor n in range(lower_n, m):\n    k = 2 * n - m\n    if k < 1 or k >= n:\n        continue\n    s_candidate = t[:n]\n    if s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]:\n        if t[n:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            found = True\n            break\n\nif not found:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `m` is determined.\n2. **Range Calculation**: The lower bound for possible lengths of `s` is calculated using integer division to ensure we consider all valid candidates.\n3. **Overlap Check**: For each candidate length `n`, compute the overlap `k` and check if it is valid (i.e., within the range `1 ≤ k < n`).\n4. **String Validation**: For each valid `k`, check if the first `k` characters of the candidate `s` match the last `k` characters. Additionally, verify if the remaining part of `t` matches the substring of `s` starting from index `k`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s`. If no valid `s` is found after checking all candidates, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible overlaps and ensures correctness by validating both the overlap condition and the structure of the merged string.",
