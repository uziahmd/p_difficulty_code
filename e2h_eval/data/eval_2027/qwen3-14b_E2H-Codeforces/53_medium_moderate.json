    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with the examples given. For instance, the input 'ababa' gives output 3. The substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the length is 3. Another example is 'zzz' where the output is 2. The substrings 'zz' occur multiple times, but the maximum length is 2. Wait, but why isn't it 3? Because the substring 'zzz' occurs once, but maybe there are two occurrences of 'zz'? Like positions 0-1 and 1-2. So yes, that's two occurrences. So the maximum length is 2 here.\n\nSo the task is to find the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice. The key is to check all possible substrings and track their occurrences.\n\nNow, how do I approach this efficiently?\n\nThe brute force way would be to check all possible substrings of the string, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nBut considering that the string length is up to 100, maybe the brute force approach is feasible here.\n\nLet me think: for each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate L from the maximum possible (which is len(s)//2, since a substring longer than half the string can't occur twice unless the string is very short) down to 1.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is length 5, the maximum possible L is 2. Because for a substring of length 3, there's only two possible positions (0-2 and 1-3). But if the string is 'aaaaa', then the substring 'aaa' occurs in positions 0-2, 1-3, 2-4. So multiple times. So the maximum possible L is len(s) -1, but in some cases. So perhaps for each possible L from len(s)-1 down to 1, check if there's a substring of that length that occurs at least twice.\n\nBut for the worst case, for each L, we can check all possible substrings of that length and see if any of them appear more than once.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor L in range (max_length, 0, -1):\n\n   collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears at least twice.\n\n   if yes, return L.\n\nIf no such L found, return 0.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the maximum possible L to check? Well, for a substring to appear at least twice, the maximum possible length is len(s) -1. For example, in a string of length 2, like 'aa', the maximum L is 1 (the substring 'a' occurs twice). But for a string of length 3, 'aaa', the maximum L is 2, since the substring 'aa' occurs twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So the maximum possible L is len(s) -1. So for the loop, we can start from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nBut for each L, how do we check if there's a substring of that length that occurs at least twice?\n\nFor example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (positions 1-3), 'aba' (positions 2-4). So 'aba' occurs twice. So for L=3, we can find that.\n\nSo for each L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nSo for each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and for each substring, count how many times it occurs. If any count is >=2, then return that L.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nRead the input string. Let's say s = input().strip()\n\nThen, for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   create a set to store the substrings we've seen so far.\n\n   for i in range(0, len(s) - L +1):\n\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substring in the set:\n\n           return L as the answer.\n\n       else:\n\n           add it to the set.\n\n   if after checking all substrings of length L, none are found, proceed to L-1.\n\nWait, but this approach would check for duplicates as we go. However, for example, if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, the first occurrence is added to the set, and when the second occurrence comes, it's found in the set, and we can return L immediately.\n\nBut this approach would miss some possibilities where a substring occurs more than once, but not in consecutive positions. However, the code would check for any occurrence of a duplicate.\n\nBut the code above would work because once any duplicate is found for a certain L, we can return that L as the maximum possible.\n\nBut wait, for example, if there are multiple substrings of length L, but only one of them occurs twice. Then the code would find it.\n\nSo the code for each L is:\n\nCheck all substrings of length L, and see if any of them appears at least twice.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nThe code above would check for that. Because for each substring, if it's already in the set, then it's been seen before. So for example, in the case of 'ababa' with L=3:\n\ni=0: substring 'aba' is not in the set, add it.\n\ni=1: substring 'bab' not in set, add.\n\ni=2: substring 'aba' is in the set. So return 3.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nBut for the case where a substring appears more than once, but not in the first occurrence. For example, if the substrings are 'abc', 'def', 'abc', then the first occurrence is added to the set. The third occurrence will find it in the set.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L +1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but this code would check for any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Because once a substring is found again, it returns L.\n\nBut what if there are multiple substrings of the same length, but only one of them occurs twice? For example, in the case of 'abba', for L=2:\n\nsubstrings are 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'. The 'b' is in positions 1-2 and 2-3? No, for L=2, the substrings are:\n\npositions 0-1: 'ab'\n\npositions 1-2: 'bb'\n\npositions 2-3: 'ba'\n\nSo no duplicates. But for L=1, the substrings are 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'. So 'a' occurs twice, 'b' occurs twice. So the code would return 1.\n\nBut the correct answer here would be 2? Wait, no. Because the substrings of length 2 are 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'. None of them occur twice. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo the code would return 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'zzz' with len 3. For L=2:\n\nsubstrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2). So when i=0, substr is 'zz' added to the set. When i=1, substr is 'zz' which is in the set. So returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nBut what about overlapping occurrences? For example, in 'ababa', the code would catch the 'aba' substring occurring at positions 0-2 and 2-4. So when i=0, substr is 'aba' added. Then i=2, substr is 'aba' again. So the code would detect that.\n\nYes. So this approach works.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the string, then for L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   check all substrings of length L. If any is found twice, return L.\n\nIf none found, return 0.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is a list of strings? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait the input is given as the first input line contains the string. Wait, the sample input shows something like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but that's probably the input for multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nWait, but in the example, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, perhaps that's a mistake. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nOutput:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWait, but that's probably a mistake in formatting. Because the actual input is a single string. But the sample shows three different inputs and outputs. So perhaps the problem is that the user has to read multiple test cases, but the problem says \"You're given a string...\" which suggests that the input is a single string.\n\nBut the sample shows that the input is a list of strings. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo perhaps the input is multiple lines, each being a separate test case. For example, in the sample input, the input is three strings, and the output is three numbers.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly. Or perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string, but the sample shows multiple strings. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nBut the sample input is given as a list of strings. So perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted. Maybe the actual input is a single string, but the sample shows multiple test cases. For example, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich would make sense. But the original problem's sample input is written as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which is perhaps a mistake. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of strings for the purpose of showing multiple test cases.\n\nBut the user's task is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin, which would be a single string. But the sample output shows multiple outputs, which implies that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of strings. So perhaps the sample is wrong, or perhaps the problem expects multiple test cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the input is a list of strings (as in, multiple test cases), and the output is a list of answers.\n\nBut in that case, the problem's input description is incorrect.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are given as lists, perhaps the actual problem is to read multiple test cases. But the problem says \"You're given a string...\" which implies that it's a single string.\n\nThis is a bit of a confusion. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is three strings, and the output is three numbers. So the code must process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo perhaps the input is multiple lines, each line is a separate test case. For example, the sample input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nand the output is:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nSo the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem's initial description says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is shown in a way that's not accurate. But given that the sample input and output are given as lists, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is a critical point. How to proceed?\n\nWell, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nBut in reality, the code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the input is multiple lines, each being a separate test case. So the code needs to read all lines from stdin, process each line as a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nFor example, in Python, the code could read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So this is a contradiction. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the problem expects multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem statement may have a mistake. Given that, perhaps the user should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to confirm? Well, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe first input is 'abcd' which is length 4. The output is 0. Because there's no substring that occurs at least twice. For example, all substrings of length 2 are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' â€” none occur twice.\n\nFor 'ababa', the output is 3, which is correct. For 'zzz', the output is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo the code must process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem's initial description says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the actual input is multiple strings, each on a separate line.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from input, process each line as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to handle that in the code?\n\nSo the code would read lines from stdin until EOF. For each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nBut the problem's initial description says that the input is a single string. However, given the sample input and output, this is conflicting. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual input format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a single string, but the sample input is written as a list of strings for the purpose of showing multiple test cases.\n\nBut the sample output shows that for the input 'abcd', the output is 0, which is correct. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single string, and the sample input is written as a list of strings to represent multiple test cases, but the actual code should process one string per input line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input and output show multiple test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as the first input line contains the string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input is given as a list of strings, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple lines, each being a separate test case. So I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nThus, the code should read all lines from input, for each line, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting. However, the sample input and output suggest that there are multiple test cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate, and the code is supposed to process a single string. But then the sample input would be a single string, and the output would be a single number. However, the sample shows three outputs.\n\nThis is a bit of a problem. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, and the code is supposed to process them.\n\nIn that case, the code would read each line as a separate string.\n\nSo, for example, in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    # process s and output the result\n\nBut then, the code would process each line as a separate test case.\n\nSo, assuming that the input is multiple lines, each being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the correct approach is to process multiple test cases.\n\nNow, proceeding with that, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code for solving the problem for a single string is as discussed earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nFor each string s:\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L +1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            # return for this test case\n\n            break\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\n    else:\n\n        # no break, continue to next L\n\n        continue\n\n    # break out of the loop and proceed to next test case\n\n    break\n\nelse:\n\n    # no L found, print 0\n\n    print(0)\n\nSo, for each string, we check for the maximum L starting from the largest possible.\n\nNow, testing this code.\n\nTest case 1: 'abcd' (len 4). The maximum L is 3. For L=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. None are duplicates. For L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. No duplicates. For L=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. All unique. So output is 0.\n\nTest case 2: 'ababa' (len 5). For L=4: possible substrings are 'abab' (positions 0-3), 'baba' (positions 1-4). No duplicates. For L=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. When i=0, substr is 'aba' added. i=2, substr is 'aba' again. So returns 3.\n\nThird test case: 'zzz' (len 3). For L=2: substrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2). So returns 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' (len 5). For L=4: substrings 'aaaa' (positions 0-3), 'aaaa' (positions 1-4). So returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' (len 6). For L=3: substrings are 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa'. Wait, but 'aab' occurs once, 'abb' once, etc. But for L=2: 'aa', 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. So 'aa' occurs at positions 0-1, 0-1 (wait, no, for L=2, the substrings are:\n\n0-1: 'aa'\n\n1-2: 'ab'\n\n2-3: 'bb'\n\n3-4: 'ba'\n\n4-5: 'aa'\n\nSo 'aa' occurs at positions 0-1 and 4-5. So for L=2, returns 2. But there's also 'aa' in positions 0-1 and 1-2? No, the substring at 1-2 is 'ab'.\n\nBut the maximum possible L here is 2. However, there's a substring 'aa' that occurs twice. But also, the substring 'aab' occurs once, but maybe other substrings?\n\nBut for L=3, the substrings are:\n\npositions 0-2: 'aab'\n\npositions 1-3: 'abb'\n\npositions 2-4: 'bba'\n\npositions 3-5: 'baa'\n\nNo duplicates. So the maximum is 2.\n\nBut for L=3, there's no duplicates, but for L=2, yes.\n\nSo code returns 2.\n\nAnother case: 'ababab' (length 6). For L=3, the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba', 'bab'. So for i=0, substr is 'aba' added. i=2, substr is 'aba' again. So returns 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears multiple times, but not overlapping. For example, 'abcabc' (length 6). For L=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bca', 'cab'. No duplicates. For L=2, 'ab', 'bc', 'ca', 'ab', 'bc'. So 'ab' occurs at positions 0-1 and 4-5. So returns 2. But the maximum possible is 3? No, because the substring 'abc' occurs once. So the code returns 2.\n\nBut if the string is 'abcabca', then for L=3, 'abc' occurs at 0-2 and 3-5. So returns 3.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, the code for Python:\n\nBut how to read the input? If the input is multiple lines, each being a test case, then:\n\nIn Python, the code would read all lines from stdin, process each line as a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        # process s and compute the answer\n\n        max_len = 0\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - L +1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        if not found:\n\n            print(0)\n\nBut wait, the code for each line would process the string s.\n\nBut for the sample input, the code would process each line.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input lines:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich matches.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is length 1? For example, input is 'a'. Then len(s) is 1, and the loop for L is from 0 down to 1? Wait, the code has for L in range(n-1, 0, -1). For n=1, n-1 is 0, and the range is from 0 to 0, but step is -1. So the range is empty. So the loop does not run. Then, the code prints 0. Which is correct, since a single character cannot have a substring that appears twice.\n\nAnother case: string is 'aa' (length 2). Then, for L=1 (since n-1=1, and the loop runs for L=1. For L=1, the substrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). The first 'a' is added to the set. The second 'a' is found in the set. So returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, reading from stdin, and outputting the correct answer for each test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string, but according to the sample input, it's multiple. However, the code I wrote handles multiple test cases, which seems to align with the sample.\n\nThus, the code should be written as such.\n\nNow, the code may have some edge cases. Let me check:\n\nCase: 'aaa' (length 3). The maximum L is 2. For L=2, the substrings are 'aa' (positions 0-1) and 'aa' (positions 1-2). So returns 2.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaa' (length 4). For L=3: substrings are 'aaa' (positions 0-2), 'aaa' (positions 1-3). So returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' (length 6). For L=3, substrings are 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa'. No duplicates. For L=2: 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. So 'aa' occurs twice. So returns 2.\n\nBut there's also 'aa' in positions 0-1 and 4-5. So code returns 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut in Python, for the line in sys.stdin, sometimes there may be trailing newlines. So using line.strip() is important.\n\nBut the code is written as follows.\n\nNow, the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        if not found:\n\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the input is empty? According to the problem statement, the input string is non-empty. So the code can assume that.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: input 'a', output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'aa', output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab', output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa', output is 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is a single string, but the code processes multiple lines. However, given the sample input and output, this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that the input is a single string. In that case, the code should read a single line, and process it.\n\nBut then the sample input and output would be conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows a list of strings, perhaps the code is intended to process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code as written is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The solution must efficiently handle overlapping occurrences of substrings and work for multiple test cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read multiple lines from standard input, each representing a separate test case.\n2. **Substring Analysis**: For each string, check all possible substrings starting from the longest possible length down to 1. This ensures that we find the maximum length as soon as possible.\n3. **Set Utilization**: Use a set to track substrings of the current length. If a substring is encountered again, it indicates that the substring appears at least twice, and we immediately return its length.\n4. **Early Termination**: Once a valid substring of a certain length is found, we terminate further checks for shorter lengths to optimize performance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads each line from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: For each string, the code iterates from the maximum possible substring length (length of the string minus one) down to 1.\n- **Tracking Substrings**: A set is used to keep track of substrings of the current length. If a duplicate substring is found, the length is printed immediately.\n- **Efficiency**: By checking from the longest possible length downwards, the solution ensures the first valid length found is the maximum possible, allowing early termination and optimizing performance.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures correctness by leveraging sets for quick lookups and iterating from the longest possible substrings to the shortest.",
