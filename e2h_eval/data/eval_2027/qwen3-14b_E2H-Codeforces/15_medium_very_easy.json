They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can be the champion given the structure of the tournament and the rules for each phase.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. There are 2^n teams, and they play in a single-elimination tournament. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. For each phase i (starting from 1 to n), the matches are decided based on the character in the string s. If s[i-1] is '0', then in that phase, the team with lower skill level wins. If it's '1', the higher skill level wins.\n\nOur task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to model the tournament structure and determine for each possible x, whether it's possible for it to win all its matches given the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how do we model the tournament? Let's think recursively. The tournament can be viewed as a binary tree. Each round, the teams are paired, and the winners proceed to the next round.\n\nBut since the permutation p is arbitrary (as long as it's a permutation of 1 to 2^n), the actual positions of the teams in the initial bracket can be arranged in a way that allows x to win. However, the problem is to find all x that can be the champion given the rules for each phase.\n\nWait, but the permutation p defines the initial arrangement of the teams. So, for example, if x is to be the champion, we need to arrange the initial bracket so that x can win all the rounds according to the rules of each phase.\n\nSo for each x, we need to check if there's a way to arrange the initial bracket (i.e., assign the teams to the leaves of the tournament tree) such that x can win through all the rounds, considering the rules for each phase.\n\nBut how can we model the possible ranges of values that x must have in each round?\n\nLet me think about each round. Let's consider that during each phase, the way the matches are decided depends on the phase. For example, in the first phase (phase 1), there are 2^{n-1} games. In each of those, the winner is determined by the rule s[0]. Then in phase 2, the next round, there are 2^{n-2} games, determined by s[1], and so on until phase n, which has 1 game.\n\nFor x to be the champion, it must win in each of these phases. Let's think about the constraints that each phase imposes on x's possible values.\n\nLet's think recursively. Suppose we have a certain number of rounds left. For each round, depending on the rule (higher or lower), the x must be able to beat the opponent in that round, given the possible opponents it could face.\n\nBut how do we model the opponents? Well, in each round, the x is in a bracket that has a certain size. For example, in the first round, x is in a pair with another team. The winner of that pair proceeds to the next round. Then, in the next round, the winner is paired with another winner from another pair, etc.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the initial bracket such that in each round, the opponents that x faces are as favorable as possible. However, the rules for each phase dictate how the match is decided.\n\nLet me think of it as building the minimum and maximum possible values that x must have in each round.\n\nFor example, suppose during a certain phase, the rule is '1' (higher skill wins). Then, in that phase's matches, x must be the higher-skilled team in its match. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the opponents in such a way that x can pass through each round.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each round, we can compute the range of possible values that x must have to survive that round, given the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of rounds. Let's imagine that for x to reach the final round (the nth phase), it must have passed through all previous phases.\n\nLet me try to model this step by step. Let's start from the last phase and work backwards. Or maybe from the first phase forward?\n\nAlternatively, think of each round as requiring that x is the best (or worst) in its bracket, depending on the rule for that round.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that for each round, the possible candidates that can reach that round must be within a certain range. For example, in the first round, the x must be either the higher or lower skill in its match, depending on the rule for phase 1. Then, in the next round, the x must be the higher or lower in its new match, depending on the rule for phase 2, and so on.\n\nBut since the initial bracket can be arranged, perhaps we can find for each round, the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have, given the rules of the previous rounds.\n\nLet me think of this as follows: For each round i (from 1 to n), the x must be able to win in that round. For that, the x must be either the maximum or the minimum in the group of 2^{i} teams that it is part of, depending on the rule of that phase.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Because in each phase, the number of teams is halved. For example, in phase 1, there are 2^{n} teams, and after phase 1, there are 2^{n-1} teams. Phase 2 is played among those 2^{n-1} teams, and so on.\n\nBut for x to reach phase i, it must have survived the previous i-1 phases. Let's think of each phase as a step where x must be the winner of its match in that phase, given the rule for that phase.\n\nSo, for example, in phase 1, the rule is s[0]. Let's say that rule is '1', meaning higher skill wins. Then, in order for x to win its first match, it needs to be the higher-skilled team in its pair. However, since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can arrange that x is paired with any other team. But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the initial bracket so that in phase 1, x's opponent is someone with a lower skill than x. Thus, x can pass phase 1.\n\nBut then, for phase 2, the rule is s[1]. Suppose that rule is '0', meaning lower skill wins. Now, in phase 2, x is in a match against another winner of phase 1. So, in that match, x must be the lower-skilled team. But how can we arrange that?\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can arrange that in the first phase, x's opponent is someone with lower skill (so x passes), and in the second phase, the other winner of that bracket is someone with higher skill than x. Then, in phase 2, since the rule is '0', the lower skill (x) would win.\n\nBut how can we model this for all phases?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each phase, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have, given the rules up to that phase.\n\nLet me think of it as building a range of possible values for x. Starting from the first phase, and moving up through the rounds.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for each round i (starting from 1 to n), the x must be in a certain range. Let's define for each round i, the possible min and max that x can have, given the rules of the first i phases.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Let's say n=3, and the string is '101'. So the phases are:\n\nPhase 1: rule 1 (higher skill wins)\nPhase 2: rule 0 (lower skill wins)\nPhase 3: rule 1 (higher skill wins)\n\nThe total number of teams is 8. For x to be the champion, it must win all three phases.\n\nIn phase 1, x must be the higher-skilled team in its match. So in the first round, x must have a higher skill than its opponent. Since the initial bracket can be arranged, we can choose x's opponent to be any team with a lower skill. Therefore, x must be at least 2 (since there's a team with 1, which is lower). However, the maximum is not limited here. Wait, but for the next phase, the opponent in phase 2 depends on the other teams.\n\nWait, but maybe for each phase, the required condition depends on the number of teams that x has to beat in that phase, and the rules of that phase. Let's think in terms of the number of teams that x must be the best or worst in a certain group.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. Each internal node represents a match between two winners of the subtrees.\n\nFor x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all matches along the path from the leaf to the root. The rules of each phase (which correspond to the level of the tree) determine how each match is decided.\n\nBut how can we find the possible x?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as having rounds. Round 1 (phase 1) has matches between adjacent pairs. Round 2 (phase 2) has matches between the winners of the first round. And so on.\n\nFor x to win all rounds, in each round i, the rule for that round determines whether x must be the higher or lower in the match. However, the opponents in each round depend on the previous rounds.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the opponents in each round such that x can satisfy the rule.\n\nSo, for each round i, the number of teams that x must have beaten is 2^{i-1} teams. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as for each round, the x must be the best or worst in a group of size 2^i. Let me explain:\n\nIn the first round (phase 1), the group size is 2^1 = 2 teams. The rule says higher or lower wins. So, if the rule is 1, then x must be the highest in that group of 2. If the rule is 0, x must be the lowest in that group.\n\nIn the second round (phase 2), the group size is 4 teams. Because in order to reach phase 2, x must have won the first round. Then, in phase 2, x is part of a group of 4 teams (the two winners from the first round in its bracket and the two winners from another bracket). Wait, no. For example, in phase 2, the number of teams is 2^{n-1} = 4 when n=3. So each match in phase 2 is between two teams that have won their first-round matches. The group size for x in phase 2 is 2^2 = 4? Or is it 2^{i} where i is the phase number?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each phase i, the group size that x must be the best/worst in is 2^i teams. Let me think:\n\nIn phase 1, x is in a group of 2 teams. To win, x must be the best or worst in that group (depending on the rule).\n\nIn phase 2, x is in a group of 4 teams. Because in phase 2, the matches are between two groups of two teams each. So, for x to reach phase 2, it must have been the winner of its group of 2. Then, in phase 2, x is in a group of 4 teams (the two groups of 2 teams each), and must be the best or worst in that group, depending on the rule of phase 2.\n\nWait, but how? Because in phase 2, the match is between two teams. So, x's group for phase 2 is 2 teams (the winner of its first-round group and the winner of another first-round group). So the group size is 2, but for phase 2, the rule applies to that match. So perhaps my earlier idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each phase i, the number of teams that x must have \"dominated\" in the sense of being the best or worst in a group of size 2^i.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for phase i, the rule is r_i (0 or 1). For x to win in phase i, it must be the best (if r_i is 1) or the worst (if r_i is 0) in the group of 2^i teams that it comes from.\n\nWait, but how does that group form? For example, in phase 1, the group is 2 teams. In phase 2, the group is 4 teams. Because in phase 2, the match is between two winners from phase 1. So, to reach phase 2, x must have been the best/worst in its group of 2. Then, in phase 2, the group is 4 teams, and x must be the best/worst in that group. Wait, but how can that be? Because in phase 2, the group of 4 teams would have two winners from phase 1. So, for x to win phase 2's match, it needs to be the best or worst in the group of 2 teams (the two winners from phase 1's groups). So maybe the group size for phase i is 2^i teams, and x must be the best/worst in that group.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each phase, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible value of x based on the rules of the previous phases.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let's assume that for each phase i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. Let's define for each phase i, the minimal and maximal possible value of x. Starting from the first phase.\n\nInitially, for phase 1, the group size is 2^1 = 2. Depending on the rule, x must be the maximum or the minimum in that group. So, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the maximum of the group of 2. So, the minimal possible value x can have is 2 (since there's a lower value in the group), and the maximum is 2^n (since it's the maximum possible). Wait, but how can we know the exact range?\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the group of 2 teams such that x is the maximum. Therefore, x can be any value between 1 and 2^n, but for it to be the maximum in a group of two, it must be larger than the other team. So, the other team can be any value less than x. Thus, for the first phase, x can be any value, but when considering the next phases, we have to make sure that x can be the best or worst in larger groups.\n\nBut how to model this for all phases?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that after processing phases 1 to i, the x must be in a certain range [lo, hi]. For phase i+1, depending on the rule, we adjust this range.\n\nFor example, let's say that for phase i, the rule is r. Then, during phase i, x must be the maximum or minimum in a group of size 2^i.\n\nWait, but how does the group size relate to the phase? For phase 1, group size is 2^1. For phase 2, group size is 2^2. And so on until phase n, group size is 2^n (the entire tournament).\n\nBut for x to be the champion, it must have passed through all phases. For each phase i, x must be the maximum or minimum in a group of size 2^i, depending on the rule of that phase.\n\nSo, for example, for phase 1, the group is 2 teams. For phase 2, the group is 4 teams. For phase 3, 8 teams, etc.\n\nBut how do these groups relate? For x to be in the group of 4 teams for phase 2, it must have been the maximum or minimum in the group of 2 teams for phase 1. Then, in phase 2, x must be the maximum or minimum in the group of 4 teams.\n\nSo, for each phase, the group size doubles. Thus, the process can be modeled as follows:\n\nWe start with the group size of 2^1 for phase 1. Then, for phase 2, group size is 2^2, and so on.\n\nNow, the question is: For each phase, given the rule, what is the range of x that can be the maximum or minimum in the group of size 2^i, considering that in previous phases, it had to be the maximum or minimum in smaller groups.\n\nLet me think of it as for each phase i, we track the minimum and maximum possible value x can have. Let me think of this as a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet me denote for each phase i, the possible range of x as [low_i, high_i].\n\nInitially, for phase 0 (before any rounds), the range is [1, 2^n], since x can be any value.\n\nThen, for phase 1, the rule is r_1 = s[0]. If the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum in a group of size 2^1. How does that affect the range?\n\nWell, to be the maximum in a group of size 2^1 (two teams), x must have at least one team in the group with lower skill. Since the group can be arranged, the minimal x can be is 2 (since there's a team with 1). The maximum is 2^n (since there's no higher value). So the range for phase 1 would be [2, 2^n] if the rule is '1'.\n\nIf the rule is '0', then x must be the minimum in the group of two teams. So x must be at most 2^{n} - 1 (since there's a higher value in the group). But the minimal x can be is 1. So the range for phase 1 is [1, 2^n - 1].\n\nThen, for phase 2, the rule is r_2 = s[1]. Now, the group size is 4. For x to be the maximum or minimum in this group of 4, depending on the rule, considering that in phase 1, x was the maximum or minimum in a group of 2.\n\nWait, but how do we combine these conditions?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that in phase 1, the rule was '1' (so x was the maximum in group of 2). Then, for phase 2, the rule is '0' (so x must be the minimum in group of 4). How can this happen?\n\nIn phase 2, x is in a group of 4 teams. These 4 teams consist of two groups of 2 teams each, which were winners of phase 1. Since in phase 1, x was the maximum in its group of 2, then in phase 2, the group of 4 includes x and another group's winner. For x to be the minimum in the group of 4, the other group's winner must have a higher value than x. But since x was the maximum in its group of 2, the other group's winner could be any value that is higher than x.\n\nBut how do we model this in terms of the range?\n\nIf in phase 1, x was the maximum in a group of 2, then x can be in the range [a, b], where a and b are determined by phase 1's rule. Now, for phase 2, the rule is '0' (minimum wins). So x must be the minimum in the group of 4. That means that all other three teams in the group must have higher values than x. But since the group of 4 consists of x and three other teams (wait, no, the group of 4 is two teams from phase 1's winners. So in phase 2, the group is two teams: x and another team. Wait, no. Wait, phase 2 is the second round. The first round had 2^{n-1} games, leaving 2^{n-1} teams. The second round has 2^{n-2} games. So for example, with n=3, 8 teams, first round has 4 games, leaving 4 teams. Second round has 2 games, leaving 2 teams. Third round has 1 game.\n\nSo, for phase i, the group size is 2^i teams. Wait, no. For phase 1, group size is 2^1 teams. For phase 2, group size is 2^2 teams. But how can that be? For example, in phase 2, each match is between two teams. So the group of 2^2 = 4 teams would have two matches. But each match is between two teams. So the group of 4 teams would have two matches in phase 2. But for x to be the minimum in that group of 4, it would need to be the minimum of all four teams. However, in reality, x is only involved in one match of phase 2, and the other teams are in another match.\n\nSo perhaps my earlier idea is wrong. Maybe the group size for phase i is 2^{i} teams, but x is only part of one match in that phase. Therefore, the logic of needing to be the maximum or minimum in the entire group of 2^i teams is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let me think again.\n\nEach phase i corresponds to a round where the number of teams is 2^{n - (i-1)} }, because after phase 1, there are 2^{n-1} teams, after phase 2, 2^{n-2}, etc. So for phase i, the number of teams is 2^{n - i + 1} }.\n\nBut in phase i, each match is between two teams, and the number of matches is 2^{n - i} }, which reduces the number of teams by half each time.\n\nBut for x to win phase i, it needs to win its match in that phase. The way the match is decided depends on the rule for phase i.\n\nNow, the question is: What constraints does this impose on x's value, given that we can arrange the initial bracket in any way?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that during phase i, the rule is r (0 or 1). For x to win its match in this phase, it must be the lower or higher skill level than its opponent. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, the opponent can be chosen as any team that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut how can we model this for all phases?\n\nLet me think about the possible range of x's value after each phase. Let's imagine that for each phase, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have, given the rules up to that phase.\n\nLet's start with phase 1. For x to win phase 1, it must be the higher or lower in its match. Since the initial bracket can be arranged, we can choose the opponent. So:\n\n- If the rule for phase 1 is '1' (higher wins), x must be higher than its opponent. So the minimal value x can have is 2 (since there's at least one team with lower value), and the maximum is 2^n (since there's no higher value). So the range is [2, 2^n].\n\n- If the rule for phase 1 is '0' (lower wins), x must be lower than its opponent. So the maximum value x can have is 2^n - 1 (since there's at least one higher value), and the minimal is 1. So the range is [1, 2^n - 1].\n\nNow, for phase 2, the rule is s[1]. For x to win phase 2, it must be the higher or lower than its opponent in this phase. However, the opponent in phase 2 is the winner of another match in phase 1. So, the opponent's value depends on the rules of phase 1 and how we arranged the initial bracket.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the opponent in phase 2 to be any value that allows x to win based on the phase 2 rule.\n\nSo, for example, if phase 2's rule is '0' (lower wins), then x must be lower than its opponent. To achieve this, we can arrange that the opponent in phase 2 is a team with higher value than x. But how does this affect the possible range of x's value?\n\nBut what constraints does this place on x's value?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that after phase 1, x's possible range is [lo_prev, hi_prev]. For phase 2, we need to choose an opponent for x in phase 2, which is the winner of another match in phase 1. The opponent's value depends on the rules of phase 1.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can choose the opponent's value to be anything that satisfies the conditions of phase 2.\n\nLet me think of this as follows. For x to win phase 2, given the rule r (0 or 1), we need to select an opponent that is either higher or lower than x. But the opponent must have passed phase 1, which implies that the opponent's value is in some range determined by phase 1's rule.\n\nSo, for example, if phase 1's rule was '1' (higher wins), then the opponent in phase 2 must have been the higher in its phase 1 match. So the opponent's value is in [2, 2^n], same as x's possible range after phase 1.\n\nBut to have x win phase 2 with rule '0' (lower wins), x must be lower than the opponent. Since the opponent's value is in [2, 2^n], we can choose the opponent's value to be higher than x. Therefore, x can be as low as possible (but still in the previous range) and the opponent can be chosen to be higher. So the new range for x after phase 2 would be the same as before, but with the constraint that there exists an opponent in the allowed range for phase 1's winners that is higher than x.\n\nBut since the opponent can be any value in the previous range, as long as it's higher than x, the minimal x can be is 1 (but wait, after phase 1, the range was [2, ...], so x can't be 1 anymore. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each phase, we can compute the new possible range based on the previous range and the current rule. For example:\n\nLet’s define for each phase i, the current range of x's possible values. Initially, for phase 0 (before any rounds), the range is [1, 2^n].\n\nFor phase 1, the rule is r1. The new range is computed based on r1 and the previous range.\n\nIf r1 is '1', then x must be higher than its opponent in phase 1. Since the opponent can be any value less than x, the minimal x can be is 2 (because there must be at least one value less than x in the initial bracket). So the new range is [lo_prev_min, hi_prev_max], where lo_prev_min is 2 and hi_prev_max is 2^n. But since the previous range was [1, 2^n], and we need x to be higher than someone, the new range becomes [2, 2^n].\n\nIf r1 is '0', then x must be lower than its opponent. So the new range is [1, 2^n-1].\n\nThen, for phase 2, the rule is r2. Now, the opponent in phase 2 is someone who has passed phase 1. So the opponent's value is in the range determined by phase 1's rule. For example, if phase 1's rule was '1', the opponent's value is in [2, 2^n].\n\nNow, for phase 2, if r2 is '0', x must be lower than the opponent. To ensure that there exists an opponent in the range [2, 2^n] that is higher than x, x must be <= 2^n-1. But since x is already in [2, 2^n] from phase 1, the new range would be [2, 2^n - 1]. Because if x is 2^n, there is no higher value in the opponent's range, so x cannot be 2^n.\n\nSimilarly, if r2 is '1', x must be higher than the opponent. The opponent's value is in [2, 2^n]. To have x be higher than the opponent, x must be at least as big as the minimal possible value of the opponent plus 1? Or no, since the opponent can be chosen to be as small as possible.\n\nWait, if x is in [2, 2^n], and we want to find an opponent in [2, 2^n] that is lower than x. For x to be able to find such an opponent, x must be at least 3? No. For example, if x is 2, the opponent can be 1? Wait, no. Because the opponent has already passed phase 1, which requires them to be in the range [2, 2^n]. So if x is 2, the opponent can't be 1. So the opponent must be in [2, 2^n]. Therefore, for x to be higher than the opponent, x must be at least 3 (since the opponent can be 2). But if x is 2, then there's no opponent in the range [2, 2^n] that is lower than x. Hence, x cannot be 2 in this scenario.\n\nWait, this suggests that for phase 2 with rule '1', the new range would be [3, 2^n]. Because x must be higher than the opponent, who is in [2, 2^n]. So the minimal x can be is 3 (opponent is 2), and the maximum is 2^n (opponent can be 2^n-1).\n\nSo, putting this together, for each phase, the new range is determined based on the previous range and the current rule. \n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nAt each step, for the current phase i (starting from 1 to n), we have a current range [lo, hi]. The rule for this phase is r (0 or 1).\n\nIf r is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than its opponent in this phase. The opponent is someone who has passed all previous phases. The opponent's value is in the range determined by the previous steps. Let's call that range [op_lo, op_hi].\n\nTo ensure that there exists an opponent in [op_lo, op_hi] that is less than x, x must be greater than the minimal possible value of the opponent. Wait, no. For example, if the opponent's range is [a, b], then x must be greater than some value in [a, b]. The minimal x can be is a + 1? Or the minimal x can be a, but only if there exists a value in [a, b] that is less than x. For example, if x is a, then the opponent must be less than a. But since the opponent's range starts at a, there's no such value. So x must be greater than a. Therefore, the new lo would be a + 1, and the hi remains b.\n\nSimilarly, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be lower than its opponent. The opponent's range is [op_lo, op_hi]. So x must be less than some value in [op_lo, op_hi]. The maximum x can be is op_hi - 1. The minimal x can be is op_lo (since the opponent can be op_lo + 1, which is higher than x).\n\nWait, this seems to be the pattern. So for each phase, the new range depends on the opponent's range, which is the same as the previous range (since the opponent is also passing through the same previous phases). \n\nWait, but the opponent is another team that has passed through the same previous phases. Therefore, the range of the opponent's possible values is the same as the current range of x before this phase. Because both x and the opponent have passed through the same previous phases.\n\nWait, but for example, in phase 1, x's range is [2, 2^n] if the rule is '1'. The opponent's range is also [2, 2^n], since they also passed phase 1. So for phase 2, the opponent's range is the same as x's previous range.\n\nThus, for phase i, the opponent's range is [lo_prev, hi_prev], which is the range of x after phase i-1.\n\nTherefore, during phase i, the new range for x is computed as follows:\n\nIf the rule is '1' (higher wins), then x must be > some value in [lo_prev, hi_prev]. The minimal x can be is lo_prev + 1, and the maximum is hi_prev. Because if x is lo_prev + 1, then there exists an opponent (lo_prev) that is less than x. If x is hi_prev, then there exists an opponent (hi_prev - 1) that is less than x.\n\nWait, but what if the opponent's range is [lo_prev, hi_prev], and x is in [lo_prev, hi_prev]. For x to be able to find an opponent that is less than x, x must be at least lo_prev + 1? No. For example, if x is lo_prev, then the opponent can be any value in [lo_prev, hi_prev] that is less than x. But since x is lo_prev, there's no such value. Hence, x must be greater than lo_prev. Therefore, the new lo is lo_prev + 1, and the hi remains hi_prev.\n\nSimilarly, if the rule is '0' (lower wins), then x must be less than some value in [lo_prev, hi_prev]. The maximum x can be is hi_prev - 1. The lo remains lo_prev, since even if x is lo_prev, there exists an opponent (lo_prev + 1) that is higher than x.\n\nSo, the new range for x after phase i is:\n\nif rule is '1': [lo_prev + 1, hi_prev]\n\nif rule is '0': [lo_prev, hi_prev - 1]\n\nThis seems promising. Let's test this with the example given.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n101\n\nSo n=3, s='101'. Let's compute the ranges step by step.\n\nInitial range: [1, 8]\n\nPhase 1: rule is '1' (s[0] is '1'). New range is [1+1, 8] → [2,8].\n\nPhase 2: rule is '0' (s[1] is '0'). New range is [2, 8-1] → [2,7].\n\nPhase 3: rule is '1' (s[2] is '1'). New range is [2+1,7] → [3,7].\n\nWait, but according to the sample output, the winning integers are 4,5,6,7. But according to this calculation, the range is [3,7]. Which includes 3,4,5,6,7. However, the sample output for the first case is 4 5 6 7.\n\nHmm, this discrepancy suggests that there's a mistake in this reasoning.\n\nWait, sample input 1 is:\n\nInput: 3\\n101 → Output: 4 5 6 7.\n\nBut according to the calculation above, the range would be [3,7], but the correct answer is [4,7]. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh, this suggests that the previous reasoning is missing something. Let's think again.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nLet me think about the third phase for the first sample. After phase 2, the range is [2,7]. Phase 3 has rule '1', so the new range is [2+1, 7] = [3,7]. But according to the sample, the correct answer is 4-7.\n\nSo why is 3 not included?\n\nLet me think about why 3 can't be a valid x.\n\nLet's imagine x=3. Can it be the champion?\n\nThe tournament has 8 teams. Let's try to arrange the initial bracket so that x=3 wins all phases.\n\nPhase 1: rule is '1' (higher wins). x=3 must be higher than its opponent. So opponent must be 1 or 2. Let's say opponent is 1. x=3 wins.\n\nPhase 2: rule is '0' (lower wins). x=3 must be lower than its opponent. The opponent is the winner of another phase 1 match. Let's say that opponent is 4. Then, since rule is '0', lower wins, so x=3 would win. But how did the opponent get to phase 2? The opponent must have passed phase 1, which for rule '1' requires that they were higher than their opponent. So opponent could be 4 (with their opponent being 2, for example).\n\nThen, phase 3: rule is '1' (higher wins). x=3 must be higher than the other finalist. Let's say the other finalist is 4. Then, x=3 would lose. So how can x=3 win phase 3?\n\nWait, in phase 3, the opponent is someone who has passed phase 2. Let's see.\n\nAfter",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be the champion in a single-elimination tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The solution involves simulating the constraints imposed by each phase's rule on the possible range of winning skill levels.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of $2^n$ teams and $n$ phases. Each phase halves the number of teams, with the winner of each match progressing to the next phase.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (either '0' or '1') that determines the winner of each match. A '0' means the team with the lower skill level wins, while '1' means the team with the higher skill level wins.\n3. **Range Calculation**: For each phase, based on the rule, we adjust the range of possible skill levels that can win the tournament. Starting from the full range of possible skill levels, we iteratively narrow down the range considering the rules of each phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 2 ** n\n    lo = 1\n    hi = total_teams\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            # Higher skill wins, x must be higher than opponent\n            lo = lo + 1\n        else:\n            # Lower skill wins, x must be lower than opponent\n            hi = hi - 1\n    \n    result = list(range(lo, hi + 1))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the full range of possible skill levels from 1 to $2^n$.\n2. **Iterate Through Phases**: For each phase, we adjust the range based on the rule:\n   - If the rule is '1', the lower bound of the range is incremented because the team must have a higher skill level than its opponent.\n   - If the rule is '0', the upper bound of the range is decremented because the team must have a lower skill level than its opponent.\n3. **Result Construction**: After processing all phases, the remaining range contains all possible skill levels that can win the tournament under the given rules. This range is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible winning skill levels by considering each phase's constraints, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
