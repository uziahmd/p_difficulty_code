Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. The output for that case is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and track their occurrences. But since the string length is up to 100, maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me think: for each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once we find the maximum such L, return it.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths from the maximum possible (which is len(s)//2? Or maybe len(s)-1? Because for example, a string of length 5 can have a substring of length 4 that appears twice if it's like 'aaaaa' — but then the substring 'aaaa' appears twice, once starting at 0 and once at 1. So the maximum possible length for a substring that can appear twice is len(s) - 1. So for a string of length N, the maximum possible L is N-1. But for that to happen, the substring would have to be the same when shifted by one. So for example, 'aaaaa' has substrings of length 4 appearing twice.\n\nSo the plan is to check for all possible L values starting from the maximum possible (N-1) down to 1. For each L, check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once we find the first L where this is true, return it. If none found, return 0.\n\nSo how to check for each L?\n\nFor each L, generate all substrings of length L, and track their counts. If any of them occurs at least twice, then return L as the answer.\n\nBut how to generate all substrings of length L? For example, for a string of length N, the number of possible substrings of length L is N - L + 1. For each position i from 0 to N-L, take s[i:i+L].\n\nThen, for each L, we can collect all these substrings and check if any of them appears more than once.\n\nSo for example, for the input 'ababa', let's see:\n\nN is 5. Let's check L=3 first. The substrings are:\n\nababa[0:3] = 'aba'\n\nababa[1:4] = 'bab'\n\nababa[2:5] = 'aba'\n\nSo the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So 'aba' appears twice. So return 3.\n\nSo the algorithm would work here.\n\nNow, for the sample input:\n\nSample input 1 is 'abcd' — length 4. The maximum possible L is 3. Check for L=3: substrings are 'abc', 'bcd' — both unique. Then check L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — all unique. Then L=1: each character appears once. So output is 0.\n\nAnother sample is 'zzz' — length 3. For L=2, substrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2). So two occurrences. So output is 2.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead the input string. Let's say s = input().strip()\n\nThen, N = len(s). If N is 0, but according to the problem statement, the input is non-empty.\n\nWe need to check for L from N-1 down to 1. For each L, check all substrings of length L. For each substring, track their occurrences. If any substring occurs at least twice, return L.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, no such substring is found, return 0.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            return L\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but this would check for each L, and for each substring in order. However, for example, if a substring appears more than once, but the first occurrence is not the same as the second. Wait, no. For example, if the same substring occurs twice, then when we check the first occurrence, it's added to the set. Then, when the second occurrence comes, we check if it's in the set. If yes, then return L.\n\nBut",
