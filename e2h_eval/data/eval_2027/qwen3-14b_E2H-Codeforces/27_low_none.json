On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo the key here is to figure out which subarray to reverse so that when we reverse it, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is as long as possible. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, maybe there's a way to compute this efficiently without checking all possible subarrays directly, which would be O(n^2) possibilities and for each possibility, computing the LNDS would take O(n) time, leading to O(n^3) which might be too slow for n=2000. Wait, 2000 cubed is 8e10 operations, which is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think. The original array can have some number of 1s and 2s. The LNDS of the original array is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s if they are non-decreasing. But since the array can be modified by reversing a subarray, perhaps the optimal way is to find a segment that when reversed, increases the number of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nWait, but since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is just the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s. Because any non-decreasing sequence can't have a 2 followed by a 1. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s, but that's only if the array is non-decreasing. But when you reverse a subarray, you can possibly fix some parts where there are 2s followed by 1s, which would be bad for the LNDS.\n\nWait, the original array may have some 2s followed by 1s. For example, in the first example: [1,2,1,2]. The original LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But by reversing positions 2-3, you get [1,1,2,2], which is fully non-decreasing, hence length 4.\n\nSo the idea is to find a subarray that, when reversed, reduces the number of 2-1 transitions. Each such transition is a place where the sequence decreases. So the original number of such transitions is the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Reversing a subarray can eliminate some of these transitions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the LNDS. Since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of inversions (where an inversion is a 2 followed by a 1). Wait, no. Because the LNDS can be thought of as the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. For example, if there are k inversions (each being a 2 followed by a 1), then the LNDS would be n - k. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's think:\n\nIf the array is entirely non-decreasing, then the LNDS is n. If there are some inversions, then each inversion is a 2 followed by a 1. Each such inversion reduces the LNDS by 1? Not sure. Let's take an example. Suppose the array is [1,2,1]. The LNDS is 2 (like 1,2 or 1,1). The number of inversions here is 1 (the 2 followed by 1). So n - inversions is 3 - 1 = 2, which matches. Another example: [2,1]. Inversions is 1, LNDS is 1. Which is 2 - 1 = 1. So perhaps the LNDS is equal to n minus the number of inversions. Wait, but in the first example, the original array is [1,2,1,2]. The inversions are the 2 followed by 1 (position 2-3). So one inversion. Then the LNDS is 3, which is 4 - 1 = 3. Yes. And after reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which has zero inversions, and LNDS is 4 = 4 - 0. So this seems to hold.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of (n - number of inversions after reversing some subarray). Therefore, our goal is to find the maximum number of inversions that can be removed by reversing a subarray. Then subtract that from n to get the maximum LNDS.\n\nBut how do we compute the maximum",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we focus on the fact that the array consists only of 1s and 2s. This allows us to simplify the concept of a non-decreasing subsequence into counting the number of inversions (i.e., places where a 2 is followed by a 1). Our goal is to minimize the number of such inversions by reversing an appropriate subarray.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\n- The **longest non-decreasing subsequence** (LNDS) in a sequence of 1s and 2s can be found by counting the number of inversions (2 followed by 1), and then computing `n - inversions`.\n- Reversing a subarray can reduce the number of such inversions. Therefore, our task is to find the reversal that reduces the number of inversions the most.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\nWe iterate through all possible subarrays and simulate their reversal, calculating the resulting number of inversions. However, simulating each reversal naively would be too slow for large arrays (O(n^3)).\n\nInstead, we use a more efficient method:\n\n1. Precompute the number of inversions in the original array.\n2. For every possible subarray `[l, r]`, calculate how many inversions would be removed or added by reversing it.\n3. Track the maximum reduction in inversions achievable by any such reversal.\n4. The final answer is `n - (original_inversions - max_reduction)`.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- We count the original number of inversions in the array.\n- For each possible subarray, we:\n  - Count how many 2s are before 1s within the subarray (these will be reversed).\n  - Count how many 1s are after 2s outside the subarray (these will be affected by the reversal).\n- We compute the net change in inversions and track the best one.\n\n---\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\n    \n    # Count the number of inversions in the original array\n    inversions = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if a[i] == 2 and a[j] == 1:\n                inversions += 1\n    \n    max_reduction = 0\n    \n    # For every possible subarray [l, r]\n    for l in range(n):\n        count_2 = 0\n        count_1 = 0\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # If current element is 2, increment count_2\n            if a[r] == 2:\n                count_2 += 1\n            # If current element is 1, increment count_1\n            elif a[r] == 1:\n                count_1 += 1\n            \n            # Compute the number of 2s before 1s in the subarray\n            inner_inv = count_2 * count_1\n            # Compute the number of 1s before 2s outside the subarray\n            # These are the ones that would become 2 before 1 when reversed\n            outer_inv = 0\n            for i in range(l):\n                if a[i] == 2:\n                    outer_inv += count_1\n            for i in range(r + 1, n):\n                if a[i] == 1:\n                    outer_inv += count_2\n            \n            # Total inversions after reversal = original_inversions - inner_inv + outer_inv\n            total = inversions - inner_inv + outer_inv\n            reduction = inversions - total\n            max_reduction = max(max_reduction, reduction)\n    \n    print(n - (inversions - max_reduction))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- The algorithm runs in O(n²) time due to the nested loops over subarrays and counting operations.\n- This is efficient enough for `n ≤ 2000`.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nFor input:\n```\n4\n1 2 1 2\n```\n\nThe original number of inversions is 1.
