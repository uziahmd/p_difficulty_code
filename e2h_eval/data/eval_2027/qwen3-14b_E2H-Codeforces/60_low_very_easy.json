Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S after each modification. The key here is understanding which Morse code strings are valid (i.e., they correspond to actual letters) and then figuring out all possible substrings of S that form these valid codes.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that each valid Morse code string is of length 1-4, and there are four invalid ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So, any substring of S that is of length 1-4 and not one of these four is considered a valid letter. But since we're looking for sequences of letters, each such valid substring represents a single letter, and sequences can be formed by concatenating multiple such letters. However, the problem says that the answer counts all non-empty sequences of letters that are represented by some substring of S. Wait, no— the wording is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe task is to find the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. Oh right! So each such sequence is a concatenation of one or more letters, and each letter is represented by a valid Morse code string. However, the entire sequence's Morse code is a substring of S. Wait, no. Wait, the way it's phrased is: the sequence of letters is represented by some substring of S. That means that the entire Morse code of the sequence must be a substring of S. For example, if the sequence is two letters, their Morse codes are concatenated, and that concatenated string must be a substring of S.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the sequence is \"AB\", where A is represented by \"1\" and B by \"11\". Then the Morse code for the sequence would be \"111\", which is the concatenation of A's code and B's code. So, the problem wants to count all possible sequences of letters such that their concatenated Morse code is a substring of S. But how do we count that?\n\nBut the problem says that each letter's Morse code is a string of 1-4 characters. So, for example, if S is \"111\", then the possible substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\". Each of these substrings can be a valid Morse code for a letter. Then, the sequences of letters would be all possible ways to split those substrings into valid Morse codes. For example, the substring \"111\" can be split as \"1\"+\"1\"+\"1\" (three letters), \"1\"+\"11\" (two letters), \"11\"+\"1\" (two letters), or \"111\" (one letter). Each of these splits represents a different sequence. So the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThis feels like a dynamic programming problem. Let's think about the total number of sequences after each step. Let's consider that for each position in the string S, we can track some state that allows us to calculate the number of valid sequences up to that point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: whenever we add a new character to S, we can look at all possible suffixes of the current string (the new S) and check if they form a valid Morse code. For each valid suffix, we can add the number of ways that the rest of the string can be split into sequences.\n\nWait, but the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S (each of which is a valid Morse code string) multiplied by the number of ways to split them into valid letters. No, that's not quite right. Because each substring can be split in multiple ways. For example, the substring \"111\" can be split into three letters, two letters, etc. So the total number of sequences is the sum for each possible substring of S (of length between 1 and 4, but also longer? No, because each letter's code is of length 1-4. So the entire substring that represents a sequence of letters must be a concatenation of such codes. Therefore, the entire substring must be of length equal to the sum of the lengths of the individual codes. So, the length of the substring can be any length, as long as it can be partitioned into parts of length 1-4. But the problem is that each such partition corresponds to a different sequence of letters.\n\nSo, for example, the entire string S could be split into multiple letters, and each split is a different sequence. But how to count",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code. Each letter in Morse code is represented by a string of length 1 to 4, composed of dots (0) and dashes (1), with four specific invalid strings excluded.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Valid Morse Codes**: Identify all valid Morse code strings of lengths 1 to 4, excluding the four invalid ones.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the number of valid sequences that can be formed up to each position in the string `S`.\n3. **Efficient Updates**: After each character addition to `S`, check all possible suffixes of the current string to determine if they form valid Morse codes. Use these valid suffixes to update the DP array efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    S = []\n    # Precompute valid Morse codes\n    valid = set()\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        for bits in range(0, 2**length):\n            s = bin(bits)[2:].zfill(length)\n            if s not in [\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"]:\n                valid.add(s)\n    \n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # empty string\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(c)\n        curr_len = i\n        # Check all possible suffixes ending at i\n        total = 0\n        for j in range(i, max(0, i - 4), -1):\n            substring = ''.join(S[j-1:i])\n            if substring in valid:\n                total += dp[j - 1]\n                total %= MOD\n        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + total) % MOD\n        print(dp[i])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, with the first line indicating the number of modifications to the string `S`.\n2. **Valid Morse Codes Set**: A set of valid Morse code strings is precomputed by generating all possible combinations of 0s and 1s of lengths 1 to 4, excluding the four invalid strings.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array is used where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences up to the i-th character of `S`.\n4. **Suffix Checks**: For each new character added to `S`, we check all possible suffixes of lengths 1 to 4. If a suffix is a valid Morse code, it contributes to the count of valid sequences based on previous counts stored in the `dp` array.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the numbers can get very large, all operations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$ to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.\n\nThis approach efficiently updates the count of valid sequences after each modification to `S`, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of 3000 modifications.",
