Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent each block? Since there are n roads, each block is determined by the arrangement of these lines. But directly representing all possible blocks isn't feasible because the number can be exponential in n. However, since we only need to find the shortest path between two specific blocks (home and university), perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of considering each block, think of each region as being defined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, the block lies on one side of the line or the other. So, for each road, the home point will be on one side, and the university on some other side. The key is that moving between adjacent blocks requires crossing exactly one road. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nBut how do I model the adjacency between regions? Well, two regions are adjacent if they share a common boundary, which would mean that they differ by exactly one road's sign. Wait, no. Because two regions can be separated by multiple roads, but adjacent regions must differ by exactly one road. Because if two regions are adjacent, their common boundary is a segment of a road. So, moving from one to another requires crossing that road. Thus, the adjacency is determined by flipping the sign of exactly one road's equation.\n\nSo, the problem becomes similar to a graph where each node represents a state of the signs of the roads. Each node is a tuple of signs (for each road, whether the home point is on the positive or negative side of the road). But with n roads, there are 2^n possible states. However, n can be up to 300, so 2^300 is way too big. That's impossible to handle directly. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm, so what's another way? Let's think about the problem as a BFS problem where each state is the set of roads that separate the current block from the home. But again, with n=300, that's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe the minimal number of steps is equal to the minimal number of roads that separate the home and the university. Because each step crosses one road. So, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that you have to cross to get from the home to the university. But how do you compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where nodes are the blocks, and edges exist between blocks that share a common boundary. Then, the problem is to find the shortest path between the home's block and the university's block. However, the issue is how to represent the blocks and find their neighbors.\n\nBut given that the number of blocks could be huge, we need a way to model this without explicitly enumerating all blocks.\n\nAnother thought: For any two points not on any road, their blocks are connected by a path that crosses roads. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that separate the home and the university. Wait, but how do we find that?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of hyperplanes. Each road divides the plane into two halves. The home and university are in different regions. The minimal steps required to get from home to university is the minimal number of roads that you need to cross. But each step allows you to cross one road. However, the minimal number of crossings depends on how the roads separate the two points.\n\nWait, but the minimal number of crossings is the minimal number of roads that separate the home and the university. Because each time you cross a road, you can change your position relative to that road. But to reach the university, you need to cross roads that separate the home from the university. \n\nWait, but how to model this? For example, suppose there are two roads. If the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads, then you can cross one road, then the other, but maybe there's a way to cross them in some order. But the minimal steps would be 2. But if the two roads are parallel, then the home and university are on opposite sides of both, but you can cross one road once, but that would take you to a region that is on the same side of the other road as the university. So, maybe you need to cross both roads. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that separate the home and the university. How can we find that?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. Each road can be considered as a hyperplane. The home and university are points in the plane. For each road, the home and university are on the same side or different sides. Let's define for each road i, a value s_i which is 0 if the home and university are on the same side of road i, or 1 if they are on different sides. Then, the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed, which is the minimal number of roads that are separating the two points. Because each step crosses one road. So, if the two points are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps is k. But is this correct?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the home and university are separated by two roads. Then, you can cross one road, then another. So two steps. But what if the two roads are not overlapping? Like, imagine two roads that cross each other. The home is in one quadrant, the university in the opposite. Then, you need to cross both roads, so two steps. So the minimal steps equals the number of roads that separate them.\n\nBut how to compute the number of roads that separate the two points?\n\nYes! Because each road that separates the two points contributes to the count. The minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate the two points. Because each step allows you to cross one road, and you need to cross each road that separates the two points once. But how can that be?\n\nWait, no. Suppose there are two roads that cross each other, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both. Then, the minimal steps is 2. But if you cross one road first, then the other, you end up in the desired region. But if there's a way to cross a single road that somehow connects them? No, because if the two points are separated by two roads, then they are in different regions. So you need to cross both roads. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nWait, but how to compute that? For each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the minimal steps. But why is that?\n\nLet me think of a case where the home and university are separated by two roads. But those two roads are parallel. So, the home is on one side of both roads, and the university is on the other side. Then, you have to cross both roads. So steps = 2. Which matches the count. But suppose there's a third road that is between them. Wait, but that would be part of the count.\n\nBut what if there's a road that separates them, but the home and university are on opposite sides of that road, but also another road that is not separating them. Then, the minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nWait, but wait! Let's take the sample input. Let's look at the first example:\n\nSample Input 1:\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are 0x +1y +0=0 (which is y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor the home (1,1), check each road:\n\nFirst road: y=0. The home is at y=1>0. The university is at y=-1 <0. So they are on opposite sides. So this road counts.\n\nSecond road: x=0. Home is x=1>0, university is x=-1 <0. Opposite sides. So count is 2. Output is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nAnother sample input: second example. Home (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. Let's see:\n\nFor each road:\n\nRoad 1: x=0. Home is positive, university negative. So opposite. Count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0. Same as above. Count +=1.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 = 0. Let's plug in home (1+1-3) = -1 <0. University (-1-1-3) = -5 <0. Both are on the same side (negative). So no count. So total count is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nSo the sample outputs match this approach. So this suggests that the answer is simply the number of roads that separate the home and university. But why?\n\nBecause each such road must be crossed once. And since each step allows crossing one road, the minimal steps is exactly the count. But how to prove this?\n\nAssume that the home and university are separated by k roads. Then, the minimal steps is k. Because each step allows you to cross one road. So, you can cross each of the k roads once. But why can't there be a path that crosses fewer roads?\n\nSuppose that there is a path that crosses m roads, where m <k. Then, the home and university would be separated by at most m roads. But since the original count is k, this would be a contradiction. Therefore, the minimal steps is exactly the count of roads that separate the two points.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where there are two roads that are not separating the two points, but the points are in different regions. Wait, but if two points are in different regions, then there must be at least one road that separates them. So the count is the minimal steps. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo the solution is:\n\nFor each road, check whether home and university are on opposite sides of the road. Sum the count of such roads. That sum is the answer.\n\nBut how to check whether two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nFor a line ax + by + c = 0, a point (x,y) is on one side if ax + by + c is positive, and the other if it's negative. So, for the home point (x1,y1) and university (x2,y2), compute the values:\n\nval1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\nIf val1 * val2 < 0, then they are on opposite sides. So we count this road.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that neither home nor university lie on any road. So val1 and val2 can't be zero. So the product is either positive or negative. \n\nThus, the algorithm is straightforward:\n\nRead home and university coordinates.\n\nRead n roads.\n\nFor each road, compute val1 and val2. If their product is negative, increment the count.\n\nOutput the count.\n\nWait, but this seems too simple. Let me test with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0 1 0 (y=0) and 1 0 0 (x=0).\n\nFor first road: val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: val1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1. Total 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 1 0 0 (x=0), 0 1 0 (y=0), 1 1 -3 (x + y -3 =0).\n\nFirst road: same as before, count +=1.\n\nSecond road: same, count +=1.\n\nThird road: val1 = 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So no count. Total 2 → correct.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples. What about other cases?\n\nLet me think of a case where two points are separated by one road. Then the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: two roads that are parallel. Suppose home is on one side of both, university on the other. Then the count is 2. So steps is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: two roads that cross. Home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then the count is 2. Steps is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about a case where the two points are separated by three roads, but there's a way to cross two roads? For example, suppose three roads arranged in a triangle. The home is inside the triangle, the university outside. Then, the count is 3. But can you cross two roads to get out? No. Because to exit the triangle, you have to cross one road. But then you are outside. But the university is outside, but maybe in a region that requires crossing another road. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the home is inside the triangle formed by three roads. The university is outside. So, the home is on one side of each road, and the university is on the other side of each road. So the count is 3. But to get from the inside to the outside, you can cross any one road. Then, you are outside. But the university is in a region that may be adjacent to the triangle's exterior. So, the minimal steps would be 1. But according to our approach, the count is 3. That's a contradiction. So our approach is wrong.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Let me think again. \n\nIn this scenario, the home is inside the triangle, the university is outside. So, the home and university are separated by all three roads. According to our approach, the answer would be 3. But in reality, you can cross one road to get to the outside. So the minimal steps is 1. Which contradicts our approach.\n\nSo our initial reasoning was wrong. This means that the answer is not simply the count of roads separating the two points. So what's wrong with our previous logic?\n\nAh, because the count of roads that separate the two points is not the same as the minimal steps. The minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that you have to cross to get from the home to the university. But in the case of the triangle, the two points are separated by three roads, but you can cross just one road. So the answer should be 1, but the count is 3. So our previous approach is incorrect. \n\nThis shows that the initial idea is wrong. Therefore, we need to think differently.\n\nSo, what's the correct way to model this problem?\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of roads that you have to cross to get from the home's block to the university's block. Each crossing corresponds to moving through a road. So, the problem is to find the minimal number of roads that separate the two points in terms of their regions. But how?\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each node is a region, and edges connect regions that share a common border. The question is to find the shortest path between the home's region and the university's region. However, the challenge is how to model the regions and their adjacency without enumerating all regions.\n\nBut with n up to 300, enumerating all regions is impossible. So we need another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: model the problem as a graph where each node represents the set of roads that have been crossed. But again, that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: each region can be represented by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road i, the sign of (a_i x + b_i y + c_i) determines which side of the road the point is on. So, the home's region can be represented by the vector of signs (s_1, s_2, ..., s_n), where s_i is the sign of the home point for road i. Similarly for the university. \n\nThe problem now becomes finding the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped (i.e., changed sign) to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector. Each step corresponds to flipping exactly one sign (since crossing a road changes the sign for that road). However, this is only possible if the two regions are adjacent, which requires that they differ in exactly one sign. But this is not necessarily the case. \n\nWait, but two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. So, two regions that differ in exactly one sign are adjacent. However, if two regions differ in more than one sign, they are not adjacent. Therefore, the minimal steps between the two regions is the minimal number of sign changes needed to transform the home's sign vector into the university's sign vector, with the constraint that each step changes exactly one sign. \n\nThis is equivalent to finding the Hamming distance between the two vectors, but since each step can change one bit (sign), the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors. Wait, but the Hamming distance is the number of positions where the two vectors differ. So, the minimal steps is exactly the Hamming distance between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector. \n\nBut in the triangle example, the home is inside the triangle, and the university is outside. Let's say there are three roads forming the triangle. For each road, the home and university are on opposite sides. So the Hamming distance is 3. But in reality, you can cross one road to get to the university. So this contradicts the Hamming distance idea. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, no. Because the Hamming distance is the number of roads where the signs differ. But the university's region may be reachable by crossing a single road, which implies that the Hamming distance between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector is 1. But this is only possible if the university's sign vector differs from the home's in exactly one road. \n\nBut in the triangle example, the university is outside. Let's say the home is inside the triangle. For each road, the home is on one side (say, positive), and the university is on the other side (negative). So the Hamming distance is 3. However, if you cross one road, you are in a region that is on the negative side of that road, but positive of the others. Which is a different region than the university. The university is on the negative side of all three roads. So, the Hamming distance is 3. To reach that region, you need to cross all three roads. But that's impossible, because each step can only cross one road. So, the minimal steps is 3. But earlier thought that you could cross one road to get to the outside is wrong. \n\nWait, that's a crucial mistake. If the home is inside the triangle formed by three roads, then crossing one road takes you to the outside of that road, but the other two roads still separate you from the university. So, the university is in a region that is outside all three roads. So, to reach that region, you need to cross all three roads. But how? Because each step can cross one road. So, the minimal steps would be three. So the Hamming distance approach is correct. \n\nSo in the triangle example, the answer would be 3. Which is indeed the Hamming distance between the two vectors. So earlier thought that you could reach the university in one step was incorrect. \n\nSo, this brings us back to the initial idea. The minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the home and university's sign vectors. Which is the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nBut how can that be? Because for two points that are separated by k roads, the minimal steps is k. \n\nSo, the initial approach is correct. The problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo why did I think of the triangle example as being solvable in one step? Because I was mistaken. The university is outside all three roads. To reach it, you have to cross each of the three roads. \n\nWait, but perhaps there's a path that crosses one road, then another, then another. So three steps. Which is the same as the count. \n\nSo the initial approach is correct. \n\nSo the problem is to count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo why did I think there was a contradiction earlier? Because I misunderstood the structure of the regions. \n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides, and count the number of such roads. \n\nThis would be very easy to implement. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead home (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), n, and the n roads.\n\nFor each road, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If val1 * val2 < 0, increment the count.\n\nPrint the count.\n\nBut why does this work? Because the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points, which is the Hamming distance between the sign vectors. \n\nSo, the code is straightforward. \n\nLet me test with the triangle example. \n\nHome is inside the triangle (so for each of the three roads, val1 is positive). University is outside, so for each road, val2 is negative. So for each road, val1 * val2 < 0. So count is 3. Which is the correct answer. \n\nAnother example: two parallel roads. Home is on one side, university on the other. So count is 2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: two roads that cross. Home is in one quadrant, university in the opposite quadrant. So, for each road, they are on opposite sides. Count is 2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: two roads that cross. Home is in a region that is on the same side of one road and opposite of another. University is on the same side of both. So count is 1. Which is correct. \n\nSo, the code seems to work. \n\nBut why did the initial sample input work? Because it was exactly that. \n\nSo, the code is correct. \n\nNow, the code needs to read the input, process each line, compute val1 and val2 for each road, check if their product is negative, and count. \n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases. \n\nWhat if n is zero? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, the third line says n is between 1 and 300. So no. \n\nAnother edge case: when a road is vertical or horizontal. But the code handles that. \n\nAnother case: when a road's equation is something like 0x + 0y + c = 0? But the problem says that ai and bi are not both zero. So each road is a valid line. \n\nAnother case: when val1 is positive and val2 is negative, or vice versa. \n\nSo, the code seems solid. \n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nFor each a, b, c in the roads:\n\ncompute val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\ncompute val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0: count +=1\n\nPrint count.\n\nThat's it. \n\nLet me check the sample input again. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are:\n\n0 1 0 → y=0. val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → x=0. val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 =1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads:\n\n1 0 0 → val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1, val2 =1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\n0 1 0 → same as before, count +=1.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → val1 =1*1 +1*1 -3 = -1. val2 =1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. Total 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: home (0,0), university (0,1). One road: y=0.5. Then, val1 = 0*0 +1*0 -0.5 = -0.5. val2 = 0*0 +1*1 -0.5 = 0.5. product is negative → count is 1. So answer is 1. Which is correct. \n\nAnother test case: home (0,0), university (0,2). Two roads: y=0.5 and y=1.5. For both roads, home is below, university is above. So count is 2. So answer is 2. Which is correct. \n\nSo the code works. \n\nTherefore, the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input lines, process as described.\n\nBut note that in Python, reading the input may require handling multiple lines. Also, the input may be given as a single string split into lines. \n\nThe code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each a, b, c in roads:\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of strings. For example, the first sample input is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, the input is read from stdin, but the way the user presented the input is as a list of strings. However, the actual code should read from stdin. So, the code should read the first line as x1, y1, then the second line as x2, y2, then third line as n, then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, the first input is a string that contains multiple lines. For example, the first input is:\n\n\"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nLine 1: 1 1\n\nLine 2: -1 -1\n\nLine 3: 2\n\nLine 4: 0 1 0\n\nLine 5: 1 0 0\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, which is a sequence of lines.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    count = 0\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n            count +=1\n\n    print(count)\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nThe second line contains two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line contains n.\n\nThen n lines with a, b, c.\n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nBut let me check the sample input. For the first case:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut why is this the correct approach? Because the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because each step allows you to cross one road. So, you have to cross each road that separates the two points once. \n\nBut why is there no shorter path? Because the regions are divided by roads. If two points are separated by k roads, then there's no way to get from one to the other without crossing each of those roads. \n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common border, which is a segment of a road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each road is defined by a linear equation. The key insight is that moving from one block to another adjacent block requires crossing exactly one road.\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads that separate these two points. This is because each road that separates the home and university blocks must be crossed once to move from one block to another.\n3. **Mathematical Check**: For each road, check if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. This can be determined by evaluating the sign of the linear equation for both points. If the signs are different, the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university points are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Checking Road Separation**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university points. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the road, hence this road separates the two points.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads**: The count of such separating roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each step corresponds to crossing one road.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
