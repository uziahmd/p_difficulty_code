Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. The city is divided by infinite roads (lines), and each region between them is a block.\n\nThe key here is to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how can I represent the blocks in a way that allows me to compute the minimum steps?\n\nHmm. Since each road is a line, the arrangement of lines divides the plane into regions. However, directly representing all possible regions isn't feasible, especially since there could be up to 300 lines, leading to O(2^300) regions, which is impossible.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of each block as being determined by the position relative to each line. For each line, a point is either on one side or the other. So for n lines, each block can be represented by a binary string of length n, where each bit indicates which side of the line the point is on. But since the lines can be arranged in various ways, two different binary strings might not correspond to distinct blocks. However, for the purpose of adjacency, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one line's sign. Wait, no. Because two regions that are separated by a single line would be adjacent. But if two regions differ in more than one line's sign, they might not be adjacent.\n\nWait, but how does adjacency work here? Two blocks are adjacent if their common border has a non-zero length. That would happen when they share a common line segment (i.e., they are separated by exactly one line). So, for example, if two regions are separated by exactly one line, then they are adjacent. But if they are separated by multiple lines, maybe they aren't adjacent.\n\nBut how can we model this? Well, for any given block, the adjacent blocks are those that differ in exactly one line's sign. Because if you cross a line, you change the sign for that line. So, each time you cross a line, you flip the sign for that line. Therefore, the adjacency between blocks is equivalent to being adjacent in the hypercube of signs. However, this is only true if the lines are in general position, but perhaps in this problem, the adjacency is determined by flipping exactly one bit (i.e., crossing exactly one line).\n\nBut wait, two regions that are separated by a single line are adjacent. So, if two regions are separated by exactly one line, then they are adjacent. Therefore, in terms of their sign vectors, they differ in exactly one coordinate. Therefore, the adjacency graph is such that each node (block) is connected to others that differ in exactly one bit. However, this depends on the arrangement of the lines. For example, if two lines are parallel, then the regions on opposite sides of both lines might not be adjacent. Wait, but if two lines are parallel, then regions separated by them are not adjacent unless they are separated by exactly one line. Wait, maybe the adjacency is determined by the fact that two regions are separated by exactly one line. So regardless of how the lines are arranged, if two regions are separated by exactly one line (i.e., their sign vectors differ in exactly one line), then they are adjacent. But how can that be? Suppose you have two parallel lines. Then, the regions between them are adjacent to each other, but the regions on the same side of both lines are not adjacent. However, the sign vectors for these regions would differ in exactly one line. For example, suppose there are two parallel lines. A region on the left of both lines would have the same sign for both lines. If you cross one line, you get a region that is on the right of that line but left of the other. So their sign vectors differ in one line. But those two regions are adjacent (they share a boundary). So perhaps the adjacency is indeed determined by differing in exactly one line's sign. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of steps between two nodes in a graph where each node is a sign vector (for all lines), and edges exist between nodes that differ in exactly one coordinate.\n\nBut how do we represent the sign vectors for the home and the university?\n\nThe home is at (x1, y1), and the university is at (x2, y2). For each line, we can compute the sign of (a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i). Since neither point is on any line, the sign is non-zero. So, for each line, the home has a sign (positive or negative), and same for the university.\n\nThe problem then becomes: find the minimum number of steps needed to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step flips exactly one bit (i.e., changes the sign for one line). Because each step corresponds to crossing a line, moving into an adjacent block.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because flipping one bit in the sign vector would correspond to moving across that line. But the question is whether the home and university's sign vectors can be connected via such steps, and what's the minimal number of steps.\n\nBut here's the thing: Each step is flipping one bit. So the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each differing bit requires a flip. However, that's only if the Hamming distance is the number of differing bits. Wait, but if two sign vectors differ in k bits, then the minimal steps required is k. Because each step can flip one bit. So the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors.\n\nWait, but that seems too easy. Let me think again. For example, if the home and university are in the same block (i.e., same sign vector), then the answer is 0. If they differ in one bit, then answer is 1. If they differ in two bits, then answer is 2. But is that possible?\n\nBut why? Suppose there are two lines. Let's say the home is in a region that is positive for both lines. The university is in a region that is negative for both. Then, the Hamming distance is 2. But how can you get from one to the other? You need to cross both lines. But each step crosses one line. So you can cross one line (step 1) to get to a region that is negative for one line, then cross the other line (step 2) to get to the region that is negative for both. So the minimal steps is 2. Which is the Hamming distance.\n\nBut what if the two regions differ in two bits, but there's a path that requires fewer steps? No, because each step can only flip one bit. So the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. Therefore, the answer is the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and the university.\n\nWait, that's a huge insight. So the problem reduces to computing for each line, the sign of the home and the university. Then, count the number of lines where the signs differ. That's the answer.\n\nBut why? Because each step can flip exactly one sign. So the minimal steps is the number of differing signs. Because each differing sign requires a flip. So, the answer is the Hamming distance between the two vectors.\n\nBut let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads:\n\nRoad 1: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0.\n\nRoad 2: 1x + 0y +0 = 0 → x=0.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 → positive.\n\nRoad 2: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1 → positive.\n\nSo home's sign vector is [1, 1].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative.\n\nRoad 2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative.\n\nSo sign vector is [-1, -1]. Comparing with home's, both signs are different. So Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are:\n\n1. x=0 (same as before)\n\n2. y=0 (same as before)\n\n3. x + y -3 =0 → x + y =3.\n\nCheck for home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: 1 → positive.\n\nRoad 2: 1 → positive.\n\nRoad 3: 1+1-3 = -1 → negative.\n\nSo home's sign vector is [1, 1, -1].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: -1 → negative.\n\nRoad 2: -1 → negative.\n\nRoad 3: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 → negative.\n\nSo sign vector is [-1, -1, -1].\n\nComparing with home's, the first two bits differ (from 1 to -1), third is same. So Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo this approach works for the sample cases. Therefore, the answer is simply the number of lines where the sign of the home and university differ.\n\nBut why is this correct? Because each step allows you to cross a line, flipping the sign for that line. Therefore, to go from the home's sign vector to the university's, you need to flip each differing line once. And since each flip is a step, the total steps is the number of differing lines.\n\nBut wait, what if there are overlapping lines or some other dependencies? For example, suppose two lines are the same. But the problem says that no two roads are the same. So each line is unique. Also, the problem says that the home and university are not on any line.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\nFor each line, compute the sign of home and university. Count the number of lines where the signs differ. That's the answer.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n lines. For each line, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). Check if they have the same sign. If not, increment the count.\n\nBut wait, how to check if the signs are different? For each line, compute val1 = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i. val2 = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i. If val1 * val2 < 0, then the signs are different. Otherwise, same.\n\nYes. Because if val1 and val2 are both positive or both negative, their product is positive. If they are different, product is negative.\n\nSo, for each line, check if val1 * val2 < 0. If yes, add 1 to the answer.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of n lines:\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's it? But why does this work? Because each differing sign implies that you need to cross that line once. And the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where you can cross a line multiple times, but somehow reach the target with fewer steps?\n\nNo, because each step can only cross one line. So, for each line that is a difference between the home and the university, you must cross it once. So the minimal steps is the number of differing lines.\n\nBut why is that? Let's think of the problem as a graph. Each node is a sign vector. Edges connect vectors that differ in exactly one bit. Then, the minimal steps between two nodes is the Hamming distance. Because each step changes one bit, and you need to change all differing bits.\n\nSo the minimal steps is indeed the number of differing lines.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nLet me check the sample inputs again.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1) and university (-1,-1). Two lines:\n\nLine 1: 0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0. For home, val1 = 1*1 +0 = 1. For university, 1*(-1) +0 = -1. So product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nLine 2: 1x +0y +0 =0 → x=0. val1 for home is 1*1 =1. val2 is -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1. Total count is 2 → output 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: three lines. The third line is x + y -3 =0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. So product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So no count. So the count is 2 (from first two lines) → output 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are in same block. Then, all lines have same sign. So count is 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: home and university differ in one line. Output 1.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. But why is this problem considered very hard? Because perhaps the initial approach is not obvious. But once you model it as the Hamming distance, it's easy.\n\nBut let me think again. Are there any cases where the answer is not the Hamming distance?\n\nSuppose there are two lines, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both lines. So Hamming distance is 2. But is there a way to reach in 2 steps?\n\nYes: cross first line, then cross second line. So answer is 2.\n\nBut what if the two lines are parallel. Then, the regions are arranged such that crossing one line and then the other is possible. So the answer is still 2.\n\nAnother scenario: suppose there are three lines, and the home and university differ in two lines. Then, answer is 2 steps. So the code would return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each line whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such lines is the answer.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead input:\n\nThe input is read from stdin. The first line is x1, y1. Second line x2, y2. Third line is n. Then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, the input is given as two separate test cases? Or perhaps the user provided two examples. But the actual code should read from standard input. So the code will process the input as per the problem statement.\n\nSo the code should read:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n from third line.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's the code. But why is this problem considered hard? Because perhaps the initial thinking is complicated, but once you realize that the answer is the Hamming distance, it's easy.\n\nBut perhaps there is a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWhat if a line is such that the home and university are on the same side, but the line is not between them? For example, if the line is far away. But in that case, the sign is same, so no count. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there are lines that are crossed multiple times? But the code counts only if the signs differ. So even if the line is crossed multiple times, but the final sign is same as the initial, it's not counted. Which is correct.\n\nYes, because the home and university are in different blocks. So, for each line, if the home and university are on the same side, then that line doesn't separate them. So, the code counts the number of lines that separate the home and university. Each such line must be crossed once. Hence, the minimal steps is the count.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each block can be represented by a sign vector relative to each road. If a point is on one side of a road, it has a positive sign, and if it is on the other side, it has a negative sign. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university positions relative to all roads. This is because each differing sign indicates a need to cross that road, which corresponds to moving from one block to an adjacent block.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Sign Calculation:** For each road, the values of the home and university positions relative to the road are calculated. These values determine the sign (positive or negative) of the position relative to the road.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation:** By checking if the product of these values is negative, we determine if the home and university positions lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, the count is incremented, indicating a need to cross that road.\n4. **Output Result:** The count of such roads (where the home and university are on opposite sides) is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps using a direct calculation based on the relative positions of the home and university with respect to each road, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
