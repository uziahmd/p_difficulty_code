Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent each block? Well, since each block is defined by the arrangement of the roads, maybe we can represent each block by the sign of each road's equation. Because for each line, a point is either on one side or the other. Since the home and university are not on any road, they are in some region.\n\nSo for each road, the home's position relative to it (like which side of the line it's on) can be determined. Similarly for the university. Then, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because crossing a road would flip the sign of that road's equation. So the adjacency is determined by flipping one sign.\n\nWait, but how do I model the blocks? Because each block can be represented by a vector of signs for each road. For example, if there are n roads, each block can be represented by a binary string (or a tuple) of +1 or -1 for each road, indicating which side of the line the block is on. However, since there are n roads, the number of possible blocks could be up to 2^n, which for n=300 would be way too big. But n is up to 300, so 2^300 is impossible to handle directly. That's not feasible.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are in some blocks, and we need to find the minimal steps between them. How can we model this without considering all possible blocks?\n\nAlternative approach: think of each block as a node in a graph, and edges exist between nodes that are adjacent (i.e., differ by exactly one road's sign). Then the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between the home's block and the university's block. But with n up to 300, the number of possible blocks is 2^300, which is impossible to represent directly. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm. So what's another way to model this? Let's think about the problem differently. Each step corresponds to changing the sign of exactly one road. So the minimal steps between the home and university's block is the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped to go from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration. But how?\n\nWait, but the home and university's sign configurations are fixed. Let me think. Let's compute for each road, whether the home is on the positive or negative side. Similarly for the university. Let's call these two vectors H and U. The problem is to find the minimal number of roads where H and U differ. Wait, no. Because each step can flip one road's sign. But how does that relate to the difference between H and U?\n\nWait, suppose H and U have k differences. Then, the minimal steps would be k? Because each step can flip one road's sign. But that would be possible only if the steps can be done in such a way. But is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because the blocks are connected if they differ in exactly one road. So the problem becomes similar to finding the Hamming distance between the two vectors. Because each step allows you to change one bit (the sign of one road). Therefore, the minimal steps would be the number of roads where H and U differ. But wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose H and U differ in two roads. Then, you can go from H to a block that differs in one road, then to another that differs in another road. So the minimal steps is 2. Which is the Hamming distance. So yes, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors. So the answer is simply the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nWait, but why is that? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which flips the sign of that road. So the minimal steps is the number of roads where the home and university are on different sides. Because each such road needs to be crossed once. And since each step can cross one road, the minimal steps is the count of differing roads.\n\nWait, but this seems too simple. Let's look at the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0, and 1x+0y+0=0 → x=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nCheck for each road:\n\nRoad 1: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common border between blocks, which corresponds to crossing one road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each block can be represented by the sign of the result of the line equation for each road. Moving from one block to another involves crossing a road, which changes the sign of that road's equation.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. This is equivalent to calculating the Hamming distance between the sign configurations of the home and university positions relative to all roads.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road, determine the sign of the result when evaluating the home and university coordinates.\n   - Count the number of roads where the signs differ for the home and university positions. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    \n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute the sign for home and university for each road\n    home_signs = []\n    uni_signs = []\n    \n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        # We just need the sign, so we can use the sign of the value\n        home_sign = 1 if val_home > 0 else -1\n        uni_sign = 1 if val_uni > 0 else -1\n        home_signs.append(home_sign)\n        uni_signs.append(uni_sign)\n    \n    # Count differing signs\n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, uni_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n    \n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home and university, along with the equations of the roads.\n- **Sign Calculation**: For each road, the sign of the result of plugging the home and university coordinates into the road's equation is calculated. This determines which side of the road each point lies on.\n- **Difference Counting**: The number of roads where the signs differ between the home and university positions is counted. This count directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each differing sign indicates a road that must be crossed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads, ensuring it handles the upper constraint limits effectively.",
