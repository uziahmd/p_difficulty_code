Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the blocks are structured. Each road divides the plane into regions. The key here is that moving between blocks requires crossing a road, but only if the blocks share a common segment (not just a point). So, two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road. \n\nBut how do I model this? Well, maybe we can model each block as a node in a graph, and edges exist between nodes if they are adjacent. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block. However, the problem is that there are infinitely many blocks, so we can't model all of them directly. \n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Since each road is a line, the arrangement of roads forms a planar graph. But how can we represent the regions (blocks) in a way that allows us to compute adjacency?\n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the regions. For each line, a point can be on one side or the other. If two regions are separated by exactly one line, then they are adjacent. But how to determine which regions are adjacent?\n\nAnother approach: For any given point (home or university), the number of roads that separate it from the origin. Wait, but how does that help? Maybe the key is to model the problem using BFS, where each state is determined by the sign of each road equation evaluated at the current point. \n\nWait, here's an idea: Each block can be uniquely identified by the signs of the equations of all the roads. For example, for each road, the block is on one side of the line. So, for each road i, we can compute the sign of a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i. Since the home and university are not on any road, their signs are all non-zero. \n\nNow, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. But if two blocks differ in more than one road's sign, then they are not adjacent. Because to move between them, you would have to cross multiple roads, which isn't allowed in one step. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, imagine two roads that cross each other. The regions divided by them form four blocks. Each adjacent pair of blocks differs by exactly one road's sign. But if two blocks are separated by two roads, then their signs differ in two positions. But are those blocks adjacent? No. Because to get from one to the other, you'd have to cross two roads. But according to the problem statement, moving between two blocks requires that they share a common border (a segment of line). Which would require that they are separated by exactly one road. \n\nSo, the adjacency between blocks is equivalent to differing in exactly one road's sign. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign changes required to go from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration, where each step flips exactly one sign. \n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of each block as a binary vector (though with n elements, each being +1 or -1, depending on the sign of the road's equation evaluated at that point). However, since the roads are infinite, the number of possible configurations is 2^n, which is way too big when n is up to 300. But wait, n can be 300, and 2^300 is impossible to handle directly. So that approach is not feasible. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are in some blocks. So, perhaps the minimal steps between them is the number of roads that separate them. Wait, no. Because each step can flip one sign. So, the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors. But wait, that's only if you can flip each bit individually. However, the Hamming distance is the number of differing bits. But the problem is that the actual movement between blocks is possible if they differ by exactly one road. So, the minimal steps would be the number of differing roads between home and university. Because each step can flip one road. \n\nWait, but that's only if the home and university are in different regions. Let me think. Suppose that the home and university have different signs for k roads. Then, the minimal steps would be k. Because each step you can flip one road's sign. But how?\n\nWait, for example, if the home and university differ in two roads, then you can go from home's region to a region that differs by one road, then to another",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Block Representation**: Each block can be represented by the signs of the equations of the roads evaluated at a point within that block. For each road, the sign (positive or negative) indicates which side of the road the point lies on.\n2. **Sign Configuration**: The home and university positions are not on any road, so their sign configurations for all roads are well-defined. The key insight is that two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between their sign configurations. This is because each step corresponds to flipping the sign of one road, moving from one block to an adjacent block.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute sign configuration for home and university\n    def get_signs(x, y):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n        return tuple(signs)\n    \n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1)\n    univ_signs = get_signs(x2, y2)\n    \n    # Count differing signs\n    diff = 0\n    for s1, s2 in zip(home_signs, univ_signs):\n        if s1 != s2:\n            diff += 1\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home, university, and the road equations.\n2. **Sign Configuration Calculation**: For both the home and university positions, we compute the sign configuration relative to each road. This configuration is a tuple where each element is either +1 or -1, indicating which side of the road the point lies on.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The number of differing signs between the home and university configurations gives the minimum number of steps required. Each differing sign corresponds to crossing a road, thus moving to an adjacent block.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of sign configurations and Hamming distance, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
