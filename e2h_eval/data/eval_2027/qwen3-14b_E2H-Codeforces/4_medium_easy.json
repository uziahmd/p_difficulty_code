The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Nikephoros and Polycarpus play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The input gives n, then the sequence A for Nikephoros, then sequence B for Polycarpus. For each round, we need to determine who wins, if anyone.\n\nThe challenge is that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how the sequences work. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo, for each round, we can compute their moves based on their respective sequences. But with n up to 2e9, checking each round is O(n), which is impossible. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can calculate the total number of losses without iterating all rounds.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the possible cycles. Since the sequences A and B are periodic, the combination of their moves will also have a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let me call this LCM as T. Because after T rounds, the pattern of moves for both players repeats.\n\nSo, for example, if m=3 and k=2, LCM(3,2)=6. So every 6 rounds, the sequence of moves between A and B repeats. Therefore, if we can compute the number of losses in one full cycle (T rounds), then multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the results from the remaining rounds (n mod T), that would be efficient.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Compute T = LCM(m, k). But since m and k can be up to 1000, their LCM can be up to 1e6 (since LCM(m, k) = m*k / GCD(m, k)), and since m and k are up to 1000, the maximum LCM would be 1000*1000 = 1e6. Which is manageable.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to T-1, compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and count the number of times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses in this T-round cycle.\n\n3. Then, compute how many full cycles there are in n rounds: full_cycles = n // T. And the remaining rounds: rem = n % T.\n\n4. Multiply the counts per cycle by full_cycles, then add the counts from the first 'rem' rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut wait, what if T is larger than n? Then, there's no full cycles, and we just process all n rounds once.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each possible round in the cycle (from 0 to T-1) what the outcome is.\n\nBut how do I compute the outcome for each round?\n\nFor each round index i (from 0 to T-1):\n\n- Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nThen, compare the two moves and determine who wins. For each such round, increment the counts for Nikephoros's loss and Polycarpus's loss accordingly.\n\nOnce I have the counts per cycle, I can calculate the total.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n- Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n\n- Compute for each of the T rounds, the outcome.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the number of losses for each player in the entire n rounds.\n\nNow, let's think about how to compute the LCM. To compute LCM(a, b), we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So first, compute GCD of m and k.\n\nBut how to compute GCD? Well, in Python, there's math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which they are here.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B. m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to T-1:\n\nget a = A[i % m], b = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine the outcome between a and b.\n\ncount how many times Nikephoros loses (so when a is beaten by b) and Polycarpus loses (when b is beaten by a).\n\nOnce we have per_cycle_nik (number of times Nikephoros loses in a cycle) and per_cycle_poly (same for Polycarpus), then:\n\ntotal_cycles = n // T\n\nremaining_rounds = n % T\n\ntotal_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n\ntotal_poly = total_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n\nThen, compute the number of losses in the first 'remaining_rounds' rounds of the cycle, and add to total_nik and total_poly.\n\nSo, the main thing is to precompute for each i in 0 to T-1, the outcome, and then for the remaining rounds, check the first rem rounds.\n\nBut for T up to 1e6, even for n up to 2e9, this is manageable. Because 1e6 is acceptable for precomputing.\n\nBut let's check the numbers. For m and k up to 1000, T can be up to 1e6. So for each of T rounds, we do O(1) processing. So total O(1e6) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the next step is to code this.\n\nNow, how to determine the outcome between a and b.\n\nLet's create a helper function that takes two characters (a and b) and returns who wins, or if it's a draw.\n\nFor example:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nElse:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beats paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nSo, for a and b:\n\nif (a, b) is (R, S) → a wins, so b loses → Nikephoros (a) wins, so Polycarpus (b) gets a spot.\n\nWait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if Nikephoros loses, he gets a spot. If Polycarpus loses, he gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each round, we need to check if Nikephoros's move is beaten by Polycarpus's move. If so, Nikephoros loses → his count increases by 1. Else, if Polycarpus's move is beaten by Nikephoros's move, then Polycarpus's count increases by 1. Else, draw.\n\nSo, for a and b:\n\nif a beats b → Polycarpus loses (so his count increases by 1)\n\nif b beats a → Nikephoros loses (his count increases by 1)\n\nelse: nothing.\n\nSo, how to code this.\n\nWe can have a helper function that returns (nik_loss, poly_loss) for a given a and b.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so b loses. So Nikephoros (a) wins, Polycarpus (b) loses → Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, so a loses. Nikephoros (a) loses → his count increases by 1.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes. So for each pair (a, b), we can compute the increments.\n\nSo, in the code, for each of the T rounds, we compute the a and b, then call this function and accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce we have per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly, then multiply by total_cycles and add the remaining part.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute GCD(m, k), then LCM = m * k // GCD.\n\nBut how to compute GCD in Python?\n\nIn Python, math.gcd(a, b) returns the GCD. However, note that math.gcd returns the positive GCD, and for Python 3.5 and above, it's available. Also, since m and k are positive integers, this is okay.\n\nBut for cases where m or k is zero? No, the problem says that m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nThen, T = compute_lcm(m, k).\n\nOnce T is computed, then for each i in 0 to T-1:\n\nget a = A[i % m], b = B[i % k]\n\nthen compute the (nik, poly) for this round.\n\nsum all nik and poly over the T rounds.\n\nThen, total_cycles = n // T\n\nrem = n % T\n\nSo, the total for the full cycles is total_cycles * (per_cycle_nik, per_cycle_poly)\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, we need to process the first rem rounds of the cycle (i from 0 to rem-1) and sum their contributions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nper_cycle_nik = 0\n\nper_cycle_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(T):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    nik, poly = get_result(a, b)\n\n    per_cycle_nik += nik\n\n    per_cycle_poly += poly\n\nThen, total_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n\ntotal_poly = total_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds:\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    nik, poly = get_result(a, b)\n\n    total_nik += nik\n\n    total_poly += poly\n\nBut wait, rem can be up to T-1, which is up to 1e6. So for n up to 2e9, this is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\", m=3. B is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nThen, for each of 12 rounds, compute the results.\n\nBut the sample input has 7 rounds. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the example explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → S beats P? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nThe sequences:\n\nNikephoros's A is RPS. So for rounds 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...:\n\nround 0: 0%3=0 → R\n\nround 1: 1%3=1 → P\n\nround 2: 2%3=2 → S\n\nround 3: 3%3=0 → R\n\nround 4: 4%3=1 → P\n\nround 5: 5%3=2 → S\n\nround 6: 6%3=0 → R\n\nPolycarpus's B is RSPP. So for rounds 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...\n\nround 0: 0%4=0 → R\n\nround 1: 1%4=1 → S\n\nround 2: 2%4=2 → P\n\nround 3: 3%4=3 → P\n\nround 4: 4%4=0 → R\n\nround 5: 5%4=1 → S\n\nround 6: 6%4=2 → P\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds (i from 0 to 6):\n\nRound 0: R vs R → draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1: P vs S → S beats P → Nikephoros (P) loses? Wait, let's check.\n\na is P (Nikephoros), b is S (Polycarpus). So the move is P vs S. According to rules: S beats P. So Polycarpus's move (S) beats Nikephoros's (P). So Nikephoros loses → his count increases by 1. So (1, 0). But according to the sample explanation, in the second round (which is round 1 here?), the sample says:\n\n\"In the first sample the game went like this: R - R. Draw. P - S. Nikephoros loses. S - P. Polycarpus loses. R - P. Nikephoros loses. P - R. Polycarpus loses. S - S. Draw. R - P. Nikephoros loses.\"\n\nWait, the rounds are numbered from 1 to 7. Let me check the sample explanation:\n\nThe first round is R vs R → draw. Then, the second round is P vs S. According to the code, in round 1 (i=1), the moves are P and S. So the code would compute that Nikephoros's move (P) is beaten by S (Polycarpus's move). So Nikephoros loses → his count increases by 1. So in the sample explanation, Nikephoros has 3 losses, and Polycarpus 2.\n\nSo for the first sample, the code would compute:\n\nIn the first 7 rounds, how many times each loses?\n\nLet me go through each of the 7 rounds:\n\nRound 0 (i=0): R vs R → draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1 (i=1): P vs S → S beats P → Nikephoros loses. (1, 0)\n\nRound 2 (i=2): S vs P → S beats P → Nikephoros (S) beats Polycarpus (P). So Polycarpus loses. (0, 1)\n\nRound 3 (i=3): R vs P → P beats R → Nikephoros (R) loses. (1, 0)\n\nRound 4 (i=4): P vs R → P beats R → Polycarpus (R) loses. (0, 1)\n\nRound 5 (i=5): S vs S → draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 6 (i=6): R vs P → R loses to P → Nikephoros loses. (1, 0)\n\nSo adding up these:\n\nNikephoros's losses: rounds 1, 3, 6 → 3.\n\nPolycarpus's losses: rounds 2, 4 → 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would compute for the first 7 rounds (n=7) the correct values.\n\nNow, let's see how the code would handle this.\n\nIn this case, T is LCM(3,4)=12. So for the first 7 rounds, rem is 7, which is less than T=12.\n\nSo the code would compute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly for 12 rounds. But for the sample, n=7, which is less than T=12, so total_cycles is 0, and rem is 7. So the code would process the first 7 rounds.\n\nThus, the code would correctly compute 3 and 2.\n\nAnother sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nBecause both sequences are R. So all rounds are draws. So no losses.\n\nSo the code would compute T = LCM(8, 1) = 8. For each of the 8 rounds, the moves are R vs R. So per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly are 0. Then, n=5, which is 0 full cycles and rem 5. So the code adds 0 for both.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if n is 0? But the problem says n ≥ 1.\n\nOther edge cases: when m or k is 1. Or when the sequences are same.\n\nAnother case: when all rounds are wins for one player.\n\nBut the code seems to handle all.\n\nNow, coding in Python:\n\nRead the input. But the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nWait, the input in the example is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the way the input is presented. Actually, the input is read as three lines: first line is n, second line is A, third line is B. So for the first sample input, the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, in code, read n as int(input()), then A = input().strip(), B = input().strip().\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the helper function. But perhaps inline.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def get_result(a, b):\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            return (0, 0)\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # a wins, so b loses → Polycarpus (b) gets a spot. So Nikephoros's loss is 0, Poly's is 1.\n\n            return (0, 1)\n\n        else:\n\n            # b wins, so a loses → Nikephoros (a) gets a spot. So (1, 0)\n\n            return (1, 0)\n\n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // gcd_val\n\n    # Now, compute per cycle counts\n\n    per_cycle_nik = 0\n\n    per_cycle_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        nik, poly = get_result(a, b)\n\n        per_cycle_nik += nik\n\n        per_cycle_poly += poly\n\n    # Now compute total_cycles and rem\n\n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n\n    rem = n % lcm\n\n    total_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n\n    total_poly = total_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n\n    # Now process rem rounds\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        nik, poly = get_result(a, b)\n\n        total_nik += nik\n\n        total_poly += poly\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first sample's lcm is 12, and n is 7. So rem is 7. So the code loops from 0 to 6 (7 rounds). Which is correct.\n\nThis should work.\n\nBut what about when n is exactly equal to lcm? Then rem is zero, and no extra rounds are processed.\n\nBut what about when lcm is zero? No, m and k are at least 1, so lcm is at least 1.\n\nNow, test the first sample input:\n\nn=7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4). lcm is 12.\n\nper_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly are calculated for 12 rounds. Then total_cycles = 7//12 = 0, rem=7. So the code processes 7 rounds, which gives the correct 3 and 2.\n\nAnother test case: when n is 12. Then total_cycles is 1, rem is 0. So the code adds per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly once.\n\nBut what is per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly for the first sample?\n\nWell, let's compute for all 12 rounds. Let's see:\n\nFor i from 0 to 11.\n\nBut maybe that's tedious. But the code would compute it correctly.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when m=1 and k=1. Then lcm is 1. So for each round, the same move. So if A[0] and B[0] are same, then no spots. Else, one of them gets a spot.\n\nSo for n=1e9, the code would compute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly once, multiply by 1e9, and rem is zero.\n\nThus, the code is efficient.\n\nNow, implement this code in Python.\n\nBut note that for very large n (like 2e9), and lcm up to 1e6, the code will run in O(1e6) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when the number of rounds is extremely large (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Sequences**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. This means their move sequences repeat after a certain number of rounds.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The combined cycle of both players' sequences can be determined using the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their respective sequences. This LCM gives the number of rounds after which both sequences realign to their starting positions.\n3. **Precompute Outcomes**: For each round within one full cycle (determined by the LCM), precompute the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Scale Results**: Using the precomputed results for one cycle, calculate the total number of losses over all full cycles and then handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def get_result(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return (0, 0)\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n    \n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // gcd_val\n    \n    per_cycle_nik = 0\n    per_cycle_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = get_result(a, b)\n        per_cycle_nik += nik\n        per_cycle_poly += poly\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n    rem = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nik = total_cycles * per_cycle_nik\n    total_poly = total_cycles * per_cycle_poly\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = get_result(a, b)\n        total_nik += nik\n        total_poly += poly\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the move sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the cycle length after which both sequences repeat.\n3. **Result Precomputation**: For each round within the LCM cycle, the outcome (losses for each player) is determined and accumulated.\n4. **Scaling Results**: The total number of losses is calculated by multiplying the precomputed values by the number of full cycles and adding the results from the remaining rounds after the full cycles.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring that the solution is computed in linear time relative to the LCM of the sequence lengths, which is feasible even for large inputs.",
