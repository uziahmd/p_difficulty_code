The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly isn't feasible. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Nikephoros uses sequence A, which repeats cyclically. Similarly, Polycarpus uses sequence B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine which move each player makes. Then determine who wins, and count the losses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't loop through each round. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, compute the number of times each scenario occurs in a full cycle, then multiply by the number of cycles and add the remainder.\n\nLet me think. The moves for each player are periodic. For example, Nikephoros's moves repeat every m rounds, and Polycarpus's every k rounds. So the combined pattern of their moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because LCM(m, k) is the least common multiple of m and k. So the combined sequence of (A's move, B's move) repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. \n\nSo the idea is: calculate the number of full cycles of LCM(m, k) in n rounds, and then the remaining rounds. For each full cycle, we can precompute how many times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Then multiply by the number of full cycles. Then handle the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, how to compute the LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need to compute GCD of m and k. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive here, it's okay.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to period_length-1, determine the moves of A and B, then determine who wins. Keep track of the total number of losses for each player in one full period.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period_length. The remaining rounds are remainder = n % period_length.\n\n4. Multiply the per-period losses by total_periods. Then, simulate the first 'remainder' rounds of the next period and add those losses.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round?\n\nFor any given round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k]. So for each i in 0..period_length-1, we can compute the moves.\n\nBut period_length could be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000, their LCM could be up to 1e6). For example, if m=1000 and k=1000, and they are coprime, LCM is 1e6. So for each of these 1e6 rounds, we can precompute the outcome. Then, for n up to 2e9, the total processing would be O(1e6), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute the per-period counts (losses for A and B in one period), then multiply by the number of full periods. Then compute the remainder rounds and add their counts.\n\nNow, how to compute the per-period counts?\n\nLet's create a loop for each i from 0 to period_length - 1:\n\nFor each i, get a_move = A[i % m], b_move = B[i % k]. Then determine who wins. For each such pair, increment the counts accordingly.\n\nBut for each i in 0 to period_length-1, we can calculate that.\n\nOnce we have the counts per period, then:\n\ntotal_A_loss = full_periods * per_period_A_loss + remainder_A_loss\n\nSame for B.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nCalculate per_period_A and per_period_B, and then calculate the remainder part.\n\nNow, the next thing is to compute for each i in 0 to period_length-1, the outcome. But how to compute the outcome between a_move and b_move?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes two characters (like 'R' and 'S') and returns which player wins, or if it's a draw.\n\nThe rules are:\n\n- Rock beats scissors (R beats S)\n- Scissors beat paper (S beats P)\n- Paper beats rock (P beats R)\nIf same, draw.\n\nSo, for a_move and b_move:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if a beats b. If yes, then B loses (so Nikephoros (A) wins, so Polycarpus (B) gets a loss. So Nikephoros's loss count is not increased. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So, for each round, if A wins, then B gets a red spot (so B's count increases by 1). If B wins, A's count increases by 1. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check whether A's move beats B's move. If yes, then B loses, so B's count increases. Else, if B's move beats A's, then A's count increases. Else, draw.\n\nSo, for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: no change.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a beats b):\n\nthen B loses. So B's count +=1.\n\nelse:\n\nA loses. So A's count +=1.\n\nSo how to code this.\n\nFor example, for a_move = 'R', b_move = 'S': A wins. So B's count increases by 1.\n\nAnother example: a is 'S', b is 'P': A wins. B's count increases.\n\nSo, how to check if a beats b.\n\nWe can have a dictionary or a helper function.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a lookup table. For example, for a given a and b:\n\nif (a, b) is in the set of winning combinations for A.\n\nLike:\n\nwinning_combinations = {\n    ('R', 'S'),\n    ('S', 'P'),\n    ('P', 'R')\n}\n\nSo, if (a, b) is in this set, then A wins, B loses. Otherwise, if (b, a) is in the set, then B wins, A loses. Else, it's a draw.\n\nSo for each pair, check if a beats b. If yes, B's loss count increases. Else if b beats a, A's loss count increases. Else, nothing.\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to period_length-1, we can compute this.\n\nOnce we have the per_period counts, then the rest is straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this for the period_length, which could be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1e3 each). For 1e6 iterations, even with n up to 2e9, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n, then read A and B.\n\nThen compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute the LCM of m and k.\n\nThen, compute period_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nThen, compute per_period_A and per_period_B.\n\nThen, compute how many full periods there are in n rounds: full_cycles = n // period_length.\n\nremaining_rounds = n % period_length.\n\nThen, total_A = full_cycles * per_period_A + count_remaining_A.\n\nSame for B.\n\nNow, how to compute per_period_A and per_period_B:\n\nInitialize per_period_A = 0, per_period_B = 0.\n\nFor i in 0 to period_length-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine the outcome, and add to per_period_A and per_period_B accordingly.\n\nBut for i from 0 to period_length-1, which is up to 1e6 steps, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, for the remaining_rounds, we need to simulate the first 'remaining_rounds' rounds of the period. So for i in 0 to remaining_rounds-1:\n\nsame as before, but only for those i's.\n\nBut wait, the remaining_rounds could be up to period_length-1, which is up to 1e6 steps. So in total, the code would be O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A_str, B_str.\n\nm = len(A_str)\n\nk = len(B_str)\n\nCompute GCD(m, k) using math.gcd. Then LCM is m*k // gcd.\n\nThen compute period_length.\n\nThen compute per_period_A and per_period_B.\n\nThen compute full_cycles = n // period_length.\n\nremaining = n % period_length.\n\nThen, total_A = full_cycles * per_period_A + count_remaining_A.\n\nSame for B.\n\nNow, how to compute count_remaining_A and count_remaining_B?\n\nWe can loop over the first 'remaining' rounds, same as the period_length loop.\n\nSo, code steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing that.\n\nBut what about when period_length is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, so LCM is at least 1.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for very large n, like 2e9, but the code is O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo period_length is 12.\n\nNow, simulate 12 rounds.\n\nFor each i from 0 to 11:\n\ni % 3 gives 0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2.\n\ni % 4 gives 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3.\n\nSo for each i, get a and b.\n\nLet me compute the per_period counts.\n\nLet me do this step by step.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\ni | a (A[i%3]) | b (B[i%4]) | outcome\n0 | R (0%3=0) | R (0%4=0) → same → no loss.\n1 | P (1%3=1) | S (1%4=1) → P vs S. S beats P? No. Wait, S beats P? Wait, the rules: scissors (S) beats paper (P). So if a is P and b is S, then B's move (S) beats A's (P). So A loses. So A's count increases by 1.\n\nWait, in the first sample input, the first round is round 0 (assuming 0-based) ?\n\nIn the sample explanation, the first round is R vs R (draw), then P vs S (Nikephoros loses?), etc. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7.\n\nA is RPS (m=3), B is RSPP (k=4).\n\nThe rounds are 7 rounds. Let's see:\n\nRound 0: i=0 → A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw.\n\nRound 1: i=1 → A[1%3=1] is P, B[1%4=1] is S. P vs S. S beats P. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So A's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 2: i=2 → A[2%3=2] is S, B[2%4=2] is P. S vs P: S beats P. So A wins. B loses. So B's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 3: i=3 → A[0], B[3%4=3] → R vs P. P beats R. So B wins. A loses. A's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 4: i=4 → A[1], B[0] → P vs R. P beats R. So A wins. B loses. B's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 5: i=5 → A[2], B[1] → S vs S. Draw.\n\nRound 6: i=6 → A[0], B[2] → R vs P. B wins. A loses. A's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 7: i=7 → A[1], B[3] → P vs P. Draw.\n\nWait but in the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R-R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (so A's count is 1)\n\nRound 3: S vs P → Polycarpus loses (B's count is 1)\n\nRound 4: R vs P → Nikephoros loses (A's count 2)\n\nRound 5: P vs R → Polycarpus loses (B's count 2)\n\nRound 6: S vs S → draw\n\nRound 7: R vs P → Nikephoros loses (A's count 3)\n\nSo total for 7 rounds, A has 3, B has 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut according to the per-period calculation for 12 rounds, let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the sample is for 7 rounds, which is less than the period_length of 12. So the full_cycles is 0, and remaining_rounds is 7. So the code would process the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut for the per_period counts, in the 12 rounds, how many A and B losses?\n\nLet me compute for all 12 rounds.\n\nLet me list all 12 rounds:\n\ni from 0 to 11:\n\ni | a | b | outcome\n0: R vs R → draw → no loss.\n1: P vs S → B wins (A loses) → A +=1\n2: S vs P → A wins (B loses) → B +=1\n3: R vs P → B wins (A loses) → A +=1\n4: P vs R → A wins (B loses) → B +=1\n5: S vs S → draw → no loss.\n6: R vs P → B wins (A loses) → A +=1\n7: P vs S → B wins (A loses) → A +=1\n8: S vs R → A wins (S beats R?) Wait S vs R: R beats S. Wait no. Wait, Rock (R) beats Scissors (S). So if a is S and b is R, then B's move (R) beats A's S. So B wins. So A loses. So A's count increases by 1.\n\nWait for i=8:\n\ni=8 → i%3= 8%3= 2 → a is S. i%4= 8%4=0 → B[0] is R. So S vs R. B's move R beats A's S. So A loses. So A's count increases by 1.\n\ni=8: A's loss.\n\ni=9: i%3=0 → a=R. i%4=1 → B[1]=S. R vs S: A wins. B loses. So B's count increases by 1.\n\ni=9: B +=1.\n\ni=10: i%3=1 → a=P. i%4=2 → B[2]=P. P vs P: draw.\n\ni=10: no loss.\n\ni=11: i%3=2 → a=S. i%4=3 → B[3]=P. S vs P: A wins. B loses. B +=1.\n\nSo let's collect all per_period counts.\n\nLet me count for each round:\n\nRound 0: no change.\n\nRound 1: A +=1 → A:1, B:0.\n\nRound 2: B +=1 → A:1, B:1.\n\nRound 3: A +=1 → A:2, B:1.\n\nRound 4: B +=1 → A:2, B:2.\n\nRound 5: no change.\n\nRound 6: A +=1 → A:3, B:2.\n\nRound 7: A +=1 → A:4, B:2.\n\nRound 8: A +=1 → A:5, B:2.\n\nRound 9: B +=1 → A:5, B:3.\n\nRound 10: no change.\n\nRound 11: B +=1 → A:5, B:4.\n\nSo per_period_A is 5, per_period_B is 4.\n\nBut in the sample input, for 7 rounds, the code would have full_cycles = 0, remaining_rounds=7. So the code would process the first 7 rounds. Which in the above list, rounds 0-6 (i=0 to 6):\n\nIn the first 7 rounds (i=0 to 6), the A's count is 3 (from rounds 1,3,6) and B's count is 2 (from rounds 2,4). Which matches the sample output. So the code would correctly compute that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing the helper function to check who wins.\n\nBut in code, for each pair (a, b), we can check:\n\nif a == b: continue.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a, b) is in the winning combinations for A → B loses.\n\nElse, A loses.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # A wins, B loses → B's count increases by 1\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # B wins, A loses → A's count increases by 1\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nWait, the return is (A_loss, B_loss). So for each round, the function returns how much each player's loss count increases.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each pair, we can calculate delta_a and delta_b.\n\nSo in code, during the per_period calculation, for each i in 0 to period_length-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\ndelta_a, delta_b = get_result(a, b)\n\nper_period_A += delta_a\n\nper_period_B += delta_b\n\nSo that's the way.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\ngcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n\nlcm_val = m * k // gcd_val\n\n# Now compute per_period_A and per_period_B\n\nper_period_A = 0\n\nper_period_B = 0\n\nfor i in range(lcm_val):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    if a_move == b_move:\n\n        continue\n\n    # check who wins\n\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n        # A wins, B loses\n\n        per_period_B +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        # B wins, A loses\n\n        per_period_A +=1\n\nfull_cycles = n // lcm_val\n\nremaining = n % lcm_val\n\n# Now compute the remaining rounds\n\nremaining_A = 0\n\nremaining_B = 0\n\nfor i in range(remaining):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    if a_move == b_move:\n\n        continue\n\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n        remaining_B +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        remaining_A +=1\n\ntotal_A = full_cycles * per_period_A + remaining_A\n\ntotal_B = full_cycles * per_period_B + remaining_B\n\nprint(total_A, total_B)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when n=7, lcm_val is 12. So full_cycles is 0, and remaining is 7. The code loops for i in 0..6 (range(7)), which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7\n\nA is 'RPS' (m=3)\n\nB is 'RSPP' (k=4)\n\nlcm_val is 12.\n\nper_period_A and per_period_B are computed as 5 and 4, respectively.\n\nBut in the code, for the first 12 rounds, the per_period_A is 5? Let's check:\n\nEarlier analysis showed that in 12 rounds, the total A losses were 5 (from rounds 1,3,6,7,8) and B losses were 4 (rounds 2,4,9,11). So yes.\n\nBut when n is 7, full_cycles is 0, and remaining is 7. The remaining_A and remaining_B are computed for i in 0..6.\n\nWhich is:\n\ni ranges 0 to 6 (7 rounds). For those rounds, the code would calculate:\n\ni=0: R vs R → no change.\n\ni=1: P vs S → A wins → B +=1 → remaining_B is 1.\n\ni=2: S vs P → A wins → B +=1 → remaining_B is 2.\n\ni=3: R vs P → B wins → A +=1 → remaining_A is 1.\n\ni=4: P vs R → A wins → B +=1 → remaining_B is 3.\n\ni=5: S vs S → no change.\n\ni=6: R vs P → B wins → A +=1 → remaining_A is 2.\n\nSo remaining_A is 2, remaining_B is 3. So total_A is 0*5 + 2 = 2? But the sample output is 3 and 2. Wait, something's wrong here. Wait what's happening here.\n\nWait, the sample says that in 7 rounds, Nikephoros has 3 losses and Polycarpus 2. But according to this code's calculation, remaining_A is 2, and remaining_B is 3. Which would give 2 and 3, but that's not matching the sample. So there's a mistake here. What's wrong?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me recheck.\n\nLet me re-calculate the per-round outcomes for the first 7 rounds (i=0 to 6):\n\ni=0: R vs R → draw. No loss.\n\ni=1: A's move is A[1%3] = A[1] = 'P'; B's move is B[1%4] = B[1] = 'S'. P vs S. S beats P. So B wins. Therefore, A loses. So remaining_A increases by 1. So remaining_A is 1, remaining_B is 0.\n\nWait, earlier code logic was:\n\nif (a_move beats b_move) → B loses (so per_period_B +=1). Else, A loses (per_period_A +=1).\n\nSo in this case, a_move is P, b_move is S. Does a_move beat b_move? Let's see. The condition is:\n\nif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') → yes, R beats S. Or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') → S beats P. Or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R') → P beats R.\n\nIn this case, a_move is P, b_move is S. None of the conditions are met. Because P vs S: S is beaten by R, but P beats R. Wait, no. Wait, the code checks if a_move beats b_move. For P vs S, S is scissors. P is paper. Scissors cut paper. So S beats P. So a_move (P) does not beat b_move (S). So the code would go into else clause, and add 1 to per_period_A. So for i=1, the code adds 1 to remaining_A, not to remaining_B.\n\nBut earlier analysis said that in this case, B wins. So A loses. Which is correct. So in this case, the code adds 1 to remaining_A. So for i=1, remaining_A is 1, remaining_B is 0.\n\nBut earlier when I thought that in the first sample, the first round (i=1) is P vs S, Nikephoros loses. Which is correct. So in the code, the remaining_A is increased by 1. So for the first 7 rounds, the code's calculation for the remaining_A and remaining_B would be:\n\nLet me re-calculate:\n\nLet me go step by step for each of the 7 rounds (i from 0 to 6):\n\ni=0:\n\na = R, b = R → same. No change. remaining_A=0, B=0.\n\ni=1:\n\na = P, b = S. Check if a beats b. P vs S: S beats P. So the condition is false. So else clause: add 1 to remaining_A. So remaining_A=1, B=0.\n\ni=2:\n\na = S, b = P. Check if a beats b. S beats P → yes. So add 1 to remaining_B. Now, remaining_B=1.\n\ni=3:\n\na = R, b = P. Check if a beats b. R vs P: P beats R. So condition is false. So add 1 to remaining_A. Now remaining_A=2, B=1.\n\ni=4:\n\na = P, b = R. Check if a beats b. P beats R → yes. Add 1 to remaining_B. Now B=2.\n\ni=5:\n\na = S, b = S → same. No change.\n\ni=6:\n\na = R, b = P. Again, R vs P. B wins. So add 1 to remaining_A. Now remaining_A=3, B=2.\n\nSo for the remaining rounds (7 rounds), remaining_A is 3 and remaining_B is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut why in my previous calculation of the code's logic for the remaining rounds, I had different numbers? Because I must have made a mistake in the earlier analysis. So the code is correct.\n\nSo why did I get different numbers earlier? Because I think I made a mistake in the code's logic.\n\nWait, the code for the remaining rounds is:\n\nfor i in range(remaining):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    if a_move == b_move:\n\n        continue\n\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n        remaining_B +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        remaining_A +=1\n\nSo for i=1, a is P and b is S. The condition is (a is R and b is S) → no. (a is S and b is P) → no. (a is P and b is R) → no. So the condition is false. So else clause: remaining_A +=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo for i=1, remaining_A increases by 1. So the code is correct.\n\nSo why in my previous analysis of the code's calculation for the remaining rounds, I thought that for i=1, remaining_B was increased? Because I must have made a mistake in that analysis.\n\nSo the code is correct. So the code would generate for the sample input:\n\ntotal_A = 0 * 5 + 3 = 3.\n\ntotal_B = 0 *4 + 2 = 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case is the second sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo n=5, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). So LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nper_period_A and per_period_B:\n\nfor i from 0 to 7:\n\neach round, a is R, b is R. All draws. So per_period_A and per_period_B are 0. So full_cycles = 5//8 = 0, remaining is 5. So the remaining rounds are 5 rounds, all draws. So total_A and total_B are 0. Which matches the sample output of 0 0.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly the LCM. For example, n=12, then full_cycles=1, remaining=0. So total_A is per_period_A, etc.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, for very large numbers, the code may take time. However, since m and k are up to 1000, LCM(m, k) is up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ngcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\nlcm_val = m * k // gcd_val\n\nper_period_A = 0\nper_period_B = 0\n\nfor i in range(lcm_val):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        per_period_B += 1\n    else:\n        per_period_A += 1\n\nfull_cycles = n // lcm_val\nremaining = n % lcm_val\n\nremaining_A = 0\nremaining_B = 0\n\nfor i in range(remaining):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        remaining_B += 1\n    else:\n        remaining_A += 1\n\ntotal_A = full_cycles * per_period_A + remaining_A\ntotal_B = full_cycles * per_period_B + remaining_B\n\nprint(total_A, total_B)\n\nThis should be the correct code.\n\nLet me check for the first sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich would be read as:\n\nn=7\n\nA is 'RPS'\n\nB is 'RSPP'\n\nThen, m=3, k=4.\n\ngcd(3,4) is 1, lcm is 12.\n\nper_period_A and per_period_B are calculated as follows.\n\nIn the code, during the first loop, for i from 0 to 11:\n\nWhich would generate the per_period_A as 5 and per_period_B as 4.\n\nfull_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0.\n\nremaining =7.\n\nThen, the second loop runs for i in 0..6.\n\nWhich gives remaining_A = 3 and remaining_B=2.\n\nThus, output 3 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n=12, the code would have full_cycles=1, remaining=0. Thus, total_A=5, total_B=4.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where m=1 and k=1. For example, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then LCM is 1. For each round, A's move is R, B's move is S. So A wins. So per_period_B is 1, per_period_A is 0. For n=2e9, the total is 0 and 2e9.\n\nAnother case: when A and B have same sequences. For example, A and B are both 'R'. Then all rounds are draws. So outputs are 0 0.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds using cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use an efficient approach leveraging the periodic nature of the strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The sequence of moves for each player repeats every `m` and `k` rounds respectively, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of their respective sequences.\n2. **Finding the Period**: The combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`. This period allows us to compute the number of losses for each player within one full cycle of this period.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By calculating the number of full cycles of this period within the total number of rounds `n`, and then handling the remaining rounds separately, we can efficiently determine the total number of losses for each player.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm_val = m * k // gcd_val\n    \n    per_period_A = 0\n    per_period_B = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm_val):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            per_period_B += 1\n        else:\n            per_period_A += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // lcm_val\n    remaining = n % lcm_val\n    \n    remaining_A = 0\n    remaining_B = 0\n    \n    for i in range(remaining):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            remaining_B += 1\n        else:\n            remaining_A += 1\n    \n    total_A = full_cycles * per_period_A + remaining_A\n    total_B = full_cycles * per_period_B + remaining_B\n    \n    print(total_A, total_B)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences of moves for the players.\n2. **Calculating LCM**: The LCM of the lengths of the sequences determines the period after which the combined moves of both players repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: We simulate one full period (up to LCM rounds) to count the number of losses for each player within this period.\n4. **Handling Full Cycles and Remainder**: Using the counts from one period, we calculate the total losses for all full cycles of this period. The remaining rounds after these full cycles are handled separately to account for any leftover rounds.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses for each player is computed and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large values of `n` by leveraging the periodicity of the sequences, avoiding the need to simulate each round individually.",
