Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The colors can be specific letters or question marks, which are wildcards. \n\nFirst, I need to think about how to maximize the pairs. Let me think about the approach.\n\nHmm, the key here is to match the boots in a way that uses as many compatible pairs as possible. Let's break down the problem.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. For each left boot and right boot, their colors can be compatible if either both are '?', or one is '?' and the other is a letter, or both are the same letter.\n\nBut since we need to maximize the pairs, maybe we can first match the specific colors where possible, then handle the wildcards.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think of it as two parts:\n\n1. Matching left and right boots with specific colors (non-?) that are the same.\n2. Handling the remaining boots with '?'s.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nAn idea: First, for each color (excluding '?'), count how many left boots and right boots have that color. Then, for each color, the number of pairs we can form is the minimum of left_count and right_count. Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots (those with '?') can be paired among themselves, but also considering that some may have been left over from the first step.\n\nWait, but the '?' can be used to pair with any other boot. So perhaps the optimal approach is:\n\n- First, pair up all specific color matches. For example, for each color c (not '?'), take as many pairs as possible between left and right boots of color c. This is straightforward.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched because there was no corresponding count on the other side), we can pair them using the '?'s. But how?\n\nWait, but after the first step, the left and right boots that are not yet paired could be:\n\n- Left boots with color c (non-?), but there were no matching right boots (because right had less than left). Or vice versa.\n\nBut those can't be matched with others except for the '?'. So perhaps the next step is to collect all the remaining left and right boots (including those that are '?') and pair them up.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally. Since '?' can be matched with anything, including other '?'s.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nStep 1: For each color c (excluding '?'), match as many left and right boots as possible. For example, for color 'a', if there are 5 left boots and 3 right boots, we can make 3 pairs. Then, we subtract those from the counts.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already used? Well, perhaps we need to process the boots in a way that allows us to track which ones are used. However, for the initial step, maybe we can collect all the positions of each color and then pair them.\n\nBut since the problem requires us to output the actual pairs, we need to track which boots are used. So maybe we need to process the strings and collect the indices for each color.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nFor each color c (excluding '?'):\n\n- Take all left boots with color c, and all right boots with color c. Pair them up. For example, if there are m left and n right, we can pair min(m,n) of them. Then mark these as used.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently. Let's think of using queues or lists for each color.\n\nOnce that's done, we'll have some left boots and right boots that are not yet paired. These include:\n\n- Left boots with color c (non-?) where the count was higher than the right's count.\n\n- Right boots with color c (non-?) where the count was higher than the left's count.\n\n- All the '?' in left and right boots.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair the remaining boots. Since '?' can be matched with anything, including other '?'. So the remaining left and right boots can be paired as follows:\n\nWe can pair as many as possible between left '?' and right non-? (but only if they are compatible, which they are since the right is non-? and the left is '?'). Similarly, right '?' can be paired with left non-? (if any). Also, the remaining '?' can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs here.\n\nAn idea is to collect all the remaining left boots (including '?') and remaining right boots (including '?'), and then pair them as follows:\n\nFor the left and right boots that are not yet used:\n\n- First, pair left '?' with right non-? (since they can be matched). But how many? For each right non-? boot, if there's a left '?', pair them. Similarly for left non-? and right '?'.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to first pair left '?' with right '?', and then pair the remaining with non-? boots. Or not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since '?' can be matched with any, perhaps the optimal way is to pair as many as possible between left and right, regardless of their color. So the total possible pairs here would be the minimum between the number of remaining left boots and remaining right boots. But that's only possible if we can pair them. However, since '?' can be matched with anything, even if the other is non-?.\n\nSo the maximum number of pairs here is the minimum between the number of remaining left and remaining right boots. But how to pair them?\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because suppose there are more left boots than right. For example, say there are 3 left (all '?') and 2 right (all 'a'). Then we can pair all 2 right boots with left '?', and have one left unpaired. So the total is 2 pairs. Which is the min(3,2) = 2. So yes, the maximum possible is min(left_remaining, right_remaining).\n\nSo the approach here is to pair all remaining left and right boots, using the fact that '?' can match anything.\n\nBut how to implement this? We need to collect all the remaining left and right boots, and then pair them in any way. But how to track which ones are used.\n\nBut how to track which left and right boots are available for pairing here.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. For each color c (not '?'), collect all left indices and right indices. Then pair them up as much as possible. For example, for color 'a', take the first min(len(left_a), len(right_a)) pairs. Mark those as used.\n\n2. After that, collect all the remaining left boots (those not yet paired) and the remaining right boots (those not yet paired). These will include all the '?' and any non-? boots that couldn't be matched in step 1.\n\n3. Now, pair as many as possible between the remaining left and right. Since '?' can match any, the maximum possible is min(number of remaining left, number of remaining right). So for each pair, we can take one left and one right, regardless of their color. But how to choose which ones to pair.\n\nBut how to do that in code.\n\nBut for the purpose of outputting the pairs, we can just take the first available left and right from the remaining lists.\n\nBut how to track which ones are available.\n\nSo here's the plan for the code:\n\n- Create two lists: left_available and right_available. These will contain the indices of the left and right boots that are not yet paired.\n\nBut wait, how to collect them. Let's think:\n\nFor step 1, we can process each color. For example, for each color c (not '?'):\n\n- For left boots with color c, collect their indices into a list left_c.\n\n- For right boots with color c, collect their indices into a list right_c.\n\nThen, the number of pairs for this color is min(len(left_c), len(right_c)). For each of these pairs, we can pair the first i elements of left_c with the first i elements of right_c. Then, mark those as used. The remaining elements in left_c and right_c are added to the remaining lists.\n\nBut how to track which left and right boots are used. Alternatively, perhaps we can use arrays of booleans to track which boots are already used.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, that's manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nInitialize two arrays, used_left and used_right, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for each color c (not '?'):\n\n   collect all left indices with color c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices with color c and not used.\n\n   take the minimum of the two lengths, say m.\n\n   for i in 0..m-1:\n\n       pair left[i] with right[i], mark them as used.\n\nSo this would handle the specific color matches.\n\nThen, after that, collect all the left indices that are not used (could be '?' or any color), and same for right.\n\nThen, for these remaining, pair them as follows:\n\nTake the left_remaining list (all not used) and right_remaining list (all not used). For each pair, take the first left and first right, pair them, and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect the left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nBut in practice, after the first step, the left_remaining would be:\n\nAll left boots that are not used, which includes:\n\n- Those with color c (non-?) that couldn't be matched because there were not enough on the other side.\n\n- Those with color '?'\n\nSame for right_remaining.\n\nSo for the second step, we can collect all left boots not used (regardless of their color) and all right boots not used (regardless of their color). Then pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to collect them. Let's think of building two lists:\n\nleft_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nright_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, the number of pairs possible is min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining)).\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, take the first k elements of left_remaining and first k elements of right_remaining, and pair them.\n\nBut how to do that in code.\n\nSo, once we have left_remaining and right_remaining, we can iterate over the minimum of the two lengths, and pair them.\n\nBut the order in which we pair them might affect the actual pairs, but the problem says that any valid answer is acceptable.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce the first step is done, collect left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nThen, for i in range(min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining))):\n\n   pair left_remaining[i] with right_remaining[i]\n\nBut how to collect left_remaining and right_remaining. Let's think about that.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as lists of False.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z' (since the question marks are handled separately):\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i]\n\n   take the min of the two lengths, say m.\n\n   for j in 0 to m-1:\n\n       pair left_indices[j] with right_indices[j]\n\n       mark used_left[left_indices[j]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_indices[j]] = True\n\nThen, after processing all colors, collect all left indices not used and all right indices not used.\n\nThen, for these, pair as many as possible by taking the first k elements of each.\n\nBut wait, what about the question marks? Because during the first step, we didn't process them. So the first step only processes colors that are not '?'. So during the first step, the '?' are left untouched, and then collected into the remaining lists.\n\nBut during the first step, when processing a color c, we ignore the '?'.\n\nSo, the code for the first step would be:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for j in range(m):\n\n       pair left_list[j] with right_list[j]\n\n       mark them as used.\n\nBut this approach would process each color once, and for each, pair as many as possible.\n\nOnce that is done, collect the remaining left and right boots (including those with '?').\n\nNow, the remaining left and right boots can be paired as follows. For example, a left '?' can be paired with any right (including '?'), and vice versa.\n\nSo, the next step is to collect all the remaining left and right boots, and pair them as much as possible. How?\n\nAs mentioned before, collect left_remaining and right_remaining as lists of indices not used. Then pair them in order.\n\nBut how to collect them. For example, after the first step, the left_remaining can be generated by:\n\nleft_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nThen, for i in range(k), where k is min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining)), we pair left_remaining[i] with right_remaining[i].\n\nThis would give us the maximum possible pairs for the second step.\n\nBut wait, what if there are some left and right boots that could be paired in a better way? For example, suppose there are some left boots with color 'a' and right boots with color 'a', but they were not paired in the first step. But that's impossible, because in the first step, we processed all colors, including 'a'. So during the first step, we would have paired all left and right 'a's that are not used. So the remaining left and right boots in the second step cannot have any color-specific matches except for the '?'.\n\nSo the second step is to pair the remaining, which can be done by any way, as long as each pair is compatible. Since the remaining left and right boots can be paired as long as they are either both '?', or one is '?' and the other is something else.\n\nSo the approach of pairing left_remaining and right_remaining in order would work.\n\nNow, the problem is how to implement this efficiently, given that n can be up to 150,000.\n\nBut for each color, generating the list of left and right indices would take O(n) time per color, which is O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for n=150,000, 26*150,000 is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there is a more efficient way. For example, for each color, we can precompute the list of indices once, and then process them.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as lists of False, size n.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left_list: indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   collect right_list: indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i]\n\n   m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for j in 0 to m-1:\n\n       add pair (left_list[j]+1, right_list[j]+1) to the answer list.\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[j]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[j]] = True\n\nOnce that's done, collect left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nThen, collect left_remaining as all indices not used in left.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nThen, for i in range( min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining)) ):\n\n   add pair (left_remaining[i]+1, right_remaining[i]+1) to the answer list.\n\n   mark them as used.\n\nWait, but the left_remaining and right_remaining are already not used. So when we collect them, they are not used. So in this step, we can pair them.\n\nBut how to collect them. Let's think:\n\nAfter the first step, the used_left and used_right arrays are updated. So for left_remaining, we can generate a list by iterating through all indices and checking if used_left[i] is False.\n\nBut for n=150,000, this would take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce the left_remaining and right_remaining are generated, the second step is to pair as many as possible between them.\n\nNow, the problem is that in the first step, for each color c, we process all possible pairs. But the way we collect left_list and right_list for each color could be time-consuming if done naively. For example, for each color, we loop through all n elements. That would be O(26n) time. But for n=1.5e5, that's 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, for each color, we can precompute the list of indices once, and then process them. However, during the first step, we need to process only those that are not yet used. So during the first step, for each color, we have to check for each index whether it's used or not.\n\nBut for the first step, perhaps we can precompute for each color, a list of indices, and then for each color, process the list, and for each element in the list, check if it's not used. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, during the first step, for each color c, we can collect all the indices for left and right that are not used. But how to do this efficiently.\n\nBut for code, perhaps the easiest way is to loop through all the indices for each color. For example, in Python, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\nleft_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\nBut for n=1.5e5 and 26 colors, this is O(26n) time. Which should be acceptable.\n\nBut in practice, for Python, this may be slow. Let's think of a better way. For example, for each color, we can have a list of indices, and then during the first step, we process them, but keeping track of which ones are already used.\n\nBut perhaps that's not necessary. Let's proceed with the code as described.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l as input().strip()\n\nRead r as input().strip()\n\nBut the input has multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows something like:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line contains l.\n\nThird line contains r.\n\nBut the sample input seems to be multiple test cases. However, the user's note says that the sample input is given as a list of test cases. But the actual problem's input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line contains l.\n\nThird line contains r.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided a list of four test cases, perhaps as examples. However, the actual code needs to read from standard input, which for each run is one test case.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line contains l.\n\nThird line contains r.\n\nSo the code needs to read three lines: n, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the user provided multiple test cases. But perhaps that's part of the example, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case.\n\nSo the code needs to read n, l, r from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample output, there are four outputs, which correspond to the four inputs. But the code is supposed to process one input per run.\n\nSo the code needs to read n, l, r.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead l from input.\n\nRead r from input.\n\nThen process as per the steps.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut for Python, the problem is that for large n (like 1.5e5), the code must be efficient.\n\nNow, let's proceed with code.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as lists of False.\n\nThen, for each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for j in range(m):\n\n       pair (left_list[j], right_list[j])\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[j]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[j]] = True\n\nBut in Python, for each color, building the left_list and right_list may be O(n) per color. Which for 26 colors is O(26n) = 3.9e6 for n=1.5e5. Which is acceptable.\n\nOnce that's done, collect left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nleft_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nright_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, the number of pairs is min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining)).\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to k-1:\n\n   pair left_remaining[i] with right_remaining[i]\n\n   mark them as used.\n\nBut wait, in this step, we don't need to mark them again, because they are already not used. But since we are adding them to the answer, we need to make sure that they are not used again. But since left_remaining and right_remaining are generated once, and we pair them in order, they are not used again.\n\nSo the code can collect the pairs in two steps.\n\nNow, the problem is that the code must collect the pairs and output them.\n\nSo, the code can have a list called pairs, which is initially empty.\n\nSo, during the first step, for each pair found, append (left+1, right+1) to pairs.\n\nSimilarly, during the second step, append (left_remaining[i]+1, right_remaining[i]+1) to pairs.\n\nBut how to collect left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nNow, let's think about the code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nl = input().strip()\n\nr = input().strip()\n\nused_left = [False]*n\n\nused_right = [False]*n\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    # collect left indices with color c and not used\n\n    left_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]:\n\n            left_list.append(i)\n\n    # collect right indices with color c and not used\n\n    right_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]:\n\n            right_list.append(i)\n\n    # pair as many as possible\n\n    m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_list[j]+1, right_list[j]+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_list[j]] = True\n\n        used_right[right_list[j]] = True\n\n# Now collect remaining left and right\n\nleft_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nright_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nk = min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining))\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n    pairs.append( (left_remaining[i]+1, right_remaining[i]+1) )\n\nprint(len(pairs))\n\nfor a, b in pairs:\n\n    print(a, b)\n\nWait, but this code would have a problem. Because in the first step, for each color c, we are looping through all n elements for left and right. For n=1.5e5, this would be O(26 * 2 * n) = O(5.2e6) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for n=1.5e5, this may be slow. For example, for each of the 26 letters, looping through 1.5e5 elements. Let's think of the code for the first step.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize that. For example, precompute for each color, the list of indices once, and then during the first step, process them.\n\nBut perhaps not. Let's proceed with the code as written.\n\nBut let's test it against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output 1: 5 pairs.\n\nBut according to the sample input, the first input is:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nBut the sample output for this is:\n\n5\n\n7 8\n\n4 9\n\n2 2\n\n9 10\n\n3 1\n\nBut let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the code would generate some pairs. However, the code may not be handling the second step correctly. Let's think.\n\nAnother example: Let's take the third sample input, which is:\n\n9\n\nbambarbia\n\nhellocode\n\nSample output is 0. Which implies that there are no compatible pairs.\n\nBut why?\n\nWell, let's see. For example, the left string is 'bambarbia' and the right is 'hellocode'.\n\nLooking for color matches. For each color, check if there are any pairs.\n\nFor example, 'b' in left. Let's see:\n\nLeft: positions 0: 'b', 1: 'a', 2: 'm', 3: 'a', 4: 'r', 5: 'b', 6: 'i', 7: 'a', 8: 'i'.\n\nRight: 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'c', 'o', 'd', 'e'.\n\nSo for each color, there are no matches. For example, 'b' is in left but not in right. 'a' is in left but not in right. So the first step would generate zero pairs. Then, the remaining left and right boots are all. Then, the second step would pair as much as possible. But since the left and right have some '?'? No, in this case, the input is 'bambarbia' and 'hellocode' which have no '?'. So the remaining left and right are all. Then, the second step would try to pair them. But since all left and right are non-? and not compatible, the pairs would be zero. Hence the output 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code would handle that correctly.\n\nAnother test case: the fourth sample input:\n\n10\n\ncode??????\n\n??????test\n\nThe output is 10 pairs. Which makes sense, since all left and right can be paired. For example, the left has 'code' followed by six '?', and the right has six '?' followed by 'test'. So during the first step, for colors 'c', 'o', 'd', 'e', 't', 'e', 's', 't' (but the right has 't', 'e', 's', 't').\n\nBut during the first step, for color 'c', the left has one (index 0), and the right has none. So no pairs. For 'o' (left index 1), right has none. For 'd' (left index 2), right has none. For 'e' (left index 3), right has some (positions 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, etc.? Well, the right string is '??????test', so positions 0-5 are '?', 6 is 't', 7 is 'e', 8 is 's', 9 is 't'.\n\nSo for color 't', left has none. Right has 't' at 6, 9. So during the first step, no pairs. So all the pairs would be formed in the second step. Since all left and right are not used, left_remaining is all 10 left boots, right_remaining is all 10 right boots. So the second step would pair them all, giving 10 pairs.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nBut what about when there are some '?' in the first step?\n\nFor example, suppose a left boot is '?', and a right boot is 'a'. During the first step, since the code processes only colors that are not '?', the '?' are not considered. So in the first step, the '?' are not processed. Then, during the second step, they are paired with any available boot.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nBut what about when there are '?' in the first step. For example, suppose a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is '?'. Then, during the first step, the code would process color 'a' and pair the left 'a' with the right '?', but the code is looking for right boots with color 'a' (since the code is processing color 'a'). But in that case, the right boot is '?', so it would not be included in the right_list for color 'a'.\n\nAh, right! Because during the first step, the code is processing for color 'a' the right boots that have color 'a' (not '?'). So the code would not pair the left 'a' with the right '?', but that pair is compatible. So the code is missing those pairs.\n\nOh no! That's a problem. Because the code is only pairing specific colors. But the '?' can be paired with any color. So the code's current approach is wrong.\n\nWait, this is a critical error in the approach.\n\nBecause, for example, a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with color '?' can be paired. But in the first step, the code is processing color 'a' for left and looking for right boots with color 'a' (not '?'). Thus, such pairs are not considered.\n\nSimilarly, a left boot with color '?' and a right boot with color 'a' can be paired, but the code would not process that in the first step.\n\nSo the code is missing some possible pairs. Therefore, the approach is incorrect.\n\nOh no! So this approach is flawed. How to fix it?\n\nSo the problem is that the code is only pairing specific colors. But the '?' can be used to pair with any color. So the code's initial approach is not considering those possibilities.\n\nSo what's the correct approach?\n\nWe need to find all possible pairs between left and right boots where the colors are compatible. How to maximize that.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can split the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Pair specific colors with specific colors (same color).\n\n2. Pair specific colors with '?', and '?' with specific colors, and '?' with '?'.\n\nBut how to do that optimally.\n\nBut the problem is that the '?' can be used in multiple ways, and we need to find the optimal way to pair them.\n\nAn alternative idea is:\n\nWe can first pair all possible specific color matches (as before). Then, for the remaining left and right boots, collect all the '?' in left and right, and pair them with the remaining non-? boots (if possible), and then pair the remaining '?'.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAfter the first step (pairing specific colors), we have:\n\nSome left boots and right boots that are not used. These can be:\n\n- Left boots with color c (non-?), but no matching right boots.\n\n- Right boots with color c (non-?), but no matching left boots.\n\n- Left and right boots with '?'.\n\nSo, for the remaining boots, we can:\n\n- For each left boot with color c (non-?), try to pair it with a right boot with '?'. Similarly for each right boot with color c (non-?), pair with left '?'.\n\n- Then pair the remaining '?' boots between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think of a better way.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is equal to the total number of pairs that can be formed by:\n\nFor each left boot and right boot, if they are compatible, and each is used once.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAn alternative way is:\n\nWe can model this as a bipartite graph, where left boots are on one side, right boots on the other, and edges exist if the colors are compatible. We need to find a maximum matching.\n\nBut for n up to 1.5e5, finding a maximum bipartite matching is impossible with standard algorithms (like Hopcroft-Karp), as it would be O(EâˆšV), which for E=O(n^2) is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a greedy approach that finds the maximum possible pairs.\n\nSo, what's the optimal greedy strategy?\n\nThe optimal way is to first pair all specific color matches, then pair the remaining specific colors with '?', and then pair the remaining '?'.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nLet me think:\n\nFirst, process all specific color matches (same color, not '?').\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots:\n\nCollect all left boots with non-? colors (call them L_non_q), and all right boots with non-? colors (R_non_q).\n\nCollect all left boots with '?' (L_q) and right boots with '?' (R_q).\n\nNow, for each left in L_non_q, we can pair with any right in R_q (since ? can match any). Similarly, for each right in R_non_q, we can pair with any left in L_q.\n\nSo, the number of such pairs is min(len(L_non_q), len(R_q)) + min(len(R_non_q), len(L_q)) ?\n\nNo, because pairing a left in L_non_q with a right in R_q consumes one from each. But also, pairing a right in R_non_q with a left in L_q consumes one from each. However, these two are separate.\n\nBut we need to choose which to pair first to maximize the total.\n\nFor example, suppose we have 3 left_non_q and 2 R_q, and 2 right_non_q and 3 L_q.\n\nIf we pair all 3 left_non_q with R_q (using 2 R_q), and then pair the 2 right_non_q with L_q (using 2 L_q), that gives 2+2=4 pairs.\n\nAlternatively, if we pair 2 left_non_q with R_q, and 2 right_non_q with L_q, and then have 1 left_non_q and 1 L_q left. Then, we can pair them if they are compatible. But since they are non-? and ?, they are compatible. So that gives 2+2+1=5 pairs.\n\nWait, but this suggests that pairing the non-? with ? first may allow more pairs. So the optimal way is to pair as many as possible between non-? and ?.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nFor the remaining non-? left and right boots, and ? boots:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is:\n\nmin(len(L_non_q) + len(R_non_q), len(L_q) + len(R_q)) ) ?\n\nNo, not exactly. Because each pair can be between:\n\n- L_non_q and R_q.\n\n- R_non_q and L_q.\n\n- L_q and R_q.\n\n- L_non_q and R_non_q (but this is already handled in the first step).\n\nWait, no. The first step already handled all L_non_q and R_non_q with same color. So the remaining L_non_q and R_non_q have no compatible pairs between them (because otherwise they would have been paired in the first step).\n\nSo, the remaining pairs can be between:\n\n- L_non_q and R_q.\n\n- R_non_q and L_q.\n\n- L_q and R_q.\n\nSo the total possible pairs is:\n\nnumber of pairs between L_non_q and R_q (up to min(len(L_non_q), len(R_q))) \n\nplus number of pairs between R_non_q and L_q (up to min(len(R_non_q), len(L_q)))\n\nplus number of pairs between L_q and R_q (up to min(len(L_q) - used_in_prev_steps, len(R_q) - used_in_prev_steps)).\n\nBut this seems complex. How to maximize this.\n\nAn optimal approach is to first pair as many as possible between L_non_q and R_q, then between R_non_q and L_q, then between L_q and R_q.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's think of it as:\n\nLet's collect:\n\nL_non_q = list of left boots not used, with color not '?'.\n\nR_non_q = list of right boots not used, with color not '?'.\n\nL_q = list of left boots not used, with color '?'.\n\nR_q = list of right boots not used, with color '?'.\n\nNow:\n\nFirst, pair as many as possible between L_non_q and R_q. For each left in L_non_q, pair with a right in R_q. The number is min(len(L_non_q), len(R_q)).\n\nThen, pair as many as possible between R_non_q and L_q. The number is min(len(R_non_q), len(L_q)).\n\nThen, pair the remaining L_q and R_q. The number is min(len(L_q) - used_in_step_2, len(R_q) - used_in_step_1).\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nLet me think of modifying the code.\n\nSo after the first step (pairing same-colored non-? boots), we collect:\n\nL_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nR_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nL_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nR_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color (a lowercase letter) or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). Two boots are compatible if they are both the same specific color, or one is a '?' which can match any other color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: First, we pair all left boots with specific colors that have matching right boots of the same color. This ensures that we use up as many specific color matches as possible.\n2. **Handle Indefinite Colors**: After handling specific color matches, we handle the remaining boots which may include indefinite colors ('?').
