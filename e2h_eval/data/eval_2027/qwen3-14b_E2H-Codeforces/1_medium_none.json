    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, right. For a rectangle of size width × height, the perimeter (the border cells) would be 2*(width + height - 2). Because each side contributes width or height, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice) → wait no, maybe better to think as 2*(w + h) - 4. Because for a rectangle, the perimeter in cells is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because each side has length, but the four corners are counted twice if you just do 2*(w + h). So subtracting 4.\n\nWait, let's take the example given. The first example input is 3 3 1. The output is 8. Let's see: for the first ring, the rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter would be 2*(3 + 3) - 4 = 12 -4 = 8. Which matches the output. So yes, that formula seems correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge. Wait, the first ring is along the edge. The second is two cells away. So for the second ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(2-1)) × (h - 4*(2-1))? Wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's the original rectangle. The first ring is the perimeter of that. Then for i=2, the rectangle is smaller by 4*(i-1) in each dimension. Wait, why 4*(i-1)? Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. So for each ring, the next rectangle is 2 cells smaller in width and height. But since each ring is added, the next one is 2 cells inward. So for example, the first ring is the outermost, then the next is 2 cells inward. So the rectangle for the second ring would be (original width - 2*2) × (original height - 2*2). Because each side is reduced by 2. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1))? Because for each ring, the rectangle is 2 cells smaller in each direction. So for i-th ring, the rectangle is (original width - 4*(i-1)) in width and same for height. Because for each step, you subtract 2 from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So 2*2 = 4 per step.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each ring, the perimeter is calculated based on that rectangle's dimensions.\n\nBut we have to make sure that for each i, the rectangle is valid. For example, if the original w and h are small, then after some steps, the rectangle might have zero size. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's possible. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ). Wait, the problem says that the input has k as up to floor( (min(w,h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w,h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3, you can have only one ring. For a 7x7, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be up to 2. So for each i from 1 to k, the rectangle for the i-th ring is valid.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each ring from 1 to k:\n\n- compute current_width = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n- compute current_height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n- compute perimeter: 2*(current_width + current_height - 2) \n\nWait, because the perimeter is 2*(width + height) - 4? Or 2*(width + height - 2)?\n\nYes, because for a rectangle of width w and height h, the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because each side has length w or h, but the four corners are counted twice. So for example, 3x3: 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which matches the first example.\n\nSo the formula for the perimeter is 2*(current_width + current_height) - 4. But wait, another way to think is that for a rectangle of size m x n, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2m + 2(n-2). Because top and bottom rows have m cells each, and the left and right columns have (n-2) each (since top and bottom are already counted). So total is 2m + 2(n-2) = 2(m + n -2). Which is same as 2*(m + n) -4. So same result.\n\nSo for each ring, the perimeter is 2*(current_width + current_height - 2).\n\nSo the plan is to loop from i=1 to k, compute for each i the current_width and current_height, compute the perimeter, add to the total.\n\nSo let's take the first example input: 3 3 1.\n\ni=1: current_width = 3 - 4*(0) = 3, current_height = 3. Perimeter is 2*(3 +3 -2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So the perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14 = 28. Which matches the second output.\n\nThird example is 7 9 2. So for i=1: 7x9, perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 28. For i=2: current_width = 7 -4*(1) = 3, current_height = 9 -4*(1) =5. So perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6 =12. Total is 28 + 12 =40. Which matches the third example.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k. Then for each i in 1..k, compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1), current_h = h -4*(i-1). For each, compute 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) and sum all.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to do this?\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then loop from 1 to k, inclusive. For each step, compute current_w and current_h. Then add 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) to the total.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. Because for the maximum k allowed, the min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) must be >= 1. Because the input constraints for k is floor( (min(w,h) +1)/4 ). Let's see. For example, if min(w,h) is 3, then k can be 1. For that, 3 -4*(1-1) =3, which is okay. For min(w,h) = 7, then (7 +1)/4 = 2, so k can be 2. For i=2, 7-4*(2-1) =7-4=3, which is okay. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's check for the third example. 7 9 2. For i=1: current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2)=28. For i=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Sum is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if input is 3 3 1, output is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if input is 5 5 2. Let's see. For i=1: 5x5. perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. For i=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, but that's 0. But according to the input constraints, k is floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For w=5, h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code will not have such a case. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. For example, input could be read via input().split().\n\nBut the input is given as a single line with three integers. So:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen initialize total to 0.\n\nLoop for i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nAdd to total.\n\nThen print(total).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSecond input:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird input:7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 =40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say, 5 5 1 → perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be the output.\n\nAnother case: 5 5 1 → 16. If k=1, correct.\n\nWhat if k=0? But according to the input constraints, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
