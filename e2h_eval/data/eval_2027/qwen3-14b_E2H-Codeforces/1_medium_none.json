    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. \n\nHmm. Let me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For the i-th ring, it's based on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we calculate the number of cells in that ring?\n\nOh right, the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. So for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3 has perimeter 8 cells (the outer ring), which matches the first example input where 3x3 with 1 ring gives 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that each ring is possible. For example, if the current dimensions after subtracting 4*(i-1) from both w and h are at least 3x3? Well, the problem says that k is given such that it's valid. The constraints on k are given as 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ). Wait, in the input description, n and m are probably w and h. So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3, you can only have one ring.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle, and add them all up.\n\nSo let's formalize this. For each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\nsum += perimeter\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. Then current_w = 3, current_h = 3. Perimeter is 2*(3 +3 -2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So current_w is 7, current_h is 9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So for i=1, current_w=7, current_h=9. Perimeter 28. For i=2, current_w = 7 -4*(1) = 3, current_h = 9 -4*(1) =5. Then perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*(6) = 12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So yes, this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is to loop from 1 to k, compute for each i the current width and height, compute the perimeter, and accumulate the sum.\n\nNow, the code. Let's see. We need to read w, h, k. Then for each i in 1..k, calculate current_w = w - 4*(i-1), same for current_h. Then compute 2*(current_w + current_h - 2), add to total.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the problem statement, k is chosen such that it's possible. Because the constraints on k are given as floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. For i=1, the current_w and current_h would be 3 - 4*(0) = 3, which is okay. For i=2, it would be 3 -4*(1) = -1, but since k is limited to 1, that's not possible. So the code can safely assume that for all i up to k, current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps the formula for k is such that for the i-th ring, the dimensions are valid. Let me think.\n\nThe problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me take min(w, h) as m. Let's see, for example, if m is 7. Then (7 +1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So k can be 2. For i=2, the current_w and current_h would be m -4*(i-1) = 7 -4*(1) = 3. Which is valid. So for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3. Because for the maximum k allowed, the i-th step would be m -4*(k-1) >= 3?\n\nYes, because k is chosen such that 4*(k-1) <= m -3. Because for example, when k is floor( (m +1)/4 ), then 4*(k-1) <= m -3 ?\n\nLet me take m=7. (m+1)/4 = 8/4=2. So k=2. 4*(2-1)=4. 7-4=3, which is okay. For m=6, (6+1)/4 is 1.75, floor is 1. So k=1. So 4*(1-1)=0. So current_w is 6-0=6, which is okay.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me test with the third example. For i=1, current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. For i=2, current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is 5x5's outer ring. Which is 5*5 - 3*3 = 25-9=16. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if w=5, h=5, k=2. Then for i=1, perimeter 16. For i=2, current_w =5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. Wait, but that would be 1x1. But then perimeter would be 2*(1+1-2) = 2*0=0. But according to the problem's constraints, k is floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). For w=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code should work. Now, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then compute the sum as described.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead input line as w, h, k. Split into integers.\n\nThen initialize total to 0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to k inclusive:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nAdd to total.\n\nPrint total.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSample input 2:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 =40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Output is 16. Correct.\n\nAnother case: w=5, h=5, k=1. What if k=1? Yes.\n\nAnother example: let's take w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. Perimeter 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Total 24+8=32. Which would be the answer.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead input line as w, h, k. Then compute sum.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead from stdin. So:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code. Let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample input 2:7 9 1 → 28. Correct.\n\nSample input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nLooks good. So this should handle all cases.\n",
