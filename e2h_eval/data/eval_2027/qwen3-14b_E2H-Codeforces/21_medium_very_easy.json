The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so how do I approach this? Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the problem reduces to counting how many even and odd chests there are, and then matching them with the available even and odd keys. But wait, the keys can be used once, and each chest can be opened once. So the maximum possible is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nYes! Because each even chest needs an odd key, but each key can only be used once. Similarly for the odd chests needing even keys. So the total is the sum of those two minima.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's see their parities:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9, 11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys = 1 (7), even_keys = 3 (others). \n\nSo min(3, 1) is 1, and min(2, 3) is 2. Sum is 3, which matches the first example's output. Yep.\n\nSecond example: chests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0. Keys are [5], which is odd. So min(5, 1) is 1, and min(0, 0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1, 0) is 0. And odd_chests is 0, even_keys is 4. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the approach is correct. Now, how to implement this in Python?\n\nThe plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the list of a_i, count how many are even and odd.\n- Read the list of b_j, count how many are even and odd.\n- The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's straightforward. Let's code this.\n\nNow, for handling the input. The input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first line shows that the input is given as multiple lines. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then the second line has n integers. Third line has m integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows something like ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', ...]. Oh, perhaps the user provided multiple test cases as separate inputs. Wait, the problem says that the input is read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The original problem says that the input is given as follows: first line has n and m, then second line has the a_i, third line has the b_j. But the sample input shows three different test cases, each with their own input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three inputs, and the output is a list of three outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description says that the input is given as per the first line being n and m, etc. So maybe the code should read multiple test cases?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user provided some test cases as examples, but the actual code is supposed to read from standard input. For example, in the original problem, the input is a single test case. But in the sample input, there are three test cases. But how is that possible?\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again. The sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nOutput:\n\n['3', '1', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. But in the original problem statement, the input is given as one test case. So perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases, and the code should process each of them?\n\nBut how? How to read the input? For example, the code needs to read from stdin. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, split them into individual test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut how are the test cases structured? Each test case is three lines: first line is n and m, second line is a_i, third line is b_j.\n\nBut in the sample input, the three test cases are given as three separate entries. So for example, the first test case is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\nThird test case:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nSo the code must read each test case as three lines, but how to read them? The problem may be that in the actual programming competition problem, each test case is given as a separate input. However, the original problem statement may have only one test case. But the sample input shows multiple. However, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line containing n and m, etc. So perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple test cases for the purpose of the example, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case.\n\nBut that's conflicting with the sample input. Wait, looking at the problem statement again, the sample input shows three test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line containing n and m, etc. So perhaps the sample input is written as three separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases, and the code should process each of them. However, in the original problem statement, the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but how?\n\nWait, the user's note says that the sample input is given as a list of three inputs, but the actual code should read from stdin. So perhaps in the actual programming competition problem, the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. But that would not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should read all the test cases from the input. For example, the input could be multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. So for example, the code reads until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nWell, in the sample input, the input is given as three test cases. So for example, the code should process each test case as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead the first line (n and m).\n\nRead the second line (n integers).\n\nRead the third line (m integers).\n\nThen compute the answer.\n\nSo the code should read all test cases. But how to read them? Well, in Python, the standard way is to read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three lines, and process each group.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think.\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as three separate test cases. So the code should process each of them. However, in practice, the problem might have only one test case. But the sample input shows multiple. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input is given as one test case. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's not the actual input. Maybe the user is providing multiple test cases as part of the example, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So perhaps the code should process one test case. But that's conflicting with the sample input. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement, it's unclear. But looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. \n\nBut the original problem's input is given as a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the problem expects the code to process a single test case. That would be confusing.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as a list of three test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input may not be that way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. For example, perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is using a format where the input is given as multiple test cases, each in their own line. But how to read that.\n\nBut given that the sample input is given as three separate test cases, and the output is three answers, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. So how to process that.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three lines (each test case being three lines). For example, the code can read all lines, then process them in groups of three.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let me think. For example, the code can read all the lines from stdin, then loop through them in chunks of three. For each chunk, process the test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, each test case is given as three lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: 5 4\n\nLine 2: 9 14 6 2 11\n\nLine 3: 8 4 7 20\n\nSo the code can read all lines, then for i in 0, 3, 6,... process the lines[i], lines[i+1], lines[i+2].\n\nBut how to read the input correctly. Let's proceed under the assumption that the code needs to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. \n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is given as per the first line containing n and m. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the actual code should process a single test case. However, the sample input and output show three test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them. For example, in the sample input, the input is given as three separate test cases. So the code must read them as such.\n\nSo here's the plan for the code:\n\nRead all the lines from stdin. Split them into groups of three. For each group, process as a test case.\n\nBut how to read the input? Let's think about the code.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines via sys.stdin.read().splitlines(). Then, process them in groups of three.\n\nBut for example, in the sample input, the first line is \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\", but that's probably not the case. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of three strings, each representing a test case. But in reality, the input is given as three separate test cases. For example, the first test case is three lines, the second is three lines, etc.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. So the code would process each test case as follows:\n\nRead n and m from the first line.\n\nRead the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nRead the next line as the list of b_j.\n\nSo the code can process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle that in the code.\n\nSo, in the code, perhaps the code will read all the lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut for the code submission, perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases, but the actual problem is expecting to read a single test case. However, given the sample input and output, it's necessary to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to know? Let's look back at the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m...\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows three test cases, which is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases for the purpose of the example, but the actual code is supposed to handle a single test case. In that case, the code would read the first line as n and m, then the next line as a_i, then the next line as b_j.\n\nBut in that case, the sample input is not properly formatted. For example, the first sample input line is \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\" which would be three lines. But perhaps the code is supposed to read the input as a single test case, and the sample input is written in a way that's not the actual input.\n\nBut the problem's sample input is given as a list of three inputs. However, the actual problem may have only one test case. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the code is supposed to process each of them. For example, the code is supposed to read from standard input, which may contain multiple test cases, each in three lines.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nLet me think about the code structure. Let's assume that the code needs to process multiple test cases. So the code can read all lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut for the problem's original input, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows three test cases, and the output shows three answers, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to confirm. Well, looking at the sample input and output, for example, the first test case's input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich would be three lines. The code would process these three lines as one test case.\n\nSo, the code needs to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. So the code should read all lines from stdin, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut how to do that in Python.\n\nLet me think: the code can read all lines into a list, then iterate over the list in steps of three. For each group of three lines, process the test case.\n\nSo for example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n    # process the test case here\n\n    n, m = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    b = list(map(int, lines[i+2].split()))\n\n    # compute the answer\n\n    # print the answer\n\n    i += 3\n\nBut this would work if the input is given as multiple test cases, each with three lines. However, if the input is a single test case, then this code would process it as well.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code needs to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output have three test cases, and the code must produce three outputs, the code must process multiple test cases. Hence, the code should be written as above.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n and m. Which suggests that it's a single test case. But perhaps the problem is that the sample input is formatted in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle one. \n\nBut how can we resolve this ambiguity?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output again. The sample input is given as a list of three test cases. The sample output is given as a list of three outputs. So the code must process each test case and output the corresponding result. So the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code should be written to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. \n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess in groups of three.\n\nFor each group:\n\ncount even and odd in a.\n\ncount even and odd in b.\n\ncompute answer as min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nSo now, the code can be written.\n\nLet's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_a: 14,6,2 → 3\n\nodd_a: 9,11 → 2\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]\n\neven_b: 8,4,20 → 3\n\nodd_b: 7 → 1\n\nanswer is min(3,1) + min(2,3) → 1 + 2 =3 → correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=5, m=1\n\na is [2,4,6,8,10] → all even → even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb is [5] → odd_b=1, even_b=0.\n\nanswer is min(5,1) + min(0,0) → 1 +0 =1 → correct.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na is [10] → even_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50] → all even → even_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nanswer is min(1,0) + min(0,4) → 0 +0 =0 → correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input. Let's proceed.\n\nThe code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and m\n\n        n, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        b = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        # count even and odd in a\n\n        even_a = 0\n\n        odd_a = 0\n\n        for num in a:\n\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n\n                even_a +=1\n\n            else:\n\n                odd_a +=1\n\n        # count even and odd in b\n\n        even_b = 0\n\n        odd_b = 0\n\n        for num in b:\n\n            if num %2 ==0:\n\n                even_b +=1\n\n            else:\n\n                odd_b +=1\n\n        res = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n\n        print(res)\n\nBut wait, what if there are not enough lines? Like, if the number of lines is not a multiple of three. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition problems, the code is supposed to read a single test case. But according to the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement's original input description, it's for one test case. \n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one. But the sample shows three test cases. However, the original problem may have a single test case. \n\nBut the user's note says that the sample input is given as a list of three inputs, and the output is three outputs. Hence, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut why would the problem have multiple test cases? It's possible that the problem is from a programming contest where multiple test cases are present, but the problem statement didn't mention that. \n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code must handle multiple test cases. Hence, the code above is correct.\n\nBut let's think again. What if the code is supposed to read a single test case? Then, the code would read the first three lines, and process them. But the sample input shows three test cases, so the code would process them. However, in that case, the sample input would have three test cases and the code would output three answers, which matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nBut for the sample input, the code would process each of the three test cases and print their outputs. Which matches the sample output.\n\nHence, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python. Also, note that the code should not have any print statements other than the answers. So the code is as written.\n\nNow, the code may have some edge cases. For example, when n=0 or m=0. But according to the problem statement, n and m are at least 1. Because the constraints say 1<=n, m <=1e5. So no need to handle zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when all chests are even and all keys are even. Then answer is zero.\n\nAnother case: when there are more keys than needed. For example, even_chests=2, odd_keys=5. Then min(2,5)=2. So that's handled.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys.
