On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo the key here is to figure out which subarray to reverse so that when we reverse it, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is as long as possible. Since the array is only made up of 1s and 2s, maybe there's a way to model this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the original approach. Normally, the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s can be found by counting the number of 1s and 2s, but since the sequence can have 1s followed by 2s, the maximum possible is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. But when you reverse a subarray, you might be able to fix some parts where there are 2s followed by 1s, which would break the non-decreasing order.\n\nWait, the original array might not be non-decreasing. For example, in the first sample input: [1, 2, 1, 2]. The LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But when you reverse positions 2-3, you get [1,1,2,2], which is fully non-decreasing, giving length 4.\n\nSo the idea is to find a subarray to reverse such that after reversing, the number of 1s followed by 2s is maximized. Because the LNDS for such an array would be the total count of 1s plus the count of 2s, but only if all 1s come before 2s. However, if there are some 2s before 1s, reversing a subarray could fix that.\n\nBut how do I model this? Let's think about the possible cases.\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS after any reversal would be the maximum between:\n\n- The original LNDS (without reversing anything)\n- The LNDS after reversing some subarray.\n\nBut checking all possible subarrays is O(n²), which for n=2000 would be 4 million possibilities. For each of those, we need to compute the LNDS. But computing the LNDS for each modified array would take O(n) time, leading to O(n³) time, which is 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think again. Since the array only has 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be calculated as follows: the maximum number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Or maybe it's the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s, but that's not right. Wait, no. For example, in a sequence like [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). But if we have [1,1,2,2], then it's 4. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements if the entire array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but that's not exactly correct either. Wait, no. Because even if there are 1s and 2s, the LNDS could be longer than the maximum count of either. For example, [1,2,2,1] has LNDS of 3 (1,2,2), but the count of 2s is 2 and 1s is 2. So the LNDS is the sum of the number of 1s and the number of 2s that are after the last 1. Or maybe the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but that's not right either. Hmm.\n\nWait, for any array of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, or the number of elements in the longest non-decreasing subsequence. Wait, no. For example, [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3 (the entire array is 1,2,1,2, which can't be non-decreasing). The maximum count of 1s is 2, 2s is 2. So the LNDS is 3, which is higher than both counts. So that approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nWait, but in the case of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be computed as follows: the maximum number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. Or perhaps, the maximum number of 1s that can be taken, followed by as many 2s as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the LNDS as the maximum possible count of 1s and 2s arranged in a non-decreasing way. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- The total number of 1s (if all 1s are taken, and then nothing else)\n- The total number of 2s (if all 2s are taken)\n- Or, the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1 in the original array. Or something similar.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, since the problem allows us to reverse any subarray, perhaps we can find the optimal way to arrange the 1s and 2s by considering how reversing a subarray can help merge some groups of 1s and 2s.\n\nLet me think about the optimal scenario. The best possible scenario is when the entire array is non-decreasing. If that's possible, then the answer is n. Otherwise, we need to find the best possible reversal.\n\nBut how can reversing a subarray help? Let's consider that the original array has some 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that part would turn them into 1s followed by 2s, which is better.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the original array is [1,2,1,2]. There's a 2 followed by a 1 (positions 2 and 3). Reversing that gives [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing.\n\nSo the idea is to find all the places where there are 2s followed by 1s, and reverse those regions to make them 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how to model this for the entire array?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the optimal LNDS after reversing a subarray is the maximum between:\n\nOriginal maximum LNDS, and\n\nthe maximum possible value obtained by considering all possible subarrays [l, r] that, when reversed, create a better arrangement.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the effect of reversing a subarray [l, r].\n\nAfter reversing, the elements in positions l to r are reversed. So, the original elements from l to r become reversed.\n\nNow, the LNDS of the new array depends on how the reversed segment interacts with the rest of the array.\n\nBut given that the array is only 1s and 2s, maybe we can model the problem in terms of the number of transitions between 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, think of the array as consisting of runs of 1s and 2s. For example, if the array is [1,1,2,2,1,2], then the runs are [1,1], [2,2], [1], [2].\n\nReversing a subarray that spans multiple runs could merge some runs, possibly reducing the number of transitions between 1 and 2, which would help the LNDS.\n\nBut how to find the best such reversal.\n\nAlternatively, since the LNDS for an array of 1s and 2s is the maximum between the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1, or the total number of 2s plus the number of 1s that come after the last 2 (but that seems not helpful). Wait, perhaps the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1, or the count of 2s plus the number of 1s that are after the last 2. But that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nIn any case, the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is the maximum of:\n\n- the total number of 1s (if all 1s are taken and no 2s)\n- the total number of 2s (if all 2s are taken and no 1s)\n- or, the number of 1s before some position plus the number of 2s after that position.\n\nWait, that makes sense. For example, if there's a point where all 1s are before it, and all 2s are after it, then the LNDS would be the total of 1s and 2s. But if there are some 2s before and 1s after, then that would be a problem.\n\nSo the maximum possible LNDS for the original array is the maximum over all possible positions i of (number of 1s up to i) + (number of 2s from i onwards). Because you can take all the 1s up to i, and then all the 2s after i, forming a non-decreasing sequence. The maximum of this over all i would be the LNDS.\n\nBut how does reversing a subarray affect this?\n\nSuppose we reverse a subarray [l, r]. How can this affect the maximum possible (number of 1s before some i) + (number of 2s after i)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal is one that allows us to merge some 1s and 2s that were previously in the wrong order.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nCompute the original maximum LNDS using the method described above (max over i of (count_1s_before_i + count_2s_after_i)).\n\nThen, for each possible reversal of [l, r], compute the new maximum LNDS and take the maximum over all possibilities.\n\nBut again, for n=2000, this would be O(n^3) time, which is not feasible.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think again. The maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is going to be the maximum between the original maximum and the maximum possible value that can be achieved by merging some 1s and 2s via a reversal.\n\nLet me think about the best possible scenario. The best scenario is when the entire array is non-decreasing. If that's possible, then the answer is n. If not, then perhaps the maximum is the original count of 1s plus the count of 2s minus the number of transitions between 2 and 1.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is immediately followed by a 1. Because each such occurrence breaks the non-decreasing sequence. But this is not quite accurate. For example, in the array [1,2,1,2], there are two such transitions (2→1 and 1→2?), no. Wait, the transitions between consecutive elements. Let's see:\n\nOriginal array: 1, 2, 1, 2. The transitions are 1→2 (good), 2→1 (bad), 1→2 (good). So two transitions. The maximum LNDS is 3. The total number of elements is 4. So 4 - 1 (number of bad transitions) = 3. Hmm, that seems to work here. Another example: [1,2,2,1]. Transitions are 1→2 (good), 2→2 (good), 2→1 (bad). So one bad transition. The LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). Which is 4-1=3. Another example: [2,1]. Transitions is 1 bad. LNDS is 1, which is 2-1=1. Seems to fit. What about [2,2,1,1]. Transitions are 2→2 (good), 2→1 (bad), 1→1 (good). So one bad transition. The LNDS is 2 (the two 2s or the two 1s). But according to the formula, it would be 4-1=3. Which is wrong. Oh, so this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So the previous idea is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the array as a sequence of 1s and 2s. The LNDS is the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order, which for this case is equivalent to the maximum number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Or, alternatively, the maximum between the count of 1s, the count of 2s, and the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think again. For the original array, the LNDS can be computed by considering the maximum between the count of 1s, count of 2s, and the maximum number of 1s up to some index plus the number of 2s from that index onwards.\n\nYes. For example, in the original array [1,2,1,2], the maximum of:\n\ncount_1s = 2, count_2s = 2.\n\nFor each index i:\n\ni=0: 1s before (0) + 2s after (2+1=3?) Wait, perhaps I need to precompute prefix sums.\n\nLet me define:\n\nprefix_1[i] = number of 1s in the first i elements (from 0 to i-1).\n\nprefix_2[i] = number of 2s in the first i elements.\n\nSimilarly, suffix_1[i] = number of 1s from position i to end.\n\nsuffix_2[i] = number of 2s from position i to end.\n\nThen for each index i (split point between the first part and the second part), the maximum possible LNDS is prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i].\n\nSo for the original array, the maximum of this over all i would be the LNDS.\n\nFor example, in [1,2,1,2], the prefix_1 array would be [0,1,1,2,2], and the suffix_2 array would be [2,2,1,1,0]. So for i=0, 0+2=2; i=1, 1+2=3; i=2, 1+1=2; i=3, 2+1=3; i=4, 2+0=2. The maximum is 3. Which matches the original LNDS.\n\nBut when we reverse a subarray, how does this change?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we reverse a subarray [l, r]. Then, the new array will have the elements from l to r reversed. How does this affect the prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays?\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can find the best possible reversal that maximizes the maximum (prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i]) after the reversal.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum LNDS after reversal is the maximum between the original value and the value obtained by some reversal.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of (number of 1s before some split point i) + (number of 2s after i) after any reversal.\n\nSo how can a reversal affect this value?\n\nLet me think of the reversal as inserting some 1s and 2s in a way that allows more 1s to be before i and more 2s after i.\n\nFor example, if there's a subarray that has some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing this subarray would turn those into 1s followed by 2s, which would allow more 1s to be before some split points and more 2s after.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal reversal is to find a segment that contains some 2s followed by 1s, and reverse it, thereby converting that segment into 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how to find the best such segment.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to find the maximum possible value of (number of 1s in the entire array) + (number of 2s in the entire array) - (number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array) + something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1. Because each such transition is a point where the sequence decreases. Reversing a subarray that contains some of these transitions could eliminate some of them.\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of 2→1 transitions in the array after reversal. Because each such transition is a place where the sequence breaks the non-decreasing property. So the fewer the transitions, the better.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the reversal that minimizes the number of 2→1 transitions.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the original array [1,2,1,2], there are two 2→1 transitions (the 2→1 at position 2, and the 1→2 is not a problem, but the 2→1 is). Wait, the transitions are between consecutive elements. So in [1,2,1,2], transitions are 1→2 (ok), 2→1 (bad), 1→2 (ok). So one bad transition. The LNDS is 3, which is 4-1=3. So this seems to hold. In the example where the array is [2,2,1,1], there is one bad transition (the 2→1). So the LNDS would be 4-1=3. But the actual LNDS is 2 (the two 2s or two 1s). So this contradicts the idea. So why?\n\nAh, because in that case, the LNDS is not 3. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this approach is not working.\n\nBack to the drawing board.\n\nLet me think again. The maximum possible LNDS for the array after reversal can be found by considering that the array will consist of some 1s followed by some 2s. Because that's the best possible scenario. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s, if all 1s are before all 2s. But if that's not possible, then the maximum is the maximum between that and other possibilities.\n\nBut how can reversing a subarray help us achieve that?\n\nLet me think about the number of 1s and 2s. Let total_1 = number of 1s in the array, total_2 = number of 2s. The maximum possible LNDS is min(total_1 + total_2, ...), but since the array is of length total_1 + total_2, the maximum possible is total_1 + total_2, but only if the array is non-decreasing. So the question is, can we reverse a subarray to make the array non-decreasing?\n\nIf yes, then the answer is n. Otherwise, the answer is something less.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nWell, the array can be made non-decreasing if there exists a subarray that, when reversed, turns all the 2s before the 1s into 1s before 2s. For example, if there is a single segment of 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that segment would make it 1s followed by 2s, thus making the entire array non-decreasing.\n\nBut if there are multiple such segments, reversing one of them may not help. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2,1], then there are multiple 2→1 transitions. Reversing any of them would only fix one of those transitions.\n\nBut in that case, the maximum LNDS would be total_1 + total_2 minus the number of transitions that cannot be fixed.\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum between:\n\n- The original maximum LNDS.\n\n- The maximum possible value of (total_1 + total_2 - k), where k is the number of 2→1 transitions in the array after reversal.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of 2→1 transitions in the array after reversal.\n\nSo to maximize the LNDS, we need to minimize the number of 2→1 transitions.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the reversal of a subarray that minimizes the number of 2→1 transitions in the new array.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think about how reversing a subarray affects the number of 2→1 transitions.\n\nThe original number of transitions can be calculated as the number of positions i where a[i] = 2 and a[i+1] = 1.\n\nWhen we reverse a subarray [l, r], the transitions inside the subarray will change, and the transitions between the subarray and the rest of the array may also change.\n\nFor example, consider the original transitions between l-1 and l, and between r and r+1. These may change after reversing.\n\nSo to calculate the change in the number of 2→1 transitions when reversing [l, r], we need to:\n\n- Subtract the original transitions inside [l, r], and between l-1 and l, and between r and r+1.\n\n- Add the new transitions after reversing the subarray.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet T be the original number of 2→1 transitions.\n\nWhen reversing [l, r], the new number of transitions is T' = T - old_transitions + new_transitions.\n\nWhere old_transitions is the number of 2→1 transitions that are affected by the reversal. These include:\n\n- The transition between l-1 and l (if l > 1)\n\n- The transition between r and r+1 (if r < n)\n\n- All transitions inside the subarray [l, r].\n\nSimilarly, new_transitions is the number of 2→1 transitions after reversing the subarray.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut for n=2000, and considering all possible l and r, this might be manageable.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this for all possible [l, r].\n\nFirst, precompute the original number of transitions T.\n\nThen, for each possible [l, r], compute the delta (change in transitions) caused by reversing it. The new number of transitions is T + delta. Our goal is to find the [l, r] that minimizes T + delta.\n\nOnce we find the minimum number of transitions, the maximum LNDS is n - (minimum number of transitions).\n\nBut wait, earlier examples showed that this might not hold. For instance, in the array [2,2,1,1], the original number of transitions is 1 (between 2 and 1). The minimum possible transitions is 0 if we reverse [2,3], making the array [2,1,2,1], which has transitions between 2 and 1, and 2 and 1 again. So no, that's not helpful. Wait, reversing [2,3] would change the array to [2, 1, 2, 1], which has two transitions (2→1 and 2→1). So the number of transitions increases. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, what's the best reversal for [2,2,1,1]? The original array has one 2→1 transition. If we reverse the entire array, it becomes [1,1,2,2], which has zero transitions. So the number of transitions becomes zero. So the LNDS would be 4, which is correct. So the delta for reversing [1,4] is -1 (original transitions was 1, new is 0). So the delta is -1. Thus, the maximum LNDS is 4-0=4.\n\nSo this approach seems to work in that case.\n\nSo the key idea is to find the reversal that reduces the number of 2→1 transitions as much as possible.\n\nThus, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Compute the original number of 2→1 transitions.\n\n2. For each possible reversal [l, r], compute how much the number of transitions changes.\n\n3. Find the minimum possible number of transitions after any reversal.\n\n4. The maximum LNDS is n - (minimum number of transitions).\n\nBut how to compute the delta for each [l, r]?\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFor a reversal of [l, r], the steps are:\n\n- Remove the transitions that are in the original array that are affected by the reversal.\n\nThese include:\n\na. The transition between l-1 and l (if l > 1).\n\nb. The transition between r and r+1 (if r < n).\n\nc. All transitions inside the subarray [l, r].\n\nThen, add the transitions that are introduced after reversing the subarray.\n\nThese include:\n\na. The new transition between l-1 and l (if l > 1).\n\nb. The new transition between r and r+1 (if r < n).\n\nc. All transitions inside the reversed subarray.\n\nLet me think of how to calculate the original transitions inside the subarray.\n\nThe original transitions inside [l, r] are the number of positions i in [l, r-1] where a[i] = 2 and a[i+1] = 1.\n\nSimilarly, after reversing the subarray, the new transitions inside [l, r] are the number of positions i in [l, r-1] where the reversed array's a[i] = 2 and a[i+1] = 1.\n\nBut the reversed array's [l, r] is the original a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l].\n\nSo, for the reversed subarray, the transitions inside [l, r] are the number of positions j in [l, r-1] where the new a[j] = 2 and new a[j+1] = 1.\n\nBut since the new a[j] is the original a[r - (j - l)] ?\n\nWait, for the reversed subarray, the element at position l becomes a[r], position l+1 becomes a[r-1], ..., position r becomes a[l].\n\nSo, for the original subarray [l, r], the reversed subarray has elements:\n\nnew_subarray[i] = original_subarray[r - (i - l)] = original_subarray[r - i + l].\n\nSo, for the new subarray, transitions between consecutive elements are between new_subarray[i] and new_subarray[i+1], for i in [l, r-1].\n\nWhich is equivalent to original_subarray[r - i + l] and original_subarray[r - (i+1) + l] = original_subarray[r - i + l - 1].\n\nSo, the transition between original_subarray[k] and original_subarray[k-1], for k from r downto l+1.\n\nSo, the number of transitions inside the reversed subarray is the same as the number of transitions in the original subarray, but in reverse order. However, the transitions themselves are between pairs of elements that were originally in the subarray. For example, if in the original subarray there was a transition from 2 to 1 at position i (original a[i] = 2 and a[i+1] = 1), then after reversing, this becomes a transition from 1 to 2 (since the elements are reversed), which is not a 2→1 transition. So the number of transitions inside the reversed subarray is equal to the number of transitions in the original subarray that were from 1→2, because when reversed they become 2→1. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal subarray has elements a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r.\n\nReversed subarray has elements a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l.\n\nThe transitions inside the reversed subarray are between consecutive elements. For each pair (a_r, a_{r-1}), (a_{r-1}, a_{r-2}), ..., (a_{l+1}, a_l}.\n\nEach of these pairs is the reverse of the original pairs in the subarray.\n\nFor example, the original transition between a_i and a_{i+1} is now a transition between a_{i+1} and a_i in the reversed subarray.\n\nSo, for each transition in the original subarray between a_i and a_{i+1}, the reversed subarray has a transition between a_{i+1} and a_i.\n\nSo, the number of 2→1 transitions inside the reversed subarray is equal to the number of 1→2 transitions in the original subarray.\n\nBecause for each original 1→2 transition, after reversal, it becomes 2→1, which contributes to the count. For original 2→1 transitions, after reversal, they become 1→2 transitions, which do not contribute to the count.\n\nAdditionally, for transitions that were 1→1 or 2→2, they remain the same after reversal.\n\nSo, the number of 2→1 transitions inside the reversed subarray is equal to the number of 1→2 transitions in the original subarray.\n\nLet me denote:\n\noriginal_inside = number of 2→1 transitions in the original subarray.\n\noriginal_1to2 = number of 1→2 transitions in the original subarray.\n\nThen, after reversal, the number of 2→1 transitions inside the reversed subarray is original_1to2.\n\nThus, the delta for the transitions inside the subarray is (original_1to2 - original_inside).\n\nBut how to compute original_inside and original_1to2 for any [l, r]?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of 2→1 transitions in the original subarray is original_inside, and the number of 1→2 transitions is original_1to2. Also, note that for each pair of consecutive elements in the subarray, it is either 2→1, 1→2, or same. So original_inside + original_1to2 + same = (r - l).\n\nSo, for each [l, r], we can precompute the number of 2→1 transitions (original_inside) and the number of 1→2 transitions (original_1to2).\n\nBut how to do this quickly.\n\nWe can precompute a prefix array for the number of 2→1 transitions up to each position. Similarly for 1→2 transitions.\n\nLet me think of building two prefix arrays:\n\nprefix_2to1[i] = number of 2→1 transitions in the first i elements (from position 1 to i-1? Or 0 to i-1? Need to clarify indices.)\n\nSimilarly, prefix_1to2[i] = number of 1→2 transitions in the first i elements.\n\nThen, for a subarray [l, r], the number of 2→1 transitions inside it is prefix_2to1[r] - prefix_2to1[l], but this depends on how the prefix arrays are defined.\n\nWait, the transitions are between positions i and i+1, for i from 1 to n-1.\n\nSo for the entire array, we can create an array trans where trans[i] = 1 if a[i] = 2 and a[i+1] = 1, else 0. Then, the number of 2→1 transitions in the original subarray [l, r] is the sum of trans[i] for i from l to r-1.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 1→2 transitions in the original subarray [l, r] is the sum of (1 if a[i] = 1 and a[i+1] = 2 else 0) for i from l to r-1.\n\nSo, for each [l, r], we can compute these sums quickly with prefix sums.\n\nSo, let's precompute two prefix arrays:\n\nprefix_2to1: where prefix_2to1[i] is the number of 2→1 transitions in the first i elements (i.e., positions 1 to i). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me define for each i from 1 to n-1, the value trans_2to1[i] = 1 if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1, else 0. Similarly for trans_1to2[i] = 1 if a[i] == 1 and a[i+1] == 2, else 0.\n\nThen, the number of 2→1 transitions in the range [l, r-1] (i.e., between positions l and r) is sum(trans_2to1[l..r-1]).\n\nSimilarly for 1→2 transitions.\n\nWe can build prefix sums for trans_2to1 and trans_1to2.\n\nOnce that is done, for any [l, r], we can compute the original_inside and original_1to2 quickly.\n\nNow, back to the delta calculation.\n\nThe delta for the transitions inside the subarray is (original_1to2 - original_inside).\n\nThen, we also need to consider the transitions between the subarray and the rest of the array.\n\nFor example, the transition between l-1 and l (if l > 1) and between r and r+1 (if r < n).\n\nLet me handle these separately.\n\nOriginal transitions:\n\n- between l-1 and l: if l > 1, it's trans_2to1[l-1] (but wait, trans_2to1 is for transitions between i and i+1. So for the transition between l-1 and l, it's trans_2to1[l-1] (if l-1 is between 1 and n-1).\n\nSimilarly, the transition between r and r+1 is trans_2to1[r].\n\nAfter reversing [l, r], the new transitions are:\n\n- between l-1 and l: now, the element at l-1 is a[l-1], and the element at l is the first element of the reversed subarray, which is a[r].\n\nSo, check if a[l-1] is 2 and a[r] is 1. If so, it contributes 1 to the new transitions.\n\nSimilarly for the transition between r and r+1: the element at r is the last element of the reversed subarray, which is a[l]. The element at r+1 is a[r+1]. Check if a[l] is 2 and a[r+1] is 1.\n\nSo, for each of these two transitions (if they exist), we need to calculate the original contribution and the new contribution, and compute the delta.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nFor the transition between l-1 and l (if l > 1):\n\noriginal_contribution = trans_2to1[l-1]\n\nnew_contribution = 1 if a[l-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1 else 0.\n\ndelta1 = new_contribution - original_contribution.\n\nSimilarly for the transition between r and r+1 (if r < n):\n\noriginal_contribution = trans_2to1[r]\n\nnew_contribution = 1 if a[l] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1 else 0.\n\ndelta2 = new_contribution - original_contribution.\n\nThe total delta for the entire reversal is:\n\ndelta_total = (original_1to2 - original_inside) + delta1 + delta2.\n\nThe new number of transitions is T + delta_total.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum possible T + delta_total over all possible [l, r].\n\nOnce we find this minimum, the maximum LNDS is n - min_transitions.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the original number of transitions T.\n\n2. Precompute prefix sums for trans_2to1 and trans_1to2.\n\n3. Iterate over all possible [l, r], compute for each the delta_total as explained.\n\n4. Find the minimum T + delta_total.\n\n5. The answer is max(original_LNDS, n - min_transitions).\n\nWait, but what about the original_LNDS? Because even if we reverse a subarray, the LNDS might not be n - min_transitions. For example, if there are multiple 2→1 transitions, but after reversing, the array is still not non-decreasing. However, the formula n - min_transitions assumes that each transition reduces the LNDS by 1. But earlier examples showed that this might not hold. However, in the example where the array is [2,2,1,1], after reversing [1,4], the number of transitions is 0, and the LNDS is 4. Which fits the formula.\n\nBut what about the case where the array has multiple transitions but after reversal, it's not non-decreasing. For example, the array [2,1,2,1]. Original transitions are 2→1 (between 1 and 2), and 2→1 (between 3 and 4). So T = 2. If we reverse the entire array, it becomes [1,2,1,2]. The transitions are 1→2 (no), 2→1 (yes), 1→2 (no). So T_new = 1. So the formula would say the LNDS is 4-1=3, which is indeed correct (the LNDS is 3, e.g., 1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of a given sequence consisting of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help reduce the number of transitions from 2 to 1, which in turn helps maximize the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Transitions**: First, count the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array. These transitions are problematic for a non-decreasing sequence.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: Precompute prefix sums for transitions from 2 to 1 and from 1 to 2. This helps quickly determine the number of such transitions in any subarray.\n3. **Evaluate Reversals**: For each possible subarray reversal, compute how it affects the number of 2→1 transitions. Specifically, calculate the change in transitions inside the subarray and at its boundaries.\n4. **Determine Minimum Transitions**: Find the minimum number of 2→1 transitions achievable by any reversal. The maximum LNDS is then derived from this minimum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute transitions\n    trans_2to1 = [0] * (n - 1)\n    trans_1to2 = [0] * (n - 1)\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1:\n            trans_2to1[i] = 1\n        elif a[i] == 1 and a[i+1] == 2:\n            trans_1to2[i] = 1\n    \n    # Prefix sums for transitions\n    prefix_2to1 = [0] * (n)\n    prefix_1to2 = [0] * (n)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_2to1[i] = prefix_2to1[i-1] + trans_2to1[i-1]\n        prefix_1to2[i] = prefix_1to2[i-1] + trans_1to2[i-1]\n    \n    T = prefix_2to1[n-1]\n    \n    min_transitions = T\n    \n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Calculate original_inside (number of 2->1 in [l, r-1])\n            if l == r:\n                original_inside = 0\n                original_1to2 = 0\n            else:\n                original_inside = prefix_2to1[r] - prefix_2to1[l]\n                original_1to2 = prefix_1to2[r] - prefix_1to2[l]\n            \n            delta_inside = original_1to2 - original_inside\n            \n            delta1 = 0\n            if l > 0:\n                original_contribution = trans_2to1[l-1]\n                new_contribution = 1 if (a[l-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1) else 0\n                delta1 = new_contribution - original_contribution\n            \n            delta2 = 0\n            if r < n - 1:\n                original_contribution = trans_2to1[r]\n                new_contribution = 1 if (a[l] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1) else 0\n                delta2 = new_contribution - original_contribution\n            \n            total_delta = delta_inside + delta1 + delta2\n            new_T = T + total_delta\n            if new_T < min_transitions:\n                min_transitions = new_T\n    \n    max_lnds = n - min_transitions\n    print(max_lnds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Transitions Counting**: We first count the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array. This helps us understand how many breaks there are in the non-decreasing order.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: Using prefix sums allows efficient calculation of transitions within any subarray, which is crucial for evaluating each possible reversal quickly.\n3. **Reversal Evaluation**: For each possible subarray reversal, we compute how it affects the transitions. This involves checking transitions inside the subarray and at its boundaries before and after reversal.\n4. **Optimal Result Calculation**: By finding the minimum number of transitions achievable through any reversal, we determine the maximum possible LNDS as the length of the array minus this minimum number of transitions.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently explore all possible subarray reversals while leveraging prefix sums for quick calculations, leading to an optimal solution.",
