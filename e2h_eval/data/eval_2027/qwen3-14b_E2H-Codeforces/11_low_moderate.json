A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible value determined by the available resources divided by the number of friends, right?\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt. But since there are n friends, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend makes one toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs their own portion. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl ml. Because each friend uses nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (one per friend), and n * np grams of salt (each friend uses np grams).\n\nSo the total number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute, and then take the minimum of those.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\nDrink: total available is k * l ml. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the maximum possible toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, if the division isn't exact, we take the floor, because you can't have partial toasts.\n\nLime slices: total available is c * d slices. Each toast requires n slices. So maximum toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: total available is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. For example, in the first sample, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So total drink is 20 ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note where they said 20/3=6 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend. Wait, no. Wait the note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". Wait that seems conflicting with my previous calculation. Wait let me check.\n\nWait the note says: the drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So per toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. For example, in the first sample, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. Then 20 / 9 is 2.222... which would be 2 toasts. But according to the note, it's 20 / 3 = 6. Wait that's a contradiction. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh wait, maybe I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each friend has one toast, so each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl ml. But in the note, the example says that 20 ml is enough for 6 toasts. Let's see: 20 / 3 = 6.666... So perhaps the note is considering that",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink available, the total number of lime slices, and the total amount of salt.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**: For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made given the constraints:\n   - **Drink**: Total drink available divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total lime slices available divided by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: Total salt available divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is found by taking the minimum of the values calculated from each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split into individual numbers\n    numbers = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the parameters\n    n = numbers[0]\n    k = numbers[1]\n    l = numbers[2]\n    c = numbers[3]\n    d = numbers[4]\n    p = numbers[5]\n    nl = numbers[6]\n    np = numbers[7]\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Drink per toast for all friends\n    drink_per_toast = n * nl\n    # Max toasts from drink\n    toasts_drink = total_drink // drink_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Slices per toast for all friends\n    lime_per_toast = n\n    # Max toasts from limes\n    toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // lime_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate total salt available\n    total_salt = p\n    # Salt per toast for all friends\n    salt_per_toast = n * np\n    # Max toasts from salt\n    toasts_salt = total_salt // salt_per_toast\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers representing the problem parameters.\n2. **Total Resources Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculated as the product of the number of bottles and milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculated as the product of the number of limes and slices per lime.\n   - **Salt**: Directly taken from the input as it's already in grams.\n3. **Toast Constraints**:\n   - **Drink**: Divided by the total drink required per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Divided by the number of slices required per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: Divided by the total salt required per toast for all friends.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value from the three constraints gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring no resource is exceeded.",
