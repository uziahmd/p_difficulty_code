    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what instability is. It's the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, when we remove one element, we want this difference to be as small as possible.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be: for each element in the array, remove it, compute the max and min of the remaining elements, then find the minimum instability. However, if the array is large (like up to 1e5 elements), this approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. For n=1e5, that's 1e10 operations—definitely not feasible.\n\nSo, I need a smarter approach. Let's think about the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). When we remove one element, the new max and min could be either the same as before (if the removed element was not the max or min) or they could change.\n\nWait, but if the array has multiple instances of the max or min, removing one of them might not affect the overall max or min. For example, if there are two 3s and one 7, removing the 7 would leave the max as 3. But if there's only one 7 and multiple 3s, removing the 7 would make the new max the next highest element.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to consider the cases where removing the max or min would help. But how do I find which element to remove?\n\nLet me think. The original array's max and min are known. Let's sort the array. Wait, maybe sorting can help here. Because once sorted, the max is the last element and min is the first. But when you remove an element, the new max and min would depend on which element you remove.\n\nBut for the problem, the key is that when you remove one element, the new array's max and min can be determined based on the original sorted array. Let's think:\n\nSuppose the array is sorted. Then, for each position i in the array, if I remove the element at position i, the new array's min and max would be:\n\n- If i is not the first element, the new min is the original min (a[0]) unless the first element was removed. Similarly for max.\n\nWait, maybe the idea is that after sorting, the possible candidates for the new min and max are limited. For example, when you remove an element, the new min is the min of the array excluding that element. But if the array is sorted, then:\n\nIf the element removed is the first element (the original min), then the new min is a[1]. Otherwise, the min remains a[0].\n\nSimilarly, if the element removed is the last element (original max), the new max is a[-2], else it remains a[-1].\n\nSo, the instability after removing element i would be:\n\nIf the array is sorted, then for each i, the new instability is:\n\nmax_candidate - min_candidate, where:\n\nmax_candidate = a[-1] if i != n-1 else a[-2]\n\nmin_candidate = a[0] if i != 0 else a[1]\n\nWait, but that's only considering the original min and max. However, what if after removing an element, the new max is not the original max, but some other element? For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. The original max is 100. If I remove 100, the new max is 4. But if I remove 4, the new max is 100. So, the instability would be 100-1=99 if I remove 4, but 4-1=3 if I remove 100.\n\nSo, in this case, the instability when removing an element is determined by the original max and min, except when the element being removed is the original max or min.\n\nWait, but in the sorted array, the original max is the last element. So, if we remove any element except the last, the max remains the last element. If we remove the last element, then the new max is the previous element (a[-2]).\n\nSimilarly for the min. So, in that case, the instability when removing element i is:\n\nIf the array is sorted as a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-1], then for each i:\n\nnew_min = a[0] if i != 0 else a[1]\n\nnew_max = a[-1] if i != n-1 else a[-2]\n\nThen, the instability is new_max - new_min.\n\nWait, but is that correct?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. After sorting, it's [1,3,3,7]. Let's check for each i:\n\ni=0 (remove 1): new array is [3,3,7]. new_min is 3, new_max is 7. instability is 4.\n\ni=1 (remove 3): new array is [1,3,7]. min is 1, max is 7. instability 6.\n\ni=2 (remove 3): same as i=1. instability 6.\n\ni=3 (remove 7): new array is [1,3,3]. min is 1, max is 3. instability 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo according to this formula, the instability for removing i is (if the array is sorted):\n\nfor each i, the instability is:\n\nif i is 0: new_min is a[1], new_max is a[-1]. So instability is a[-1] - a[1]\n\nif i is n-1: new_min is a[0], new_max is a[-2]. instability is a[-2] - a[0]\n\nelse: new_min is a[0], new_max is a[-1]. instability is a[-1] - a[0]\n\nWait, but in this case, the instability is either a[-1] - a[0], or a[-1] - a[1], or a[-2] - a[0]. So, the minimal instability would be the minimum among these possibilities.\n\nWait, but this would imply that the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\na[-1] - a[0] (if we remove an element that is neither the first nor last in the sorted array)\n\na[-1] - a[1] (if we remove the first element)\n\na[-2] - a[0] (if we remove the last element)\n\nBut wait, in the example, when we remove the last element (7), the instability is a[-2] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[0]) (when we remove an element that's not the first or last in the sorted array), (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut why? Because when you remove any element that's not the first or last in the sorted array, the min and max remain the same. Therefore, the instability is the same as original (a[-1] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but in that case, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[0]) (if we remove an element not the first or last), (a[-1] - a[1]) (if we remove the first element), (a[-2] - a[0]) (if we remove the last element). So the answer is the minimum among these three values.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n- (a[-1] - a[0]) (if we remove an element in the middle)\n\n- (a[-1] - a[1]) (if we remove the first element)\n\n- (a[-2] - a[0]) (if we remove the last element)\n\nBut then, what if the array has multiple elements that are same as the min or max?\n\nFor example, consider the array [1,1,1,1]. Then, removing any element gives [1,1,1], instability 0. So according to the formula, the original a[-1] - a[0] is 0, and the other options are also 0. So the minimum is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 4 (5-2=3?), wait no. Wait, the array after removing first element is [2,3,4,5], so instability is 5-2=3. Which is a[-1] - a[1] (since original a[-1] is 5, a[1] is 2). So the formula says that when we remove the first element, the instability is 5-2=3. Similarly, if we remove the last element, the instability is (a[-2] - a[0]) = 4 - 1 = 3. And if we remove any other element, the instability is 5-1=4. So the minimal instability is 3.\n\nWhich is indeed correct. So the answer would be min(4, 3, 3) = 3.\n\nSo according to this logic, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[0]), (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]). Wait, but what if the array has more than two elements? For example, n=5. Then, when you remove any of the middle elements, the instability is a[-1]-a[0], which is the original instability. But if you remove the first element, the instability is a[-1] - a[1], and if you remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal is the minimum between those three possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the approach would be:\n\nSort the array. Then, compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[0]), (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]). Wait, but what if n is 2? For example, the second example in the problem: input is 2 elements, 1 and 100000. After sorting, the array is [1, 100000]. Then, if we remove the first element, the instability is 0 (since the array is [100000], but the problem says n is 2, and after removing one element, the array is of size 1. So the instability is 0. Similarly for removing the second element. So according to our formula, the possible options are:\n\nOriginal a[-1] - a[0] is 99999. But since n=2, when we remove the first element, the instability is a[-1] (which is 100000) minus a[1] (but since the array is length 2, after removing the first element, the array is [a[1]], so the instability is 0. But according to our previous formula, when n=2, the a[-1] - a[1] would be a[1] - a[1] = 0. Similarly for a[-2] - a[0] (a[0] - a[0] = 0). So the formula works.\n\nSo the general solution would be:\n\nSort the array. Then, compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[0]) (if we remove any element that is not the first or last in the sorted array), (a[-1] - a[1]) (if we remove the first element), (a[-2] - a[0]) (if we remove the last element). Then, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but what if the array has more than two elements? For example, n=3. Let's say the array is [1, 2, 3]. Then, removing the first element (1) gives [2,3], instability 1. Removing the last element (3) gives [1,2], instability 1. Removing the middle element (2) gives [1,3], instability 2. So the minimal is 1. According to the formula, the three options are:\n\nOriginal instability is 3-1=2. Then, a[-1]-a[1] is 3-2=1. a[-2]-a[0] is 2-1=1. So the minimum is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula seems to work. Therefore, the approach is:\n\nSort the array. Then, compute the minimum between:\n\n- a[-1] - a[0] (the original instability, which is the case when we remove an element that is not the first or last in the sorted array)\n\n- a[-1] - a[1] (the case when we remove the first element)\n\n- a[-2] - a[0] (the case when we remove the last element)\n\nWait, but for the case when n=2, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0], but when you remove one element, the instability is 0. So according to the formula, the three options would be:\n\noriginal instability (a[-1]-a[0] = 99999), a[-1]-a[1] (which is a[-1] - a[1] = 100000 - 100000 = 0), and a[-2] - a[0] (a[-2] is a[0], so 1-1=0). So the minimum is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula works for all n >= 2.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the three possible values:\n\noption1 = a[-1] - a[0]\n\noption2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\noption3 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nThe answer is min(option1, option2, option3).\n\nWait, but why do we consider only those three options?\n\nBecause when you remove any element except the first or last in the sorted array, the instability is option1. So the minimal among all possible removals would be the minimum between option1, option2, option3.\n\nBut why not other possibilities? For example, if the array is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], and we remove the third element (5), then the instability is 9-1=8. Which is option1. But if we remove the first element, the instability is 9-3=6 (option2). If we remove the last element, instability is 7-1=6 (option3). So the minimal is 6. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there's another scenario where removing a different element gives a better result?\n\nLet me think of a case where the best is not among these three options.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. Sorted. Original instability is 5-1=4. Now, if we remove 2, the array becomes [1,4,5], instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 4, the array becomes [1,2,5], instability 5-1=4. So the minimal is still 4. But according to the formula, option1 is 4, option2 is 5-2=3 (if we remove the first element, which is 1, then the array is [2,4,5], instability 5-2=3). Option3 is a[-2] - a[0] = 4-1=3. So the answer is min(4,3,3)=3. Which is correct. So the formula gives the correct answer.\n\nSo, in this case, the formula works.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. Suppose we remove 3, the instability is 7-1=6. But if we remove 7, the instability is 5-1=4. Which is option3. If we remove 1, instability is 7-3=4. Which is option2. So the answer is 4.\n\nBut according to the formula, option1 is 7-1=6, option2 is 7-3=4, option3 is 5-1=4. So the minimum is 4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, the approach is to sort the array, then compute the minimum of these three options.\n\nThus, the steps for the code are:\n\nRead n and the array.\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2, then the answer is 0 (since removing one element leaves one element, instability is zero). Wait, but according to the formula, for n=2, option1 is a[-1] - a[0], option2 is a[-1] - a[1] (which is a[-1] - a[1] = a[-1] - a[-1] = 0), option3 is a[-2] - a[0] (a[0] - a[0] = 0). So the min is 0. Which is correct. So the code can handle that.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the three options, then take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3?\n\nFor example, array [1, 2, 3]. The options are:\n\noption1 = 3-1=2.\n\noption2 = 3-2=1.\n\noption3 = 2-1=1.\n\nminimum is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute min( (a[-1] - a[0]), (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) )\n\nBut wait, what if the array has multiple elements and the best is to remove an element that's not the first or last in the sorted array? For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and we remove 3. Then the instability is 5-1=4. Which is option1. But if we remove the first element (1), instability is 5-2=3. Which is option2. So the minimum is 3. So the formula works.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 100]. So the original instability is 100-1=99. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 100 - 5 = 95. If we remove the last element (100), the instability is 5 -1 =4. So the formula would compute option1 as 99, option2 as 100-5=95, option3 as 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to capture all possibilities.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it.\n\nIf n is 2, then output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the three options and take the minimum.\n\nWait, but for n=3, the code would compute the three options. Let me see:\n\nFor n=3, the options are:\n\noption1: a[-1] - a[0] (the original instability)\n\noption2: a[-1] - a[1] (removing the first element)\n\noption3: a[-2] - a[0] (removing the last element)\n\nSo for example, array [1, 2, 3], the options are 2, 1, 1. So min is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 3, 5], and we remove the middle element (3). Then the instability is 5-1=4. Which is option1. But the other options are option2 (5-3=2) and option3 (3-1=2). So the minimum is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the three options as mentioned, and return the minimum of them.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option3 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2, option3))\n\nWait, but what about when n is larger than 3, but removing an element in the middle that's not the first or last in the sorted array? For example, the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Removing 3 would leave [1,2,4,5], instability is 5-1=4. Which is the same as option1. So the code considers that case in option1.\n\nBut what if there's a scenario where removing a middle element (not first or last) gives a better instability than the three options? For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. Then, the original instability is 99. If we remove 100, the instability is 4-1=3. If we remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. If we remove 2, the instability is 100-1=99. If we remove 3, instability is 100-1=99. If we remove 4, instability is 100-1=99. So the minimal is 3. Which is option3 (a[-2] - a[0] = 4 - 1 = 3). So the code would compute option1 (100-1=99), option2 (100-2=98), option3 (4-1=3). So the minimum is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 4, 5, 100]. If we remove 100, the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. So the code's option3 is 5-1=4. So the code returns min(99, 98, 4) = 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait, but what if the array is [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The original instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 4, the instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 1, the instability is 7-5=2. If we remove 7, the instability is 6-1=5. So the minimal is 2. Which is option2 (a[-1] - a[1] = 7 - 5 = 2). Which is correct.\n\nYes, the code would compute that.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1 = 7-1=6\n\noption2 = 7 - a[1] = 7-3=4\n\noption3 = a[-2] - a[0] = 3 -1=2 → min(6,4,2) → 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted is [1, 100000]. So n=2, output 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. Output is min(2, 1, 1) → 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 1]. All options are 0, so output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The options are 4, 3 (5-2=3), 3 (4-1=3). So min is 3.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it. Then if n is 2, output 0. Else compute the three options and take the min.\n\nBut wait, in the case when n is 3, the code will compute the three options. For example, for the array [1, 3, 3], sorted. option1 is 3-1=2. option2 is 3 - a[1] = 3-3=0. option3 is a[-2] - a[0] = 3-1=2. So the min is 0. Which is correct. Because removing the first element (1) gives [3,3], instability 0.\n\nYes, the code would return 0.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut wait, what about n=1? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list.\n\nSort it.\n\nIf n == 2: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the three options and take min.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[0]\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option3 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2, option3))\n\nWait, but for n=3, the code would compute option1 as a[-1] - a[0], which is the original instability. But when you remove an element that's not first or last (i.e., the middle element), the instability is the same as the original. So the code's option1 is that value. But the code compares with option2 and option3, which are the possibilities when removing the first or last element.\n\nBut in this case, the code works.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 100]. So sorted. Then, the best is to remove 100, giving instability 5-1=4. Or remove 1, giving instability 100-5=95. So the code would compute option1 as 100-1=99, option2 as 100 - 5 = 95, option3 as 5-1=4. So min is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 3 1 1 1000. Sorted [1,1,1000]. option1 is 1000-1=999. option2 is 1000-1=999. option3 is 1 -1 =0. So min is 0. Which is correct. Removing the last element (1000) gives [1,1], instability 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the minimum and maximum values after removing elements.\n2. **Evaluate Key Scenarios**: After sorting, the key scenarios to consider for minimizing instability are:\n   - Removing the first element of the sorted array.\n   - Removing the last element of the sorted array.\n   - Removing any other element (which leaves the original min and max unchanged).\n3. **Calculate Instability for Each Scenario**:\n   - If we remove the first element, the new instability is calculated using the second element as the new minimum.\n   - If we remove the last element, the new instability is calculated using the second-to-last element as the new maximum.\n   - If we remove any other element, the instability remains the same as the original array's instability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[0]\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option3 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2, option3))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for calculating instability.\n2. **Handling Edge Case for n=2**: If the array has only two elements, removing either will leave a single element, resulting in zero instability.\n3. **Evaluating Scenarios**:\n   - **Option 1**: The original instability if any middle element is removed.\n   - **Option 2**: Instability if the first element is removed, using the second element as the new minimum.\n   - **Option 3**: Instability if the last element is removed, using the second-to-last element as the new maximum.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among these three scenarios gives the desired result, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting.",
