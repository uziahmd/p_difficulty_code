She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about Luba closing browser tabs as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the operations available. Each second, she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. Closing tabs is a one-second operation, but moving takes one second per step. So the challenge is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closes.\n\nLet me think about the scenarios. The initial state has all tabs open. But after some closes, the a and b values (the current min and max of open tabs) change. However, since we need to end up with exactly the tabs [l, r], the final a is l and b is r. \n\nBut during the process, when closing tabs, the a and b are determined by the current open tabs. However, perhaps we can model the problem without considering the dynamic changes of a and b, because the final goal is fixed. Let me think: the tabs that need to be closed are those outside [l, r]. So, the problem reduces to closing all tabs left of l and right of r. \n\nSo the key is to find the minimal steps required to reach a position where she can close the left and right parts. \n\nLet me consider different cases based on the initial position and the target range [l, r].\n\nFirst, check if the current position is already within [l, r]. If so, maybe she can close left and right in some steps. But if not, she needs to move into the correct position.\n\nBut how to model the steps?\n\nLet me think about the two required operations: closing all tabs to the left of the target range (i.e., closing tabs from 1 to l-1) and closing all tabs to the right of the target range (r+1 to n). \n\nBut to close these, she must be at the correct position. For example, to close all tabs to the left, she must be at position l. Because when she closes all tabs to the left, that would close [a, i-1], where a is the current min. Initially, a is 1. But once she closes the left part, then the new a becomes l. Similarly for closing the right part: she must be at position r to close all tabs to the right (since that would close [i+1, b], which would be r+1 to n).\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to close both sides with fewer steps. For example, if she's already in the correct position, she can close both sides in two operations. But maybe not, because closing one side might affect the other. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- She needs to close all tabs to the left of l. To do that, she must be at position l. Then she can close all tabs to the left (which would be from 1 to l-1). Similarly, to close all tabs to the right of r, she must be at position r, then close all tabs to the right (r+1 to n). \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to do it more efficiently. Like, if she is at position l, and closes the left, then moves to r and closes the right. Or maybe she can close the right first, then move to l and close the left. Or maybe she can do it in a way that requires fewer steps.\n\nBut the order of closing left and right might affect the steps required. Also, the initial position of the cursor plays a role here.\n\nSo, the problem breaks down into two main parts: moving to the correct positions to perform the close operations, and then performing those closes.\n\nBut what's the minimal steps needed?\n\nLet me think about the steps required for each case.\n\nCase 1: The target range [l, r] is already the entire set of tabs. So l=1 and r=n. Then nothing needs to be done. So answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: The target range is such that l=1 and r <n. Then, she needs to close all tabs to the right of r. To do that, she must be at position r, then close the right. How to get there? Depending on her current position.\n\nSimilarly, if l>1 and r =n, then she needs to close all tabs to the left of l, which requires being at l, then closing left.\n\nIf both l>1 and r <n, then she needs to close left and right. So she has to move to l, close left, then move to r, close right. Or move to r, close right, then move to l, close left. Which is better?\n\nBut how to compute the minimal steps for these scenarios?\n\nLet me think about the steps needed for each scenario.\n\nFirst, determine whether the current position is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all browser tabs outside a specified range [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the target range [l, r] already includes all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no operations are needed.\n2. **Closing Tabs on the Left**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, Luba must move to position `l` and then close all tabs to the left.\n3. **Closing Tabs on the Right**: If there are tabs to the right of `r`, Luba must move to position `r` and then close all tabs to the right.\n4. **Calculate Moves**: Compute the minimum steps required to move to the necessary positions for closing tabs on both sides and sum these steps along with the closing operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    steps = 0\n    # Check if we need to close left side (tabs before l)\n    if l > 1:\n        # Need to move to l and close left\n        steps += abs(pos - l)\n        steps += 1  # close left\n    # Check if we need to close right side (tabs after r)\n    if r < n:\n        # Need to move to r and close right\n        steps += abs(pos - r)\n        steps += 1  # close right\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the target range covers all tabs, the result is zero.\n- **Closing Tabs on the Left**: If `l` is greater than 1, Luba needs to move from her current position to `l` and then close the tabs to the left. The movement time is the absolute difference between her current position and `l`.\n- **Closing Tabs on the Right**: Similarly, if `r` is less than `n`, Luba needs to move from her current position to `r` and then close the tabs to the right. The movement time here is the absolute difference between her current position and `r`.\n- **Total Steps**: Sum the movement steps and the closing operations (each closing operation takes one second).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimal steps required by focusing on the necessary movements and closures, considering both left and right sides independently.",
