During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, let's note that adding k to both a and b. Let me denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since k is the same for both, y - x = (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So the difference between x and y is fixed as (b -a). Let's assume that a and b are such that a < b. Wait, but maybe we should consider the absolute difference. Because if a is bigger than b, then the difference would be negative, but the absolute difference is the same. So maybe we can let d = |a - b|. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the LCM of x and y, where x and y differ by d. Let me think: Let's suppose that a < b. Then, x = a +k, y = b +k = x + (b -a). Let me call d = b -a. So y = x +d. Then, the LCM of x and x +d. \n\nThe LCM of two numbers can be calculated as (x * (x +d)) / gcd(x, x+d). But since gcd(x, x +d) is the same as gcd(x, d). Because gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d). So the LCM is (x*(x +d))/gcd(x, d). \n\nSo our goal is to minimize this value. But how?\n\nLet me think. Since d is fixed (assuming a < b), then the problem reduces to finding x (which is a +k, so x >= a, since k is non-negative) such that the LCM of x and x +d is minimized. Then, once we find the optimal x, we can compute k as x -a. But since k must be non-negative, x must be at least a. \n\nBut wait, if a is larger than b, then d would be a -b, and then y would be x -d. But in that case, the same logic applies. So perhaps we can let d = |a -b|, and then find x such that x and x +d (or x -d?) have minimal LCM. \n\nBut regardless of the direction, the problem is symmetric. So let's assume without loss of generality that a <= b. Then d = b -a. Then, the problem becomes find x >= a (since k >=0 implies x = a +k >= a) such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. \n\nSo, what's the optimal x here? Well, the LCM of x and x +d is (x*(x +d)) / gcd(x, x +d) = (x*(x +d))/g, where g is gcd(x, d). Because x +d -x =d, so the gcd(x, x +d) is same as gcd(x, d). \n\nSo, to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the gcd(x, d). Because the denominator is larger, which would make the overall value smaller. \n\nSo the idea is that for x, we want to choose x such that it's as large as possible in terms of sharing factors with d. \n\nBut how do we find such x?\n\nAlternatively, since x and x +d have a difference of d, their gcd is the same as gcd(x, d). Let me think: For example, if x is a multiple of d, then x +d is also a multiple of d. So their gcd would be d. Which is the maximum possible. So in that case, the LCM would be (x*(x +d))/d. Which would be x*(x +d)/d. But since x is a multiple of d, let's say x = m*d. Then the LCM would be m*d * (m*d +d) /d = m*d * (m+1)*d /d = m*(m+1)*d. Which is m(m+1)d. To minimize this, we need to minimize m. Since x = m*d >= a. So m is the smallest integer such that m*d >=a. \n\nBut perhaps that's one candidate for x. Let's think about that. For example, in the first sample input: a=6, b=10. Then d =4. So x is 6 +k. We want x to be a multiple of 4. The smallest x >=6 which is a multiple of 4 is 8. Then, k would be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. The key insight here is to recognize that the LCM of two numbers can be minimized by maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Difference Calculation**: Calculate the absolute difference $ d $ between $ a $ and $ b $.\n2. **Optimal Multiple**: The optimal value of $ k $ occurs when $ a + k $ is a multiple of $ d $. This is because the GCD of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ will be maximized when $ a + k $ is a multiple of $ d $, which in turn minimizes the LCM.\n3. **Determine Minimum $ k $**: Compute the smallest non-negative $ k $ such that $ a + k $ is a multiple of $ d $. If $ a $ is already a multiple of $ d $, then $ k = 0 $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef minimal_k(a, b):\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        return 0\n    # We need to find the smallest k >=0 such that (a +k) is a multiple of d\n    # So, find the smallest m such that m*d >= a\n    # m = ceil(a / d)\n    # But since a +k = m*d => k = m*d - a\n    # However, if a is already divisible by d, then m = a//d\n    # But if a is not divisible by d, then m = (a // d) + 1\n    m = (a + d - 1) // d  # equivalent to ceiling division\n    k = m * d - a\n    return k\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    for i in range(0, len(input), 2):\n        a = int(input[i])\n        b = int(input[i+1])\n        print(minimal_k(a, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Difference Calculation**: The absolute difference $ d $ between $ a $ and $ b $ is calculated to determine the interval over which we need to find the optimal $ k $.\n2. **Ceiling Division**: By using ceiling division, we determine the smallest integer $ m $ such that $ m \\times d $ is greater than or equal to $ a $. This ensures that $ a + k $ is a multiple of $ d $, maximizing the GCD and thus minimizing the LCM.\n3. **Compute $ k $**: The value of $ k $ is derived from the smallest multiple of $ d $ that is greater than or equal to $ a $, ensuring the smallest non-negative $ k $ is chosen.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal $ k $ in constant time, ensuring it handles all edge cases and large inputs within the constraints.",
