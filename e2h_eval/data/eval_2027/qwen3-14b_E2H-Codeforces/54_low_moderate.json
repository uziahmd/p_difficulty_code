Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me recall that in a regular polygon, each interior angle can be calculated. Wait, but here the angle we're talking about isn't necessarily an interior angle. For example, in the sample input with a square (n=4), they can create angles of 45 or 90 degrees. So how does that happen?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a regular polygon with n sides. Let's consider choosing three vertices v1, v2, v3. The angle at v2 is formed by the lines v2v1 and v2v3. Now, since the polygon is regular, the positions of these points are symmetric. \n\nSo maybe the key is to find the number of steps between the vertices. For example, in a regular polygon, if you pick two adjacent vertices, the central angle between them is 360/n degrees. But when considering the angle at a vertex, perhaps there's a formula based on how many vertices apart the other points are.\n\nLet me think about the angle at v2. Suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k edges. Wait, for example, in a square (n=4), if we take vertices 1, 2, 3: the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if we take vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 would be something else. Wait, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle depends on how many vertices are between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. Let's imagine that in a regular polygon, the angle at v2 depends on the number of sides between v1 and v3. For instance, in a regular pentagon (n=5), if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 (like 1,2,3), then the angle at 2 would be the interior angle. But if they are further apart, like 1,2,4, then the angle would be different.\n\nWait, here's a formula I remember from geometry. For a regular polygon, the measure of the angle formed by three vertices where v2 is the middle vertex, and there are k steps between v1 and v3 (i.e., there are k-1 vertices between them along one side of the polygon), then the angle at v2 is given by (k * 180) / n degrees. Or wait, perhaps it's ( (k-1) * 180 ) / n? No, maybe I need to derive it.\n\nLet me think of the regular polygon inscribed in a circle. Each vertex lies on a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 2π/n radians, which is 360/n degrees. Now, the angle at v2 (say, vertex A) between points B and C. Let's say that between B and C, there are m edges. So, the arc from B to C (passing through the other side of the polygon) would be m * (360/n) degrees. Wait, but the angle at A depends on the arc opposite to it. \n\nIn circle theorems, the inscribed angle theorem says that an angle subtended at the circumference is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc. So, if we have points B and C, and A is another point on the circumference, then the angle BAC is half the measure of the arc BC that does not contain A. \n\nWait, but in our case, the polygon is regular, so all vertices lie on a circle. Let's suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps when moving clockwise around the polygon. Then the arc between them is k*(360/n) degrees. However, the angle at v2 (which is between v1 and v3) would depend on the arc that's opposite. Wait, perhaps the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that's opposite to it. \n\nLet me try with the square example. Suppose n=4. If I take vertices 1, 2, 3. The arc from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (each step is 90 degrees). So the arc is 180 degrees. The angle at 2 is 90 degrees, which is half of 180. That fits. Now, if I take vertices 1,2,4. The arc from 1 to 4 is 3 steps (each 90) which is 270 degrees. But the angle at 2 would be half of the arc that's opposite",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently calculating the closest possible angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular polygon with `n` sides, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees. For any three vertices `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` where `v2` is the vertex of the angle, the angle at `v2` can be determined by the number of steps between `v1` and `v3` around the polygon.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle at vertex `v2` depends on the arc opposite to it. For a given number of steps `k` between `v1` and `v3`, the angle at `v2` is `(k * 180) / n` degrees.\n3. **Finding Closest Angle**: We need to find the integer `k` such that the angle `(k * 180) / n` is closest to `a`. This involves checking values of `k` from 1 to `n-2` (as valid angles are formed with at least one vertex between `v1` and `v3`).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import math\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # The angle at v2 is (k * 180) / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 (excluding v2)\n    # We need to find k such that this angle is as close as possible to a\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    for k in range(1, n - 1):\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k for consistency\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    \n    # Now, find a triplet of vertices that forms this angle\n    # Let's pick v2 as 1, then v1 and v3 are 1 + best_k + 1 and 1 - 1?\n    # Wait, need to ensure that the vertices are distinct and properly placed.\n    # For example, for k steps between v1 and v3, the positions could be:\n    # v2 is at position 1, v1 is at position 1 - best_k (mod n), and v3 is at position 1 + best_k (mod n)\n    # But need to handle wrapping around.\n    # Alternatively, choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k (but need to check)\n    \n    # To avoid confusion, let's use a fixed pattern.\n    # Choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k (but need to wrap around)\n    # However, since the polygon is cyclic, we can choose any starting point.\n    # Let's pick v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as (2 + best_k) % n if it's not 0, else n.\n    # But wait, for best_k steps between v1 and v3, when v2 is in the middle.\n    # Maybe better to use the following approach:\n    # For best_k steps between v1 and v3, with v2 being the vertex between them.\n    # So, for example, if best_k is 1, then v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2.\n    # So, let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as (1 + best_k + 1) mod n?\n    # Maybe an easier way is to set v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as (1 + best_k + 1) if within range.\n    # But perhaps the simplest way is to take v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as (best_k + 2).

If v2 is at position 1, then the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the polygon's perimeter (excluding v2) should be best_k.\n    # So if v1 is at position 2, and v3 is at position 2 + best_k, then the number of steps between v1 and v3 is best_k. But only if 2 + best_k <= n.\n    # Otherwise, it wraps around. But since best_k is at most n-2, 2 + best_k can be at most n.\n    # For example, if n=5, best_k=3, then 2+3=5, which is valid.\n    # So, v3 = 2 + best_k\n    # So the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+best_k\n    \n    # Wait, but in the sample input for n=4 and a=67, the best_k is 1 (since 45 is closer to 67 than 90). So the output is 2 1 3. Which fits: v2=1, v1=2, v3=3. The steps between v1 and v3 is 1.\n    # So the code above would generate v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + 1 = 3, which is correct.\n    \n    # Another sample: n=4, a=68. The best_k is 2 (since 90 is closer to 68 than 45). Then v3 = 2 + 2 = 4. So the triplet is 2, 1, 4. Which is one of the correct outputs.\n    \n    # So this approach seems to work.\n    # However, what if best_k is such that 2 + best_k exceeds n? For example, n=5, best_k=3. 2+3=5, which is valid.\n    # If best_k=4, then 2+4=6, but n=5. But best_k can't be 4 because n-2 is 3 for n=5.\n    \n    # Therefore, the code is safe.\n    \n    # So, the output is v1, v2, v3 as 2, 1, (2 + best_k)\n    # However, in the first sample input, n=3 and a=15. The best_k is 1, since (1*180)/3 = 60. The output is 1 2 3. But according to our code, it would output 2 1 3. Which is also correct, but the sample output is 1 2 3.
