For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem statement again. For each binary string s (of any length up to n), we choose a c_s between 0 and k. Then, a beautiful multiset is one where for every s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. The maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. We need to count the number of valid choices of c_s's that make this true.\n\nHmm. So the main idea is to model the constraints on the c_s's such that when you choose them, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. But how do we relate the c_s's to this maximum?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. For each binary string s, the count of how many times it's a prefix in the multiset must be ≤ c_s. But how does that affect the maximum size of the multiset?\n\nWait, the multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n. Each such string contributes to the count of all its prefixes. For example, the string \"01\" (length 2) contributes to the count of \"0\" (prefix of length 1), and \"01\" (prefix of length 2). \n\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints on all the prefixes. So, for the multiset to be as large as possible, we need to maximize the number of strings in it while respecting all the c_s constraints. \n\nThis feels similar to some kind of tree structure, where each node represents a binary string (prefix), and the constraints are on the number of times each node can be \"used\". But since each string in the multiset is of length n, each such string corresponds to a path from the root (empty string?) down to a leaf of depth n. Wait, but the problem says the binary strings in the multiset are of length exactly n. So each string in the multiset is a path of length n, and for each prefix s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is limited by c_s.\n\nBut how do we model the maximum possible size of such a multiset? It seems like this is equivalent to finding the minimum over all possible constraints. Because each string in the multiset contributes to multiple prefixes. For example, if you have a string of length n, then all its prefixes (from length 1 to n) have their counts increased by 1. Therefore, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is constrained by the sum of the capacities along certain paths, but perhaps more accurately, it's constrained by the capacities of the prefixes along each path.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible size of the multiset given the c_s's? Let's think of it as a flow problem. For each node (prefix), the number of strings passing through it can't exceed c_s. However, since each string is a path from root to a leaf (depth n), the problem becomes similar to a tree where each node has two children (0 and 1), and we want to select a set of leaves (paths) such that for each node, the number of paths passing through it is at most c_s. The maximum number of such paths is what we need to compute.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of paths (strings) that can be selected under these constraints would be determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths. However, this is not straightforward. For example, if you have a node with capacity 2, but all its children have higher capacities, then you can only have 2 paths going through that node. But since each path goes through all ancestors, the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum capacity along all nodes in the tree. However, this isn't quite right. Because each path contributes to all its prefixes. So, the problem is similar to a tree where each node has a capacity, and the number of paths that pass through it is limited by that capacity. The maximum number of paths is the maximum number of paths that can be selected such that no node is exceeded in its capacity.\n\nThis sounds like the problem of finding the maximum number of paths from root to leaves, with each node having a capacity, and each path uses up one unit of capacity for each node along its path.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of paths that can be packed into the tree given the capacities. How can we model this?\n\nAn approach here is to think of the capacities as constraints. The maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum of the capacities of all the nodes in some way. However, this is not obvious. But there's a standard approach here: for each node, the number of paths passing through it is limited by its capacity. But since each path passes through all its ancestors, the maximum number of paths is determined by the capacities of the nodes along the paths.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible number of paths given the capacities? This feels like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming or by considering the capacities in a certain order.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a tree where each node has a capacity c_s. For each node, the number of paths that go through it is the sum of the number of paths that go through its left and right children. However, since each path must go through the node, the total number of paths that pass through the node cannot exceed c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum of the capacities of the nodes along the paths. But how?\n\nAnother thought: the maximum number of paths is the minimum between the capacities of the root (since all paths pass through it), and the sum of the capacities of the children. Wait, maybe not. Let's take an example. Suppose the root has capacity 3, and each of its two children has capacity 2. Then the maximum number of paths is 2, since each path goes through the root and one child. The root can handle 3, but each child can only handle 2. So the total is 2*1 (each child can contribute 2 paths, but since they are separate, the total is 2+2=4? No, wait, each path is a unique path from root to a leaf. If the root has two children, and each child has capacity 2, then the maximum number of paths is 2 + 2 = 4? But the root's capacity is 3, which is less than 4. So the actual maximum is min(3, 2 + 2) = 3? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's think again. Each path passes through the root. So the number of paths can't exceed the root's capacity. Also, each path must pass through exactly one of the children of the root. So for each child, the number of paths that go through it can't exceed its capacity. Therefore, the total number of paths is the sum of the number of paths through each child. But since the sum can't exceed the root's capacity. So the maximum number of paths is the minimum between the root's capacity and the sum of the capacities of the children. Wait, but that's only if the children can supply that sum. For example, if the root's capacity is 3, and each child can supply 2, then the sum of children is 4. So the maximum is 3. But how is that achieved? The root can take 3 paths, which could be split between the two children. For example, 2 paths through the left child and 1 through the right. Then the left child's capacity is 2, which is okay, and the right's is 1 ≤ 2. So yes, the maximum is 3.\n\nSo this suggests that for a node, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the maximum number of paths that can be passed through its children. Wait, but how is that computed recursively?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming approach. For each node, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the maximum number of paths that can pass through each of its children. But how?\n\nWait, for a leaf node (depth n), it has no children. So the maximum number of paths passing through it is its capacity. Because each path that ends here contributes 1 to this node's count. But since the node is a leaf (depth n), the paths are exactly the ones that end here. So the maximum number of paths passing through it is c_s. However, for a non-leaf node, the maximum number of paths passing through it is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the maximum paths of its children. Because the sum of the children's paths is the maximum number of paths that can pass through the node (since each path through the node must go through one of its children). But since the node's capacity limits how many paths can pass through it, the total is min(c_s, sum_children).\n\nThis seems promising. So for each node, the maximum number of paths that can be accommodated under the constraints is:\n\nif it's a leaf node (depth n), then it's c_s.\n\nOtherwise, it's min(c_s, left_child_max + right_child_max).\n\nIf this is the case, then the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the value computed for the root node (the empty string?), but wait, the root node here would correspond to the empty string, but in our problem, the strings are of length from 1 to n. Wait, perhaps the root here is the empty string, but in the problem, the prefixes are of lengths from 1 to n. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the model.\n\nWait, the original problem considers all binary strings of length from 1 to n. So the root of the tree (if we model the prefixes as a trie) would be the empty string, and each level corresponds to the length of the prefix. The leaves are the strings of length n. So for the problem, the maximum number of paths (strings of length n) that can be chosen is the value computed for the root node (the empty string) using the above DP approach. Because the root's capacity is the c_s for the empty string, but in the problem, the empty string is not considered. Wait, no, the problem states that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, we have c_s. So the empty string is not part of the input. Wait, but the root node in this model is the empty string. But according to the problem, the c_s's are defined for strings of length 1 to n. So the empty string is not considered. Therefore, perhaps the model is slightly different.\n\nWait, perhaps the root node is the empty string, but the c_s for the empty string is not part of the input. But according to the problem statement, the c_s's are for strings of length from 1 to n. So the empty string is not included. Therefore, perhaps the model is that the root node (empty string) is not considered. But then, how does the capacity for the empty string affect the maximum?\n\nWait, the problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. So for the empty string (which is a prefix of all strings), the count is equal to the total number of strings in the multiset. Because every string in the multiset has the empty string as a prefix. Therefore, the count for the empty string is exactly the size of the multiset. Therefore, the constraint is that the total size of the multiset must be ≤ c_{empty} (but the empty string is not considered in the input. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the c_s is chosen for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So the empty string is not part of the input. Therefore, the problem statement is missing something here. Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"for every such string s (of length from 1 to n), you need to choose an integer c_s from 0 to k.\" So the empty string is not considered. However, the empty string is a prefix of all the strings in the multiset. So the count of strings in the multiset that have the empty string as a prefix is exactly the size of the multiset. However, since the empty string is not part of the c_s's, there is no constraint on that count. Wait, but that can't be. Because the problem says that the multiset is beautiful if for every s (of length from 1 to n), the count of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. But the empty string is not considered here. Therefore, the count of the empty string's prefix is not constrained. So that implies that the size of the multiset can be as large as possible, except for the constraints imposed by other prefixes. But this seems contradictory. \n\nWait, but the empty string is not part of the c_s's. Therefore, the count of the empty string's prefix is not constrained. However, the problem says that the multiset is made of strings of length exactly n. So the count of the empty string's prefix is exactly the size of the multiset. Since there's no constraint on that, the maximum size of the multiset is not directly bounded by that. Therefore, the constraints come from the other prefixes. But how?\n\nThis seems like a problem. Because if there's no constraint on the empty string's count, then the maximum size of the multiset could be unbounded. However, that's not possible because all other constraints must be satisfied. For example, consider a string s of length 1. The count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. For example, if n=2, and s is '0', then the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with '0' (i.e., '00' or '01'). Therefore, the constraints on the prefixes of length 1, 2, etc., will indirectly constrain the maximum size of the multiset.\n\nBut how to model this. Let me think again. The problem requires that for all prefixes s (of length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. Therefore, the maximum possible size of the multiset is the maximum number of strings that can be selected such that for all prefixes s, the count is within c_s. \n\nBut how to find that maximum. This seems like the same problem as before, but the root node (empty string) is not part of the constraints. However, the empty string's count is the total size of the multiset, but since there's no constraint on it, it can be as large as possible. However, other constraints may limit this. \n\nWait, but the empty string's count is the total size of the multiset. However, for any string of length 1, say s_1, the count of strings with s_1 as a prefix is ≤ c_{s_1}. Since each string in the multiset has exactly one prefix of length 1 (the first character), the sum of all c_{s_1} for all s_1 of length 1 must be ≥ the size of the multiset. But that's not necessarily true. For example, if the multiset has m elements, then for each of the two possible s_1 (0 or 1), the count of strings with s_1 as prefix is some number. The sum of these counts is m, since each string has exactly one s_1 prefix. Therefore, the sum of c_s for all s of length 1 must be ≥ m. Similarly, for longer prefixes.\n\nBut how to model the maximum m. This seems complicated. However, earlier thoughts about the tree structure might still apply. Let's try to model the problem as a trie where each node represents a prefix s (of length up to n). For each node, the capacity is c_s. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the maximum number of paths from the root (empty string) to the leaves (strings of length n) such that for each node along the path, the number of paths passing through it is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut the root node (empty string) is not part of the c_s's. Wait, but the root node's count (number of paths passing through it) is exactly the size of the multiset. However, since there's no constraint on that, we can have as many as possible. However, the other nodes impose constraints. So the maximum possible size of the multiset is determined by the constraints on the other nodes. But how?\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe the root node's capacity is effectively infinity (since there's no constraint on it). Therefore, the maximum number of paths is determined by the constraints of the other nodes. \n\nBut how to model that. Let's think recursively. For the root node (empty string), which has two children (the prefixes of length 1: \"0\" and \"1\"). The maximum number of paths passing through the root is unbounded, but the maximum number of paths passing through each of the children is determined by their capacities. However, the root's capacity is not a constraint. Therefore, the maximum number of paths is the sum of the maximum number of paths that can be passed through each child. But for each child, the maximum number of paths is determined by their own constraints.\n\nBut this seems similar to the previous model. For example, for a node (say, the root), the maximum number of paths passing through it is the sum of the maximum paths of its children. But since the root's capacity is not a constraint, it's allowed to have as many as the sum of the children's contributions. However, for other nodes, the maximum is min(c_s, sum of children's max paths).\n\nSo, in this model, the root node's maximum is the sum of the max paths of its children. For other nodes, the maximum is min(c_s, sum of children's max paths).\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's test this with the first example given in the problem statement.\n\nIn the first example, n=1, k=42, f=2. The answer is 3. Let's see why.\n\nThe possible c_s's are for the binary strings of length 1. There are two strings: \"0\" and \"1\". Each can be chosen between 0 and 42. The maximum possible size of the multiset (which consists of strings of length 1) is determined by the constraints. The multiset can have up to min(c_0, c_1) strings. Wait, no. Because each string in the multiset is of length 1. So for the root node (empty string), the maximum number of paths is the sum of the max paths of its children. But each child is a string of length 1. For those nodes, their children are leaves (since n=1). So for each node (like \"0\"), the maximum number of paths passing through it is c_0. Therefore, the root's maximum is c_0 + c_1. But since the root has no capacity constraint, the maximum size of the multiset is c_0 + c_1. Wait, but that contradicts the sample input. Let me check the first example again.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 42 2. The output is 3. The explanation says that there are three ways. For example, c_0=0, c_1=2. The maximum multiset size is 2. Which is the sum of c_0 and c_1 (0+2=2). Another example is c_0=1, c_1=1, sum is 2. And c_0=2, c_1=0, sum is 2. So the maximum is indeed the sum of the capacities of the two children of the root. Therefore, the maximum size of the multiset is the sum of the capacities of the two children of the root. But in this case, the root's capacity is not constrained. Therefore, the maximum size is indeed the sum of the capacities of the children of the root. Which is the sum of c_0 and c_1.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum size is the sum of the capacities of the two children. Therefore, for the problem, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by this recursive formula: for each node, if it's a leaf (depth n), then the maximum is c_s. Otherwise, it's the sum of the children's maximums if it's the root (no capacity constraint), or min(c_s, sum of children's maximums) otherwise.\n\nWait, but the root node is not constrained. So for the root node, the maximum number of paths passing through it is the sum of the max of its children. But for other nodes (non-root), it's min(c_s, sum of children's max). \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the value computed for the root node (which is sum of children's max). But how to compute this recursively.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nFor each possible choice of c_s values (each between 0 and k), compute the maximum size of the beautiful multiset as per the above rules. Then, count the number of choices where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nThe problem reduces to counting the number of c_s assignments (each c_s in [0, k]) such that the computed maximum is exactly f.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be up to 15. The number of nodes is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16 - 2 = 65534 nodes. However, considering that for each node, the c_s is chosen between 0 and k, the total number of possibilities is (k+1)^{2^{n+1} - 2}, which is way too big for n=15. So brute force is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a dynamic programming approach that can compute the number of valid c_s assignments that result in the maximum being exactly f.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think recursively. For each node, we can model the possible values of the maximum number of paths that can pass through it, given the constraints on its children and its own c_s.\n\nBut since the nodes are structured as a binary tree (each node has two children, except for leaves), perhaps we can process the nodes in a bottom-up manner.\n\nLet me think. For each node, the maximum number of paths passing through it depends on the values of its children and its own c_s. However, the root node's maximum is the sum of its children's maxima. For other nodes, it's min(c_s, sum of children's maxima).\n\nSo, for the entire tree, the maximum size of the multiset is the value computed for the root node, which is the sum of the maxima of its two children.\n\nBut how to model this for all possible c_s choices.\n\nLet me consider that for each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s values to its subtree such that the maximum number of paths passing through this node is exactly x. Then, for the root node, we need the maximum to be exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute this for all nodes.\n\nLet me think about the base case: a leaf node (depth n). Its maximum is c_s. So for this node, the number of ways to assign c_s such that the maximum is x is 1 if x is between 0 and k, and 0 otherwise. Wait, no. For a leaf node, the maximum is exactly c_s. So for each possible x in 0..k, the number of ways is 1 (since c_s can be x). So for a leaf node, the number of ways for x is 1 if 0 ≤ x ≤ k.\n\nNow, for a non-leaf node. Let's consider that the node is not the root. For this node, the maximum is min(c_s, sum_children). But sum_children is the sum of the maxima of its two children. So for this node, the value of the maximum depends on c_s and the sum of the children's maxima.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's suppose that the node has two children, left and right. Let's denote the maximum for left as L and for right as R. Then, the sum_children is L + R. The maximum for this node is min(c_s, L + R). \n\nSo, for this node, the value depends on the sum of the children's maxima and the choice of c_s. But how do we model the possibilities for all possible combinations of L and R.\n\nThis suggests that for each node, we can compute a function dp[node][x] = number of ways to assign c_s and the children's values such that the maximum for this node is x.\n\nBut for n=15, the number of nodes is 2^16-2, which is about 65534. For each node, the possible x can be up to ... Well, for the root node, the maximum is the sum of the two children's maxima. For each child, the maximum could be up to ... Well, for a node at depth d (distance from the root), the maximum can be up to k multiplied by some factor. But for n=15, and k up to 2e5, this could be very large. However, given that f can be up to 2e5, and we need to count the number of ways where the root's maximum is exactly f, perhaps we can find a way to model this with dynamic programming, keeping track of possible x up to f.\n\nBut even that might be challenging. However, given that n is small (up to 15), and for each node, the maximum possible value for x is up to something like 2^d * k, where d is the depth. But for n=15, this could be very large, but perhaps for the purposes of the problem, we can find that for the root node, the maximum is up to 2^n * k. However, since f is up to 2e5, and for n=15, 2^15 is 32768, so 32768 * 2e5 is around 6.5e9, which is way larger than f. So perhaps for our purposes, we can model the DP for each node with x up to f, but this might not be sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible value for the root is min( sum of all c_s's for the leaves, ... ). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that for the root node, the maximum is the sum of the maxima of its two children. Each of these children's maxima is determined by their own c_s and their children's maxima. However, this seems recursive and complex.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of generating functions. For each node, the number of ways to assign c_s and children's values such that the node's maximum is x.\n\nFor a leaf node, it's simple: dp_leaf[x] = 1 if 0 ≤ x ≤k, else 0.\n\nFor a non-leaf node, which is not the root, the maximum is min(c_s, L + R), where L is the maximum of the left child and R is the maximum of the right child. So, for each possible combination of L and R, and for each possible c_s, we can compute the value of min(c_s, L + R). Then, for the current node, we need to count the number of ways that this value is x.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible L and R. Let me think recursively.\n\nSuppose that for the left and right children, we have their dp tables. For each possible value of l (left's max) and r (right's max), we can compute the sum s = l + r. Then, for the current node, the maximum is min(c_s, s). But c_s can be chosen between 0 and k. For each possible choice of c_s, we can determine whether min(c_s, s) equals x. \n\nBut for the current node, the number of ways for a particular x is the sum over all possible l and r, and all possible c_s such that min(c_s, l + r) = x, of (ways_left[l] * ways_right[r] * number of c_s that satisfy min(c_s, l + r) = x).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me formalize this. For a non-leaf node (not the root), the number of ways for x is:\n\nsum_{l, r} [ ways_left[l] * ways_right[r] * (number of c_s in [0, k] such that min(c_s, l + r) = x) ]\n\nSo for each pair (l, r), compute the sum s = l + r. Then, the number of c_s that make min(c_s, s) = x is:\n\nif x <= s: then c_s must be >= x and <= s, but also min(c_s, s) =x. Wait:\n\nmin(c_s, s) = x implies that:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1: x = s. Then, c_s >= s. Because min(c_s, s) = s if c_s >= s. But since s is fixed, for this to be x, we need x = s. So in this case, c_s can be any value >= x (since min(c_s, s) = s = x). But since x = s, this implies that c_s >= x.\n\nBut wait, if x = s, then min(c_s, s) = x implies that min(c_s, s) = s. Which requires that c_s >= s. So the number of c_s is (k - s + 1) if s <= k, else 0.\n\nCase 2: x < s. Then, min(c_s, s) = x implies that c_s >= x and c_s < s. Because if c_s is in [x, s), then min(c_s, s) is c_s, which is x. Wait no. If x is the value of min(c_s, s), then:\n\nIf c_s >= s → min is s.\n\nIf c_s < s → min is c_s.\n\nSo for min(c_s, s) to be x, either:\n\n- x = s and c_s >= s, or\n\n- x < s and c_s = x.\n\nTherefore, the number of c_s that satisfy min(c_s, s) = x is:\n\nif x < s: then 1 if x is between 0 and k, else 0. Because c_s must be exactly x.\n\nif x == s: then the number of c_s is max(0, k - s + 1) if s <=k, else 0.\n\nWait, but if x == s, then the condition is that c_s >= s. So the number of c_s is (k - s + 1) if s <=k, else zero.\n\nBut for x to be equal to s, s must be <=k. Because if s exceeds k, then c_s can't be >= s (since c_s is at most k), so the number of c_s is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together, for a given s and x:\n\nif x < s:\n\n   if x is in [0, k], then the count is 1 (since c_s must be exactly x)\n\nelse 0\n\nif x == s:\n\n   if s <=k → count is (k - s + 1)\n\n   else → 0\n\nelse (x > s):\n\n   0\n\nSo, for each pair (l, r), compute s = l + r. Then, for each possible x, we can compute the contribution to the current node's dp[x].\n\nThis seems manageable. Now, the problem is how to compute this for all possible l and r. However, for each node, the number of possible l and r depends on the children's dp tables. For example, for a node with two children, each of which can have up to some maximum value, the number of pairs (l, r) is O(m^2), where m is the maximum possible value for the children's dp. However, for n=15, and with f up to 2e5, perhaps we can manage this by limiting the maximum value considered to f, since for the root node, the maximum possible value is the sum of its children's maxima, which could be up to 2^15 *k. But if f is smaller than that, then for the root node's dp, we can ignore any x greater than f.\n\nBut how to proceed. Let's think recursively. For each node, we can compute a dp table that maps x to the number of ways to assign c_s and children's values such that the node's maximum is x.\n\nFor the root node, the maximum is the sum of the maxima of its two children. Because the root node has no capacity constraint. So for the root node, the maximum is the sum of the children's maxima. However, the root node's own c_s is not considered (since there's no constraint for the empty string). So for the root node, the maximum is simply the sum of the left and right children's maxima. Therefore, the root's dp is computed as follows:\n\nsum over all possible l and r (left and right children's maxima) of (ways_left[l] * ways_right[r]) * [indicator that sum is x]. So for the root node, the number of ways for x is the convolution of the left and right dp tables.\n\nBut this is different from the other nodes. So, for non-root nodes, we need to compute the min(c_s, l + r) as discussed. For the root node, the maximum is l + r, and there is no c_s constraint (so the value is l + r, and the number of ways is the convolution of left and right's ways).\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\n- Build the tree structure for all nodes (binary prefixes up to length n).\n\n- For each node, compute its dp table based on its children's dp tables.\n\n- For the root node, the maximum is the sum of the two children's maxima, and we need to count the number of ways where this sum is exactly f.\n\nBut how to build the tree structure. For n=15, there are 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2 nodes. For each node, we can represent it by its string (but for n=15, storing the string is not efficient). Alternatively, we can represent each node by its depth and its binary value (as an integer). However, for dynamic programming, perhaps we can process the nodes in a bottom-up manner, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute all nodes in a way that allows processing them in order of increasing depth (from leaves up to root).\n\n2. For each node, compute its dp table.\n\nFor example, for a node of depth d (with d = n, which is a leaf), the dp is {x: 1 if 0<=x<=k}.\n\nFor a node of depth d < n, it has two children (left and right), which are nodes of depth d+1. For non-root nodes, compute the dp as described earlier, considering the min(c_s, l + r) for each possible l and r.\n\nFor the root node (depth 0?), compute the convolution of its children's dp tables.\n\nOnce the root's dp is computed, the answer is the number of ways where the root's maximum is exactly f. However, we need to ensure that the maximum is exactly f, not less than or equal to f. Therefore, the answer is the value of the root's dp[f], but subtract the number of ways where the maximum is less than f. Wait, no. The root's dp[x] is the number of ways where the maximum is exactly x. So the answer is the root's dp[f].\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nBut there's another thing: the problem requires that the maximum possible size is exactly f. So, we need to count the number of c_s assignments such that the maximum is exactly f. Which is the value of the root's dp[f].\n\nBut how to compute the dp for all nodes.\n\nBut for large n and k, this approach may be feasible if we use memoization and efficient convolution.\n\nHowever, for n=15, the number of nodes is 2^16 - 2 = 65534. For each node, the dp table can be represented as a dictionary or array. But for each node, the possible x values can be up to some maximum. For the leaves, it's up to k. For non-leaf nodes, it's up to ... For example, for a node at depth d, the maximum possible x is the sum of the maxima of its children. But for the root node, the maximum x is up to 2^n * k (since each of the 2^n leaves has a maximum of up to k, and the root's maximum is the sum of the two children's maxima, which recursively sum up to the sum of all leaves' maxima. However, this could be very large. However, since the problem requires that the final answer is the number of ways where the root's maximum is exactly f, perhaps we can cap the x values for the dp tables at f. Because if during the computation, any x exceeds f, we can ignore it, since for the root node, we only care about x=f.\n\nBut how to handle that. Let's think: for each node, during the dp computation, we can track x up to f. Because if a node's",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values $ c_s $ for all binary strings $ s $ of length from 1 to $ n $ such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) and combinatorial counting with modular arithmetic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: Consider each binary string as a node in a binary tree where each node has two children (0 and 1). The leaves of this tree are the binary strings of length $ n $.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: For each node, compute the number of ways to assign values such that the maximum number of paths through the node (considering constraints) is exactly $ x $.\n3. **Bottom-Up Processing**: Process nodes starting from the leaves (depth $ n $) up to the root (depth 0). This ensures that when processing a node, its children's DP tables are already computed.\n4. **Combining Results**: For non-root nodes, combine the results of their children using constraints on their capacities. For the root node, sum the results of its children's maxima directly since there's no constraint on the root's capacity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        # Precompute all nodes in BFS order (from leaves up)\n        # Each node is represented by depth and value (as integer)\n        # For depth d, the number of nodes is 2^d\n        # We'll process nodes level by level, starting from depth n down to 0\n        # For each node, we'll store its dp table as a dictionary or array\n        # But since n can be up to 15, and f up to 2e5, we need to manage the DP efficiently\n        \n        # For each depth d, nodes are processed in order\n        # We'll use memoization with dictionaries for dp tables\n        # However, for efficiency, we'll represent dp as arrays up to f\n        \n        # For each node, we'll compute dp[x] = number of ways to have max x at this node\n        # For leaves (depth == n), dp[x] = 1 if 0 <= x <=k else 0\n        # For non-leaves, compute based on children\n        \n        # First, build the tree structure in terms of levels\n        # We can represent the nodes as a list of lists, where each level is processed in order\n        # We'll use memoization with a dictionary for each node's dp\n        \n        # However, given the time constraints, we can process each level from bottom up\n        \n        # Let's create a list of dp tables for each node.
