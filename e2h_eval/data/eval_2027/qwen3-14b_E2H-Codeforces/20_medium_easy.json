For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. The task is to count the number of ways to assign values c_s for each binary string s (of lengths from 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, what's a beautiful multiset? For every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. So, our goal is to find all possible assignments of c_s values such that when you choose the c_s's, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nWait, but how do we model the maximum possible size? Let's think about how to compute the maximum possible size given the constraints of the c_s's.\n\nLet me think. For each binary string s of length up to n, the constraints are that the count of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. But since the multiset consists of n-length strings, each string contributes to multiple prefixes. For example, a string of length n has all its prefixes (from length 1 to n) as prefixes.\n\nSo the problem is similar to a tree structure where each node represents a binary string, and the children are the extensions by adding a 0 or 1. The root is the empty string, but maybe not relevant here. Each node's c_s value imposes a constraint on how many times it can be \"covered\" by the multiset elements.\n\nBut the maximum size of the beautiful multiset would be determined by some constraints. How?\n\nThis seems like a problem related to the constraints forming a system where the maximum possible is determined by the minimum of certain values along paths. Let me think of it as a flow problem. Each element in the multiset contributes 1 to all its prefixes. So, the total number of elements in the multiset is the sum over all elements, but the constraints are that for each prefix s, the total number of elements that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how do we maximize the size of the multiset under these constraints?\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of elements (strings of length n) such that for every prefix s, the number of elements that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. The maximum possible size is the maximum possible x such that there exists a way to select x strings of length n satisfying all the constraints.\n\nBut how do we compute this x given the c_s's? It seems like a problem that can be modeled using inclusion-exclusion. For example, the constraints form a hierarchy. For example, the count for a longer prefix can't exceed the count for its shorter prefixes. Wait, no. Because if a string has a prefix s of length l, then it also has all prefixes of s. So for example, if a string is '01', then it contributes to the count of '0' (length 1), '01' (length 2), and so on. Therefore, for the constraints to be satisfied, for any two prefixes where one is a prefix of the other, the c_s for the longer one must be ≤ the c_s for the shorter one. Otherwise, it's impossible to satisfy the constraints. Because, for example, if you have a longer prefix s with c_s less than the c of its parent, then the number of elements that have s as a prefix can't exceed c_s, but those elements are also part of the count for the parent. So the maximum number of elements that can be allowed for the parent's count is at least the count for the child. Therefore, for the constraints to be feasible, for every s, the c_s must be ≤ the c of all its prefixes. Wait, no. Because the count for s's parent must be ≥ the count for s. Because, for example, if you have a parent p and child s. The number of elements that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. But since all those elements also have p as a prefix, the count for p must be ≥ the count for s. Therefore, for the constraints to be feasible, for every s, c_s must be ≤ the minimum of the c values of all its ancestors. Wait, but that's not necessarily required. Wait, the user can choose the c_s values. However, if the user chooses a c_s that is larger than some ancestor's c, then the constraints may not be compatible. For example, suppose c_p is 1 and c_s is 2. Then, the number of elements that have s as a prefix is ≤ 2, but since those elements are also counted under p's count, which must be ≤ 1. Therefore, the count for s can't exceed 1. Hence, the constraints must satisfy that for every s, c_s ≤ c_{parent(s)}. Otherwise, even if you set c_s to a higher value, the parent's c would limit the maximum possible count for s. Therefore, for the constraints to be feasible, for every s, c_s must be ≤ the c of its parent. Because otherwise, the constraints are conflicting. \n\nWait, but the user is choosing the c_s values. So, perhaps the way to ensure that the constraints are compatible is that for every s, c_s ≤ c_{parent(s)}. If this is not the case, then the constraints are not compatible. For example, if a parent has c_p = 1 and a child has c_s = 2. Then, the number of elements that have s as a prefix can be at most 2, but since those elements are also counted under p's count (which is at most 1). Therefore, the maximum possible number of elements that have s as a prefix is 1, which is ≤ c_s (which is 2). So the constraints are compatible. Wait, but the problem says that for the multiset to be beautiful, the count for s must be ≤ c_s. So even if c_s is larger than the parent's c_p, the count for s can't exceed c_p, because the parent's count is limited. Therefore, the c_s can be larger than c_p, but in that case, the actual count for s will be limited by the parent's c_p. However, the user can choose the c_s's in any way, but when trying to find the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset, the constraints are automatically adjusted by the hierarchy.\n\nBut how does this affect the maximum possible size of the multiset?\n\nAh, perhaps the maximum possible size of the multiset is determined by the minimum of the c_s values along all paths from the root to the leaves. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of it as a tree. Each node represents a binary string. The root is the empty string. Each node has two children: appending 0 and 1. The leaves are the strings of length n. Now, for each node, the c_s is the maximum number of times elements in the multiset can have s as a prefix. However, the elements in the multiset are leaves (strings of length n). Each leaf contributes 1 to all its prefixes.\n\nThe maximum number of elements in the multiset is the maximum x such that for every node s, the number of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum x where the constraints are satisfied. How can we compute this x given the c_s's?\n\nThis feels like a problem where x is constrained by the minimum of the c_s's along certain paths. For example, the maximum x is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)} ), but I'm not sure. Wait, let's think about the constraints.\n\nFor each node s, the number of leaves that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s. Since each leaf in the subtree contributes 1 to the count of s. So, the maximum x is such that for each node s, the number of leaves in the multiset that are in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. But the total number of leaves in the multiset is x, and each leaf is in the subtree of all its prefixes.\n\nTo maximize x, we need to choose the leaves such that for all nodes s, the number of leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is equivalent to a problem where each node s has a capacity c_s, and the leaves are to be selected such that the number of leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. The maximum x is the maximum possible number of leaves that can be selected under these constraints.\n\nNow, how do we compute this x given the capacities?\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where the constraints form a hierarchy, and the maximum x is determined by the minimum of (c_s) for all nodes s, multiplied by some factor based on their depth. Wait, for example, the root node (empty string) has a capacity c_root. Since the total number of leaves is x, and the root's subtree includes all leaves. Therefore, x ≤ c_root. Similarly, for a node s of length l, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n - l} (since each leaf is a binary string of length n, and the subtree of s has 2^{n-l} leaves). Therefore, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s is min(c_s, ... ). Wait, no. Because for each node s, the number of leaves in the multiset that are in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. But the leaves in the subtree of s are also in the subtree of their ancestors. So the constraints are that for each node s, the number of leaves in the multiset in s's subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut the maximum x is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected such that for every node s, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is equivalent to the problem of selecting as many leaves as possible, subject to the constraints that for every node s, the number of selected leaves in s's subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nHow to compute this maximum x?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved by considering the constraints in a bottom-up manner. For example, the leaves have no children. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves that can be selected in its children's subtrees. Wait, but this might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a node s. Its subtree consists of all leaves that start with s. Let's say that the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s is m_s. Then, m_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves that can be selected in the left and right children of s. But wait, the children of s are s0 and s1. Each of them has their own constraints. For example, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s0 is m_{s0}, and similarly for s1. Then, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is m_{s0} + m_{s1}, but this must be ≤ c_s. Therefore, m_s = min(c_s, m_{s0} + m_{s1}).\n\nIf this is the case, then the maximum x is m_root, where m_root is computed in this way. Because for the root, the maximum number of leaves is min(c_root, m_0 + m_1), where m_0 and m_1 are the max for the children of the root. And so on recursively.\n\nYes! That makes sense. Because for each node s, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum between its capacity c_s and the sum of the capacities of its children's subtrees. Because the children's subtrees can contribute up to their own m values, but the parent's capacity may restrict that.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is determined by this recursive calculation. So, given the c_s values, we can compute the maximum x as the result of this process.\n\nNow, the problem requires us to count the number of ways to assign c_s values (each from 0 to k) such that this maximum x is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nFirst, note that the c_s's must satisfy the condition that for any node s, the c_s is ≥ the minimum of the capacities of its children. Wait, no. Because during the calculation of m_s, we take the minimum between c_s and the sum of the children's m values. However, the c_s can be anything. But for the maximum x to be as large as possible, the constraints must be such that the m_s is determined as above.\n\nBut when assigning the c_s's, how do they affect the final x?\n\nThe problem requires that the maximum x is exactly f. So, we need to count all possible assignments of c_s's (each between 0 and k) such that when you compute m_root as per the recursive formula, it equals f.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nGiven that n is up to 15, the number of binary strings of length up to n is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16 - 2 = 65534, which is manageable in terms of processing if we can find a dynamic programming approach.\n\nBut even that seems challenging. However, perhaps we can model this problem as a tree and use dynamic programming on the tree structure.\n\nLet me think of the tree structure. Each node s has two children, s0 and s1. The root is the empty string. For each node, we need to assign a c_s value between 0 and k. The maximum x is determined by the DP approach described earlier.\n\nBut how can we model the number of assignments where the maximum x is exactly f?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering that for each node, the value of m_s depends on the c_s and the m values of its children. But since the m values are determined recursively, maybe we can find a way to represent the constraints on the c_s's.\n\nBut considering that the m_s for a node is min(c_s, m_left + m_right), where m_left and m_right are the m values of the children.\n\nSo, for each node, the m_s is determined by its children's m values and its c_s.\n\nBut how can we count the number of assignments of c_s's such that the m_root equals f?\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, considering the tree structure and the possible m values for each node.\n\nLet me consider that for each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s's to that subtree, such that the m value of that node is a certain value. Then, combining these for the children.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think recursively. For a node with children left and right, the m value of the node is min(c_s, m_left + m_right). So, for the node's m value to be t, there are two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: c_s >= m_left + m_right. Then, m_s = m_left + m_right. So, t = m_left + m_right. In this case, c_s can be any value >= t, but <=k.\n\nCase 2: c_s < m_left + m_right. Then, m_s = c_s. So, t = c_s. In this case, c_s must be exactly t, and t must be <= m_left + m_right.\n\nBut how do we combine these possibilities for the children?\n\nThis suggests that for each node, we can compute a DP table where dp[node][t] is the number of ways to assign c_s's in the subtree rooted at node such that the m value of the node is t.\n\nThen, for the root node, we want dp[root][f], but considering that the total number of assignments is the product of the possibilities for each node's c_s, given the constraints from their children.\n\nBut how do we compute this DP?\n\nLet's think for a leaf node. A leaf node is a node of length n. Its children are nonexistent (since the strings are of length n). So, for a leaf node, the m value is min(c_s, 0 + 0) = min(c_s, 0). But since the subtree of a leaf node contains only itself. Wait, no. Wait, for a node of length n (a leaf), the number of leaves in its subtree is 1. So, the m value for the node is the minimum between c_s and 1. Because the sum of the children's m values is zero (no children). So, for a leaf node, m_s is min(c_s, 1). But the maximum x for the entire tree is determined by the root's m value.\n\nWait, no. For a node of length n (leaf), the subtree consists of exactly one leaf (the node itself). Therefore, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is min(c_s, 1). Therefore, the m_s for the leaf node is min(c_s, 1). But since the c_s can be between 0 and k, the m_s can be 0 or 1, depending on c_s. For example, if c_s >=1, then m_s is 1. If c_s is 0, m_s is 0.\n\nSo for a leaf node, the possible m_s values are 0 or 1. And the number of ways to assign c_s to get m_s = t is:\n\n- if t=0: c_s must be 0. So 1 way.\n- if t=1: c_s can be any value from 1 to k. So k ways.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that c_s can be chosen from 0 to k. So for a leaf node, the number of ways to have m_s = 0 is 1 (only c_s=0). For m_s = 1, it's (k - 0) choices? No, because c_s must be >=1. So the number of ways is (k - 0) if 1 <=k. But since k can be 1, then the count is (k) - 0? Wait, for t=1, the c_s can be any value between 1 and k, inclusive. So the number of options is (k - 0) if 1 is included. Wait, the count is max(0, k - 0) when t=1? No, the count is (k - 0) if k >=1. Wait, the count is (k - 0) if t=1? No, the count is (k - 0) when t=1? No. Let me think. The c_s must be >=1 (so that m_s = min(c_s, 1) = 1). So the number of c_s values is (k - 0) if 1 <=k. But since k can be 0? Wait, no. The input constraints say that k is at least 1. Wait, looking back: the input constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 15, 1 ≤ k, f ≤ 2e5. So k is at least 1. Therefore, for a leaf node, the number of ways for m_s =1 is (k) - 0? No. For c_s can be 1 to k, inclusive. So the count is k - 0? No, the count is k - 0 + 1? Wait, no. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So if the allowed values are 1 to k, inclusive, the count is k - 1 + 1 = k.\n\nYes. So for a leaf node, the number of ways to have m_s = t is:\n\nif t=0: 1 (c_s=0)\nif t=1: k (c_s from 1 to k)\n\nNow, for internal nodes (non-leaves), we can think recursively. Let's say that the node has two children, left and right. For the current node, the m value is min(c_s, m_left + m_right). So, for each possible pair of (m_left, m_right), we can compute the possible m for the current node, and count the ways accordingly.\n\nBut how do we model this for dynamic programming?\n\nLet me think. For each node, we can compute a function f(t) that represents the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's c's such that the m value of this node is t.\n\nFor a node with children left and right, the m value for this node depends on the m values of left and right, and the choice of c_s.\n\nLet me denote that for the left child, the possible m values are m_l, and for the right child, m_r. Then, the sum m_l + m_r is S. Then, the current node's m is min(c_s, S).\n\nSo, for the current node, given that the left and right children have m values m_l and m_r, we can compute the possible ways for the current node's c_s.\n\nBut how do we combine this for all possible m_l and m_r?\n\nThis suggests that for each node, we need to consider all possible combinations of m_l and m_r, compute their sum S, and then for each possible t, accumulate the number of ways based on the possible choices of c_s.\n\nBut for the DP approach, the idea is that for each node, we can compute the possible m values and the number of ways to achieve them, based on the children's DP tables.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose that for the left child, we have a DP table L where L[t] is the number of ways for the left subtree to have m value t. Similarly for the right child, R[t]. Then, for the current node, we can compute a DP table C[t], which represents the number of ways for the current node's subtree to have m value t.\n\nFor each possible pair (t1, t2) where t1 is a possible m value for the left, and t2 for the right, we compute S = t1 + t2. Then, for the current node, the m value can be either:\n\nCase 1: c_s >= S. Then, the m value is S. For this case, the number of ways is the product of L[t1] * R[t2] multiplied by the number of valid c_s values for this case (i.e., c_s can be any value between S and k, inclusive).\n\nCase 2: c_s < S. Then, the m value is c_s. For this case, the number of ways is the product of L[t1] * R[t2] multiplied by the number of valid c_s values for this case (i.e., c_s can be any value between 0 and S-1, inclusive).\n\nBut wait, the m value for the current node is t. So for each possible t, we need to collect all possibilities from both cases.\n\nSo, for each t, C[t] is the sum over all possible pairs (t1, t2) of:\n\n[ (number of ways for left to have t1) * (number of ways for right to have t2) ] multiplied by [ (number of c_s choices that make the current node's m value equal to t) ].\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me rephrase. For a given pair (t1, t2), S = t1 + t2. The current node's m value can be either S (if c_s >= S) or any value from 0 to S-1 (if c_s is chosen as such). However, for the current node's m value to be t, we need to consider:\n\nIf t = S: then we add the product L[t1] * R[t2] multiplied by the number of c_s values that are >= S (i.e., (k - S + 1) if S <=k, else 0).\n\nIf t < S: then we add the product L[t1] * R[t2] multiplied by the number of c_s values that are exactly t (i.e., 1 if t is between 0 and S-1, but wait, no. For this case, when the current node's m is t, which is c_s. So, the c_s must be exactly t. But since t can be any value from 0 to S-1, the number of ways is 1 (choosing c_s = t). However, this is only possible if t is in [0, S-1].\n\nWait, no. For case 2, when c_s < S, the m value is c_s. So, for the current node's m value to be t, we need to choose c_s = t. But t must be less than S. So for each pair (t1, t2) leading to S, we can contribute to C[t] for all t in [0, S-1] by adding L[t1] * R[t2] * 1 (since there's exactly one choice of c_s: t).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each pair (t1, t2):\n\nCompute S = t1 + t2.\n\nThen, for the current node's m value:\n\n- Add to C[S] the term (L[t1] * R[t2]) * (max(0, k - S + 1)).\n\n- For each t in 0 to S-1, add to C[t] the term (L[t1] * R[t2]) * 1.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive, especially for large S. However, given that n is small (up to 15), the maximum possible m value for a node is 2^{n - len(s)}, which for the root is 2^n. For n=15, this is 32768, which is manageable.\n\nWait, the maximum possible m value for a node is the number of leaves in its subtree. For example, the root has 2^n leaves. So for n=15, the maximum m value is 32768. So for each node, the possible t values for its DP table can be up to 2^{n - len(s)}.\n\nBut for n=15, the maximum possible m is 2^15 = 32768. So for each node, the DP table for that node can have up to 32768 entries. Considering that the number of nodes is O(2^n), which for n=15 is 32766, this would lead to O(2^15 * 2^15) operations, which is way too big (like 1e9 operations). So this approach is not feasible for n=15.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the possible values of S. For each node, the sum S = t1 + t2 is the sum of the m values of the left and right children. But since each m value for a child is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in their subtree, the sum S is the maximum possible number of leaves that can be selected in the current node's subtree if there were no constraints on c_s. But the actual m value for the current node is min(c_s, S). However, the c_s can be chosen to influence this.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to model the DP for each node more efficiently. Let's think again about the DP for a node.\n\nLet me think of the DP for a node as follows: for the node, given that the left and right children have DP tables L and R, the current node's DP table C can be computed as follows.\n\nFor each possible value of S = t1 + t2, where t1 ranges over possible m values for left, and t2 for right, we can compute the contribution to C's DP.\n\nBut instead of iterating through all possible t1 and t2, perhaps we can precompute the convolution of L and R. The convolution would give us, for each possible S, the number of (t1, t2) pairs that sum to S. Then, for each S, we can compute the contributions to C's DP.\n\nYes! Because the number of (t1, t2) pairs that sum to S is equal to the convolution of L and R at position S. So for each S, the count is conv[L, R][S].\n\nOnce we have this, for each S, we can compute the contributions to C's DP as:\n\n- For the case where the current node's m is S: add conv[L, R][S] * (number of valid c_s choices for this case).\n- For the case where the current node's m is t < S: add conv[L, R][S] * 1 for each t in 0..S-1.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally heavy if we have to loop through all S and for each S, loop through 0..S-1.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a mathematical way to represent this. Let's think about the total contribution for all t < S. For each S, the number of ways is conv[L, R][S] multiplied by S (since for each of the S possible t's, we add 1). However, this would contribute to all t < S.\n\nBut how can we model this in the DP?\n\nLet me think of the DP for the current node as follows:\n\nC[t] = (number of ways where the current node's m is t).\n\nFor all possible S (sum of left and right m values), we have:\n\n- For t = S: add (conv_LR[S]) * (ways to choose c_s >= S).\n- For t < S: add (conv_LR[S]) * 1 (for each t in 0..S-1).\n\nBut this would require for each S, adding conv_LR[S] to each C[t] for t < S. Which is O(S) per S. For S up to 2^15, this would be O( (2^15)^2 ) operations for each node, which is 2^30 operations. Not feasible for n=15.\n\nThis seems computationally impossible. So there must be a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the DP for a node as follows.\n\nFor each node, the possible m value is t. For the node's m to be t, there are two possibilities:\n\nEither:\n\n1. The sum of the children's m values is >= t, and c_s is chosen as t. This implies that t is the value of c_s, and the sum of children's m is >= t.\n\nOR\n\n2. The sum of the children's m values is exactly t, and c_s is chosen >= t. In this case, the m value is t.\n\nWait, no. Because the m value is min(c_s, sum_children). So, if the sum_children is S, then:\n\nIf c_s >= S, then m = S.\n\nElse, m = c_s.\n\nSo, for the current node's m to be t, there are two possibilities:\n\nCase A: t = S (sum_children), and c_s >= S. So, the number of ways is the number of (t1, t2) pairs that sum to S, multiplied by (number of c_s >= S).\n\nCase B: t < S (sum_children), and c_s = t. So, the number of ways is the number of (t1, t2) pairs that sum to S >= t, multiplied by 1 (since c_s must be exactly t).\n\nBut how to aggregate this over all possible S?\n\nAlternatively, for a given t, the total ways is:\n\nsum_{S >= t} [ (number of (t1, t2) pairs that sum to S) * (if S == t, then (ways for c_s >= S) else if S > t, then 1) ) ] ?\n\nNot sure. Let me think again.\n\nFor the current node's m to be t, it can be achieved in two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The sum of children's m values is S >= t, and c_s is chosen to be exactly t. But this is only possible if t <= S. So, for each S >= t, the number of (t1, t2) pairs that sum to S, multiplied by 1 (since c_s = t).\n\nScenario 2: The sum of children's m values is S = t, and c_s is chosen to be >= S. So, the number of (t1, t2) pairs that sum to t, multiplied by (ways for c_s >= t).\n\nThus, the total number of ways for the current node's m being t is:\n\n(number of ways from scenario 1) + (number of ways from scenario 2).\n\nScenario 1: sum_{S >= t} (conv_LR[S]) * 1.\n\nScenario 2: conv_LR[t] * (ways for c_s >= t).\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nScenario 1 is the sum over all S >= t of conv_LR[S], multiplied by 1. This sum is equal to the total number of (t1, t2) pairs where their sum is >= t. Let's denote this as total_ge_t.\n\nScenario 2 is conv_LR[t] multiplied by (k - t + 1) if t <=k, else 0.\n\nSo, for the current node's DP[t], it's equal to total_ge_t + conv_LR[t] * (max(0, k - t + 1)).\n\nBut how to compute total_ge_t for all t?\n\nWell, total_ge_t is the sum of conv_LR[S] for S >= t. This can be precomputed for all t by using prefix sums. For example, we can compute an array where for each t, we store the sum of conv_LR from t to max_S. Then, for each t, total_ge_t is this precomputed value.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor a node with children left and right:\n\n1. Compute the convolution of the left and right DP tables, conv_LR[S] = sum_{t1 + t2 = S} L[t1] * R[t2}.\n\n2. Compute the prefix sums from max_S down to 0 for the conv_LR array. Let's call this sum_ge[t] = sum_{s >= t} conv_LR[s}.\n\n3. For each t, the current node's DP[t] = sum_ge[t] + conv_LR[t] * (max(0, k - t + 1)).\n\nBut wait, why?\n\nBecause:\n\nsum_ge[t] is the sum over all S >= t of conv_LR[S], which is the number of (t1, t2) pairs where their sum S >= t. For each such pair, we can choose c_s = t (as long as t <= S). Since S >= t, this is allowed. And for each such pair, we contribute 1 way (choosing c_s = t). Thus, sum_ge[t] is the contribution from scenario 1.\n\nScenario 2 is when S = t, and c_s is chosen to be >= t. For this, the number of ways is conv_LR[t] * (number of c_s >= t).\n\nThus, the total DP[t] is sum_ge[t] + conv_LR[t] * max(0, k - t + 1).\n\nThis is a brilliant insight! This reduces the problem from O(S^2) per node to O(S) per node.\n\nSo, for each node, we can compute its DP table as follows:\n\n- Compute the convolution of the left and right children's DP tables, which gives conv_LR[S] for all possible S.\n\n- Compute sum_ge[t] for all t, which is the sum of conv_LR from t to max_S.\n\n- For each t, DP[t] = sum_ge[t] + conv_LR[t] * (max(0, k - t + 1)).\n\nThis way, we avoid having to iterate through all S and for each S, iterate through t < S.\n\nThis is a huge optimization. Now, the complexity becomes manageable.\n\nNow, the next question is: how to compute the convolution of two DP tables?\n\nThe convolution here is the sum over t1 and t2 such that t1 + t2 = S of L[t1] * R[t2}. This is equivalent to the standard convolution, except that it's for all possible S.\n\nFor example, if the left child's DP table has maximum value L_max, and the right child's DP table has maximum value R_max, then the maximum possible S is L_max + R_max.\n\nSo, for each node, we need to compute the convolution of the left and right DP tables.\n\nNow, considering that for n=15, the maximum possible S for the root node is 2^15 = 32768. For each node, the maximum S is 2^{n - len(s)}, where len(s) is the length of the string represented by the node. For example, a node of depth d (length d) has a subtree with 2^{n-d} leaves, so the maximum S for that node is 2^{n-d}.\n\nBut for the DP tables, we can represent them as arrays of size up to 2^{n} (for the root node).\n\nNow, the question is: how to implement this convolution efficiently?\n\nFor each node, the left and right children's DP tables are known. For example, for a leaf node, the DP table is [1, k], where index 0 corresponds to m=0 and index 1 corresponds to m=1.\n\nBut for the convolution, we need to iterate over all possible t1 in the left's DP and t2 in the right's DP, and for each sum S = t1 + t2, accumulate L[t1] * R[t2} into conv_LR[S].\n\nThis can be done with a nested loop for each t1 and t2. For example, for a node with left DP of size L_size and",
