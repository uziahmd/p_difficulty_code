The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do I calculate the number of cells in each ring?\n\nLet me think. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a 3x3 rectangle's perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me compute it properly. The perimeter cells are all the cells in the first row, last row, first column, last column. So for a rectangle of size W x H, the number of cells in the border is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the first row has W cells, the last row has W cells, and the columns between them contribute 2*(H-2) cells (since the first and last columns are already counted). Alternatively, it's 2*(W + H) - 4. Because the total for all four sides would be 2*(W + H), but subtracting 4 because the four corners are counted twice. So yes, 2*(W + H - 2) equals 2W + 2H -4. Which is the same as 2*(W + H) -4.\n\nSo for each ring i, the dimensions are W_i = w - 4*(i-1), H_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then the number of cells in that ring is 2*(W_i + H_i - 2). But wait, this is only if the ring exists. So for each i from 1 to k, we need to compute that and sum all of them.\n\nBut wait, what's the condition for the ring to exist? Well, the problem says that k is given such that it's valid. So the input ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions W_i and H_i are at least 3? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem says that the input k is such that 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w,h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. For a 3x3 plate, the first ring is the perimeter. Then the next ring would require min(w, h) - 4*(i-1) >= something. Wait, for i=1, the rectangle is w x h. For i=2, it's w-4(1) and h-4(1). So for that to be valid, w-4 and h-4 must be ≥ 3? Or maybe not. Because the problem says that the input k is valid. So the code doesn't have to check that. So for each i from 1 to k, we can compute W_i and H_i, then calculate the perimeter for each.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nReturn total\n\nWait, but let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h = 3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. So current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So for i=1: 7,9 → 2*(7+9-2)=28. For i=2: current_w =7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So yes, this seems correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read w,",
