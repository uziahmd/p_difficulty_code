The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is the edge, the second is two cells in, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. \n\nHmm. Let me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For the i-th ring, it's based on a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle? Because the ring is the border of that rectangle. Oh right, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because each side contributes (length) but the corners are counted twice. Alternatively, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*m + 2*(n-2) = 2*(m + n) -4. Because the top and bottom rows have n cells each, and the left and right columns have (m-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). \n\nWait, let me check. For example, a 3x3 rectangle. The perimeter is 3*4 - 4 = 8? Because the total cells in the border would be 3*4 - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice if you just do 4*3). Wait, another way: the perimeter is (width * 2) + (height - 2)*2. For a 3x3, that's 3*2 + (3-2)*2 = 6 + 2 = 8. Which matches the first example input. The first example input is 3 3 1, output is 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w', h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, wait. Wait, the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but for the first ring, i=1, so the rectangle is w × h. Then the perimeter is 2*(w + h) -4. For the second ring, i=2, the rectangle is (w -4*(1)) × (h -4*(1)), so (w-4) × (h-4). Then the perimeter is 2*( (w-4) + (h-4) ) -4. But wait, no, the perimeter formula is 2*(width + height) - 4? Or is it 2*(width + height - 2) ?\n\nWait, let me re-derive it. For a rectangle with m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the perimeter is:\n\nThe top row has n cells, the bottom row has n cells. The left and right columns have (m-2) cells each (excluding the top and bottom which are already counted). So total is 2n + 2(m-2) = 2n + 2m -4 = 2(m + n) -4. Yes. So that's the formula.\n\nSo for each ring i, the perimeter is 2*( (w' + h') - 2 ), where w' and h' are the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring. Wait, no, 2*(w' + h') -4. So that's the same as 2*(w' + h' - 2). Either way.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i, h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). But we have to make sure that these dimensions are valid. For example, if the original w and h are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1), the dimensions are at least 3? Well, according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Wait, the input says that k is up to floor( (min(n, m) +1)/4 ), but I think that's to ensure that the rings can be formed. Because for each ring i, the dimensions must be at least 3? Or maybe not. Let's think. For example, if the rectangle is 3x3, then the first ring is 3x3, which gives perimeter 8. Then for the next ring, i=2, the dimensions would be 3-4*(1",
