    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that given an array a of n distinct integers, I have to construct a permutation b of a such that for every non-empty subset S of indices (with size between 1 and n-1), the sum of elements in positions S for array a is different from the sum of elements in positions S for array b. If no such permutation exists, output -1.\n\nHmm. So for every possible subset S (excluding empty and full set), the sum of a's elements on S must not equal the sum of b's elements on S. Wait, no. Wait, the condition is that the sum of elements on those positions in a and in b are different. So for each subset S, sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i. Oh right. Because the problem says that for every non-empty subset S (with size between 1 and n-1), the sums for a and b on those positions are different.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the subset S is a set of indices. So when you take the sum for a and for b, it's the sum of the elements in those positions. For example, if S is {1,3}, then sum a[0] + a[2] (assuming 0-based) and sum b[0] + b[2] must be different.\n\nSo the task is to find a permutation of a such that for all subsets S (non-empty, not full), the sum of the elements in those positions in a is not equal to the sum in those positions in b.\n\nBut how can we approach this? Let's think about possible strategies.\n\nFirst, note that for any permutation b, the sum of the entire array is the same as a's sum, since it's a permutation. So the full subset (which is excluded) is not considered. But for all other subsets, their sums must differ between a and b.\n\nBut how do we ensure that? Let's think about what happens when we permute the array. For example, in the sample input where n=2, the original array is [1,2]. The output is [2,1]. Let's check the subsets. The only possible subset is {1} and {2} (since n=2, subsets of size 1). For subset {1}, the sum in a is 1, in b it's 2. Different. For subset {2}, sum in a is 2, in b it's 1. Different. So that works. If the permutation was [1,2], then for subset {1}, the sum would be same as a's sum. So that's invalid.\n\nSo the key is to find a permutation where for all subsets S (not empty, not full), the sum of the elements in S in a is not equal to the sum of elements in S in b.\n\nBut how can we find such a permutation?\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Let's consider that for each subset S, the sum of a's elements on S is different from the sum of b's elements on S. Since b is a permutation of a, the elements are the same, but arranged differently.\n\nBut how can we arrange them so that for all subsets S (except the full and empty), the sum in a and in b differ?\n\nAn idea comes to mind: perhaps if the permutation is such that the elements are ordered in a way that their values are \"spread out\" enough. For example, if we sort the array in a certain way.\n\nWait, but what if we reverse the order? Like in the sample input. For n=2, reversing gives the correct answer. Let's see another example. For the second sample input: the original array is [1000, 100, 10, 1]. The output is [100, 1, 1000, 10]. Let's check some subsets. For example, the subset {1,2} in a has sum 1000+100=1100. In b, the same positions (assuming the output is [100, 1, 1000, 10], then positions 1 and 2 are 100 and 1, sum 101. Which is different. So that works. But how to ensure that for all subsets?\n\nAnother thought: for each subset S, the sum in a and sum in b must differ. Since b is a permutation of a, the sum for S in b is the same as the sum of some subset of a's elements. But how to ensure that for all subsets S, the sum of S in a is not equal to the sum of S in b.\n\nWait, but the sum of S in b is the sum of the elements of a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct a permutation of the given array such that the sum of elements in any non-empty subset (excluding the full set) of indices differs between the original array and the permutation. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key requirement is that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set), the sum of elements in those positions in the original array must not match the sum of elements in the same positions in the permutation array.\n\n2. **Observation**: For small values of `n` (up to 22), we can leverage the fact that the number of permutations is manageable (though large). However, checking all permutations directly would be computationally expensive.\n\n3. **Key Insight**: A permutation where the elements are sorted in ascending order and then reversed might help ensure that the sums of subsets differ. This approach leverages the idea that reversing the sorted array can spread out values sufficiently to avoid matching subset sums.\n\n4. **Implementation Strategy**: \n   - Sort the array and reverse it.\n   - Check if this permutation satisfies the condition for all non-empty subsets (excluding the full set).\n   - If it does, output this permutation; otherwise, return -1.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    # Generate the candidate permutation by sorting and reversing\n    sorted_a = sorted(a)\n    reversed_sorted = sorted_a[::-1]\n    \n    # Check if this permutation works\n    def is_valid(original, perm):\n        # Generate all subsets of size 1 to n-1\n        for k in range(1, n):\n            for subset in itertools.combinations(range(n), k):\n                sum_original = sum(original[i] for i in subset)\n                sum_perm = sum(perm[i] for i in subset)\n                if sum_original == sum_perm:\n                    return False\n        return True\n    \n    if is_valid(a, reversed_sorted):\n        print(' '.join(map(str, reversed_sorted)))\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an array `a`.\n- **Candidate Permutation**: The array is sorted and then reversed to create a potential permutation.\n- **Validation Function**: This function checks if the generated permutation meets the problem's requirements by iterating over all possible non-empty subsets (excluding the full set) and comparing their sums in both the original and permutation arrays.\n- **Output**: If the permutation is valid, it is printed; otherwise, -1 is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the required conditions using a heuristic-based permutation strategy, leveraging the properties of sorted and reversed arrays to avoid matching subset sums.",
