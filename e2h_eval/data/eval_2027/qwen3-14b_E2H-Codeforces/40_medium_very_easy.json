The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And then return this count modulo mod. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For all possible pairs of permutations p and q, we need to check two conditions: p < q lexicographically, and inv(p) > inv(q). Then sum all such valid pairs.\n\nBut considering n can be up to 500, the total number of permutations is n! which is way too big for brute force. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. The key here is to find for each possible inversion count, how many permutations have that count, and then find pairs where p has more inversions than q, but p is lex smaller than q.\n\nBut how to compute the number of permutations with a certain inversion count? Well, there's a dynamic programming approach for that. Let's recall that the number of permutations of size n with k inversions can be computed using DP. The recurrence is something like dp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(k, n-1)} dp[n-1][k - i]. Because inserting the nth element into a permutation of n-1 elements can add between 0 to n-1 inversions, depending on where it's inserted.\n\nBut for n up to 500, the maximum number of inversions is n*(n-1)/2. For n=500, that's 500*499/2 = 124750. So the DP table would be size 500 x 124750. But even that might be manageable with some optimizations. However, for n=500, the DP might take O(n^3) time? Let me think. For each n, and for each possible inversion count up to max_inversion, we need to sum over i from 0 to min(...). So for each dp[n][k], the time is O(k). So overall time is O(n^3) for the DP. For n=500, that's 500^3 = 125 million operations. Which might be feasible, but perhaps tight for Python. However, since the problem is for the hard version, maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut first, let's think about the problem again. Once we have the inversion counts for all permutations, how do we compute the answer?\n\nThe answer is the number of pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nNow, note that for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So if we can compute for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), then subtract those where p > q, but then also consider the lex order.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, and then split them into those where p < q and p > q. For each pair, exactly one of these is true. So the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to (total_pairs_with_inv_p_gt_inv_q - same_pairs)/2, but I'm not sure. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q. For each such pair, either p < q or p > q. Let's say that for each such pair, inv(p) and inv(q) can be compared. Let A be the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Let B be the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p > q. Then the total number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is A + B. However, since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q, p > q) holds. So for each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of A or B is incremented. So the total number of such pairs is (number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q)) multiplied by 1, but how does that relate to A and B?\n\nAlternatively, for each unordered pair {p, q}, where p != q, exactly one of the following is true: p < q or q < p. Suppose inv(p) > inv(q). Then if p < q, this contributes to A. If q < p, then it contributes to B. So the total number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to A + B. But since each unordered pair is counted once, and for each such pair, exactly one of A or B is counted. Therefore, if we can compute the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), then A is the number of those pairs where p < q. But how to compute that?\n\nBut the problem requires us to count exactly A. How can we compute A?\n\nWell, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q is (n!)^2 - n! = n! * (n! - 1). But for each unordered pair {p, q}, there are two ordered pairs: (p, q) and (q, p). Now, suppose we compute the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. That's exactly the required answer.\n\nBut how can we compute this?\n\nLet me think. Let’s denote for all permutations, the inversion counts as inv(p). Let’s compute for all possible pairs of permutations (p, q), where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). Let’s call this total T. Then, since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q, q < p) holds, and exactly one of (inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), inv(p) = inv(q)) holds. So, the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to T. But how does T relate to A?\n\nLet’s think: T is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q). Now, among these ordered pairs, exactly half of them (if inv(p) and inv(q) are different) will have p < q and the other half will have p > q? No, that's not necessarily the case. Because the lex order and inversion counts are independent.\n\nBut here's an idea: For all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(q) > inv(p). Because for each such pair, if inv(p) > inv(q), then inv(q) < inv(p), so they are symmetric. Except when inv(p) = inv(q). So:\n\nT = (total number of ordered pairs with inv(p) != inv(q)) ) / 2 ?\n\nNo, because for each pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), there is a corresponding pair (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p). So the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of ordered pairs where inv(q) > inv(p). Let’s denote S as the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) != inv(q). Then T = S / 2. Because for each such pair, exactly one of the two possibilities holds.\n\nBut then, the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to (T - C)/2 + ... no, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nLet’s imagine that for all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, we have:\n\nTotal pairs = (n! * (n! - 1)).\n\nThese can be divided into three categories:\n\n- inv(p) > inv(q)\n- inv(p) < inv(q)\n- inv(p) == inv(q)\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nA: number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q.\n\nB: number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p > q.\n\nC: number of ordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q.\n\nD: number of ordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) and p > q.\n\nE: number of ordered pairs where inv(p) == inv(q).\n\nThen, the total pairs is A + B + C + D + E = n! * (n! - 1).\n\nBut for each unordered pair {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of (p < q or q < p) holds. Also, for each such pair, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q) holds.\n\nSo for each such unordered pair, if inv(p) > inv(q), then either p < q (contributes to A) or p > q (contributes to B). Similarly, if inv(p) < inv(q), then either p < q (C) or p > q (D). \n\nNow, for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented by 1. Similarly for the others. \n\nBut what is the relation between A and B? Well, if we consider all ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), then these are exactly A + B. Similarly, the ordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) are C + D. And E is the ones where inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nNow, since for any pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), the pair (q, p) has inv(q) < inv(p). So the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). So A + B = C + D.\n\nBut how does that help us?\n\nOur problem is to compute A, the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet me think about the total number of ordered pairs where p < q. Since for all p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. The total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is equal to (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Because for each unordered pair, exactly one of the two ordered pairs exists. So the number of ordered pairs where p < q is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2.\n\nNow, among these, some have inv(p) > inv(q), and others have inv(p) < inv(q), and some have inv(p) = inv(q). Let’s denote:\n\nLet X be the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). This is exactly our desired answer A.\n\nSimilarly, Y is the number of ordered pairs where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). And Z is the number where inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nSo X + Y + Z = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2.\n\nBut since A + B = C + D = T, and X = A, Y = C. Because:\n\nFor ordered pairs where p < q, inv(p) > inv(q) is X (which is A), inv(p) < inv(q) is Y (which is C). \n\nBut earlier we had that A + B = C + D. Also, since D is the number of ordered pairs where p > q and inv(p) < inv(q). Which would be the same as the number of ordered pairs where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p). Which is the same as the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p), which is X. So D = X. Similarly, C = Y. \n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nIf (p, q) is an ordered pair where p > q and inv(p) < inv(q), then (q, p) is an ordered pair where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p). So the number of such pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) < inv(q) is equal to X. Because for each such pair, there's a corresponding (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p), which is X. So D = X. \n\nSimilarly, the number of ordered pairs where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q) is B. Which would correspond to the number of ordered pairs where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), which is Y. So B = Y. \n\nThus, since A + B = C + D, substituting:\n\nA + Y = Y + X → A = X. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nEarlier, we said that A + B = C + D. But according to the above, D = X and B = Y. Also, C = Y? Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, C is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). Which is Y. And D is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) < inv(q). Which is the same as the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p). Which is X. So D = X. \n\nSo A + B = C + D becomes A + B = Y + X. \n\nBut also, since A + B = T (the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q)), and Y + X is the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) plus the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, from earlier, T = A + B = number of ordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q). And the number of ordered pairs with inv(p) < inv(q) is C + D = Y + X. But since T = (total pairs - E) / 2, where E is the number of ordered pairs with inv(p) = inv(q). So T = (total_pairs - E) / 2. \n\nBut regardless, going back to the equation A + B = Y + X. But how can I find X?\n\nWe know that X is the answer we need. Let's see:\n\nWe can think that for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is X. And the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) is Y. And the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) is Z. So X + Y + Z = total_pairs_where_p_less_than_q. \n\nBut what is the relation between X and Y?\n\nWell, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) != inv(q), exactly half of them have inv(p) > inv(q) and the other half have inv(p) < inv(q)? No, that's not true. Because the lex order and inversion counts are independent. \n\nBut here's an idea: For all unordered pairs {p, q}, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Because for each such pair, either inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) (assuming they are not equal). So the total number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Let's call this count U. Then, the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is U + V, where V is the number of ordered pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) (but I'm not sure). Wait, no. For each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then there are two ordered pairs (p, q) and (q, p). But in the ordered pairs, only one of them has inv(p) > inv(q) (the (p, q) pair if inv(p) > inv(q)), and the other has inv(q) < inv(p). So the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), multiplied by 1 (since for each unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) has inv(p) > inv(q)). \n\nBut the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Let me denote that as U. So the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is U. But this contradicts previous thoughts. Wait, no. Let me think again. For each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. So the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Let’s call this number U. So the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is U (since each unordered pair contributes exactly one ordered pair where inv(p) > inv(q)). Similarly, the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) is also U. And the remaining ordered pairs (those with inv(p) = inv(q)) are E. \n\nSo total ordered pairs is 2U + E = (n! * (n! - 1)).\n\nBut then, the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is U. Which equals the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). \n\nBut how does this help us find X, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nWell, for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) has p < q. So for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the two ordered pairs is counted in X or in the set of ordered pairs where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). \n\nLet’s denote that for each such unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is either 1 or 0, depending on whether p < q. \n\nSo the total X is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Similarly, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p > q is equal to the number of such unordered pairs where p > q. \n\nBut since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or p > q holds, the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to X + B', where B' is the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p > q. But since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of X or B' is incremented by 1, and the total is U = X + B'. But since the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is U, and X is the number of those pairs where p < q, and B' is the number where p > q. But since for each unordered pair, exactly one of p < q or p > q holds, then X + B' = U. But since the unordered pairs are symmetric, how can we find X?\n\nBut how can we find X? Well, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p > q. Because for each such pair, there's a corresponding pair with the opposite order. Wait no. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. So the number of such pairs where p < q is equal to the number of such pairs where p > q? No. Because for example, if there are more permutations p where p < q, but that's not the case. The number of unordered pairs {p, q} with p < q is the same as the number with p > q. But for the condition inv(p) > inv(q), it's not necessarily symmetric.\n\nWait, no. The number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is U. And for each such pair, exactly one of p < q or p > q holds. So the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to X, and the number where inv(p) > inv(q) and p > q is equal to (U - X). \n\nBut how can we find X? It depends on how the lex order and inversion counts are related.\n\nBut here's an idea: the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is equal to (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Let's denote this as T_total. \n\nWithin this T_total, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is X, the number where inv(p) < inv(q) is Y, and the number where inv(p) = inv(q) is Z. So X + Y + Z = T_total. \n\nBut also, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is U = X + (number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p > q). But since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of (p < q or p > q) holds, and the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is U, then X is the number of such unordered pairs where p < q. And the number of unordered pairs where p > q is U - X. \n\nBut how to find X?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire set of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q. For each such pair, the probability that inv(p) > inv(q) is something. But I don't think that helps.\n\nAnother approach: Let’s compute for all possible inversion counts i and j, the number of permutations with i inversions (call this cnt[i]), and the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q, inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j. Then, for all i > j, sum over all such pairs. \n\nBut how to compute the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q, inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j. \n\nThe problem is that for given i and j, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q, inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j is equal to (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2 if i != j, but no. Because for each pair (p, q) where p < q, inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and for each pair (q, p) where q < p, inv(q) = j and inv(p) = i. So if i != j, then the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j is cnt[i] * cnt[j]. And the number of such ordered pairs where p < q is (cnt[i] * cnt[j] + cnt[j] * cnt[i] - ... wait, no. For i != j, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j is cnt[i] * cnt[j]. Among these, exactly half of them have p < q and half have p > q if the lex order is symmetric. But is that the case?\n\nNo. Because the lex order between p and q depends on their actual values, not their inversion counts. However, for all possible pairs of permutations p and q, exactly half of the ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q have p < q. But when we fix inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, how many of them have p < q?\n\nThis seems difficult to compute. However, there's an important observation here: for all permutations p and q with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and p != q, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is equal to the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p. Because for each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for the set of all pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and p != q, the number of ordered pairs where p < q is equal to (cnt[i] * cnt[j] - same) / 2, where same is the number of pairs where p = q (but since p and q are permutations, same is zero unless i = j and p = q). \n\nWait, for i != j, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j is cnt[i] * cnt[j]. For each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the number of ordered pairs where p < q is (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} where p has i inversions and q has j inversions, there are two ordered pairs. \n\nSo, if i != j, then the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q, inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j is equal to (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. \n\nBut when i = j, then for the pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = inv(q) = i, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is (cnt[i] * (cnt[i] - 1)) / 2. Because for each pair of distinct permutations p and q with the same inversion count, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer X (the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) can be calculated as:\n\nX = sum_{i > j} [ (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2 ] \n\nBecause for each i > j, we have all pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and p < q. \n\nBut why? Because for each i > j, the pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j contribute to X. And for each such i and j, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. \n\nYes! Because for i > j, each such pair (p, q) contributes 1 to X if p < q. And since the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j is cnt[i] * cnt[j], and exactly half of them have p < q, then the contribution is (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) // 2. \n\nSo the answer X is the sum for all i > j of (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) // 2. \n\nBut wait, this assumes that for any i and j, when i != j, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q is exactly (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. Is this true?\n\nYes. Because for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for all pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j and i != j, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is exactly (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the sum over all i > j of (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) // 2. \n\nThis is a crucial insight. So the problem reduces to computing the inversion count distribution for permutations of size n, then for each pair (i, j) where i > j, multiply cnt[i] * cnt[j], sum all those products, then divide by 2. \n\nBut wait, why divide by 2? Because for each i and j where i > j, the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q is (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. So adding all those for i > j gives the total X. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute cnt[k] for all k from 0 to max_inversion (which is n*(n-1)/2), where cnt[k] is the number of permutations of size n with exactly k inversions.\n\n2. Compute the sum over all pairs (i, j) where i > j of cnt[i] * cnt[j].\n\n3. Divide this sum by 2, then take modulo mod.\n\nBut wait, the division by 2 is necessary because for each i and j, when i > j, the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j and p < q is exactly (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. \n\nBut how to handle division by 2 in modular arithmetic? Because mod may not be a prime. \n\nAh, but in this case, the sum is even. Because for each pair (i, j) where i > j, and (j, i) where j < i, the product cnt[i] * cnt[j] is counted once in i > j and once in j < i. But in our case, we are only considering i > j. However, the sum of all i > j of cnt[i] * cnt[j] is equal to the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and i > j, but for each such pair (p, q), the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is the same as the sum over i > j of cnt[i] * cnt[j]. But earlier analysis said that the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to U, which is the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). However, this seems conflicting with the previous approach. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The sum over i > j of cnt[i] * cnt[j] is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and i > j. Which is exactly the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q). Because for any ordered pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), it must have i = inv(p), j = inv(q), and i > j. \n\nSo the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j]. And according to earlier analysis, this sum equals U, the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), multiplied by 1 (since for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), there is exactly one ordered pair (p, q) or (q, p) that contributes to this sum). \n\nBut according to the previous idea, the answer X (the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) is equal to (sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. \n\nBut why? Because for each ordered pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly half of them have p < q and the other half have p > q. \n\nIs this true? \n\nYes. Because for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. And for all ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), there's a corresponding ordered pair (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p). \n\nSo the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of ordered pairs where inv(q) > inv(p). And the total number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j]. \n\nSo the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is exactly half of that sum. \n\nBecause for each such pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), either p < q or q < p. And for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of these two ordered pairs is counted in the sum. So the total sum is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), and this sum is equal to twice the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Hence, the answer X is sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j] / 2. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to computing this sum and dividing by 2. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute the inversion count distribution for permutations of size n.\n\n- Compute the sum of cnt[i] * cnt[j] for all i > j.\n\n- Divide this sum by 2, take modulo mod. \n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the inversion count distribution. For that, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define dp[n][k] as the number of permutations of size n with exactly k inversions. \n\nThe recurrence is:\n\ndp[1][0] = 1.\n\nFor n >= 2, dp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(k, n-1)} dp[n-1][k - i]\n\nBecause inserting the nth element into a permutation of size n-1 can add between 0 to n-1 inversions, depending on where it is inserted. \n\nBut for n=500, and k up to 500*499/2 = 124750, the DP table would be 500 x 124750. \n\nBut for each n, the maximum k is (n*(n-1))/2. So for n=500, it's 124750. So the DP table would be manageable. However, for Python, even with 500*125,000 entries, that's 62,375,000 entries. Each entry is an integer. But for n=500, it's possible. \n\nBut the problem is that for each n, and for each k, we need to compute the sum of dp[n-1][k - i], for i from 0 to min(n-1, k). \n\nBut for n=500, this could be O(n^3) time. Let's see:\n\nEach dp[n][k] requires O(n) time. For each n from 1 to 500, and for each k up to (n*(n-1))/2. \n\nSo for n=500, the total operations would be roughly O(n^3) = 500^3 = 125,000,000 operations. Which is acceptable in Python if optimized properly.\n\nBut let's think about the DP. \n\nWe can precompute dp for all n up to 500. \n\nLet me think about the initial steps. \n\nFor n=1, the only permutation is [1], with 0 inversions. So dp[1][0] = 1.\n\nFor n=2, the permutations are [1,2] (0 inversions) and [2,1] (1 inversion). So dp[2][0] = 1, dp[2][1] = 1.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nEach permutation of size 2 can be extended by inserting 3 in different positions. For example, inserting into the first position adds 2 inversions (since 3 is larger than both elements), inserting into the second position adds 1 inversion, inserting into the third position adds 0. \n\nSo for each dp[2][k], the new dp[3][k + 0] += dp[2][k], dp[3][k + 1] += dp[2][k], dp[3][k + 2] += dp[2][k].\n\nSo for each n, the new dp[n][k] is the sum of dp[n-1][k - i], for i from 0 to n-1 (but only if k - i >= 0).\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nWe can use a 2D array, where for each n, we compute the current dp[n] based on dp[n-1].\n\nBut for space optimization, since we only need dp[n-1] to compute dp[n], we can use two 1D arrays: previous and current.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve the problem of counting the number of permutation pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$ and has more inversions than $q$, we use dynamic programming to compute the number of permutations with a specific number of inversions. Then, we calculate the required sum based on these counts.\n\n---\n\n### Key Steps\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming for Inversion Counts**:\n   - We define `dp[n][k]` as the number of permutations of length `n` with exactly `k` inversions.\n   - The recurrence relation is:\n     $$\n     dp[n][k] = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\min(k, n-1)} dp[n-1][k-i]\n     $$\n     This accounts for inserting the new element in all possible positions, which affects the number of inversions accordingly.\n\n2. **Summing Valid Pairs**:\n   - After computing the inversion count distribution, we compute the total number of valid pairs where $p < q$ and $\\text{inversions}(p) > \\text{inversions}(q)$.\n   - This is done by summing over all pairs $(i, j)$ where $i > j$, and multiplying the counts of permutations with $i$ and $j$ inversions, then dividing the result by 2 (since each pair is counted twice in the full product sum).\n\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**:\n   - Since the result can be very large, we compute everything modulo `mod`.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n, mod = map(int, input().split())\n\n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    dp = [0] * (max_inv + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: 1 permutation of size 1 with 0 inversions\n\n    for size in range(2, n + 1):\n        new_dp = [0] * (max_inv + 1)\n        for k in range(max_inv + 1):\n            if dp[k] == 0:\n                continue\n            for i in range(0, min(size - 1, max_inv - k) + 1):\n                new_dp[k + i] = (new_dp[k + i] + dp[k]) % mod\n        dp = new_dp\n\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(max_inv + 1):\n        for j in range(i):\n            total = (total + dp[i] * dp[j]) % mod\n\n    print(total // 2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0] = 1` since there's one permutation (of size 1) with zero inversions.\n- **DP Transition**: For each `size` from 2 to `n`, update the number of permutations with `k` inversions by considering how inserting the next element into different positions changes the number of inversions.\n- **Counting Valid Pairs**: Iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` where `i > j`, and accumulate the product of `dp[i] * dp[j]`.\n- **Final Result**: Since each valid pair is counted twice in the full product sum, divide the final result by 2 before printing.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired count using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic.",
