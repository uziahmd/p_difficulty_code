Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair. \n\nSo, first, I need to figure out how to pair them optimally. Let's think about the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') can only pair with another 'a' or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'. \n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. Maybe we can first pair the specific colors with each other, then use the question marks for the remaining ones. But how to handle that efficiently?\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots and right boots. For example, if there are x left boots of color 'a' and y right boots of color 'a', then the maximum possible pairs for this color is min(x, y). But since '?' can also pair with them, perhaps we need to first pair the specific colors, then use the '?'s.\n\nBut wait, the '?' can be used in two ways: either as a left or right boot. So maybe the approach is:\n\n- First, pair all specific colors (non-?) between left and right. For example, for each color c (non-?), pair as many left c with right c as possible. Then, collect the leftover left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired) and use the '?'s to pair them.\n\nWait, but the '?'s can be on either side. So maybe we need to process them in a way that uses the '?'s optimally.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nWe can first pair all the non-? left boots with non-? right boots. For example, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But once we do that, we have some left and right boots left that are either ? or have colors that couldn't be matched. Then, the remaining ? can be used to pair with any of the remaining boots.\n\nBut how to track which specific boots are being used? Because we need to actually output the indices of the pairs. So perhaps we need to track for each color, the positions of the left and right boots.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to output the actual indices. So the approach needs to not only count the maximum number of pairs but also track which pairs to make.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nStep 1: Pair specific colors with each other. For example, for each color c (not ?), match left boots of color c with right boots of color c. For each such pair, we can take as many as possible. Once that's done, we can collect the leftover left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired because their color didn't match).\n\nStep 2: Now, handle the ?s. The ?s can be used in two ways: as a left boot that can pair with any right boot (including ?s), or as a right boot that can pair with any left boot (including ?s). But how to maximize the pairs here?\n\nBut after step 1, the remaining left boots are those that are either ? or have colors that couldn't be matched with the right boots. Similarly for the right boots.\n\nBut perhaps, after step 1, we can collect all left boots that are ? and all right boots that are ?, and then pair them together. However, there's also the possibility of pairing the remaining non-? left boots with ? right boots, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but during step 1, we might have left some non-? left boots that couldn't be paired. For example, suppose there are more left boots of color 'a' than right boots of color 'a'. Then, after pairing min(left_a, right_a) pairs, there are left_a - right_a left boots of color 'a' left. These can be paired with ? right boots. Similarly for the right boots.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each color c (non-?), pair as many left and right as possible. Record these pairs.\n\n- Then, collect the remaining left boots (those that are non-? but couldn't be paired) and the remaining right boots (same). Also, collect the left ?s and right ?s.\n\n- Now, for the remaining non-? left boots, they can be paired with any right ?s. Similarly, remaining non-? right boots can be paired with left ?s. Also, the ?s can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nAfter step 1, we have:\n\nleft_remain: list of left boots (positions) that are non-",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The compatibility rules are such that a specific color can only pair with another specific color of the same type or an indefinite color, while an indefinite color can pair with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), pair as many left boots with right boots of the same color as possible. This ensures that we use up specific colors efficiently.\n2. **Track Remaining Boots**: After pairing specific colors, track the remaining left and right boots that could not be paired. These include both specific colors that couldn't find matches and indefinite colors.\n3. **Use Indefinite Colors**: Use the remaining indefinite colors to pair with any remaining specific or indefinite colors. This involves:\n   - Pairing remaining specific left boots with indefinite right boots.\n   - Pairing remaining specific right boots with indefinite left boots.\n   - Pairing remaining indefinite left boots with remaining indefinite right boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l_str = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r_str = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    l = list(l_str)\n    r = list(r_str)\n    \n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors with each other\n    left_pairs = []\n    right_pairs = []\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    \n    # Count for specific colors\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    left_count = defaultdict(list)\n    right_count = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_count[l[i]].append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            right_count[r[i]].append(i)\n    \n    # Pair same color\n    for c in left_count:\n        if c in right_count:\n            left_list = left_count[c]\n            right_list = right_count[c]\n            min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(min_len):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                left_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n                used_left[left_idx] = True\n                used_right[right_idx] = True\n    \n    # Now collect remaining left and right indices\n    remaining_left = []\n    remaining_right = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            remaining_left.append(i)\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            remaining_right.append(i)\n    \n    # Step 2: Pair remaining specific with ?\n    # First, process left ? and right non-?\n    # Create lists of left ? and right ? and others\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n    left_other = []\n    right_other = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            if l[i] == '?':\n                left_q.append(i)\n            else:\n                left_other.append(i)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            if r[i] == '?':\n                right_q.append(i)\n            else:\n                right_other.append(i)\n    \n    # Pair left_other with right_q\n    for i in range(len(left_other)):\n        if len(right_q) > 0:\n            left_idx = left_other[i]\n            right_idx = right_q.pop(0)\n            left_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n    \n    # Pair right_other with left_q\n    for i in range(len(right_other)):\n        if len(left_q) > 0:\n            right_idx = right_other[i]\n            left_idx = left_q.pop(0)\n            left_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n    \n    # Now pair remaining ?s\n    # left_q and right_q have remaining ?s\n    # Pair them together\n    min_len = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        left_idx = left_q[i]\n        right_idx = right_q[i]\n        left_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n    \n    # Output\n    print(len(left_pairs))\n    for a, b in left_pairs:\n        print(a + 1, b + 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into two strings representing the colors of left and right boots.\n2. **Counting Specific Colors**: We count the positions of each specific color (excluding '?') in both left and right boots.\n3. **Pairing Specific Colors**: For each color, we pair as many left boots with right boots of the same color as possible.\n4. **Handling Remaining Boots**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots.
