Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which is a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question mark can match any color. I have to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nThe output requires the count followed by the pairs. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the steps. First, I need to find the maximum possible pairs. Let's think about how to match them optimally.\n\nFirst, I can think of two types of matches:\n\n1. Specific matches where both are letters and same. For example, 'a' and 'a'.\n2. Matches involving '?'. Since '?' can match any color, either specific or another '?'.\n\nBut how to maximize the total pairs?\n\nAn approach could be to first match the specific colors, then use the question marks to cover the remaining.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping cases? For example, if a left boot is 'a', and a right boot is 'a', that's a direct match. But if there's a left 'a' and a right '?', maybe it's better to pair them, but maybe not if there's another right 'a' that can be paired with another left 'a'.\n\nWait, but the goal is maximum pairs. So perhaps we should first pair as many specific matches as possible, then use the question marks to pair with remaining specific colors, and then pair the remaining question marks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to:\n\n- For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left and right boots. Then, for each color, the number of pairs is the minimum of left and right counts. Then, the remaining left and right boots (those not matched in this step) can be paired with '?'s. But how?\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used in two ways: they can be paired with specific colors or with other question marks.\n\nBut maybe the optimal way is:\n\nFirst, match all specific color pairs. For example, for color 'a', take min(left_a, right_a) pairs. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched because the other side didn't have enough), we can pair them using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nWe can have two groups: left and right. Let's process the specific colors first.\n\nFor each color c (from a-z):\n\n- The number of left boots with color c is L[c].\n- The number of right boots with color c is R[c].\n\nThe number of pairs for color c is min(L[c], R[c]). We can pair these. Then, subtract those from L[c] and R[c].\n\nAfter this, we have some leftover L and R. These leftovers are:\n\n- Left boots with color c where R[c] was less than L[c], so some left boots are left.\n- Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut also, there are the '?' in both left and right.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair the remaining left and right boots. But since '?' can match anything, perhaps we can pair them in the following way:\n\nTake all the left boots that are not '?' and have not been matched yet. These can be paired with right boots that are '?'. Similarly, take the right boots that are not '?' and have not been matched yet, and pair them with left boots that are '?'.\n\nThen, the remaining '?' on both sides can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nAfter processing the specific colors, let's have:\n\nleft_remaining = list of left boots that are either '?', or their color couldn't be matched (because the other side didn't have enough).\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nBut perhaps, after the initial matching, the remaining left boots can be:\n\nFor each left boot, if it's not a '?', and wasn't matched in the specific color step, then it's a specific color that couldn't be matched. So, for example, if there are more left 'a's than right 'a's, then the excess left 'a's are left.\n\nSimilarly for the right.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair these leftover specific colors with the '?' on the opposite side.\n\nFor example, for each left boot that is not '?', but hasn't been matched yet, we can pair it with a '?' on the right. Similarly for the right boots that are not '?', pair with '?' on left.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining '?' on left and right can be paired with each other.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Match specific colors (non-?) between left and right.\n\n2. For the remaining left boots (specific colors) and right",
    "response": "To solve the Colored Boots problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot can be of a specific color (a lowercase letter) or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that their colors are compatible, with each boot being used in at most one pair.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Specific Color Matching**: First, we match boots of the same specific color on both left and right sides. For each color from 'a' to 'z', we count the occurrences on both sides and form pairs up to the minimum count of either side.\n2. **Indefinite Color Matching**: After handling specific color matches, we use the remaining boots with indefinite colors ('?') to pair with any remaining specific color boots. This is done by matching left '?' with right non-'?' and vice versa.\n3. **Remaining Indefinite Pairs**: Finally, any remaining '?' on both sides are paired together.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # We need to read all test cases, but the input is given as multiple test cases.\n    # Wait, looking back, the example shows that the input may have multiple test cases.\n    # But the original problem says: the input is for one test case.
