    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find all the integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars at some point during the file copying process. \n\nSo, first, I need to understand how the progress bars work. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied. The second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied. \n\nThe key here is to simulate all possible moments when a byte is copied and check for each moment what the two percentages are. Then collect all the values that are present in both.\n\nBut simulating every byte might be computationally feasible since the maximum total bytes is 100 files * 1000 bytes = 100,000 bytes. For each byte, we can compute the two percentages and track when they are equal. However, even with 1e5 bytes, it's manageable for Python.\n\nWait, but for each byte, we have to calculate both percentages. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the total size of all files, let's call it total_size = sum(a).\n\n2. For each file i (from 0 to n-1), and for each byte x in 1..a[i] (since after each byte, the progress is updated):\n\n   a. The current file's progress is (x * 100) // a[i]. But wait, the problem says that after copying the x-th byte of the file, the first progress bar shows floor(100 * x / a_i). So for x from 1 to a_i. Also, note that when x is 0 (before any bytes are copied?), but according to the note, initially both bars show 0. But the initial state is before any bytes are copied. However, the problem says that the bars update after each byte is copied. So the initial 0% is before any bytes are copied, but then after the first byte is copied, the first bar is floor(100 * 1 / a_i) and the second is floor(100 * (sum_prev + 1)/total_size). \n\nWait, the initial state is considered as 0% for both. Then, after each byte is copied, the bars are updated. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is a valid moment where both are 0. But according to the problem statement, the first byte is copied, and after that, the bars are updated. So the initial 0 is included. But during the process, after each byte, the bars are updated. So for example, if there's one file of size 6, then the initial state is 0. Then after each byte (from 1 to 6), the progress bars are updated. So for each of these steps, we need to check if the two percentages are the same. \n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Iterate through each byte copied, keeping track of the current position in the files. For each such byte, compute both percentages and check if they are equal. Collect all such values.\n\nBut how do we model the bytes?\n\nLet me think. For each file i (starting from 0), for each byte x (from 1 to a[i]):\n\n- The sum_prev is the sum of the sizes of the previous files. So, the total bytes copied up to this point is sum_prev + x. \n\nSo for the overall progress, it's (sum_prev + x) * 100 // total_size.\n\nFor the current file's progress, it's (x * 100) // a[i].\n\nBut also, we need to consider the initial state where no bytes have been copied. At that moment, both are 0. So that's one of the possible values. But in the simulation, when you start, before any bytes are copied, the bars are 0. Then, after the first byte is copied, the bars are updated. So the initial 0 is a valid moment. However, when we simulate all the bytes, we need to make sure that the initial 0 is considered. But when you process all the bytes, the initial state is not captured unless you add it explicitly. Because, for example, in the first test case, the output includes 0, which is the initial state. But when you process each byte, the initial state isn't covered. So how do we handle that?\n\nAh, right. Because the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So, for the initial state, both progress bars are 0. So that's a valid value. Then, during the simulation of each byte, we can check for the percentages. But we must include the initial 0 in our result.\n\nBut how to check if 0 is present. Well, in the initial state, both are zero. So 0 is always present. But perhaps in some cases, even after some bytes, the percentages could be 0 again. For example, if the total size is very large. But the initial 0 is definitely a valid value. So the answer must include 0, unless there's some edge case where even that is not possible. Wait, no. The problem says that initially both are zero. So 0 is always part of the answer. Unless the problem says that the initial state is not considered. Wait, the problem says: \"the values on the progress bars are updated after copying each byte.\" So the initial state is before any bytes are copied, and the bars show 0. So that's a valid moment. So 0 is always present in the answer. But looking at the sample input, for example, the first sample input's output includes 0 and 100. So that's correct.\n\nBut how to capture that. Well, in the code, we can add 0 to the set of possible values. But wait, maybe during the simulation, the initial state is not covered. For example, when we process each byte, the initial state is not part of the simulation. So we need to check if 0 is present. However, during the simulation, after the first byte is copied, the progress bars may be 0 again. For example, if the first file is of size 1000, then after the first byte, the current progress is 0.00...%, which is 0. The overall progress is (1/1000)*100 = 0.1% which is 0. So both are 0. So in that case, 0 is present again. But the initial 0 is also present. So the code needs to capture that. \n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Initialize a set to collect all the values that are present in both progress bars at some moment.\n\n- Add 0 to the set, because the initial state is 0 for both.\n\n- Then simulate each byte being copied, and for each such moment, compute the two percentages and check if they are equal. If they are, add them to the set.\n\nWait, but maybe the initial 0 is already captured during the simulation? No. Because when you copy the first byte, the first progress bar is (1 * 100) // a_i. For example, if a_i is 1000, then that's 0. So the first progress bar is 0. The overall progress is (sum_prev + x) * 100 // total_size. sum_prev is 0, x is 1. So (1 * 100) // total_size. If total_size is 1000, then that's 0. So in that case, after the first byte, both are 0. So the initial 0 is not captured in the simulation, but the same 0 is captured again. However, the initial 0 is a moment when both are 0. So in the code, we need to include that. \n\nBut what if during the simulation, the same 0 is generated again? For example, in the first sample input, which is 1 file of 6 bytes. The initial state is 0. Then after each byte, the first progress bar is (x*100)//6, and the overall is (x*100)//6. So for x=1, 100//6=16. So the initial 0 is a valid moment. So the code must include 0 in the answer. Therefore, in the code, we need to start by adding 0 to the set. Then proceed with the simulation. \n\nBut wait, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. However, during the simulation, when you process each byte, you can have the same 0 again. But the initial 0 is a valid moment. So in the code, we need to include 0 as a possible value. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize a set called 'result' with 0.\n\nThen, for each file, for each byte x (from 1 to a_i):\n\nCompute the current progress (current_percent) as (x * 100) // a_i.\n\nCompute the total progress (total_percent) as ((sum_prev + x) * 100) // total_size.\n\nIf current_percent == total_percent, then add that value to the 'result' set.\n\nBut wait, sum_prev is the sum of the sizes of all previous files. So for the first file, sum_prev is 0. For the second file, sum_prev is a_1. And so on. \n\nSo, the code would need to track the cumulative sum up to the previous files. \n\nLet me think about how to structure the loop:\n\nCompute the total_size = sum(a).\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n    sum_prev = sum(a[0..i-1])\n\n    for x in 1..a[i]:\n\n        current_percent = (x * 100) // a[i]\n\n        total_bytes_copied = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_percent = (total_bytes_copied * 100) // total_size\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            add to the set.\n\nBut how to compute sum_prev? Well, we can precompute the prefix sums. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. Then, for the i-th file (0-based?), sum_prev would be prefix_sums[i].\n\nAlternatively, during the loop, we can keep track of the cumulative sum. For example, initialize a variable cumulative_sum = 0. Then, for each file in a:\n\n    for x in 1..file_size:\n\n        compute current_percent and total_percent\n\n    cumulative_sum += file_size\n\nBut that's probably easier. Let me see:\n\nInitialize cumulative_sum = 0.\n\nfor each file in a:\n\n    file_size = file\n\n    for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n        current_percent = (x * 100) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = cumulative_sum + x\n\n        total_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_size\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            add to result\n\n    cumulative_sum += file_size\n\nYes. That seems manageable.\n\nBut then, what about the final state where all bytes are copied. For example, when all bytes are copied, the progress bars are 100%? Well, for the first progress bar, when x is equal to a_i, then (x * 100) // a_i is 100. For the total progress, when total_bytes is equal to total_size, (total_bytes * 100) // total_size is 100. So in that case, both are 100. So that's a valid moment. So the code will capture that. \n\nBut what about the moment when all bytes are copied. For example, the last byte of the last file. The code would process that x, and compute the percentages, which would be 100 for both. So the code adds 100 to the set. \n\nBut what about the moment after all bytes are copied? Well, according to the problem statement, the bars are updated after each byte is copied. So after the last byte is copied, the bars are updated. So that's included in the simulation. \n\nSo the code would capture that. \n\nNow, the initial 0 is added to the result set. However, what if during the simulation, there's another moment when both are 0? For example, when the first byte is copied, and both percentages are 0. Then, the code would add 0 again, but since it's a set, duplicates are handled automatically. \n\nBut the initial 0 is added to the set. However, what if the initial state is not considered? For example, if the code does not add 0, but during the simulation, the first byte copied results in both being 0. Then, the code would capture 0. However, if there is no such moment, like when the first byte copied makes the percentages non-zero, then the initial 0 would not be captured. \n\nSo, for example, if the first file is of size 1. Then, the initial state is 0. After copying the first byte, the current percent is 100 * 1 / 1 = 100, and the total percent is 100 * 1 / 1 = 100. So in that case, the code would capture 100. But the initial 0 is not captured in the simulation. So adding 0 to the set is necessary. \n\nTherefore, the code should start by initializing the set with 0. \n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the output includes 0 and 100. Let's see:\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=1, a=[6]. The total_size is 6. \n\nInitial state: 0. \n\nThen, for x from 1 to 6:\n\nAt x=1, current percent is (1*100)/6 = 16.666... floored to 16. Total bytes is 1, so (1*100)/6 = 16. So same. So 16 is added. \n\nSimilarly, for x=2: 200/6=33.333... floored to 33. Total is 2*100/6=33. So same. \n\nSo during the simulation, 16, 33, etc. are added. \n\nBut the initial 0 is added to the set. So the result set includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo the code should add 0 to the set. \n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic. \n\nBut what about when the total_size is zero? Well, the problem says that a_i is at least 1. So total_size is at least 1. So division by zero is not possible. \n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n, then read list a. \n\nCompute total_size = sum(a). \n\nInitialize a set called 'result' with 0. \n\nInitialize cumulative_sum = 0. \n\nThen, for each file in a:\n\n    file_size = current file's size. \n\n    for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n        current_percent = (x * 100) // file_size \n\n        total_bytes = cumulative_sum + x \n\n        total_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_size \n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            add to the result set. \n\n    cumulative_sum += file_size \n\nOnce all bytes are processed, collect all elements in the result set, sort them, and output them. \n\nBut wait, what about the moment when all bytes are copied? For example, when x is the last byte of the last file. Then, the code would process that and add 100 to the set. \n\nBut in the sample input 1, the output includes 100. So that's correct. \n\nNow, let's test the code against the sample input. \n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=1, a=[6]. \n\ntotal_size = 6. \n\nresult starts with 0. \n\ncumulative_sum starts at 0. \n\nProcessing the first file (size 6):\n\nfor x from 1 to 6:\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100*1//6 = 16. \n\ntotal_bytes = 0+1 = 1. total_percent = 100*1//6 = 16. So same. add 16.\n\nx=2: 200//6=33. total is 2*100//6=33. add 33.\n\nx=3: 300//6=50. total is 3*100//6=50. add 50.\n\nx=4: 400//6=66. total is 4*100//6=66. add 66.\n\nx=5: 500//6=83. total is 5*100//6=83. add 83.\n\nx=6: 600//6=100. total is 6*100//6=100. add 100.\n\nSo the result set has 0,16,33,50,66,83,100. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput is 2\\n100 500. Output is 0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100. \n\nLet me think about that. \n\nTotal size is 600. \n\nLet's simulate. \n\nInitially, result has 0. \n\nFirst file is 100 bytes. \n\ncumulative_sum starts at 0. \n\nFor x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100) // 100 = x. \n\ntotal_bytes is 0 + x. \n\ntotal_percent is (x * 100) // 600. \n\nSo for x from 1 to 100, current_percent is x, total_percent is (x * 100) // 600. \n\nWe need to check when x equals (x * 100) // 600. \n\nBut for x in 1-100, (x * 100) // 600 = floor(x/6). \n\nSo for example, when x=6, floor(6/6) = 1. So current_percent is 6, total is 1. Not equal. \n\nSo when does x equal floor(x/6)? \n\nWell, for x=0, but that's the initial state. For x in 1-100, it's impossible. Because x is between 1-100, and floor(x/6) is between 0 and 16. So the only way for x to equal floor(x/6) is if x is 0. So during the first file's processing, none of the x's will trigger adding a value to the set. \n\nThen, after processing the first file, cumulative_sum becomes 100. \n\nNow, the second file is 500 bytes. \n\nFor x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100) // 500 = floor( (x * 100)/500 ) = floor(x/5). \n\ntotal_bytes is 100 + x. \n\ntotal_percent is ( (100 + x) * 100 ) // 600. \n\nSo when is floor(x/5) equal to floor( (100 + x) * 100 / 600 ) ?\n\nLet me compute (100 + x) * 100 / 600 = (100 + x)/6. So floor( (100 +x)/6 ). \n\nSo the equation is floor(x/5) = floor( (100 + x)/6 )\n\nWe need to find x in 1..500 where this holds. \n\nLet me try to find x values where this is true. \n\nFor example, when x= 500:\n\nfloor(500/5) = 100. \n\n(100 + 500)/6 = 600/6 = 100. So yes, 100. So that's added. \n\nWhat about other x's?\n\nLet me think of when x= 500 - 5* something. \n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think that during the simulation, the code would find those x's where the two percentages are equal. \n\nBut according to the sample output, the numbers are 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. \n\nSo during the processing of the second file, some x's would generate those values. \n\nFor example, when x= 595? Wait, but the second file is 500 bytes. So x ranges from 1 to 500. \n\nWait, let's take x= 475. \n\ncurrent_percent = 475/5 = 95. \n\ntotal_bytes is 100 + 475 = 575. \n\ntotal_percent = 575 / 6 = 95.833..., which floors to 95. \n\nSo 95 == 95. So that's added. \n\nSimilarly, for x= 476: \n\ncurrent_percent is 476 /5 = 95.2 → 95. \n\ntotal_bytes = 100 + 476 = 576. 576 /6 = 96 → 96. So 95 != 96. \n\nSo that's not added. \n\nBut when x= 475, the value 95 is added. \n\nSimilarly, for x= 480:\n\ncurrent_percent is 480/5 = 96. \n\ntotal_bytes = 100+480=580. 580/6 = 96.666..., floor is 96. So 96 == 96 → added. \n\nSo that's 96. \n\nSimilarly, for x= 485 → current is 97, total is 585/6=97.5 → 97. \n\nSo added. \n\nx= 490 → current is 98, total is 590/6= 98.333... → 98. \n\nAdded. \n\nx= 495 → current is 99, total is 595/6= 99.166... → 99. \n\nAdded. \n\nx= 500 → current is 100, total is 600/6=100 → added. \n\nSo during the processing of the second file, the code would add 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. \n\nPlus the initial 0. \n\nSo the result set would be {0, 95,96,97,98,99,100}, which matches the sample output. \n\nThus, the code seems correct. \n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, a=[1]. \n\nTotal size is 1. \n\nInitial 0 is added. \n\nThen for x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100 * 1 //1 = 100. \n\ntotal_bytes = 1 → 100*1//1 = 100. So 100 is added. \n\nSo the result is 0, 100. \n\nEdge case 2: n=2, a=[1, 1]. \n\nTotal size is 2. \n\nInitial 0 added. \n\nProcessing first file (size 1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100*1//1 = 100. \n\ntotal_bytes = 1 → 100 * 1 //2 = 50. \n\nNot equal. So nothing added. \n\nThen cumulative_sum becomes 1. \n\nProcessing second file (size 1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100 *1//1 = 100. \n\ntotal_bytes = 1+1=2 → 200//2=100. So added. \n\nSo the result set is {0, 100}. \n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[2, 2]. \n\ntotal_size is 4. \n\nInitial 0 added. \n\nFirst file (size 2):\n\nfor x=1:\n\ncurrent is 50. total is (1*100)/4=25. Not equal. \n\nx=2: current is 100. total is 2*100/4=50. Not equal. \n\nThen cumulative_sum is 2. \n\nSecond file (size 2):\n\nfor x=1:\n\ncurrent is 50. total is (2+1)*100/4= 300/4=75 → 75. Not equal. \n\nx=2: current is 100. total is (4 * 100)/4 = 100. So added. \n\nThus, the result set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[3, 3]. \n\ntotal_size=6. \n\nInitial 0. \n\nFirst file: 3 bytes. \n\nx=1: current is 33. total is 1*100/6=16. Not equal. \n\nx=2: current is 66. total is 2*100/6=33. Not equal. \n\nx=3: current is 100. total is 3*100/6=50. Not equal. \n\ncumulative_sum is 3. \n\nSecond file: 3 bytes. \n\nfor x=1: current is 33. total is (3+1)*100/6 = 400/6=66.666 → 66. Not equal. \n\nx=2: current is 66. total is (3+2)*100/6 = 500/6=83.333 → 83. Not equal. \n\nx=3: current is 100. total is 6*100/6=100. Added. \n\nSo result set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case where during the simulation, the same value appears multiple times. \n\nNow, the code seems to handle all these. \n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead n, then the list a. \n\nCompute total_size = sum(a). \n\nInitialize a set, result = {0}\n\ncumulative_sum = 0\n\nfor each file_size in a:\n\n    for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n        current_percent = (x * 100) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = cumulative_sum + x\n\n        total_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_size\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            add to result\n\n    cumulative_sum += file_size\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list of the elements in the result set. \n\nBut wait, what about the moment when all bytes are copied? For example, the last byte of the last file. That's covered by the code. \n\nNow, implement this in Python. \n\nBut for reading the input, the user provided examples with multiple test cases. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. The user provided examples are multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and print output to stdout. \n\nBut looking back, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nIn the first line, given n. Then in the second line, given the list a. \n\nSo the code should read from stdin. \n\nBut the sample inputs given in the problem are multiple test cases. However, the actual problem says that the code should process a single test case. \n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nIn the first line given n, then in the second line given the list a. \n\nSo the code should read one test case. \n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases. However, the problem's sample input is probably showing multiple examples, but the actual code should read one input. \n\nSo for example, the first sample input is:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nWhich outputs 0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100. \n\nBut the user's sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the code is supposed to process a single test case. \n\nThus, the code should read n from stdin, then the list a. \n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n from input. \n\nThen read the next line, split into integers. \n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen process as above. \n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplementing the code. \n\nBut for the code, we need to collect all the values. \n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, a. \n\ntotal_size = sum(a)\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\ncumulative_sum = 0\n\nfor file_size in a:\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (x * 100) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = cumulative_sum + x\n\n        total_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_size\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\n    cumulative_sum += file_size\n\nThen, collect the sorted list of the result. \n\nBut wait, the initial 0 is added. Then, during the simulation, for each x, the code checks if current and total are equal, and adds the value. \n\nOnce done, the code sorts the elements of the set and prints them separated by newlines. \n\nBut in the sample outputs, the first sample output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is the sorted list of the set. \n\nSo, after collecting the result, we need to sort the elements and print each on a separate line. \n\nSo, in code:\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor val in sorted_result:\n\n    print(val)\n\nBut what about when the result set is empty? Well, since 0 is added, it's not possible. \n\nTesting the code with the first sample input. \n\nNow, possible edge case: when a file has size 0? But the problem says that a_i >= 1. \n\nAnother edge case: when total_size is 1. \n\nSo, for example, n=1, a=[1]. \n\nThe code adds 0, then processes x=1. \n\ncurrent_percent = 100*1//1 = 100. \n\ntotal_bytes = 0+1 = 1. \n\ntotal_percent = 1*100//1 = 100. \n\nSo 100 is added. \n\nSo the result is [0, 100]. \n\nAnother edge case: when during the simulation, the same value is added multiple times, but the set takes care of uniqueness. \n\nThus, the code seems correct. \n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that in Python, when reading from stdin, sometimes there may be issues with leading or trailing spaces, but the code uses split() which handles that. \n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then a. \n\nThen proceed. \n\nSo the full code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total_size = sum(a)\n    result = {0}\n    cumulative_sum = 0\n    for file_size in a:\n        for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n            current_percent = (x * 100) // file_size\n            total_bytes = cumulative_sum + x\n            total_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_size\n            if current_percent == total_percent:\n                result.add(current_percent)\n        cumulative_sum += file_size\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for val in sorted_result:\n        print(val)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut let's test against the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nWhich should output 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. \n\nAs discussed earlier, during the processing of the second file, the code adds those numbers. \n\nAnother sample input is the third example:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998\n\nOutput is 0, 50, 99, 100. \n\nLet me think. \n\nTotal size is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002. \n\nLet me think about the moments when both percentages are equal. \n\nInitially 0. \n\nDuring the first file (size 1000). \n\nFor x from 1 to 1000:\n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100) // 1000 = floor(x/10). \n\ntotal_percent is (x * 100) // 2002. \n\nSo when is floor(x/10) equal to floor( (x * 100) / 2002 ) ?\n\nFor example, when x is 1000:\n\ncurrent_percent is 1000*100//1000 = 100. \n\ntotal_percent is (1000 * 100) // 2002 = 100000//2002 = 49.95... → 49. \n\nNot equal. \n\nSo during the first file, there may be no matches except possibly some. \n\nBut during the simulation, perhaps no values are added except for the initial 0. \n\nThen, after the first file is processed, cumulative_sum is 1000. \n\nThen, second file is 2 bytes. \n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent is 50. \n\ntotal_bytes is 1000+1=1001. \n\ntotal_percent is (1001 * 100) // 2002 = 100100 // 2002 = 50. \n\nSo 50 == 50. So added. \n\nFor x=2:\n\ncurrent_percent is 100. \n\ntotal_bytes is 1002. \n\ntotal_percent is (1002 * 100) // 2002 = 100200 // 2002 = 50.09... → 50. \n\nSo current is 100, total is 50 → not equal. \n\nSo during the second file, 50 is added. \n\nThen, cumulative_sum is 1000 + 2 = 1002. \n\nThird file is 2 bytes. \n\nx=1: current is 50. \n\ntotal_bytes is 1002 +1 = 1003. \n\ntotal_percent is 1003 * 100 / 2002 = 100300 / 2002 = 50.1... → 50. \n\nSo 50 == 50. So added. \n\nx=2: current is 100. total is 1004 * 100 / 2002 = 100400 / 2002 = 50.149... → 50. So current is 100 != 50. \n\nSo during third file, 50 is added again. \n\nThen, cumulative_sum is 1002 + 2 = 1004. \n\nFourth file is 998 bytes. \n\nFor x from 1 to 998. \n\nLet me think about when current_percent equals total_percent. \n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100) // 998. \n\ntotal_bytes is 1004 + x. \n\ntotal_percent is ( (1004 + x) * 100 ) // 2002. \n\nWe need to find x where these are equal. \n\nLet me compute for x= 998: \n\ncurrent_percent = (998 * 100) // 998 = 100. \n\ntotal_bytes = 1004 + 998 = 2002. \n\ntotal_percent = (2002 * 100) // 2002 = 100. So added. \n\nWhat about x= 997:\n\ncurrent is (997 * 100) // 998 = 99700 // 998 = let's compute 998 * 100 = 99800. So 997",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the file copying process. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are rounded down to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Total Size Calculation**: Compute the total size of all files combined.\n3. **Progress Tracking**: Track the cumulative bytes copied as we iterate through each file and each byte within the file.\n4. **Percentage Calculation**: For each byte copied, compute both the current file's progress and the overall progress.\n5. **Set of Valid Percentages**: Use a set to collect all valid percentages where both progress bars show the same value.\n6. **Output**: Sort the collected values and print them in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total_size = sum(a)\n    result = {0}\n    cumulative_sum = 0\n    for file_size in a:\n        for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n            current_percent = (x * 100) // file_size\n            total_bytes = cumulative_sum + x\n            total_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_size\n            if current_percent == total_percent:\n                result.add(current_percent)\n        cumulative_sum += file_size\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for val in sorted_result:\n        print(val)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line gives the number of files, and the second line provides the sizes of these files.\n2. **Total Size Calculation**: The total size of all files is calculated once to determine the overall progress.\n3. **Cumulative Sum Tracking**: As we iterate through each file and each byte within the file, we maintain a cumulative sum of bytes copied to compute the overall progress.\n4. **Percentage Calculation**: For each byte copied, the current file's progress and the overall progress are computed using integer division to ensure they are floored to the nearest integer.\n5. **Set Collection**: A set is used to collect all unique percentages where both progress bars match, ensuring no duplicates.\n6. **Sorting and Output**: The collected percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order to meet the problem requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the copying process and checks for matching progress percentages, ensuring correctness and optimal performance given the constraints.",
