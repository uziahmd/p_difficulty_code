There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced bracket. But here, the structure is different because of the rule. The problem says that the organizers arrange the grid in a way that maximizes the winner's games, under that rule.\n\nWait, the question is to find the maximum possible number of games the winner can have. So, how do we model this?\n\nLet me look at the examples:\n\nFor n=2, the answer is 1. That's straightforward, just one game.\n\nn=3: output is 2. How? The winner plays two games. Let's see: first, maybe player 1 plays against 2 (game 1). Then, player 1 plays against 3 (game 2). But according to the rule, when they play the second game, the player 1 has already played 1 game, and player 3 has played 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because in a normal knockout, you need 3 games for the winner (since it's 4 players, 3 rounds). But according to the example, the answer is 2. Oh, because the rule restricts the arrangement. So in the example, the optimal way is to have two rounds. For example, first two games: (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4). Then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner has played two games. So the maximum is 2. So the rule here prevents the winner from playing more than two games. \n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play, given that the tournament is arranged optimally under the rule.\n\nHow to model this? Let's think recursively. Let's say the maximum number of games is f(n). We need to find f(n).\n\nLet's think about the structure. For the winner to play as many games as possible, each time he plays a game, he must face an opponent who has played either the same number of games or one less. \n\nLet's imagine that the winner plays k games. Then, in each of those games, he must have faced opponents that have a certain number of games. For example, in the first game, the opponent has 0 games. Then, after winning, the winner has 1 game. For the next game, the opponent can have either 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the opponent has 1 game. So each time, the winner's opponent is someone who has played as many games as possible.\n\nThis seems similar to building a binary tree where each node represents a game. But perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, think about the minimum number of players required for the winner to have k games. Let's denote this as m(k). Then, for the winner to play k games, he must have defeated k opponents. Each time he plays a game, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let's think recursively.\n\nFor the first game, the opponent has 0 games. So the winner plays once. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. To maximize the total, the opponent would have played 1 game. Which means that opponent had to have played a game before. So for the second game, the opponent's path requires that he had a game. So the total number of players needed for the winner to have 2 games would be 1 (the winner) + 1 (opponent in first game) + 1 (opponent in second game) + ... but maybe that's not the right way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a Fibonacci-like sequence. Because for the winner to have k games, he must have played against someone who has played k-1 games, and that person must have come from a subtree where they had k-1 games. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nLet me think of the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games. Let's call this m(k). \n\nFor k=1, the winner needs to play once. So m(1) = 2 (two players).\n\nFor k=2, the winner must play two games. For the first game, he plays against someone (needs 1 player). For the second game, he",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. This is because each time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less. This structure leads to a recursive relationship where the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n1. **Recursive Insight**: Let `f(k)` represent the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games. The recurrence relation is:\n   - `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)`\n   - This is because for the winner to play `k` games, they must face an opponent who has played `k-1` games and another opponent who has played `k-2` games.\n\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - `f(0) = 1` (one player, no games)\n   - `f(1) = 2` (two players, one game)\n\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We iteratively compute the values of `f(k)` until we exceed the given number of players `n`. The maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # We need to find the maximum k such that f(k) <= n\n    # f(k) is similar to Fibonacci numbers\n    # Initialize the sequence\n    a, b = 1, 2  # f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2\n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        if b > n:\n            break\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n`, representing the number of players.\n- **Base Case Handling**: If there's only one player, the output is 0 since no games are played.\n- **Fibonacci-like Sequence**: We use two variables `a` and `b` to simulate the Fibonacci sequence, starting from `f(0) = 1` and `f(1) = 2`.\n- **Loop Until Exceeding n**: We incrementally calculate the next value in the sequence until it exceeds `n`. The maximum number of games `k` is tracked during this process.\n- **Output Result**: The result is printed as the maximum number of games the winner can play, which is `k - 1` when the loop exits.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using an iterative method with constant space complexity, ensuring it handles very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$ efficiently.",
