His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores of all participants, but not their names. The challenge is to determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have, considering that when there are ties, the jury can assign the positions in any way.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the best possible rank for Vasya is when he has the maximum possible total points, and others are arranged to give him the highest possible position. Wait, no. Wait, the best rank is when he is as high as possible. So to find the best possible rank, we need to maximize his total (so that he's higher than others), but since his total is at least x, but he can have a higher value. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. But the actual total could be higher. However, the problem is to find the best and worst possible positions given that his total is at least x. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the actual total could be anything >=x. However, when considering the best and worst possible positions, we need to choose the best scenario for Vasya (so that he gets the highest possible rank) and the worst scenario (so that he gets the lowest possible rank).\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nFor the best possible rank: We want to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible, but at least x. Then, arrange the other participants' totals so that as many as possible are worse than Vasya's total. Wait, but since the other participants' a and b are fixed, but their pairing is arbitrary. Because the problem says that the teacher has the first and second tour results, but they are given in arbitrary order. So each participant's first tour score is a_i, and second tour is b_j, but the pairing between a_i and b_j is not known. So the actual total for each participant is a_i + b_j, but the pairing is arbitrary. But the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya, considering that there exists some pairing of a's and b's where Vasya's total is at least x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the actual data is that the teacher has the list of first tour scores and the list of second tour scores. But the pairing between a_i and b_j is not known. So, the teacher needs to consider all possible pairings of the a's and b's (i.e., all possible permutations of the b array, since each participant has one a and one b). And for each possible pairing, check if there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is at least x. But since it's guaranteed that there is at least one such pairing, we need to find for all possible pairings (possible assignments of a's and b's to participants) where Vasya's total is at least x, what is the best and worst possible rank he could have.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because for the best possible rank, we can choose the pairing that gives Vasya the highest possible total (so that he's as high as possible) and arrange others to be as low as possible. For the worst possible rank, we choose the pairing that gives Vasya the minimal possible total (but still at least x), and arrange others to be as high as possible.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have. So the best possible rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are arranged to be as low as possible. The worst possible rank is when Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and others are arranged to be as high as possible.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nLet me think again. The key is that for the best possible rank, we can choose the pairing of a and b such that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and then compute the best possible rank. For the worst possible rank, we choose the pairing where Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others are arranged to be as high as possible.\n\nBut how to find these pairings?\n\nAlternatively, the problem is that the pairing between a_i and b_j is arbitrary. So, for the best possible rank, we can select for Vasya the maximum possible a_i + b_j",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves considering all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to find optimal scenarios for Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank for Vasya, we need to maximize his total score. This can be done by pairing the highest possible scores from the first and second tours. Once we have the maximum possible score for Vasya, we count how many participants can have a higher or equal score than him.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank for Vasya, we need to minimize his total score while ensuring it is at least the given minimum value `x`. This involves pairing the lowest possible scores from the first and second tours that still meet the minimum requirement. Then, we count how many participants can have a higher score than him.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort a and b\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Best place: maximize Vasya's score\n    max_vasya = 0\n    i = n - 1\n    j = n - 1\n    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\n        current = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j]\n        if current >= x:\n            max_vasya = current\n            break\n        else:\n            if a_sorted[i] > b_sorted[j]:\n                i -= 1\n            else:\n                j -= 1\n    # Now, count how many participants can have sum >= max_vasya\n    # For best place, we want the minimal count of people with sum >= max_vasya\n    # But since we can arrange others to be as low as possible, the best place is 1\n    # Wait no, the best place is when Vasya's score is as high as possible, then count how many have higher or equal\n    # But since the pairing is arbitrary, for best case, we can have Vasya's score as max possible, and others' sum can be arranged to be as low as possible\n    # So the best place is 1, because he can be the top if his score is the maximum\n    # However, there might be others with same score.

Since the jury can assign positions in case of ties, the best possible rank is always 1.\n- **Worst Place Calculation**: We minimize Vasya's score while ensuring it meets the minimum threshold `x`. We then count how many participants can have a higher score than this minimum, which gives us the worst possible rank for Vasya. This is done efficiently using binary search to count valid pairs.",
