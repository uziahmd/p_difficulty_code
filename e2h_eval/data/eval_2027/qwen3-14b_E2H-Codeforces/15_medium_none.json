They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can be the champion given the tournament structure and the string s that dictates the rules for each phase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the tournament works. So there are 2^n teams. Each phase halves the number of teams. For each phase, depending on whether s[i] is 0 or 1, the matches are decided by lower or higher skill level. The key is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is given, but here we have to find x such that there exists some p (permutation) where x is the champion. Oh right, because the problem says \"find all x that are winning\", meaning there exists at least one permutation p where x wins the tournament.\n\nBut how do we model this? Since the permutation p is arbitrary except that it's a permutation of 1 to 2^n, but the tournament structure depends on the rules in each phase.\n\nThe challenge is to find all possible x that can be champions under some permutation p. So, for each x, can we construct a permutation where x wins?\n\nBut how to model the tournament steps. Let's think recursively. For example, in each phase, the way the matches are decided depends on the phase. For instance, in phase i (starting from 0?), the matches are decided by lower or higher skill.\n\nLet me think about the tournament structure. The tournament is a binary tree. Each round reduces the number of teams by half. For example, for n=3, there are 8 teams. The first phase (phase 1) has 4 games, then phase 2 has 2 games, phase 3 has 1 game.\n\nEach phase corresponds to a level in the tree. The rules for each phase determine how the matches are decided. For example, during phase i, when two teams meet, the winner is the one with higher or lower skill, based on s[i-1] (assuming phases are 1-based or 0-based? Let me check the input example.)\n\nIn the sample input, for example, the first case is n=3 and s is '101'. So the phases are:\n\nPhase 1 (i=1): s[0] is '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nPhase 2 (i=2): s[1] is '0' → lower skill wins.\n\nPhase 3 (i=3): s[2] is '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nSo the tournament has three phases. Each phase corresponds to the level of the tree.\n\nNow, for a given x, how can we determine if it's possible for x to be the champion? Well, perhaps we can model the possible ranges of values that can reach the final, considering the rules in each phase.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a binary tree where each node represents a group of teams that must be in a certain bracket. For x to be the champion, it must win all the matches in each phase, according to the rules of that phase.\n\nBut how to model the possible positions of x in the tournament. Since the permutation p is arbitrary, we can arrange the teams in such a way that x can win through each phase.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the tournament as a series of rounds. In each round, the teams are grouped into pairs, and the winner proceeds. The rules for each round are determined by the corresponding character in s.\n\nFor x to be the champion, in each round, it must be that x is the winner of its match in that round, according to the rule for that round.\n\nBut how do we model the possible opponents x could face in each round, given that the permutation can be arranged optimally?\n\nAn idea is that for each round, x must be able to be the winner of its match, given that the other teams in its path are chosen such that they are either higher or lower than x, depending on the rule.\n\nLet me think of it as building a set of possible candidates for x to be the champion. For example, in the first round (phase 1), the rule is determined by s[0]. Suppose s[0] is 1 (higher skill wins). Then, in order for x to win this round, it must be that in its initial match, it's paired with a team with lower skill. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose that x is in a pair where the other team has lower skill. However, for the next rounds, the opponents depend on the previous rounds' winners.\n\nBut since the permutation can be arranged, perhaps we can model the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have in each round.\n\nWait, here's an approach inspired by the concept of \"possible ranges\" for x. For each round, we can determine the range of possible values that x must be in order to win that round, given the rules of that round and the previous rounds.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that in the first round (phase 1), the rule is s[0]. For x to win this round, depending on the rule, it must be either the maximum or the minimum in its pair. Then, in the next phase, it's part of a group of 2^{n-1} teams, and again, the rule applies for that phase. So, for each phase, we can model the constraints on x's value relative to the other teams in its path.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe using intervals. For example, for each round, we can track the minimum and maximum value that x must have in order to proceed through that round.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For x to be the champion, during each phase i (from 1 to n), x must be the winner of its match in that phase. Let's think of the tournament as a series of layers. For each layer, the way the match is decided depends on the s[i-1] (assuming phases are numbered from 1 to n).\n\nLet me take an example. Let's say n=1. Then there are 2 teams. The string s is length 1. If s is '1', then the higher skill wins. So the winning x is 2. If s is '0', then the lower skill wins, so x is 1.\n\nAnother example from the input: for n=2, s is '01'. Output is 2 3. Let's see why. Let's think of the tournament structure. There are 4 teams. Phase 1 (s[0] is 0, lower skill wins), so in the first round, each pair is decided by lower skill. Then phase 2 (s[1] is 1, higher skill wins).\n\nSo for x to be the champion, it must first win in phase 1, then in phase 2.\n\nSuppose x is 2. How can it be the champion? Let's arrange the permutation so that in the first phase, 2 is in a pair with a higher skill. Since phase 1 uses lower skill wins, 2 would win if it's paired with someone higher. For example, suppose in the first round, 2 vs 3. Then 2 is lower than 3, so 2 wins. Then, in phase 2, the other winner is the one from the other pair. Let's say the other pair is 1 vs 4. Since phase 1 is lower skill, 1 would win. Then phase 2 is higher skill. The two winners are 2 and 1. 2 is higher, so 2 wins. So yes, 2 can be champion.\n\nSimilarly for 3. Let's see. In phase 1, 3 must be in a pair where it is the lower skill. Wait, no: phase 1 is lower skill wins. So in the first round, the winner is the lower of the two. So for 3 to win in phase 1, it must be paired with someone higher. For example, 3 vs 4. Then 3 is lower, so it wins. Then in phase 2, the other winner is from the first pair. Let's say the first pair is 1 vs 2. 1 wins. Then phase 2 is between 1 and 3. Since phase 2 is higher skill, 3 wins. So yes, 3 is possible.\n\nSo the output is 2 and 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the idea is that for each phase, x must be able to be the winner of its match. But how to model the possible ranges of x's value.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the number of teams is halved. The first round (phase 1) has 2^{n-1} matches. The second round (phase 2) has 2^{n-2} matches, etc.\n\nLet me think of the process for x to reach the final. For each round, the x must be the winner of its match. For that, depending on the rule of the round, x must be the minimum or maximum in its current group of 2 teams.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can model the possible ranges that x can have in each round. For example, in the first round, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the minimum of its pair. So, in that pair, there's another team with higher value. But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange that. However, in the next rounds, x will be matched against another winner, which depends on the previous rounds.\n\nBut how to model this? Perhaps we can model the possible range of x's value such that, for each round, it can be the minimum or maximum required by the rule of that round.\n\nLet me think of it in terms of possible ranges. For example, in the first round (phase 1), the rule is s[0]. Let's say it's '0' (lower wins). Then, in order for x to win this round, it must be the minimum in its pair. Therefore, in this pair, there is another team with higher value. However, since the permutation can be arranged, we can choose that the other team is any higher value. But for x to proceed to the next round, the other teams in the same bracket must be arranged in such a way that x can proceed through all the rounds.\n\nWait, but the next rounds depend on the previous rounds. For example, in the second round (phase 2), the rule is s[1], and x is competing against another winner from the first round. How do we ensure that x can win that match?\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe we can model for each round, the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have, given the rules up to that round.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the possible range of values that x must be in order to be able to win all the rounds. For example, starting from the last round (the final) and working backwards.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. The champion must win all the matches. For each match in the tournament, depending on the phase, the winner is determined by the rule. Let's think recursively about the possible values of x in each subtree.\n\nFor example, in the final round (phase n), there are two teams. The rule for this phase is s[n-1]. For x to win this match, it must be either higher or lower than the other team, depending on the rule. Since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the other team to be either higher or lower than x, as needed. However, the other team must be the winner of their own subtree.\n\nBut how to model this for all phases.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for x to be the champion, during each phase i (from 1 to n), x must be the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^{i} teams (depending on the rule of that phase). Wait, maybe not exactly. Because each phase is a round where the teams are grouped into pairs. So, for example, in phase 1, each team is in a pair. To win phase 1, x must be the min or max of its pair. Then, in phase 2, x is in a pair with another team that won their phase 1 match. For x to win phase 2, it must be the min or max of that pair. And so on, until phase n.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be that in each phase, it is the min or max of the group of teams that it is in during that phase. But the group during phase i is determined by the previous phases.\n\nBut since the permutation can be arranged, we can arrange the teams such that x is in the correct position to be the min or max in each phase.\n\nSo, perhaps for each phase, we can determine the constraints on x's value. Let's think of it as follows:\n\nLet’s imagine that during phase i (there are n phases), the rule is s[i-1]. For x to proceed through phase i, it must be either the minimum or maximum of the group of 2^{n - i + 1} teams that it is part of during that phase. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nEach phase reduces the number of teams by half. For example, phase 1 starts with 2^n teams, phase 2 with 2^{n-1}, etc. So during phase i, there are 2^{n - i + 1} teams. Wait, no. The number of teams in phase i is 2^{n - i + 1}? Let's see for n=3, phase 1: 2^3 = 8 teams. Then phase 2 has 4, phase 3 has 2. So phase i has 2^{n - i + 1} teams? For i=1: 2^{3 - 1 + 1} = 2^3 = 8. Yes. For i=2, 2^{3 -2 +1} = 2^2 = 4. For i=3, 2^{3-3+1} = 2^1 = 2. So yes.\n\nBut during phase i, the teams are grouped into pairs. So, for each phase, the group of teams that x is part of during that phase is a group of 2^{n - i + 1} teams. For x to win this phase's match, it must be the min or max of its pair. However, the pair depends on the grouping in that phase.\n\nBut how to model the possible values of x. Here's an idea: For each phase i, the x must be the min or max in a group of size 2^{n - i + 1} teams. However, since the grouping is arbitrary (as we can arrange the permutation), we can model the constraints on x's value based on the rules of the phases.\n\nWait, but for x to be able to win all phases, during phase i, the rule is s[i-1], so x must be either the min or max of its pair in that phase. However, the pair is determined by the previous phases. For example, in phase 1, x is in a pair with one other team. In phase 2, x is in a pair with another team who also won their phase 1 match. So, for x to win phase 2, it must be the min or max of the pair of two teams (x and another team that has survived phase 1).\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can model the possible ranges of x that would allow it to be the min or max in each phase's pair, given the rules.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming or interval merging.\n\nLet me think of the process in reverse. Let's start from the last phase (phase n) and work our way back to phase 1.\n\nIn phase n, there are 2 teams. The rule is s[n-1]. For x to win this phase, it must be the min or max of the two teams. Since we can arrange the permutation, the other team can be any value. But for x to be the champion, the other team must have been eliminated in the previous phases. However, since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps the constraints for x in phase n are that it must be either the min or max of the two teams. But how does that affect x's possible value?\n\nWait, but the other team in phase n is the winner of the other half of the tournament. So for x to be the champion, during phase n, the other team must be such that x is the winner according to the rule.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps for phase n, the other team can be chosen to be either higher or lower than x. However, the other team must be the winner of their own path, which depends on the rules of previous phases.\n\nSo perhaps, for each phase, we can model the possible range of values that x must have in order to proceed through that phase, given the rules up to that phase.\n\nLet me try to model this with intervals. For example, during the final phase (phase n), the x must be either the min or max of two teams. So, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than the other team. But since we can arrange the other team to be any value, as long as it's possible to have such a team in the other half of the tournament. However, the other team must have been able to reach the final, which depends on their own path.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nLet's define for each round i (from 1 to n), the minimal and maximal possible value that x must have to reach the final. For example, during phase i, the rule determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^{n - i + 1} teams.\n\nWait, but in each phase, the group is split into pairs. So during phase i, x is part of a group of 2^{n - i + 1} teams. To proceed to phase i+1, x must be the min or max of its pair in phase i.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, perhaps the constraints on x can be modeled as follows:\n\nFor each phase i, the rule is s[i-1]. Let's say that during phase i, the rule is '0' (lower skill wins). Then, in order for x to proceed, x must be the minimum in its pair. Therefore, in that pair, there's another team that is higher than x. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose that other team to be any value higher than x. However, for x to proceed to the next phase, that other team must have been eliminated in phase i, which is already handled.\n\nBut how does this affect the possible range of x's value?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For x to be the champion, during phase i, it must be the min or max of its pair (depending on the rule). The other team in the pair must be such that they can be eliminated in that phase. But since we can choose the permutation, the other team can be any value that satisfies the condition for that phase.\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a set of constraints on x. For example, during phase 1, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the minimum of its pair. Therefore, there must be at least one team with a higher value than x. But since the permutation is arbitrary, this is always possible unless x is the maximum possible value. Wait, but if x is the maximum value, then there's no higher value, so it can't be the minimum. So in this case, x cannot be the maximum value. So for phase 1 with rule 0, x must be less than some value, which implies that x can't be the maximum value. But since we can arrange the permutation, the other team can be any value higher than x.\n\nBut for x to be able to proceed through all phases, we need to ensure that in each phase, the rule allows x to be the winner of its pair. So, for each phase, the rule imposes a constraint on x's value relative to the other teams in that phase.\n\nBut how to model these constraints across all phases.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: For x to be the champion, during each phase i, x must be the min or max of the group of teams in that phase. However, the group of teams in phase i is determined by the previous phases.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the other teams in each phase to be the ones that allow x to win. So for each phase, the constraints on x's value are:\n\nIf during phase i, the rule is '0' (lower wins), then x must be the minimum in its pair. Therefore, in that pair, there must be a team with higher value than x. However, since we can choose the permutation, this is possible as long as there exists at least one value higher than x. Similarly, if the rule is '1', x must be the maximum in its pair, requiring that there exists at least one value lower than x.\n\nBut this seems too simplistic. Because for the later phases, the other teams that x faces may have their own constraints based on earlier phases.\n\nWait, but perhaps the constraints are cumulative. For example, during phase 1, if the rule is '0', then x must be the minimum in its pair. That requires that there's at least one team with higher value than x. But during phase 2, x is in a pair with another team that has passed phase 1. For x to win phase 2, depending on the rule of phase 2, x must be the min or max of that pair. However, the other team in phase 2 must have passed phase 1, which means that during phase 1, they were either the min or max of their pair, depending on the rule of phase 1.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps the other teams can be chosen to have values that allow x to proceed through all phases.\n\nThis suggests that the constraints on x are determined by the rules of each phase, and for each phase, x must be either the minimum or maximum in the group of teams that it is part of during that phase. However, since the groups are built recursively, perhaps we can model the possible ranges of x as follows:\n\nLet’s define for each phase i (starting from the last phase and moving backward), the possible range of values that x can have. For example, in phase n (the final), x must be the min or max of two teams. Depending on the rule, this imposes that x is either the minimum or maximum of the two. Since we can choose the other team, this doesn't impose any constraints on x's value except that there must be at least one other team. But since the total number of teams is 2^n, and x is one of them, there are others.\n\nBut this line of thinking isn't leading me anywhere. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can model the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the x must be able to be the winner of that round's match. The key is to find for each x, whether there exists a way to arrange the other teams such that x can win all rounds.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that during phase i, the rule is r (0 or 1). To win this phase, x must be the min or max of its pair. Let's assume that in the previous rounds, x has successfully won all matches up to this point. Now, during phase i, x is in a pair with another team y. Depending on r, x must be the min or max of x and y.\n\nBut since we can choose the permutation, we can choose y to be any value that satisfies the condition. However, y must also have been able to reach this phase, which depends on the rules of the previous phases.\n\nBut how can we model this? For example, during phase i, the other team y must have passed all previous phases. So for y to have reached phase i, it must have been the winner of each previous phase's match.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose y to be any value that can reach phase i under the rules. So for x to win phase i, we can choose y to be any value that allows x to win the match, and that y can reach phase i.\n\nBut how to find the possible values for x.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, for each phase, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have, based on the rules of that phase and the previous phases.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model for each round i (from 1 to n), the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have to survive up to that round. Starting from the first round and moving forward.\n\nLet me try this for the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: n=3, s='101'\n\nPhases:\n\nPhase 1 (rule '1' - higher wins)\n\nPhase 2 (rule '0' - lower wins)\n\nPhase 3 (rule '1' - higher wins)\n\nLet's think about what constraints this places on x.\n\nFor x to win phase 1: since the rule is higher wins, x must be the higher of the two in its pair. So in this pair, there's a team with lower value. So x can be any value except the minimum possible (since there's always someone lower than it, unless x is 1). Wait, but since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the other team to be lower than x. So for x to be able to pass phase 1, it must be possible to have a team lower than x. Which is possible for x >= 2.\n\nBut wait, if x is 1, then there's no team lower than it, so it can't win phase 1 (since the rule is higher wins). Therefore, x must be at least 2.\n\nThen, for phase 2, the rule is lower wins. So during phase 2, x is in a pair with another team that passed phase 1. For x to win this phase, it must be the lower of the two. So x must be less than the other team. But the other team must have passed phase 1, which required it to be higher than its opponent in phase 1.\n\nBut since we can choose the other team, perhaps we can arrange that the other team is higher than x, and that it passed phase 1. For example, the other team could be any value higher than x, and in phase 1, it was paired with a team lower than itself, allowing it to pass.\n\nSo, for x to pass phase 2, it must be possible to have another team higher than x. Which requires that x is not the maximum possible value. For example, x can be up to 2^3 - 1 - 1 = 7-1=6? Or something like that.\n\nThen, for phase 3, the rule is higher wins. x must be higher than the other team in the final. So the other team must be lower than x. But the other team must have passed phase 2. Which requires that it was lower than its opponent in phase 2, and passed phase 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, x must satisfy:\n\nIn phase 1: x >= 2 (so there's someone lower)\n\nIn phase 2: x must be less than the other team (so x can be up to 6, since there's someone higher)\n\nIn phase 3: x must be higher than the other team (so x must be at least ... ? Well, the other team must have passed phase 2. Let's think about what's the minimal value that the other team can have.\n\nThe other team in phase 3 must have passed phase 2 and phase 1. Let's think of how that team could have passed.\n\nFor example, during phase 1 (rule higher wins), the team must have been the higher in its pair. So it's value must be higher than its phase 1 opponent. Then during phase 2 (rule lower wins), it must have been the lower of its pair. So during phase 2, it must be lower than its opponent. So that team's value must be lower than its phase 2 opponent, but higher than its phase 1 opponent.\n\nBut since we can choose the other team's value, we can choose it to be any value that satisfies these conditions.\n\nSo for x to be able to beat this team in phase 3 (higher wins), x must be higher than this other team. Therefore, x must be higher than the other team's value.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible value of the other team? Well, the other team must have passed phase 2, which requires that during phase 2, it was the lower of its pair. So during phase 2, the other team's value must be less than its opponent. But that opponent could be any value higher than it.\n\nSo, for the other team in phase 3 to be as high as possible, it can be as high as possible as long as it can pass phase 2. Let's think: the other team's value must be lower than its phase 2 opponent. But during phase 2, the rule is lower wins. So during phase 2, the other team must be the lower of its pair. So its value is less than its opponent. However, during phase 1, the other team must have been the higher of its pair (since phase 1 rule is higher wins).\n\nSo for the other team's value, let's say it's y. Then during phase 1, y must be higher than some value. During phase 2, y must be lower than some other value. So y can be any value between 2 and 2^3 - 1 - 1 = 6 (since there must be someone higher than it in phase 2 and someone lower than it in phase 1).\n\nBut since we can choose the other team's value to be anything that satisfies these conditions, for x to beat it in phase 3, x must be higher than the maximum possible value of this other team. But what is the maximum possible value of this other team?\n\nWell, during phase 2, the other team (y) must be lower than its opponent. Let's assume that the opponent in phase 2 is as high as possible. So for y to be as high as possible, it can be 6. Because if y is 6, then during phase 2, it needs to be paired with someone higher, like 7. Then during phase 1, y must have been the higher of its pair. For example, during phase 1, y could have been paired with someone lower than it, like 5. Then during phase 1, y wins, and during phase 2, it loses to 7. But then, in phase 3, x must be higher than y. So x must be higher than 6, which is 7.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the output for the first case is 4 5 6 7. So 7 is included. So according to this, x can be 7.\n\nBut according to the earlier analysis, x must be higher than 6. So x can be 7.\n\nBut then why are 4, 5, 6 also allowed? Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps my earlier reasoning is incorrect. Let's re-examine.\n\nThe key is that the other team in phase 3 can be any value that can reach phase 3. For x to be able to beat it, x must be higher than that value. But the other team can be as low as possible, allowing x to be as low as possible.\n\nSo, for example, if the other team is 1, then x can be 2. But the other team must have passed phase 1 and 2. How can the other team be 1?\n\nDuring phase 1, the rule is higher wins. For the other team (y=1) to pass phase 1, it must be higher than its opponent. But since y is 1, there's no team with lower value. So it can't pass phase 1. Therefore, the other team in phase 3 cannot be 1. Hence, the other team must have a value that can pass both phase 1 and 2.\n\nSo what's the minimal and maximal value that the other team in phase 3 can have?\n\nFor the other team to pass phase 1 (rule higher wins), it must be higher than its phase 1 opponent. For phase 2 (rule lower wins), it must be lower than its phase 2 opponent.\n\nSo during phase 1, the other team (let's call it y) must be higher than some value. During phase 2, it must be lower than some other value. Therefore, y can be any value between 2 and 2^3 - 1 - 1 = 6, but how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Let's say y is 2. How can it pass phase 1 and phase 2?\n\nPhase 1: y=2 must be higher than its opponent. So the opponent is 1. Then y wins.\n\nPhase 2: y=2 must be lower than its opponent. So the opponent could be 3. Then y loses, but that's not possible because in phase 2, the other team must be the one that wins. Wait, no. In phase 2, the other team is the one that wins their match. So for y to reach phase 3, it must win phase 2. So during phase 2, y must be the lower of its pair. So the opponent in phase 2 must have higher value than y.\n\nSo y must be the lower of the pair in phase 2, which means that during phase 2, y wins, and proceeds to phase 3. So for y=2, during phase 2, it is paired with someone higher (say 3), and wins because phase 2 rule is lower wins. Then it proceeds to phase 3.\n\nSo yes, y=2 can reach phase 3.\n\nSo the other team in phase 3 can be as low as 2 (assuming that it passed phase 1 and 2). Therefore, for x to beat this other team in phase 3, x must be higher than 2. So x can be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nBut in the sample input, the answer is 4,5,6,7. Why isn't 3 included?\n\nAh, because there might be other constraints from previous phases. Let me think again.\n\nLet me go back to the first phase. For x to be able to pass phase 1, it must be higher than its opponent. So x must be at least 2.\n\nThen, for phase 2, x must be lower than its opponent. So x must be less than the opponent in phase 2. So the opponent in phase 2 must be higher than x. Let's say x is 3. Then, during phase 2, x must be lower than the opponent, which requires that the opponent is higher than 3. Let's say the opponent is 4. Then x (3) wins phase 2.\n\nThen, in phase 3, x must be higher than the other team. The other team must have passed phase 1 and 2. Let's say the other team is 2 (as discussed earlier). Then x (3) can beat it in phase 3. So why isn't 3 in the sample output?\n\nWait, the sample input for the first case is n=3 and s=101. The output is 4 5 6 7. So according to this, 3 is not a valid x. What's wrong with my reasoning?\n\nAh, I think I missed some constraints. Let me think again.\n\nWhen x is 3, it must pass all phases.\n\nPhase 1: rule is higher wins. So x (3) must be higher than its opponent. Possible.\n\nPhase 2: rule is lower wins. So x (3) must be lower than its opponent. So during phase 2, x is paired with someone higher than 3, say 4. x wins phase 2.\n\nPhase 3: rule is higher wins. So x (3) must be higher than the other team. The other team must have passed phase 1 and 2. Let's say the other team is 2. Then x (3) is higher than 2 and wins.\n\nSo in this case, x=3 should be a valid solution. But according to the sample input, it's not. So why?\n\nWait, the sample input's output is 4 5 6 7. Let me check the sample input again. Oh, the first input is:\n\nInput:\n3\n101\n\nOutput: 4 5 6 7.\n\nHmm. So why is 3 not in the output?\n\nThis suggests that my reasoning is wrong. There must be some other constraint that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think of the tournament structure for n=3 and s=101.\n\nThe tournament has three phases:\n\nPhase 1 (rule 1: higher wins): 4 matches (8 teams → 4 winners).\n\nPhase 2 (rule 0: lower wins): 2 matches (4 → 2).\n\nPhase 3 (rule 1: higher wins): 1 match (2 → 1).\n\nFor x=3 to be the champion, it must win all three phases.\n\nLet me try to construct a permutation where x=3 is the champion.\n\nPhase 1: x=3 must be higher than its opponent. Let's say the opponent is 1. So 3 wins.\n\nPhase 2: x=3 must be lower than its opponent. Let's say the opponent is 4. So 3 wins phase 2.\n\nPhase 3: x=3 must be higher than the other team. The other team must have passed phase 1 and 2. Let's say that team is 2. How did it get there?\n\nPhase 1 for team 2: must have been higher than its opponent. Let's say it was paired with 1. Team 2 wins (since rule is higher wins). Then phase 2: team",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be the champion in a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The solution involves simulating the tournament structure and determining the valid ranges of skill levels that can win under the given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in phases where each phase halves the number of teams. The result of each match in a phase is determined by whether the higher or lower skill level wins, as specified by the input string `s`.\n\n2. **Range Constraints**: For each phase, we determine the range of possible skill levels that a team must have to proceed through that phase. This is done by considering the rules from the input string and working backwards from the final phase to the initial phase.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Intervals**: We use dynamic programming to keep track of the valid ranges of skill levels that can win each phase. Starting from the last phase (final match), we iteratively compute the valid ranges for previous phases based on the current phase's rules.\n\n4. **Combining Ranges**: For each phase, we adjust the valid ranges based on whether the rule is for the higher or lower skill level to win. This helps us determine the minimum and maximum possible values that a team must have to be the champion.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    \n    # Initialize the possible range for the final phase\n    # For the final phase, the range is [1, total_teams]\n    # But we need to work backwards.\n    # We'll keep track of the current possible range for x\n    # Initially, after the last phase, the range is [1, total_teams]\n    # Then for each previous phase, we adjust it based on the rule\n    \n    # Start from the last phase and move backward\n    # The initial range is [1, total_teams]\n    low = 1\n    high = total_teams\n    \n    for i in reversed(range(n)):\n        rule = s[i]\n        # Determine how the current phase affects the range\n        # The current phase is phase (i+1) in the problem description\n        # For example, when i is 0 (last character in s), it's phase n\n        # Each phase has 2^{n - (i+1)} games\n        # The number of teams in this phase is 2^{n - i}\n        # For each step back, the number of teams doubles\n        \n        # For the current phase, we need to find the range of x that can pass this phase\n        # depending on the rule\n        if rule == '1':\n            # Higher skill wins in this phase\n            # To win this phase, x must be the maximum in its pair\n            # So, in the previous phase (before this one), x must be in the upper half\n            # Therefore, the new range is [current_low + 2^i, current_high]\n            # Because in this phase, the winner is the higher, so x must be in the upper half\n            # of the 2^{i+1} teams that were in this phase\n            size = 1 << (i + 1)\n            half = 1 << i\n            # The current range [low, high] represents the possible x values that can reach this phase\n            # To win this phase (higher wins), x must be in the upper half of its group\n            # So, the new low is low + half\n            # The new high remains high\n            low = low + (1 << i)\n        else:\n            # Lower skill wins in this phase\n            # x must be the minimum in its pair\n            # So, x must be in the lower half of its group\n            # new high is high - (1 << i)\n            high = high - (1 << i)\n    \n    # Now, the valid x's are from low to high inclusive\n    result = list(range(low, high + 1))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with the total number of teams, which is $2^n$.\n- **Backward Phase Adjustment**: We iterate from the last phase to the first, adjusting the valid range of skill levels based on the rules of each phase. If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), we adjust the lower bound of the range to ensure the team is in the upper half of the possible values. Conversely, if the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), we adjust the upper bound to ensure the team is in the lower half.\n- **Result Calculation**: After processing all phases, the valid range of skill levels that can be champions is determined and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the valid ranges using dynamic programming principles, ensuring that we consider all constraints imposed by the tournament rules.",
