There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key constraint here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a normal knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced binary tree. But here, the structure isn't fixed. We need to arrange the matches in such a way that the winner plays as many games as possible, following the rule.\n\nLet me look at the examples:\n\nFor n=2, there's only one game. So answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But why is that allowed? Because when the first game is played, the winner has 1 game, and the next opponent (player 3) has 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nFor n=4, the answer is 2. Wait, but normally in a knockout tournament with 4 players, the winner plays 2 games (semifinal and final). But why isn't it possible for the winner to play 3 games? Because maybe the structure isn't allowing that. Let's see the note: if you have 4 players, the optimal is to split into two matches (1 vs 2, 3 vs 4), then the winners play. So the winner plays two games. If you tried to have the winner play three games, that would require that in each round, the opponent has played one less game. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the tournament must be arranged in a way that each match follows the rule. So the maximum number of games the winner can play depends on how the players are structured in the tournament.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each time he plays a game, he must have an opponent who has played either the same number of games or one less. So, for the first game, the opponent has 0 games. Then, after winning, the next game, the opponent could have 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps each time the winner's opponent has played as many games as possible.\n\nWait, maybe this is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for the winner to play k games, each time he needs to have opponents that have played up to k-1 games. Let me think: To get to k games, the winner must have played k-1 games before, and then play another. But for each of those steps, the number of players required might follow a Fibonacci-like pattern.\n\nLet me think of it like this: Let's say f(k) is the minimum number of players needed so that the winner can play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, he must have played k-1 games before. So, for the k-th game, he needs an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the opponent has played k-1 games. But how does that work?\n\nWait, for the winner to play his k-th game, he must have an opponent who has played either k-1, k-2, or k-1 games? Wait, the rule says that two players can play only if the difference in their number of games is at most one. So, when the winner is about to play his k-th game, he has already played k-1 games. His opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. But how can that opponent have played k-1 games? That would require that the opponent has also gone through a series of matches where they had to play k-1 games. But that would mean that the opponent is also a winner of a subtree that requires f(k-1) players. But then, the total number of players required for the winner to play k games would be f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because the winner's path requires that he has to play against someone who has played k-1 games (which requires f(k-1) players) and someone who has played k-2 games (which requires f(k-2) players). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider that for the winner to play k games, he must have played in each round against someone who has played as many games as possible. For example, the first game, he has 0 games, opponent also 0. Then, after winning, he has 1 game. For the second game, the opponent must have 0 or 1 games. If the opponent has",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining the maximum number of games a winner can play in a knockout tournament with the given constraint, we need to understand the structure of the tournament and how players progress through it.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n1. **Knockout Tournament Rule**: Each player is eliminated upon losing a match.\n2. **Constraint on Match Pairing**: Two players can only play if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most 1.\n3. **Goal**: Maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\nThis problem is closely related to the Fibonacci sequence. We define `f(k)` as the minimum number of players required for a winner to be able to play `k` games. The recurrence is:\n\n- `f(0) = 1` (a single player, no games)\n- `f(1) = 2` (two players play one game)\n- `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)` for `k ≥ 2`\n\nThe logic is that:\n- To play the `k`-th game, the winner must have played `k-1` games, and the opponent must have played `k-1` or `k-2` games.\n- This implies that the total number of players needed is the sum of those required for both branches of the match tree.\n\nGiven a number of players `n`, we want the largest `k` such that `f(k) ≤ n`.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Steps**\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci-like sequence up to the point where `f(k)` exceeds `10^18`.\n2. For a given input `n`, find the maximum `k` such that `f(k) ≤ n`.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\ndef max_games_winner(n):\n    # Base cases\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n\n    # Precompute the sequence f(k)\n    fib = [1, 2]  # f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2\n    k = 2\n    while True:\n        next_f = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_f > 10**18:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_f)\n        k += 1\n\n    # Find the maximum k such that fib[k] <= n\n    for i in range(len(fib)-1, -1, -1):\n        if fib[i] <= n:\n            return i\n\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games_winner(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Example Execution**\n\nFor input:\n```\n3\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n2\n```\n\nExplanation: With 3 players, the winner can play a maximum of 2 games.\n\n---\n\n### **Time and Space Complexity**\n\n- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), since the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially.\n- **Space Complexity**: O(log n), for storing the sequence up to the value exceeding `10^18`.\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles the large constraints (`n` up to `10^18`) effectively.",
