    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo the key here is to figure out which subarray to reverse so that when we reverse it, the overall sequence has the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence. But how do I approach this efficiently?\n\nFirst, let's think about the original array. The maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence is obviously the count of 1s plus the count of 2s if they are already in order. But since we can reverse a subarray, maybe we can find a way to merge more 1s and 2s into a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nWait, but for the original array, the longest non-decreasing subsequence can be found by counting the number of 1s and 2s. Because the sequence is non-decreasing if all 1s come before 2s. So the maximum possible length is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s if the array is already sorted. But if there are some 2s followed by 1s, reversing a subarray that contains those could help.\n\nBut the problem allows us to reverse any subarray. So the idea is to find a reversal that will create as many 1s followed by 2s as possible.\n\nLet me think about the optimal scenario. The best case is when the entire array is 1s followed by 2s. Then the length is n. But if that's not possible, maybe we can find a reversal that allows merging some parts.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: [1,2,1,2]. The original longest non-decreasing subsequence is 3 (like 1,2,2). But after reversing [2,3], we get [1,1,2,2], which is fully non-decreasing, so length 4.\n\nSo the question is, how can we find the best subarray to reverse such that the resulting array has as long a non-decreasing subsequence as possible.\n\nBut trying all possible subarrays and checking the result for each is going to be O(n^2) possibilities. For each of these, computing the longest non-decreasing subsequence would be O(n^2) time. For n=2000, that would be O(n^4), which is way too slow. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nWe need a smarter way. Let's think about the structure of the array after reversal. Since the array only has 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. Wait, no. Actually, the maximum length is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s if the array is non-decreasing. But if there are some 2s followed by 1s, then the maximum is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1. Wait, no. The maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1. But perhaps that's not the case. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But after reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which is length 4.\n\nSo the idea is that the optimal reversal should allow us to have as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible.\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's say the original array has x 1s and y 2s. The maximum possible length is x + y = n, but only if the array is already non-decreasing. Otherwise, the maximum is x + y minus some number. But when we reverse a subarray, perhaps we can fix some of these issues.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the original array. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s, but no, that's not right. Wait, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in an array of 1s and 2s is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1. Or maybe the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s. No, that's not correct. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 3 (like 1,2,2). But the count of 1s is 2, count of 2s is 2. So the maximum is 3, which is not equal to either count. So how to compute it?\n\nActually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence for an array of 1s and 2s is equal to the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Which is the same as the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1. Wait, no. Because the longest non-decreasing subsequence can take all the 1s and all the 2s that are after the last 1. So the maximum length is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1. But that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, the maximum length is the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s, but that's also not correct. For example, the array [1,2,1,2] has 2 ones and 2 twos. The maximum length is 3.\n\nWait, but the maximum length of a non-decreasing subsequence in this case is 3. How to calculate it?\n\nAlternatively, the longest non-decreasing subsequence can be found by considering that it's the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s, or the sum of the number of 1s and the number of 2s that are in the correct order. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nBut since the problem allows us to reverse a subarray, perhaps the optimal way is to find the best way to merge some 1s and 2s.\n\nLet me think differently. Since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in a non-decreasing way. Which can be achieved by taking all 1s and all 2s that come after the last 1. So the original array's maximum length is the count of 1s plus the number of 2s after the last occurrence of 1. But maybe that's not the case. For example, if the array is [1,2,2,1], then the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 3 (the first three elements), but the count of 1s is 2 and the number of 2s after the last 1 is zero. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum length is the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s. But again, that's not correct. For example, the array [1,2,1,2] has 2 ones and 2 twos, and the maximum length is 3. So that approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between the number of 1s, the number of 2s, and the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. Wait, but how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum length is the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 comes before a 1. Because each such inversion contributes to a decrease. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight here is that after reversing a subarray, the best possible scenario is to have as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible. So the optimal reversal would be to find a segment where there are some 2s followed by some 1s, and reversing that segment would turn them into 1s followed by 2s, thereby increasing the total length.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in non-decreasing order by reversing a subarray. How can we compute this?\n\nLet's think of the original array. Let's suppose that there are x 1s and y 2s. The maximum possible length is x + y = n if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, the maximum possible is x + y minus the number of inversions that can't be fixed by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother approach: For any subarray that we reverse, the new array will have the original elements except that the reversed subarray is flipped. The longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the new array can be computed based on how the reversed subarray affects the overall sequence.\n\nBut again, checking all possible subarrays is O(n^2) and for each, computing LNDS is O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2000.\n\nBut since the elements are only 1 and 2, maybe we can find a way to compute the maximum LNDS after reversing a subarray efficiently.\n\nLet me think: The LNDS of the array after reversal can be determined by the number of 1s before the reversed subarray, the number of 2s inside the reversed subarray, and the number of 2s after the reversed subarray. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we reverse a subarray from l to r. The original array is a[1..n]. After reversing, the elements from l to r become a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l].\n\nThe LNDS would be the maximum between:\n\n- the LNDS of the original array (without any reversal), but we can't assume that.\n\nBut since the array is made up of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1 in the array. But when we reverse a subarray, perhaps we can find a way to merge some 1s and 2s.\n\nAlternatively, for any reversal of a subarray, the best possible LNDS would be:\n\nnumber of 1s before l, plus the number of 1s in the reversed subarray, plus the number of 2s in the reversed subarray, plus the number of 2s after r. But this is only if the reversed subarray is such that all the 1s in it are before the 2s in it. Because when reversed, the subarray would be reversed, so if the original subarray had some 2s followed by 1s, reversing it would make them 1s followed by 2s.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Suppose the original subarray has some 2s followed by 1s. Reversing it would turn those into 1s followed by 2s, which is good for the LNDS. So, the contribution of that subarray to the LNDS would be the number of 1s and 2s in it, because they are now in non-decreasing order. Also, the elements before and after the reversed subarray must be considered.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS after reversing a subarray [l, r] would be:\n\n(number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in [l, r]) + (number of 2s in [l, r]) + (number of 2s after r) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the elements before l are up to l-1. The elements after r are from r+1 to end. The reversed subarray [l, r] would have all 1s and 2s. But if the elements before l are all 1s, and the reversed subarray starts with 1s and ends with 2s, then the elements after r are 2s. So the entire sequence is non-decreasing.\n\nSo the total length would be:\n\n(number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in [l, r]) + (number of 2s in [l, r]) + (number of 2s after r) ?\n\nBut that's equal to (number of 1s in the entire array) + (number of 2s in the entire array) = n. Which is possible only if the entire array is non-decreasing. So that can't be right. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, because the elements before l may contain 2s. For example, if there are some 2s before l, then the 1s in the reversed subarray may not be able to be added to the count.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the following:\n\nThe LNDS can be composed of:\n\n- All the 1s that are before the reversed subarray, but only if they are followed by 1s or 2s in the reversed subarray.\n\n- The reversed subarray itself, which may contribute some 1s and 2s in non-decreasing order.\n\n- All the 2s that are after the reversed subarray, provided they are >= the last element of the reversed subarray.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n\nthe number of 1s in the entire array plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the array.\n\nSo, the idea is that the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be taken, plus the maximum number of 2s that can be taken after those 1s.\n\nSo, for the original array, the maximum is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but no. Wait, no. For example, [1,2,1,2], the maximum is 3. The count of 1s is 2, count of 2s is 2. So the maximum is 2 + 1 (the number of 2s after the last 1). The last 1 is at position 3, and after that, there's one 2. So 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the maximum possible is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1. Similarly, if there are some 2s followed by 1s, reversing a subarray that contains them could help increase the number of 2s that are after the 1s.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in a non-decreasing way by reversing a subarray. How?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nCompute the original maximum LNDS. Then, for each possible subarray [l, r], compute the maximum possible LNDS after reversing [l, r], and take the maximum among all possibilities.\n\nBut again, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut given that the elements are only 1 and 2, perhaps we can precompute some prefix and suffix arrays.\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor any subarray [l, r], when reversed, the elements in [l, r] will be reversed. Let's consider the effect of this reversal on the LNDS.\n\nThe LNDS can be calculated as:\n\nleft_ones + middle_ones + middle_twos + right_twos.\n\nBut this is only true if the elements before l are all 1s, the reversed subarray is all 1s followed by 2s, and the elements after r are all 2s. However, in reality, the elements before l may have 2s, and the elements after r may have 1s. So how to account for that?\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS after reversing [l, r] can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n1. The number of 1s in the entire array plus the number of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1 in the modified array.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible [l, r]?\n\nAlternatively, think about the reversed subarray as a block. The best scenario is that this block has as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible. So, when you reverse the subarray, if it originally had some 2s followed by 1s, then after reversal, it's 1s followed by 2s. This would contribute to the LNDS.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be merged by reversing a subarray. For example, the number of 1s before l, plus the number of 1s in the reversed subarray, plus the number of 2s in the reversed subarray, plus the number of 2s after r. But this is only if the elements before l are all 1s and the elements after r are all 2s.\n\nBut that's probably not always the case. However, since the LNDS is the maximum possible, perhaps the optimal scenario is to find the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before the 2s in the array.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS after reversing a subarray is the original maximum plus the number of 2s that were before some 1s in the original array, which can be turned into 1s followed by 2s.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's imagine that the best possible LNDS after reversal is the number of 1s in the array plus the number of 2s in the array minus the number of inversions (places where a 2 is before a 1) that can be eliminated by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the array. So, to maximize this, we can find the best way to have as many 2s as possible after the last 1.\n\nSo, the original array may have some 2s before some 1s. If we reverse a subarray that contains these 2s and 1s, we can turn them into 1s followed by 2s, thereby increasing the number of 2s that come after the last 1.\n\nFor example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 1, 2]. The original last 1 is at position 3. After reversing positions 2-3, we get [1,1,2,2]. Now the last 1 is at position 2, and after that are two 2s. So the number of 2s after the last 1 is 2. Adding the number of 1s (2) gives 4.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of 2s that can be placed after the last 1, possibly by reversing a subarray that contains some 2s before 1s.\n\nSo, how can we compute this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Precompute for each position i, the number of 1s up to i (prefix_ones).\n\n2. Precompute for each position i, the number of 2s from i to the end (suffix_twos).\n\nThen, the original maximum is the total_ones + max_suffix_twos, where max_suffix_twos is the maximum number of 2s after the last 1. Wait, but how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that appear after the last occurrence of 1 in the original array.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, we can find the earliest position where all 1s are before that position, and then the 2s after that. But this seems vague.\n\nBut back to the idea of reversing a subarray. The best way to increase the number of 2s after the last 1 is to find a segment where there are some 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s. Then, the last 1 in the entire array would be the last 1 in the reversed segment, and the 2s after that would be the 2s in the reversed segment plus the 2s after the reversed segment.\n\nSo, for each possible subarray [l, r], we can compute how much it contributes to the total.\n\nLet me think: for a subarray [l, r], when reversed, the number of 1s in this subarray is cnt_1, and the number of 2s is cnt_2. The reversed subarray will have all the 1s first, followed by the 2s. So, the contribution of this subarray is cnt_1 + cnt_2.\n\nBut how does this affect the overall count of 1s and 2s after the last 1?\n\nLet me think of the entire array as follows:\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1 in the modified array.\n\nSo, to find this, we can find the last occurrence of 1 in the modified array. Let's say that in the modified array, the last occurrence of 1 is at position x. Then, the number of 2s after x is the total number of 2s in the array minus the number of 2s before or at x.\n\nBut how to compute x?\n\nThe last occurrence of 1 in the modified array could be:\n\n- Either the original last 1, but with some changes due to the reversed subarray.\n\n- Or the last 1 in the reversed subarray.\n\nSo, for each possible subarray [l, r], we can find:\n\n- The number of 1s before l that are not part of the reversed subarray.\n\n- The number of 1s in the reversed subarray.\n\n- The number of 2s in the reversed subarray.\n\n- The number of 2s after r.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, for any reversed subarray [l, r], the last occurrence of 1 in the entire array is the maximum between:\n\n- the last occurrence of 1 in the original array that is before l.\n\n- the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray.\n\n- the last occurrence of 1 in the original array that is after r.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, but since the reversed subarray [l, r] is now in reverse order. So, the original subarray was a[l], a[l+1], ..., a[r]. After reversing, it's a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l].\n\nIn this reversed subarray, the first elements are the original last elements of the subarray, and the last elements are the original first elements.\n\nSo, the reversed subarray may have some 1s and 2s. The last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray (since when reversed, the first occurrence of 1 in the original becomes the last occurrence in the reversed subarray).\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Suppose the original subarray is [2, 1]. When reversed, it becomes [1, 2]. The last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray is at position 1 (index 0 if 0-based). So in the original subarray, the first occurrence of 1 is at position 2 (original index 1). So the reversed subarray has the 1 at the beginning.\n\nSo, the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray. Wait, no. The reversed subarray is [a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]]. So the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray. Because in the reversed subarray, the elements are in reverse order of the original. So the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray is the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray.\n\nSo, the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. Perhaps we can think of the following:\n\nWhen we reverse [l, r], the new array will have the following structure:\n\nelements before l, then the reversed subarray, then elements after r.\n\nThe last occurrence of 1 in the entire array is the maximum between:\n\n- the last occurrence of 1 in the elements before l,\n\n- the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray,\n\n- the last occurrence of 1 in the elements after r.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 2s after this last occurrence of 1 would be the number of 2s in the elements after r that are after the last occurrence of 1 in the elements after r, plus the number of 2s in the reversed subarray that are after the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray, plus the number of 2s in the elements after r.\n\nBut this seems very complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS achievable by reversing a subarray is the original maximum plus the number of 2s that are in some segment before 1s, which can be converted into 1s followed by 2s.\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the modified array. To maximize this, we need to find the best way to arrange the array such that as many 2s as possible are after the last 1.\n\nThe original array may have some 2s before some 1s. For example, consider a segment where there are x 2s followed by y 1s. Reversing this segment would turn it into y 1s followed by x 2s. This increases the number of 2s after the last 1 by x (because those 2s are now after the y 1s). So, for each such segment, the gain is x.\n\nBut how to find the maximum gain?\n\nSo, the idea is to find the maximum number of 2s that are before 1s in the original array. Then, reversing those segments would add those 2s to the count of 2s after the last 1.\n\nBut how to find this maximum gain?\n\nLet me think of the original array. For each position, we can track the number of 2s that are before the current 1. For example, if there is a 1 at position i, and before it there are some 2s, then reversing the segment that contains those 2s and the 1 would move those 2s after the 1.\n\nBut this seems like a lot of possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the maximum number of 2s that are before some 1s. For example, the maximum value of (number of 2s in a prefix) - (number of 1s in that prefix). But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The optimal reversal is to find a segment that contains some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing this segment will turn those 2s into 1s followed by 2s. The more 2s and 1s in this segment, the better.\n\nSo, the maximum gain is the maximum number of 2s in a segment that is followed by 1s.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nLet’s define for each position i, the number of 2s before i that are followed by 1s. Or perhaps, find the maximum number of 2s in a segment that is followed by some 1s.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the original array as consisting of some 1s and 2s. We can find all the positions where a 2 is followed by a 1. For each such pair, reversing a subarray that includes this 2 and the following 1 will turn them into a 1 followed by a 2. This increases the count of 2s after the last 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this to larger segments.\n\nPerhaps, the maximum possible gain is the maximum number of 2s that can be moved to the right of the last 1 by reversing a subarray.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nCompute the original number of 1s (total_ones) and the original number of 2s (total_twos). The original maximum LNDS is total_ones + max_twos_after_last_one.\n\nTo find the maximum possible after reversal, we can find the maximum value of (total_ones + max_twos_after_last_one_modified), where max_twos_after_last_one_modified is the maximum number of 2s after the last 1 in the modified array.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible max_twos_after_last_one_modified.\n\nHow to compute this?\n\nLet me think about the following:\n\nThe last 1 in the modified array can be anywhere. The best scenario is that all 2s are after this last 1.\n\nSo, the maximum possible max_twos_after_last_one_modified is the total_twos, but only if the entire array can be arranged as 1s followed by 2s. Otherwise, it depends on the best possible arrangement.\n\nSo, for the original array, the maximum is total_ones + max_twos_after_last_one_original.\n\nWhen we reverse a subarray, what's the new max_twos_after_last_one?\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nSuppose we reverse a subarray [l, r]. Let's assume that in the original array, this subarray contained some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing it turns them into 1s followed by 2s. This means that the 2s in this subarray are now after the 1s in this subarray. So, if the last 1 in the entire array is now somewhere in this subarray, then the 2s in this subarray and after it are counted as part of the max_twos_after_last_one.\n\nSo, to compute this, we can consider:\n\nThe new last 1 in the entire array is the maximum between:\n\n- the last 1 in the original array that is before l,\n\n- the last 1 in the reversed subarray,\n\n- the last 1 in the original array that is after r.\n\nBut how to calculate this for all possible [l, r]?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive. However, perhaps there's a way to precompute certain values.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute for each position i, the number of 1s up to i (prefix_ones[i]).\n\n2. Compute for each position i, the number of 2s from i to the end (suffix_twos[i]).\n\nThen, for any subarray [l, r], after reversing, the contribution to the max_twos_after_last_one_modified can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe new last 1 in the entire array is the last occurrence of 1 in the entire array after the reversal. Let's call this position x.\n\nThe number of 2s after x is the suffix_twos[x+1].\n\nSo, the total would be prefix_ones[x] + suffix_twos[x+1].\n\nBut how to find x?\n\nAlternatively, for the reversed subarray [l, r], the last 1 in the entire array could be:\n\n- The last 1 in the original array that is before l. Let's call this last_before = last_1_before_l.\n\n- The last 1 in the reversed subarray. Let's call this last_in_reversed.\n\n- The last 1 in the original array that is after r. Let's call this last_after = last_1_after_r.\n\nSo, the new last 1 is the maximum among last_before, last_in_reversed, last_after.\n\nBut how to compute these values?\n\nLet's think about the reversed subarray. The reversed subarray is the original [l, r] reversed. So the last 1 in the reversed subarray is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray. Let me explain:\n\nOriginal subarray: [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r].\n\nReversed subarray: [a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l].\n\nThe first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray is the first 1 in the original subarray. In the reversed subarray, this 1 would be at position (original index - l) in the reversed subarray. Wait, no. The reversed subarray starts with a_r, then a_{r-1}, etc. So the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray would be at position k in the original subarray (l ≤ k ≤ r). In the reversed subarray, this would be at position r - k in the reversed subarray. So the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray would be the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray. Because the reversed subarray is the original reversed, so the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray is the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray.\n\nYes! So, for the reversed subarray, the last occurrence of 1 is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray. Therefore, if the original subarray has any 1s, the last_in_reversed is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray. If the original subarray has no 1s, then the reversed subarray has no 1s.\n\nBut how to compute this for any subarray [l, r]?\n\nWe can precompute for each position i, the next occurrence of 1 to the right, or something similar. Or for each subarray [l, r], find the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray.\n\nBut for n=2000, checking all O(n^2) subarrays and for each finding the first occurrence of 1 would be O(n^3), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm. So this approach might not be efficient enough.\n\nAlternative idea: since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the maximum gain we can get by reversing a subarray is to find the maximum number of 2s that can be moved after the 1s.\n\nLet me think of the following: the original array has some 2s that are before some 1s. Each such pair of 2 before 1 is an inversion. By reversing a subarray that contains these 2s and 1s, we can eliminate these inversions. The more such inversions we can eliminate, the better.\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of inversions that can be eliminated by reversing a single subarray.\n\nBut what's the maximum number of inversions that can be eliminated by reversing a subarray?\n\nAn inversion is a pair (i, j) where i < j and a[i] = 2, a[j] = 1.\n\nReversing a subarray [l, r] will change the order of elements within it. Any inversion that is entirely inside [l, r] will be reversed. For example, if there is a pair (i, j) in [l, r] with i < j and a[i]=2, a[j]=1, then after reversal, this becomes (j', i') where j' = r - (i - l) and i' = r - (j - l). So the pair becomes (j', i') where j' > i', but the elements are now a[j] = 1 and a[i] = 2. So the pair (i', j') in the new array would have a[i']=1 and a[j']=2, which is not an inversion. So this inversion is eliminated.\n\nThus, reversing a subarray [l, r] will eliminate all inversions that are entirely within the subarray. Additionally, it may create new inversions between elements inside and outside the subarray. But for our purpose, we want to eliminate as many inversions as possible.\n\nBut how to find the subarray [l, r] that contains the maximum number of such inversions.\n\nThe maximum number of such inversions is the maximum number of pairs (i,j) where i < j, a[i]=2, a[j]=1, and both i and j are in [l, r]. This is equivalent to the number of inversions in the subarray [l, r].\n\nSo, the maximum gain is the maximum number of inversions in any subarray. Because reversing that subarray will eliminate all those inversions, leading to a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nBut wait, the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of inversions. Or is it? No, that's not correct. The number of inversions is the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j and a[i] > a[j]. For an array of 1s and 2s, the number of inversions is the number of pairs where a[i]=2 and a[j]=1. So, the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is n - number_of_inversions. Because each inversion is a pair that violates the non-decreasing property. But this is only true if the array is a permutation, which it's not. For example, in the array [1,2,1,2], the number of inversions is 1 (the pair (2,3)), and the LNDS is 3, which is n - 1 = 3. So it works here. Another example: [2,1], inversions is 1, LNDS is 1, which is 2-1=1. Yes. Another example: [1,1,2,2], inversions is 0, LNDS is 4 = ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help eliminate inversions (pairs where a 2 precedes a 1), which in turn increases the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Inversions**: Count the number of inversions in the original array. An inversion here is a pair (i, j) where i < j and the element at i is 2 while the element at j is 1.\n2. **Maximize Inversion Elimination**: By reversing any subarray, we can eliminate all inversions within that subarray. The goal is to find the subarray with the maximum number of such inversions.\n3. **Calculate Result**: The maximum possible length of the LNDS after reversing an optimal subarray is the total number of elements minus the maximum number of inversions found in any subarray.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    max_inversions = 0\n    # Precompute the number of 1s up to each position\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n    \n    # For each possible subarray [l, r], compute the number of inversions\n    # which is the number of 2s before the subarray multiplied by the number of 1s in the subarray\n    # plus the number of inversions inside the subarray (but since we are considering all pairs in [l, r], it's better to use a different approach)\n    \n    # However, since the array has only 1 and 2, the number of inversions in the subarray [l, r] is equal to:\n    # the number of 2s in the subarray multiplied by the number of 1s in the subarray\n    # because each 2 in the subarray will be before each 1 in the subarray (since they are in the original order)\n    # Wait, no.
