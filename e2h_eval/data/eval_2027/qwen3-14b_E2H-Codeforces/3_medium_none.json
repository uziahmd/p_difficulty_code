Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is a straight line from 0 to l. Each lantern can light up points within distance d. So, I need to find the smallest d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. The key idea is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum required d for those gaps. Because if there's a gap between two lanterns, the worst case is the middle of that gap, which would require the maximum distance from either lantern. Also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would be a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive ones can't be considered properly. For example, if the lanterns are at positions 3, 5, 1, then sorting them gives 1,3,5. Then the gaps between them can be checked.\n\n2. Check the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The required d here would be the distance from 0 to the first lantern. Because if the first lantern is at position a1, then the area from 0 to a1 -d must be covered. Wait, no. The lantern's light covers from a_i -d to a_i +d. So, for the beginning of the street, the first lantern's left side must cover 0. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a1. So the required d must be at least a1. Because if the lantern is at a1, then to cover 0, the distance from a1 to 0 is a1, so d must be at least a1. Similarly, for the end of the street, the last lantern's position is an. The distance from an to l is l - an. So d must be at least that.\n\nThen, between two consecutive lanterns, say at positions a and b (sorted), the maximum distance between them is (b -a). But since each lantern covers up to d on both sides, the middle of the gap between a and b would be (b - a)/2 away from each. So the required d for this gap is (b -a)/2. Because if the gap is larger than 2d, then there's a point in the middle that isn't covered. So the maximum of all these (b -a)/2 values would be the required d for the middle parts.\n\nSo putting it all together, the minimal d is the maximum between:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if it's not at 0)\n- the last lantern's distance to l (if it's not at l)\n- the maximum (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2\n\nBut wait, what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the initial distance is zero, so no problem. Similarly for the last lantern.\n\nSo the algorithm steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial distance (a[0] - 0) → but wait, no: the first lantern's position is a[0], so the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. So the required d must be at least that. Because the lantern's light needs to reach 0. For example, if a[0] is 3, then d must be at least 3, so that 0 is covered (since 3 -d <=0 → d >=3).\n\nSimilarly for the end: l - a[-1].\n\nThen, between consecutive lanterns, compute the difference between current and previous, divide by 2. Take the maximum of these.\n\nThe overall answer is the maximum between these three values.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1, l=5, and the lantern is at position 0. Then the required d is max(0 (from start), 5-0=5, and no gaps between lanterns. So the answer is 5. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is 2 5 with lanterns at 2 and 5. The first lantern is at 2, so the initial distance is 2. The last lantern is at 5, so l - a[-1] is 0. Then between 2 and 5, the gap is 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum of 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array.\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. If it's not zero, then the initial distance is a[0], which is a candidate.\n\nCheck the last lantern's position. If it's not l, then the distance is l - a[-1], which is a candidate.\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference (current - previous), divide by 2. Take the maximum of these values.\n\nThe answer is the maximum of all these candidates.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial_max = 0.\n\nif a[0] > 0: initial_max = a[0]\n\nif a[-1] < l: initial_max = max(initial_max, l - a[-1])\n\nthen for i from 1 to n-1:\n\ngap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_gap = gap / 2.0\n\nif current_gap > initial_max:\n\n   initial_max = current_gap\n\nso the answer is initial_max.\n\nWait, but in the first step, initial_max is set to a[0], but then when checking the last lantern, it's compared with the initial_max. So for example, if the first lantern is at 0, then initial_max is 0, and then the last lantern may be less than l, so l - a[-1] could be larger than 0. So that's handled.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, handling edge cases:\n\nCase where n=1. For example, n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the initial_max is 5 (distance from 0 to 5), and the last lantern's distance is 5 (10-5). So the initial_max is 5. Then between consecutive lanterns, there's none. So the answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a = [0,5]. Then the initial_max is 0 (a[0] is 0), and the last lantern is 5, so l - a[-1] is 0. The gap between 0 and 5 is 5. Divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a = [0,3]. Then the initial_max is 0, the last lantern is 3, so l - a[-1] is 2. The gap between 0 and 3 is 3/2 = 1.5. So the max is 2. So the answer is 2. Which would be correct. Because the first lantern covers up to 0 + d, and the second covers 3 -d to 3 +d. For the end of the street (5), the distance from 3 is 2, so d must be at least 2. So the answer is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nRead input: first line is n and l. Then next line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. The input examples show two cases, but in the actual problem, perhaps the input is a single test case. Wait, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input examples have two cases, but the actual input is given as per the problem's input description.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo each test case is two lines. However, the sample input shows two test cases. For example, in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen another input line is 2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut that's probably part of the sample input, but perhaps the actual program is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the input description. So the actual input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps in the problem, the user is supposed to read multiple test cases? Or maybe that's a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again. The input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps that's because the sample input is written as two separate inputs, but in reality, the program should read one test case. Or maybe the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So the code is supposed to read a single test case.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen the second input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. But in reality, the program should read one test case. However, in the problem statement's input section, it says that the input is given as per the first line. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. But the code is supposed to process one test case. Therefore, perhaps the code should read two lines of input, but in the sample input, there are two test cases. However, the problem's sample output shows two outputs. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nSo the input is two test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases. But how many? How is the input structured?\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So the code must process a single test case. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem's input is multiple test cases. But the problem's input description is ambiguous. However, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\nSo the input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases. But in programming competition problems, sometimes the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual input is for one. However, the problem's sample input and output suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the original problem's sample input is given as two lines. Let me check the original problem's sample input.\n\nLooking back, the sample input is:\n\nInput\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nOutput:\n\n2.5000000000\n\n2.0000000000\n\nWhich suggests that the input has two test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut in the problem's input description, it's unclear. However, looking at the problem's original source (assuming this is from Codeforces or similar), the input is likely to be multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code should read until EOF, processing each test case.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first test case is:\n\nFirst line: 7 15\n\nSecond line: 15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen another test case:\n\nFirst line: 2 5\n\nSecond line: 2 5\n\nSo the code must read multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should process all test cases provided in the input. But how to read them?\n\nIn Python, the standard way is to read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process them accordingly.\n\nBut in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description may not mention it. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? Well, for example, in the sample input, the input is given as two test cases, each consisting of two lines. So the code should read all lines until EOF, and for each pair of lines, process a test case.\n\nBut in practice, how to read them in Python? Well, perhaps read all input as a list of lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the sample input. But given that the sample input includes two test cases, the code must handle that. However, the problem's original input description may not mention that. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is presented as two test cases, but the actual problem expects only one test case. However, the problem's sample output shows two outputs. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces, and the input is multiple test cases. But the problem's input description is not clear. However, in the problem statement's sample input, the first line is the first test case, then the second test case. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? Well, in Python, reading from stdin can be done with sys.stdin.read().split(), which splits all input into tokens. Then, process the tokens as per the test cases.\n\nFor example, for each test case, read two lines: first line has n and l, second line has n integers.\n\nBut how to read them? Let's think.\n\nSuppose the input is read as a list of tokens. Then, for each test case, read the first two tokens as n and l, then read the next n tokens as the ai list.\n\nBut how to handle multiple test cases? For example, the first test case is 7 15, then the next line is 15 5 3 7 9 14 0. Then the next test case is 2 5, then next line is 2 5.\n\nSo the tokens would be:\n\n['7', '15', '15', '5', '3', '7', '9', '14', '0', '2', '5', '2', '5']\n\nSo, the code can read all tokens as a list, then process them in order.\n\nSo, for example, the code can do something like:\n\nimport sys\n\ndata = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\nThen, process the data as follows:\n\nindex = 0\n\nwhile index < len(data):\n\n    n = data[index]\n\n    l = data[index + 1]\n\n    index += 2\n\n    a = data[index:index + n]\n\n    index += n\n\n    # process the test case here\n\nBut in this case, the code will process all test cases.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, the code must process two test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description may not mention this. However, given that the sample input shows two test cases, and the output shows two outputs, it's likely that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original statement may not have mentioned that. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l, implying that there is only one test case. But that's conflicting with the sample input.\n\nThis is a critical point. If the code is written to process a single test case, but the actual input has multiple test cases, then the code will fail.\n\nBut looking at the original problem's sample input and output, perhaps the problem is from Codeforces, and the actual input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the actual problem has only one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. Let me check the problem's original statement again.\n\nThe problem's sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nOutput:\n\n2.5000000000\n\n2.0000000000\n\nSo the input is two test cases. Hence, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code must read multiple test cases. So the code must read all the input, split into tokens, and process them as per the test cases.\n\nThus, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all tokens as a list.\n\nProcess them in groups: for each test case, read n and l, then read n integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(data):\n\n        n = data[idx]\n\n        l = data[idx+1]\n\n        idx +=2\n\n        a = data[idx:idx+n]\n\n        idx +=n\n\n        # process this test case\n\n        # sort the a list\n\n        a.sort()\n\n        # compute the max_d\n\n        max_d = 0.0\n\n        # first lantern\n\n        if a[0] > 0:\n\n            max_d = a[0]\n\n        # last lantern\n\n        if a[-1] < l:\n\n            current = l - a[-1]\n\n            if current > max_d:\n\n                max_d = current\n\n        # check between lanterns\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n            current = gap / 2.0\n\n            if current > max_d:\n\n                max_d = current\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, what if n is 0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nBut what if n=1 and a[0] is 0 and l is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nWait, the input constraints for l are 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9.\n\nSo, for example, if n is 1 and a[0] is 0, and l is 5, then the code checks if a[0] is 0 (so no contribution to max_d), then checks if a[-1] (which is 0) is less than l (5). So l - a[-1] is 5, which is the max_d. Then between lanterns, there are none. So the answer is 5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: if n=1 and a[0] is l, then the code checks a[0] is l, which is equal to l. So the first part (a[0] > 0) is true if l is greater than 0. But then the last lantern is a[-1] = l, which is equal to l, so no contribution. The max_d is a[0] (if a[0] is 0?), no.\n\nWait, for example, n=1, l=5, a=[5]. Then:\n\na[0] is 5. So first check: a[0] > 0 → yes, max_d is 5. Then check if a[-1] < l → 5 < 5? No. So no change. Then between lanterns nothing. So the answer is 5.0. Which is correct, because the lantern is at 5, and the street is from 0 to 5. The lantern's light must cover from 5 -d to 5 +d. But since the street is up to 5, the required d is 5 (so that 0 is covered). So yes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then the first lantern is at 3. So the initial max_d is 3. Then the last lantern is at 3, which is less than l (5). So l - a[-1] is 2. So the max_d is max(3, 2) = 3. Then no gaps between lanterns. So answer is 3. Which is correct. Because the lantern covers from 3 -d to 3 +d. To cover 0, d must be at least 3. To cover 5, d must be at least 2. So the max is 3.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when the lanterns are sorted, but there are multiple lanterns at the same position. For example, n=3, l=10, a = [0,0,10]. Then the code sorts a as [0,0,10]. The first lantern is 0, so no contribution. Last lantern is 10, which equals l, so no contribution. Between lanterns: first gap is 0-0=0, divided by 2 is 0. Then between 0 and 10: gap is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So the max_d is 5. Which is correct. Because the lanterns at 0 and 10. The middle is at 5, which needs to be covered. So d must be 5. So the code returns 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a = [0, 5, 10]. The gaps between 0 and 5 is 5 → 2.5. Between 5 and 10 is 5 → 2.5. The max is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code must print the answer with 10 decimal digits. So using the format string as .10f.\n\nBut what about when the answer is an integer? Like the second sample input. The answer is 2.0, which is printed as 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code must handle the case when n is 0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nFirst lantern is 0 → no contribution. Last lantern is 15, which is equal to l (15). So no contribution. Now check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nThe maximum among these is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5, which matches the first sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted as [2,5]. First lantern is 2, so initial max_d is 2. Last lantern is 5, which is equal to l. So no contribution. Gap between 2 and 5 is 3 → 1.5. So the max is 2.0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. Also, note that for the case when n=0? Well, according to the problem statement, n ≥ 1.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut in Python, when you read the input as a list of integers, then process them as per the test cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(data):\n        n = data[idx]\n        l = data[idx + 1]\n        idx += 2\n        a = data[idx:idx + n]\n        idx += n\n        a.sort()\n        max_d = 0.0\n        # check first lantern\n        if a[0] > 0:\n            max_d = a[0]\n        # check last lantern\n        if a[-1] < l:\n            current = l - a[-1]\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        # check gaps between lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the case where the first lantern is at 0, and the last at l, and all gaps are covered. For example, n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then the code would have max_d initially 0. Then check a[-1] is 5 which is equal to l. So no change. Then between the two lanterns, the gap is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then the first lantern is 0, so no contribution. Last lantern is 0, which is less than l=1. So current = 1-0=1. So max_d is 1.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[1]. Then first lantern is 1>0 → max_d is 1. Last lantern is 1 which is equal to l. So no change. So answer is 1.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, note that the problem requires that the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 1e-9. Using floating point division and printing with 10 decimal digits should suffice.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street. The solution involves analyzing the positions of the lanterns and calculating the maximum distance that needs to be covered by any lantern's light.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all input data at once and split it into a list of integers for easier processing.\n2. **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Check**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them and determine the maximum half-gap, which represents the worst-case distance that needs to be covered by the lanterns' light in the middle of the gap.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result for each test case is the maximum value obtained from the initial checks and the gap calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(data):\n        n = data[idx]\n        l = data[idx + 1]\n        idx += 2\n        a = data[idx:idx + n]\n        idx += n\n        a.sort()\n        max_d = 0.0\n        # Check the first lantern's distance from 0\n        if a[0] > 0:\n            max_d = a[0]\n        # Check the last lantern's distance from l\n        if a[-1] < l:\n            current = l - a[-1]\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into a list of integers for efficient processing.\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in sequentially checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Initial Checks**: The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street are checked to ensure the entire street is illuminated.\n- **Gap Analysis**: By iterating through the sorted lantern positions, we compute the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The worst-case distance for illumination in these gaps is half the gap size.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required for the lanterns to cover the entire street, considering all edge cases and ensuring precision.",
