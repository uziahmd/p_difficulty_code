She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. We need to find the minimum number of seconds required for her to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem thoroughly. \n\nSo, there are n tabs, and the cursor is at position pos. She needs to leave only tabs from l to r. All other tabs must be closed. The operations allowed are moving left/right (each taking 1 second) or closing tabs to the left or right of the current position (each taking 1 second). But when she closes tabs, the a and b values (the min and max of the current open tabs) change. So, after closing some tabs, the available range changes.\n\nThe key here is to model the steps needed to close all tabs outside [l, r], considering that closing operations can be done once you're positioned correctly, but moving takes time.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the cases where the current [l, r] is already the entire set of tabs. Like in the third example where l=1 and r=5 and n=5. Then no operations are needed. So output is zero.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the minimal steps to close the tabs outside [l, r]. Let's think about what needs to be closed:\n\nIf l > 1: then all tabs from 1 to l-1 must be closed. Similarly, if r < n: tabs from r+1 to n must be closed.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps required. For example, to close the left part (tabs before l), she needs to move to a position where she can close them. Similarly for the right part.\n\nBut the order of closing might affect the steps. For instance, closing left first or right first.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to first close the left part and then the right part, or vice versa. Or maybe there's a way to do both in a single step if possible.\n\nWait, but each closing operation can only close either all tabs to the left of the current position or all to the right. So, for example, if the current position is at l, then closing all tabs to the left would close tabs 1 to l-1. Similarly, if the current position is at r, closing all tabs to the right would close r+1 to n.\n\nSo the plan is to find the minimal steps to reach a position where you can close the left part (if needed), then reach a position where you can close the right part (if needed).\n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nLet me break it down into two parts: closing the left part (if needed) and closing the right part (if needed).\n\nFirst, check if l > 1. If so, we need to close tabs from 1 to l-1. To do that, we need to move to a position such that the left part can be closed. Since after closing, the a (minimum tab) becomes l. So, during the process of closing the left part, the current a is initially 1, but once we close the left part, a becomes l. However, when moving, the a and b depend on the current state of open tabs. But maybe during the process of moving, the a and b are determined based on which tabs are already closed. Hmm, this seems complicated. However, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that the initial state has all tabs open, and we need to perform the steps to close the left and right parts. Once those are closed, the rest is done.\n\nSo, the idea is that the closing operations can be done once the cursor is in the correct position. For example, to close the left part (tabs 1 to l-1), we need to have the cursor at position l. Because then, when you close all tabs to the left, that would remove tabs 1 to l-1. Similarly, to close the right part (tabs r+1 to n), the cursor must be at position r, and then close all tabs to the right.\n\nBut maybe there's another way. Suppose that after closing the left part, the a becomes l. Then, for closing the right part, we need to be at position r. But during movement, the a and b are determined by the current open tabs. However, since we are trying to close the left and right parts, perhaps the movement steps are calculated based on the original positions, not considering that some tabs are closed. Because once you close the left part, the movement is now within the [l, ...] range. But perhaps the movement steps can be calculated based on the original positions, because when you close tabs, the movement is constrained by the current a and b. But this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered in two phases: closing the left part and closing the right part. Each phase requires moving to the correct position and then performing the close operation. However, the movement steps for each phase may be affected by whether the other part has been closed or not.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model this. Let's consider that the order in which we close the left and right parts affects the movement steps. For example, if we first close the left part, then the movement for closing the right part is done within the [l, n] range. Alternatively, if we first close the right part, then movement for closing the left part is done within the [1, r] range.\n\nBut how do these choices affect the total steps?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose that the initial position is pos, and we need to close left (tabs before l) and right (tabs after r). Let's say that l is 2, r is 4, n is 6, pos is 3. Like the first example. \n\nIn this case, the left part is tabs 1. So to close it, we need to move to position 2 (since that's l), then close left. Then, to close the right part (tabs 5,6), we need to move to position 4 (r) and close right. \n\nThe steps would be:\n\n- Move from pos=3 to 2: 1 second.\n- Close left: 1 second. Now the tabs are 2-4, and a=2, b=4.\n- Then move from 2 to 4: 2 seconds (right twice).\n- Close right: 1 second. Total steps: 1+1+2+1 = 5, which matches the example.\n\nAlternatively, if we first close the right part, then the left part. Let's see:\n\nOriginal pos is 3. Need to close right part (tabs 5,6). To do that, need to be at position 4 (r). How to get there? From 3 to 4: 1 second. Close right (1 sec). Now the tabs are 1-4, a=1, b=4. Then, need to close left part (tabs 1). To do that, need to be at position 2 (l). So from current position 4, move left to 2: 2 steps. Close left: 1 sec. Total steps: 1+1+2+1=5. Same total.\n\nSo in this case, the order doesn't matter. But maybe in some other cases it does.\n\nAnother example: suppose l=1, r=3, and n=5. pos=5. So need to close tabs 4 and 5. To close right part, need to be at position 3 (r). So from 5, moving left to 3: 2 steps. Close right (1 sec). Then, since l is 1, no need to close left. Total steps: 3.\n\nAlternatively, if we first close left (but l is 1, so no need). So the answer is 3 steps.\n\nSo the order of closing left and right may not affect the total steps. So perhaps we can compute the steps for closing left and right, and sum them, regardless of order. But how to compute the steps required for each part?\n\nLet me think. For the left part: if l > 1, then we need to move to l, then close. But how many steps to move to l?\n\nBut the initial position is pos. However, during movement, the a and b are initially 1 and n. So when moving, the cursor can move freely between 1 and n. So the movement steps from pos to l is |pos - l| steps. Then, closing left takes 1 second. Similarly, for the right part: if r < n, then we need to move to r, which takes |pos - r| steps. Then closing right takes 1 second. But wait, this is only if we don't have to do anything else. However, this approach would be incorrect if we have to do both left and right steps. Because, for example, if you first move to l, then move to r, the movement steps would be |pos - l| + |l - r|. But if you first move to r, then to l, it's |pos - r| + |r - l|. Which is the same as the previous sum. So the total steps for movement would be |pos - l| + |pos - r| + 2 (for the two close operations). But that's not correct. Because if you first close the left part, then moving from l to r would take |l - r| steps. But if you first close the right part, then moving from r to l would take |r - l| steps. So the total movement steps would be (steps to reach l) + (steps to reach r from l) or (steps to reach r) + (steps to reach l from r). Either way, the sum is |pos - l| + |pos - r| + |l - r|? No, no. Wait, the sum would be |pos - l| + |l - r|, or |pos - r| + |r - l|. Which is same as |pos - l| + |pos - r| + |l - r|? No. Because |pos - l| + |l - r| is equal to |pos - r| + |l - r| if pos is on one side of l and r. Not sure. But perhaps the minimal steps is the minimal between the two options.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a better way. Let me think again.\n\nIf we need to close both left and right parts, then the steps required are:\n\n- Move to the position where you can close left (l), then move to the position where you can close right (r), and then close both. Or vice versa.\n\nBut the movement steps would be:\n\nOption 1: move to l, close left (cost: |pos - l| + 1). Then move to r (cost |l - r| steps) and close right (another 1 sec). So total steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1 = |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nOption 2: move to r, close right (cost |pos - r| + 1). Then move to l (cost |r - l| steps) and close left (another 1 sec). Total steps: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut which option is better depends on the values of pos, l, r.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. For example, if the initial position is already in a position that allows closing both left and right in one move? Well, no. Because closing left or right can only close one side. So you need to do both steps.\n\nBut maybe there's a scenario where you can close both in a single step. For example, if the initial position is l and r is such that l = r. But that's when l = r. But in that case, if the initial position is l, then closing left and right would not be needed. Or if the required segment is [l, r], and l = r, then the only thing to do is to close any tabs outside. For example, if l = r = 3, and n is 5. Then you need to close tabs 1-2 and 4-5. So you need to close left and right.\n\nBut regardless, the steps are to move to l, close left, then move to r and close right. Or vice versa.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, if the initial position is between l and r. Let's say l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, to close left and right, you can move to l (2), close left (cost 1 sec). Then move to r (4) (cost 2 sec). Close right (1 sec). Total movement steps: 1+2 = 3, plus 2 close steps: total 5. Which matches the first example.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already at l? Then moving to l is zero steps. Close left. Then move to r, etc.\n\nBut how to compute this in code?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps required for closing the left and right parts is:\n\nIf we need to close left and right:\n\nTotal steps = (steps to move to l) + 1 (close left) + (steps to move from l to r) + 1 (close right)\n\nOR\n\nTotal steps = (steps to move to r) + 1 (close right) + (steps to move from r to l) + 1 (close left)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nmin( (|pos - l| + |l - r|) + 2, (|pos - r| + |r - l|) + 2 )\n\nBut since |l - r| is same as |r - l|, the two options are |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2 and |pos - r| + |l - r| + 2. Which is the same as (|pos - l| + |pos - r| + 2) ?\n\nNo, because |pos - l| + |l - r| is not the same as |pos - r| + |l - r|. Wait, no. Let me take an example. Suppose pos is 3, l is 2, r is 4. |pos - l| is 1, |l - r| is 2. So total is 1 + 2 = 3. |pos - r| is 1, same as |l - r| is 2. So the total is 1 + 2 = 3. So in this case, both options are same. So the total steps would be 3 + 2 = 5, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: pos is 1, l=2, r=4. Then, option 1: |1-2|=1, |2-4|=2. Total movement steps is 3, plus 2 closes steps: 5. Option 2: |1-4|=3, |4-2|=2. Total movement steps is 3+2=5, plus 2 steps: 7. So option 1 is better. Hence, the minimal steps would be min( (steps to reach l) + (steps to reach r from l), (steps to reach r) + (steps to reach l from r) ) + 2.\n\nBut how to compute this in code? Well, perhaps the minimal steps for moving between the two points is min( |pos - l| + |l - r|, |pos - r| + |r - l| ), which is same as min( |pos - l| + |l - r|, |pos - r| + |l - r| ). Which equals |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ). So the total steps for both closing left and right is |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + 2.\n\nWait, no. Because |pos - l| + |l - r| = |pos - l| + |r - l|. And |pos - r| + |r - l| = |pos - r| + |r - l|. So the min between these two is |r - l| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ). So adding 2 steps for the closing operations, the total steps is |r - l| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + 2.\n\nBut why?\n\nYes, because the min between |pos - l| + |r - l| and |pos - r| + |r - l| is |r - l| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ). So the total steps for moving and closing both left and right is that value plus 2 (for the two close operations). \n\nBut wait, in the example where pos is 1, l=2, r=4. Then |r - l| is 2, min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) is min(1, 3) = 1. So total movement steps is 2 + 1 = 3. Adding 2 gives 5. Which is correct, as in option 1.\n\nSo that formula seems to work. But what if l and r are the same? Like l = r. Then |r - l| is zero. So steps would be 0 + min(...). But in that case, if l = r, then we need to close all tabs except that one. So for example, if l = r = 3, n = 5, then we need to close tabs 1-2 and 4-5. So steps would be moving to 3 (if needed) and closing left and right. But how?\n\nWait, in this case, when l = r, the required segment is just one tab. So the steps would be:\n\nIf the current position is pos. To close left (tabs 1-2) and right (tabs 4-5). So you need to first close left, then close right. Or vice versa.\n\nFor example, if pos is 3, then you can close left (all tabs to the left) and then close right (all tabs to the right). Each requires moving to the position where you can close. For closing left, you need to be at position 3 (since l is 3). So you can close left (tabs 1-2) by being at 3. Then, you can close right (tabs 4-5) by being at 3 again. So steps would be:\n\nClose left (1 sec) and close right (1 sec). But how to move? Since the initial position is already 3. So movement steps are zero. So total steps is 2 seconds.\n\nBut according to the formula above, |r - l| is 0. min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) is 0 (since pos is 3, l is 3). So the movement steps are 0 + 0 = 0. Plus 2 steps for closing. So total 2 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother example: pos is 1, l = r = 3, n=5. So steps would be:\n\nMove to l (3) which is 2 steps. Then close left (1 sec) and close right (1 sec). So total steps: 2 + 2 = 4. According to the formula, |r - l| is 0. min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) is 2. So 0 + 2 = 2. Add 2 steps: total 4. Correct.\n\nSo this formula seems to work for when both left and right need to be closed.\n\nNow, what about cases where only left needs to be closed, or only right needs to be closed?\n\nFor example, if l = 1, r = 5, n = 5. Then no need to close anything. So steps is 0.\n\nAnother example: l = 1, r = 3, n = 5. So need to close tabs 4 and 5. So steps required is to move to r (3), then close right. So movement steps is |pos - r|, then 1 sec. So total steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if l = 3, r = 5, n = 5. Then need to close tabs 1-2. Steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSo, putting all together, the steps can be computed as follows:\n\nFirst, check if the current [l, r] is already the entire range. If l == 1 and r == n, then steps is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to check whether we need to close left (if l > 1) and/or close right (if r < n).\n\nSo:\n\nCase 1: Only left needs to be closed (r == n). So steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase 2: Only right needs to be closed (l == 1). Steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase 3: Both left and right need to be closed. Steps is (|l - r| + min(|pos - l|, |pos - r| )) + 2.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck. In case 3, the formula was |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + 2.\n\nWait, earlier analysis said that for both left and right, the steps are |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + 2.\n\nBut why is that?\n\nBecause the movement steps are |l - r| + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ), and then adding 2 for the two closing operations.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. For example, in the first case where l=2, r=4, pos=3. The movement steps are |2-4| + min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) = 2 + 1 = 3. Then adding 2 steps for closing gives 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: l=2, r=5, pos=1. Then, need to close left (l=2>1) and right (r=5 < n= say 6). So steps would be |2-5| + min( |1-2|, |1-5| ) + 2 = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6. Let's see:\n\nOption is to move to l=2 (steps 1), close left (1 sec). Then move from 2 to 5 (steps 3), close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches.\n\nBut what if the movement steps are not |l - r| + min(...) ?\n\nSo the formula for case 3 is correct.\n\nSo, putting all this together, the algorithm can be structured as:\n\nCheck if the required segment [l, r] is already the entire range (i.e., l == 1 and r == n). If so, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute whether left needs to be closed (left_needed = l > 1) and whether right needs to be closed (right_needed = r < n).\n\nIf left_needed and right_needed:\n\ntotal_steps = (abs(l - r) + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))) + 2\n\nelif left_needed:\n\ntotal_steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\ntotal_steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nBut wait, let's check the example given in the problem.\n\nSecond example input: '6 3 1 3' → output is 1.\n\nIn this case, l=1, r=3. n=6. So need to close tabs 4-6. So right_needed is true (r=3 < 6). So steps is |pos - r| + 1. pos is 3, r is 3. So steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the example.\n\nThird example input: '5 2 1 5' → output 0. Because l=1, r=5, n=5. So no steps needed.\n\nAnother test case: input '6 3 2 4' → output 5. Let's compute according to the formula.\n\nleft_needed: l=2>1 → yes. right_needed: r=4 <6 → yes. So:\n\nabs(2-4) = 2. min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 ) → 1. So 2 + 1 = 3. Add 2 steps: 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo this formula seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what if the required segment is [l, r] where l is 1 and r is less than n. For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. Then, the steps are |pos - r| + 1. So if pos is 3, steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct. Because you can close all tabs to the right of 3 (which is 4 and 5) with one step.\n\nBut what if the required segment is [l, r] where l is 1, and r is n. Then, no steps needed.\n\nAnother case: when l=3, r=5, n=5. Then, no need to close anything. So steps is zero.\n\nNow, what about when l=1, r=5, n=6. Then, need to close tab 6. So steps is |pos - r| + 1. Since r=5. So steps is |pos -5| +1. For example, if pos is 3, steps is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nBut how? Let's think. The user needs to close tab 6. So she needs to move to position 5 (r) and close all tabs to the right. Which is tab 6. So movement steps from pos=3 to 5 is 2 steps. Close right: 1. Total 3 steps. Correct.\n\nBut what if she moves to 6 first? Well, but she can't, because the current a and b are 1 and 6. So she can move to 6. But then, to close the right part (tabs to the right of 6, which is none). So that's not helpful. So the correct way is to move to r=5 and close right.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=1 and r=n. Output is zero.\n\nAnother case: when l=1, r= n-1. Then, need to close tab n. So steps is |pos - r| + 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to cover all cases.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nFirst, read the input: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if l > 1 and r < n → both sides need to be closed.\n\nElse, check if only left or only right.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_needed = l > 1\n\n    right_needed = r < n\n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n        steps = (abs(l - r) + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))) + 2\n\n    elif left_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # this can't happen because if l == 1 and r ==n is already handled.\n\n        # but for code safety, perhaps handle it.\n\n        steps = 0\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what about when l is 1 and r <n? Then, only right needed. So steps is |pos - r| +1.\n\nBut let's test the example where l=1, r=3, n=6, pos=3. Then steps is 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: l=1, r=3, n=6, pos=1. Steps is |1-3| +1 = 2 +1=3. Let's see:\n\nNeed to close tabs 4-6. So move from pos=1 to r=3: 2 steps. Close right: 1 sec. Total 3 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=5, n=6. So left_needed (2>1) and right_needed (5<6). So steps is abs(2-5) + min( |pos -2|, |pos-5| ) + 2.\n\nFor example, if pos is 3. Then:\n\nabs(2-5) is 3. min( |3-2|=1, |3-5|=2) → 1. So 3+1=4. +2 → 6 steps.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption 1: move to l=2 (steps 1), close left (1 sec). Then move to r=5 (steps 3) and close right (1 sec). Total steps 1+1+3+1 = 6. Correct.\n\nAnother case: pos=5, l=2, r=5, n=6. So steps would be:\n\nabs(2-5) is 3. min(|5-2|=3, |5-5|=0) → 0. So 3 + 0 = 3. +2 → 5 steps.\n\nWhich would be:\n\nmove to r=5 (steps 0), close right (tabs 6). Then move to l=2 (steps 3) and close left (tabs 1). So steps: 0+1 +3+1=5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what if the required segment is [l, r], but the current pos is already in a position that allows closing both left and right in one step?\n\nLike, for example, if l=2, r=4, pos=2. So steps:\n\nabs(2-4)=2. min( |2-2|=0, |2-4|=2) → 0. So 2+0=2. +2 → 4 steps. Which would be:\n\nClose left (already at l=2, so close left (tabs 1) → 1 sec. Then move to r=4 (steps 2) and close right (tabs 5-...). So steps: 0 movement steps for moving to l, 1 sec. Then 2 steps movement, 1 sec. Total 0 +1 + 2 +1 =4 steps. Correct.\n\nSo this formula seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r= n-1. For example, n=5, l=1, r=4. So need to close tab 5. So steps is |pos - r| +1. Which is |pos -4| +1. So if pos is 4, steps is 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=4, n=5. pos is 5. So need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tab 5). So steps is:\n\nabs(2-4) = 2. min( |5-2|=3, |5-4|=1) → 1. 2+1=3. +2=5 steps.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption: move to r=4 (steps 1). Close right (tabs 5). Then move to l=2 (steps 2). Close left (tabs 1). Total steps: 1 (move) +1 (close) + 2 (move) +1 (close) = 5 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother example where pos is already in the middle of l and r. For example, l=3, r=5, n=6, pos=4. Need to close left (tabs 1-2). So steps is |4-3| +1 = 1 +1=2 steps. Because you need to move to l=3 (1 step), then close left (1 step). So total 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code logic seems solid.\n\nNow, let's check the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → output 5.\n\nAs discussed, the code computes:\n\nl=2, r=4. Both needed. So steps = abs(2-4) + min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) + 2 → 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3 → output 1. l=1, r=3. n=6. So right_needed (3 <6). steps is |3-3| +1 = 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 2 1 5 → output 0. Because l=1 and r=5, which equals n=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=5 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=4. Then steps is |5-4| +1 = 1 +1 = 2 steps.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead the input as four integers. But the input is given as a list of multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as a single line with four integers. But the example shows:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\" So perhaps the examples are multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line of input. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains four integer numbers...\n\nBut the example shows three test cases. That's probably because the example shows multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line per test case. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but according to the problem statement, the code should read one line of input.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line. The example shows three lines, but that's probably because the user is showing multiple test cases. For example, the sample input may be multiple lines, but the actual problem says that the input is one line. However, the sample input is written as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut that's probably for the purpose of the example. However, the actual code should read a single line of input. But perhaps in the problem, the input is multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the problem says:\n\n\"The only line of input contains four integer numbers...\"\n\nSo the code should read one line of input, split into four integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases, but the actual code should process each line as a separate test case. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's confusing. But the code should read one line of input with four integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given in the problem:\n\nIn the first example, the input is '6 3 2 4', output is '5'.\n\nSo the code should read one line of input, split into n, pos, l, r.\n\nTherefore, the code should be written to read one line, split into four integers.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead the input line, split into four integers.\n\nThen compute according to the logic above.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_needed = l > 1\n\n    right_needed = r < n\n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n        steps = (abs(l - r) + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))) + 2\n\n    elif left_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        steps = 0\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what about when l=1 and r <n? For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. Then, right_needed is True, and steps is |pos - r| +1.\n\nBut let's test this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → code:\n\nl=2, r=4. Not equal to 1 and 6. left_needed is True (2>1), right_needed is True (4 <6). So steps = (abs(2-4) = 2) + min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1) → 1. 2+1=3 + 2 → 5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. Not equal to 1 and 6. left_needed is False (l=1). right_needed is True (3 <6). So steps is |3-3| +1 → ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal movements and closing operations based on the current position of the cursor and the required segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the required segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l = 1 and r = n), no operations are needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Required Operations**: \n   - Check if tabs to the left of l need to be closed (left_needed).\n   - Check if tabs to the right of r need to be closed (right_needed).\n3. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - **Both Sides Need Closing**: Calculate the steps required to move to the nearest end of the segment and then close both sides.\n   - **Only Left Side Needs Closing**: Calculate the steps to move to l and close the left side.\n   - **Only Right Side Needs Closing**: Calculate the steps to move to r and close the right side.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needed = l > 1\n    right_needed = r < n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n        steps = (abs(l - r) + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))) + 2\n    elif left_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        steps = 0\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] spans the entire range of tabs, no actions are needed.\n- **Movement and Closing Operations**:\n  - **Both Sides**: The steps are calculated by moving to the nearest end of the segment (either l or r), then moving to the other end to close both sides. This ensures minimal movement.\n  - **Single Side**: Directly move to the relevant end (l or r) and perform the closing operation, which is efficient as it minimizes unnecessary movements.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal steps required by considering both movement and closing operations, ensuring optimal performance.",
