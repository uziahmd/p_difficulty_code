The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about selecting which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we have to remove exactly k districts, and output their numbers in increasing order.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n- The districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So the input is a tree.\n- Removing k districts, but the remaining n - k must be connected. So the problem reduces to choosing a subtree with (n - k) nodes such that the sum of 2^i for those nodes is as large as possible. Then, the districts not in this subtree are the ones to remove.\n\nBut how do we find this subtree?\n\nSince the sum is maximized by keeping the nodes with the highest possible 2^i values. However, the constraint is that the selected nodes must form a connected subtree. So the optimal approach would be to select the nodes with the largest values, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but the tree's structure complicates things. For example, if we want to keep the highest nodes, but they might be spread out in the tree, requiring us to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut here's an idea: since the value of each node is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i. So higher-numbered districts have much higher values than lower ones. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, and remove the lower ones. But how to ensure connectivity.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to start from the highest-numbered node and perform some kind of selection process, ensuring that the selected nodes form a connected subtree. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as selecting a subtree with (n - k) nodes. Since we want maximum sum, we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem where we need to choose a subtree with exactly m = n - k nodes. The goal is to maximize the sum of 2^i for these nodes. How to find such a subtree?\n\nSince 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the optimal subtree should contain the largest possible nodes. However, the subtree must be connected.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to greedily select the largest nodes, and then make sure that they are connected. But how?\n\nAnother thought: the problem is similar to finding a subtree of size m that has the maximum sum of node values. Since the node values are 2^i, which are very large for higher i, the optimal subtree must include the highest possible nodes.\n\nBut how to select them?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nStart by considering that the best possible scenario is to include all nodes from (m) up to n, but only if they form a connected subtree. If they don't, then we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how can we check that? Well, perhaps the way to do this is to perform a priority-based selection where we select the highest nodes first, and then ensure that they are connected by adding necessary nodes.\n\nWait, but that sounds complicated. Alternatively, since the tree is connected, maybe we can think of the problem as choosing a root (probably the highest node), and then building the subtree by including as many high nodes as possible.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the following: the optimal subtree will consist of the largest (n - k) nodes, but with some adjustments to maintain connectivity. However, the largest nodes may not be connected, so we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how can we find which nodes to include?\n\nLet me think about the following approach. Let's consider that we need to select m = n - k nodes. The maximum sum is achieved when we select the m largest nodes, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. However, if those nodes are not connected, we need to add some lower nodes to connect them, which would require removing some higher nodes and including lower ones. But since the sum is dominated by the higher nodes, perhaps the optimal way is to select as many of the highest nodes as possible, and then include the minimal necessary lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAn alternative idea comes from the fact that in a tree, any subtree of size m can be formed by starting with a root node and then adding children, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let's think about the problem as trying to remove the k districts with the smallest numbers (since higher numbers are better). However, the problem is that removing them might disconnect the tree. So the challenge is to remove k districts, but in such a way that the remaining districts form a connected component. To maximize the sum, we need to remove the districts with the smallest numbers",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans (represented as $2^i$) is maximized. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts have exponentially more fans, so we should aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since the value $2^i$ increases exponentially with $i$, we prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the selected districts form a connected subtree.
