Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about Homer and Marge choosing turns to take digits from a number A such that each makes exactly n moves (since the total digits are 2n). The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of H and M moves that achieves this maximum.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Each turn, either Homer or Marge takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number. After taking, that digit is removed from A. The total sum is S1 + S2, and we want to maximize this.\n\nThe key here is that the order in which they take digits affects the value of their numbers. For example, taking a higher digit early on contributes more to the number's value because it's multiplied by higher powers of 10. So, for instance, if Homer takes a digit at position i, that digit contributes 10^{n - k} where k is the number of digits taken so far. Wait, but since each player takes exactly n digits, the positions are determined by the order of taking. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider that the digits are taken in order. Suppose the original A is a string of 2n digits. Each time a digit is taken, it's added to the respective player's number. For example, if the first move is H, then the first digit of A becomes part of S1. Then the next move could be H or M, etc.\n\nThe value of S1 is the number formed by the digits taken by Homer. Similarly for S2. The sum is S1 + S2. But since S1 and S2 are numbers, their sum depends on the digits each took and their positions.\n\nBut how do we model this? Since each digit's contribution to the sum depends on its position in the respective player's number. For example, if a digit is taken as the k-th digit (from the left) in Homer's sequence, then it contributes digit * 10^{n - k} to S1. Similarly for Marge.\n\nBut since both players take exactly n digits, the total digits are 2n. The problem is to decide for each step whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit, such that the sum of their numbers is maximized.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. However, with n up to 18, the total steps are 36. But the state space for DP would be something like the current position in A, the number of digits Homer has taken so far, and the number of digits Marge has taken so far. Since each has to take exactly n digits, the state can be represented by (position, h_count, m_count). However, since h_count + m_count = position (since each step increases the count by one), we can represent the state with (position, h_count), because m_count = position - h_count. But given that the total number of steps is 2n, and h_count can't exceed n, and m_count can't exceed n.\n\nWait, the initial state is position 0 (no digits taken yet), h_count = 0, m_count = 0. At each step, the position increases by 1, and either h_count increases by 1 (if Homer takes the digit) or m_count increases by 1 (if Marge takes it). So, the state can be represented by (position, h_count), since m_count is determined as position - h_count. However, we need to ensure that h_count <=n and m_count <=n.\n\nSo, for each state (pos, h_count), we can track the maximum possible sum that can be achieved from that state onward. Also, we need to track the path (the sequence of choices) to reconstruct the solution.\n\nBut for n=18, the position can be up to 2*18=36. h_count can be up to 18. So the number of states is 36 * 19 = 684. That's manageable. But wait, for each state, we have to compute the maximum sum possible. How?\n\nLet me think about the transition. For a given state (pos, h_count), the current digit is A[pos]. Let's say that there are (2n - pos) digits left. The current digit is the leftmost one, so when you take it, it's added to either Homer's or Marge's number. The question is: which choice leads to the maximum total sum?\n\nBut how do we calculate the contribution of this digit to the total sum?\n\nSuppose that Homer takes this digit. Then, this digit will be the (h_count +1)-th digit in his number. Since his number has n digits, the position in his number is (h_count +1), and the value of this",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize (the sum of their numbers) is maximized. Each player must make exactly `n` moves, taking digits from a number `A` of length `2n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach where the state is represented by the current position in the number `A`, the number of digits Homer has taken so far, and the number of digits Marge has taken so far. This allows us to efficiently explore all possible sequences of moves and track the maximum possible sum.\n\n2. **State Representation**: The state is represented as `(pos, h_count)`, where `pos` is the current position in the number `A`, and `h_count` is the number of digits Homer has taken so far. Marge's count can be derived as `m_count = pos - h_count`.\n\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each state, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit). We compute the contribution of the current digit to the total sum based on its position in each player's number and recursively determine the optimal subsequent moves.\n\n4. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we memoize the results of subproblems using a dictionary.\n\n5. **Path Reconstruction**: Alongside computing the maximum sum, we track the sequence of moves (either 'H' or 'M') that leads to this maximum sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    total_len = 2 * n\n\n    # Precompute the digits as integers\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\n    # Memoization cache\n    memo = {}\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(pos, h_count):\n        if pos == total_len:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        m_count = pos - h_count\n        # Check if we can proceed\n        if h_count > n or m_count > n:\n            return (-1, \"\")\n        # Current digit\n        current_digit = digits[pos]\n        # Try Homer takes it\n        if h_count < n:\n            h_new = h_count + 1\n            m_new = m_count\n            # Contribution to the sum: current_digit * 10^(n - h_new)\n            contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h_new))\n            # Recursive call\n            val, path = dp(pos + 1, h_new)\n            if val != -1:\n                total = contribution_h + val\n                new_path = 'H' + path\n                best_val = total\n                best_path = new_path\n            else:\n                best_val = -1\n                best_path = \"\"\n        else:\n            best_val = -1\n            best_path = \"\"\n        \n        # Try Marge takes it\n        if m_count < n:\n            m_new = m_count + 1\n            h_new = h_count\n            # Contribution to the sum: current_digit * 10^(n - m_new)\n            contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m_new))\n            # Recursive call\n            val, path = dp(pos + 1, h_new)\n            if val != -1:\n                total = contribution_m + val\n                new_path = 'M' + path\n                if best_val == -1 or total > best_val:\n                    best_val = total\n                    best_path = new_path\n                elif total == best_val:\n                    # Choose lex smaller?

It returns the maximum sum and the corresponding sequence of moves.\n- **Recursive Transitions**: For each position, we consider both Homer and Marge taking the current digit, calculate their contributions to the total sum, and recursively determine the optimal path.\n- **Memoization**: Using `functools.lru_cache` ensures that each state is computed only once, significantly improving efficiency.\n- **Path Reconstruction**: The function keeps track of the sequence of moves that leads to the maximum sum, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible move sequences while ensuring the solution is optimal and meets the constraints.",
