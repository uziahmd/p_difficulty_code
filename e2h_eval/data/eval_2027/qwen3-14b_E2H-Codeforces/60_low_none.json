Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of S in Morse code after each modification. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Each time a character (0 or 1) is added to S, I have to compute the answer. The answer is the total number of valid Morse code substrings, where each substring corresponds to a valid letter. But the tricky part is that each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4) except four specific ones is considered as a valid letter. So, for any substring of S, if it's a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of those four forbidden strings), then it contributes to the count. However, the count isn't just the number of such substrings; it's the number of non-empty sequences of letters. Wait, but each valid substring represents exactly one letter. So, for example, if there are multiple substrings that are valid, each of them is a single-letter sequence. But sequences can be longer, like two letters, which would correspond to two consecutive valid substrings. Wait no, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the note. For example, in the first sample, after S is \"111\", the possible substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", \"1\", \"11\", \"1\", etc. Each of these substrings that are valid Morse codes. But the note lists all possible sequences. For example, \"TT\" is a sequence of two letters, each of which is T (Morse code \"1\"). But the way that's represented is by the substring \"11\" (which is the Morse code for M, but wait in the note, they say that \"TT\" translates into \"11\". Oh right, because each letter is represented by its own Morse code. So, the entire sequence of letters is represented as the concatenation of their Morse codes. So, the problem is: find all possible ways to split some substring of S into valid Morse code letters, and count each such split as a sequence. \n\nSo for example, if a substring of S is \"11\", then it can be split as one letter (M) or two letters (T and T). So each split gives a different sequence. Therefore, the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S (each of which is a valid Morse code string) multiplied by the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters. Wait, no. Because the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each sequence is a concatenation of Morse code letters. So, for example, the substring \"11\" can be split into two letters (each '1') or one letter (11). So each of these splits counts as a separate sequence. So the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S of the number of ways to parse that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThis seems similar to dynamic programming problems where we track the number of ways to parse up to a certain position. So for the current string S, after each addition, we need to compute the total number of sequences. \n\nLet me think. Let's consider that for each position i in the string S, we can track the number of ways to parse the substring ending at i. Let's denote dp[i] as the number of valid sequences that end at position i. Then, the total number of sequences would be the sum of dp[i] for all i from 1 to len(S).\n\nBut how to compute dp[i]? Well, for each position i, we can look back up to 4 positions (since Morse code letters are 1-4 characters long). For each possible k (1 to 4), if the substring ending at i of length k is a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of the forbidden four), then we can add dp[i -k] to dp[i]. Also, if k is 1, then even if there's nothing before, we can add 1 (as a new sequence starting here). \n\nWait, but the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (if the substring ending at i of length k is valid, then dp[i -k] + 1 if i -k == 0? Or perhaps the base case is that dp[0] = 1, representing the empty string. Then, for each i, dp[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (if the substring s[i-k+1..i] is valid, then dp[i -k])",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code after each modification. The key challenge is efficiently determining valid Morse code substrings and counting the possible sequences formed by splitting these substrings into valid Morse code letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string `S`.\n2. **Forbidden Morse Codes**: Maintain a set of forbidden Morse code strings which do not correspond to any English letter.\n3. **Valid Substrings Check**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible substrings ending at the current position to see if they form a valid Morse code string.\n4. **DP Transition**: For each valid substring found, update the DP array based on previous values to account for all possible sequences ending at the current position.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    operations = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    S = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # empty string\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        S.append(operations[i-1])\n        current = ''.join(S)\n        total = 0\n        for k in range(1, 5):\n            if i - k >= 0:\n                substr = current[-k:]\n                if substr not in forbidden:\n                    total += dp[i - k]\n        dp[i] = total % MOD\n        print(dp[i])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations `m` and the subsequent operations (each being '0' or '1').\n2. **Forbidden Set**: A set of forbidden Morse code strings is maintained to quickly check validity.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: `dp[i]` keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at the `i-th` position in the string `S`.\n4. **Updating DP Array**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible substrings ending at the current position (up to length 4). If a substring is valid (not in the forbidden set), update the DP value using previous results.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers as specified.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of valid sequences after each modification, leveraging dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and ensure optimal performance.",
