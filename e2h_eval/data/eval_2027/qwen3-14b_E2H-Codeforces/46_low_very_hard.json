The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest subsegment in a sequence such that by changing at most one element, the subsegment becomes strictly increasing. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The subsegment can have at most one element that is not in order. So, for example, if there's a subsegment where all elements are strictly increasing except for one place where it's non-increasing, then we can change that one element to fix the sequence.\n\nBut how do I find the maximum length of such a subsegment?\n\nHmm. Let me think about possible approaches. One idea is to track the longest possible subsegment where there's at most one \"break\" in the strictly increasing order. But how do I track that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe for each position, I can track two things: the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at this position with 0 changes and with 1 change.\n\nWait, that might be a way. Let's consider two arrays:\n\n- dp0[i]: the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at i with no changes.\n- dp1[i]: the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at i with exactly one change.\n\nSo, for each i, we can compute these based on previous values.\n\nFor dp0[i], if a[i] > a[i-1], then dp0[i] = dp0[i-1] + 1. Otherwise, dp0[i] = 1 (since the current element can't be part of an increasing sequence without changes unless we start a new sequence here).\n\nFor dp1[i], it's a bit more complex. There are two possibilities:\n\n1. We already had a change before. So, if the current a[i] is greater than a[i-1], then dp1[i] = dp1[i-1] + 1. But if not, then maybe we can't extend it, so dp1[i] would be dp1[i-1] (but wait, no. If there was a previous change, then maybe the current element can be adjusted? Or maybe not. Wait, the dp1[i] represents the maximum length of a subsegment ending at i with exactly one change. So, when considering the current element, if the previous subsegment (ending at i-1) had exactly one change, then adding a[i] would require that a[i] is larger than the previous element. Otherwise, if a[i] is not larger than a[i-1], then we can't just add it. But maybe we can use the previous dp1[i-1] value plus 1 if we can change a[i] to fit. Wait, no. Because if there's already one change in the previous subsegment, then we can't make another change. So, for the case where there's already one change, the current element must be in order with the previous one. So, if a[i] is not larger than a[i-1], then we can't extend the subsegment. Therefore, dp1[i] would be 1 (if we can change a[i] to something else?), but wait, no. Because the dp1[i] counts the number of changes allowed. So, if we have a subsegment ending at i-1 with one change, and a[i] is not larger than a[i-1], then we can't add it. However, perhaps we can make a change here. But since we already used the one allowed change, we can't. Therefore, in that case, the subsegment ending at i can't be extended. So, dp1[i] would be the same as dp1[i-1] if we can't extend it, but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dp1[i] can be computed in two ways:\n\nCase 1: The current element is part of the subsegment where we made a change. So, for example, if the previous element (i-1) is part of a strictly increasing sequence, but a[i] is not larger than a[i-1]. Then, we can change a[i] to be a[i-1]+1. So, in this case, the length would be dp0[i-1] + 1 (since we used the one change here). \n\nCase 2: The previous subsegment already had a change. Then, if a[i] > a[i-1], we can extend it by 1. Else, we can't. \n\nSo, for dp1[i], the maximum between these possibilities. \n\nSo, putting this together, for each i, dp1[i] can be:\n\nIf a[i] > a[i-1], then dp1[i] = max(dp1[i-1] + 1, dp0[i-1] + 1). Wait, no. Because dp1[i] represents the maximum length of a subsegment",
