There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all restrictions.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this? Since n and h and m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible? But even then, for n=50, each house can have up to h+1 possibilities (from 0 to h). So 50^50 possibilities? That's way too big. So brute force isn't feasible here.\n\nAlternative idea: Think of this as an optimization problem with constraints. The constraints are that for each restriction, the maximum in the interval [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. And we want to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe dynamic programming? Or perhaps some kind of greedy approach?\n\nWait, but for small n (like 50), maybe we can model it with some backtracking or recursive approach with memoization. However, even for n=50, trying all possibilities isn't feasible. So another approach is needed.\n\nAnother thought: For each position, the maximum allowed height is determined by all the restrictions that apply to it. But since a restriction applies to a range, the maximum height of any house in that range can't exceed x_i. However, the maximum of the range is constrained by the minimum of all x_i that cover that range. Wait, not exactly. Because each restriction applies to a range. For example, if there's a restriction that says the max in [1,3] is <= 2, and another that says [2,3] is <= 3, then for position 2, the max allowed would be min(2,3) = 2. But maybe that's not the case. Because the first restriction applies to the entire range, so the max in [1,3] must be <= 2. So each individual house in that range can be up to 2. But if there's another restriction that allows a higher value in a subset of that range, but the overall max is still constrained by the first restriction.\n\nSo perhaps for each position, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and all the x_i from restrictions that include that position in their [l_i, r_i] range. But that's not correct. Because a restriction might not directly apply to a position, but if the maximum in some range that includes that position is constrained, then that position's height could be higher than the x_i of that restriction. For example, suppose there's a restriction that says the max in [1,3] is <= 2. Then each of positions 1, 2, 3 can be at most 2. But if there's another restriction that says the max in [2,3] is <= 3. Then the first restriction is more restrictive. So the maximum for position 2 is 2, not 3. So for each position, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and all x_i from restrictions that cover that position in their ranges. Wait, no. Because the restriction applies to the maximum of the entire range. For example, if a restriction says that in [1,3], the max is <= x. Then each of the positions in that range can be up to x. But if there's another restriction that says in [1,2], the max is <= y, which is higher than x. Then the first restriction is more restrictive. So the maximum for position 1 and 2 can be up to x. So the maximum for any position is the minimum of all x_i where that position is in [l_i, r_i], and also h. But that's not entirely accurate. Because if there's a restriction that applies to a range that includes the position, but other restrictions that don't include the position. For example, if a position is in a range [l_i, r_i] with x_i = 3, and another restriction that applies to a different range that doesn't include that position, but allows higher values. Then the position's maximum is 3. However, if there's a restriction that applies to a range that includes the position and has x_i = 5, and another that applies to a range that includes the position and x_i = 3, then the position's maximum is 3.\n\nSo, for each position i, the maximum height allowed is the minimum of h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include position i in their [l_i, r_i] range. Because if any restriction applies to that position's range, then the maximum in that range can't exceed x_i. Therefore, the individual position's height can't exceed x_i. But if there are multiple restrictions that apply to ranges that include position i, then the maximum allowed for that position is the minimum of all those x_i's. Because if one restriction requires that in a certain range, the maximum is <= x, then the position's height can't be higher than x. So for each position, the maximum possible height is min(h, min of all x_i for restrictions that include that position in their range).\n\nWait, but that's only if the restriction applies to that position. For example, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then each position in 1-3 can be at most 2. However, if there's a restriction on [2,3] with x=3, then the first restriction is more restrictive. So for position 2, the maximum is 2. But for position 3, the maximum is min(2, 3) = 2. So yes, the maximum for each position is the minimum of h and the x_i's of all restrictions that include that position in their ranges. Because if any restriction includes that position, then the maximum in that range is limited by that x_i. Therefore, the position's height can't be higher than that x_i. Hence, for each position, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i's that include that position, and h.\n\nWait, but what if there are no restrictions that include a position? Then the maximum is h.\n\nSo, if I can compute for each position the maximum allowed height, then the optimal solution is to set each position to that maximum allowed height. Because the sum of squares would be maximized when each position is as high as possible. But is that correct?\n\nWait, but what if there are overlapping restrictions. For example, suppose there's a restriction on [1, 2] with x=3, and another restriction on [2, 3] with x=2. Then for position 2, the maximum allowed is 2. But for position 1, the maximum is 3 (since only the first restriction applies to it). Position 3's maximum is 2. Now, the maximum in [1,2] is 3 (position 1) and 2 (position 2). So the maximum is 3, which violates the first restriction. Oh wait! Because the first restriction says that the maximum in [1,2] must be at most 3. Which is satisfied, since the maximum is 3. So that's okay. But if the first restriction was x=2, then the maximum allowed for position 1 would be 2. But if there's a restriction on [1,2] with x=2, and a restriction on [2,3] with x=3. Then for position 2, the maximum allowed is min(2,3)=2. So the maximum in [1,2] is 2 (since position 1 can be 2, position 2 can be 2). So that satisfies the first restriction. So the approach of setting each position to the minimum of all x_i that apply to it, and h, would satisfy all the restrictions.\n\nWait, but how do we know that this approach will satisfy all restrictions?\n\nBecause for each restriction [l_i, r_i], the maximum of the positions in that range is the maximum of their individual allowed heights. Since each position in that range has their allowed maximum as the minimum of x_i's that apply to them. But how do we know that the maximum of that range is <= x_i for that restriction?\n\nLet me think. Suppose a restriction says that in [l_i, r_i], the maximum must be <= x_i. For each position j in [l_i, r_i], the allowed maximum is the minimum of all x's of restrictions that include j. So for that position j, the allowed maximum is <= x_i (since the current restriction applies to j, and x_i is one of the x's considered for j). Therefore, each position j in [l_i, r_i] can't have a height higher than x_i. Therefore, the maximum of that range is <= x_i. Therefore, the restriction is satisfied.\n\nAh! So that's correct. Therefore, the maximum allowed for each position is the minimum of h and all x_i's of restrictions that include that position. Then, setting each position to that maximum gives a valid configuration. And since each position is as high as possible, the sum of squares would be maximized.\n\nWait, but why can't there be a scenario where lowering some positions' heights allows others to be higher, leading to a better total sum? For example, imagine two positions with allowed maximums of 3 and 3. If there's a restriction that says the max in [1,2] is 2. Then each position's allowed maximum is 2. So sum is 2² + 2² = 8. But if we could set one to 2 and the other to 3, but that would violate the restriction. So no. So in that case, the approach is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two positions, and no restrictions. Then each can be set to h. Sum is 2h². Which is optimal.\n\nBut if there is a restriction that says the max in [1,2] is 3. So each position can be set to 3. Which is optimal.\n\nSo the approach seems correct. Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each position, compute the maximum allowed height, which is the minimum between h and the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include that position in their [l_i, r_i] range. Then, the answer is the sum of squares of these values.\n\nWait, but that seems too easy. But according to the sample input, let's check.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → position 1 is covered by this restriction, so its max is 1.\n\n2 2 3 → position 2's max is 3.\n\n3 3 2 → position 3's max is 2.\n\nSo the sum is 1² + 3² + 2² = 14, which matches the sample. So that works.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → positions 2 and 3 are covered by this restriction. So their max is min(8, ...). \n\nAnother restriction is 3 4 7 → positions 3 and 4 are covered. So for position 3, the min between 8 and 7 is 7. Position 2 is only covered by the first restriction, so 8. Position 4 is covered by the second restriction, so 7. Position 1 is not covered by any restriction, so h=10. So the heights are [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 10² +8² +7² +7² = 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches the sample. So that works.\n\nSo this approach seems correct. So the problem reduces to, for each position, find the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include that position. Then take the minimum between that and h. Then sum squares.\n\nBut how do we compute for each position, the minimal x_i of all restrictions that include it?\n\nSo for each position i (from 1 to n), we need to check all m restrictions. For each restriction, if l_i <= i <= r_i, then we take x_i into account. Then, the minimal x_i among all such restrictions. Then the maximum allowed for position i is min(h, that minimal x_i). If there are no restrictions covering i, then it's h.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward:\n\nInitialize for each position, max_height[i] = h.\n\nThen for each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   for each position i in l to r:\n\n      if x < max_height[i], then set max_height[i] = x.\n\nWait, no. Because for each restriction, the max in the range [l, r] must be <= x. So for each position in that range, the maximum allowed height is at most x. So for each position in that range, we need to take the minimum between their current max_height and x.\n\nYes. So for each restriction, we iterate through all positions in l_i to r_i, and set their max_height to min(current value, x_i).\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, the max_height array is computed. Then sum the squares.\n\nYes. So that seems manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize max_height array as [h] * (n+1) (assuming 1-based indexing).\n\nThen for each of m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = ... \n\n   for i in l to r:\n\n      if x < max_height[i]:\n\n          max_height[i] = x\n\nThen compute sum of (max_height[i]^2) for i from 1 to n.\n\nWait, but that would work? Let me think.\n\nYes. Because for each restriction, we are ensuring that all positions in [l_i, r_i] have their max_height not exceeding x_i. Because for each position in that range, we set it to the minimum between its current value and x_i. So after processing all restrictions, each position's max_height is the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include it, and h.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample, initial max_height is [3,3,3]. Then first restriction is 1-1, x=1. So for position 1, set to min(3,1)=1. Then second restriction is 2-2, x=3. So position 2 is min(3,3) = 3. Third restriction is 3-3, x=2. So position 3 is min(3,2)=2. So the array becomes [3,1,3,2] (assuming indexes 1-3). Then sum is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2 = 14.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example, the second sample. Initial max_height is [10,10,10,10]. Then first restriction is l=2, r=3, x=8. So positions 2 and 3 are set to 8. Then the second restriction is l=3, r=4, x=7. So positions 3 and 4 are set to min(8,7) =7. So the array becomes [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 10² +8² +7² +7² = 262.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the input format.\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then, for the second example, the input is another set of lines. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe input is given as a list of strings, like ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'].\n\nBut in actual code, the input is read from stdin. So perhaps the input is multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first line is the first test case's input. Then the second line is the second test case's input. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nBut the sample input shows two separate inputs. So perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input is given as two separate cases. But in the problem statement's input description, it's not clear. Wait, looking at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Each of the next m lines contains three integers... So the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the actual problem has multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, perhaps the input is a single test case. Wait, the sample input shows two examples, but perhaps the actual code needs to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input is not clear.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of two strings, which probably represents two test cases. For example, the first input line is for the first test case, and the second input line is for the second test case. So the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each with their own n, h, m, and m restrictions.\n\nBut how to read them? Because in the sample input, each test case is given as a single block. For example, the first test case is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo the code needs to read all lines from stdin, split into test cases. But how?\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is described as the first line containing n, h, m, etc. So perhaps the problem expects that there are multiple test cases, each given in the same way. But how many? How to read them?\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the code is given two test cases, and outputs two answers. So perhaps the code needs to read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, it's not specified. However, looking at the sample input and output, it's likely that the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input may have been designed for a single test case. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each with their own input.\n\nBut how to read them in Python?\n\nIn programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem statement may not mention it. But in the sample input given here, the first line is for the first test case, and then the second line is for the second test case. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, split into test cases, each starting with a line of n, h, m, followed by m lines.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them as a list. For example, the code can read all input as a list of lines, and process them sequentially.\n\nSo the code would:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nThen, process each test case by reading the first line (n, h, m), then the next m lines as the restrictions. Then, process the next test case, etc.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think.\n\nIn the sample input, the first test case has 1 + 3 lines (the first line is n, h, m, then 3 lines of restrictions). The second test case has 1 + 2 lines. So the code can process the input as follows:\n\nRead all the lines into a list. Then, process each test case by taking the first line as n, h, m, then the next m lines as restrictions. Then, after processing, the remaining lines are for the next test case.\n\nBut how to handle this in code? Let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all the lines from stdin using sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nThen, process the lines as follows:\n\nlines = list of all lines.\n\ncurrent_index = 0\n\nwhile current_index < len(lines):\n\n   read the line at current_index as n, h, m.\n\n   current_index += 1\n\n   then read the next m lines as the restrictions.\n\n   process the test case.\n\n   current_index += m\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as two separate test cases. So the code must handle that.\n\nBut perhaps in the original problem, the input is a single test case. But according to the sample input, it's multiple. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nOutput:\n\n14\n\nThen another input:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput:\n\n262\n\nSo the code needs to process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must read all test cases.\n\nSo the code will have to process multiple test cases, each with their own n, h, m, and m restrictions.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess each test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nInitialize max_height array as [h] * (n+1) (since positions are 1-based).\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = map(int, line.split())\n\n   for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n       if x < max_height[i]:\n\n           max_height[i] = x\n\nThen compute the sum of squares of max_height[1..n].\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, for each test case, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut how to read the input? Let's think about that.\n\nIn code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n, h, m\n\n        if not lines[idx].strip():\n\n            idx +=1\n\n            continue\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        max_height = [h]*(n+1) # positions 0 to n, but 0 unused\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n\n            if idx >= len(lines):\n\n                break\n\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n            idx +=1\n\n            for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n                if x < max_height[i]:\n\n                    max_height[i] = x\n\n        total = 0\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n\n            total += max_height[i] **2\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, what if there are empty lines in the input? Probably, the problem's input does not have empty lines. So the code can proceed.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nFirst test case lines:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nmax_height is [3,3,3,3]\n\nProcessing the first restriction (1,1,1):\n\nfor i in 1..1:\n\nset max_height[1] to min(3, 1) =1.\n\nThen second restriction (2,2,3): for i=2, set to min(3,3) → 3.\n\nThird restriction (3,3,2): i=3 → set to 2.\n\nsum is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2 = 14 → correct.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nrestrictions are 2 3 8 and 3 4 7.\n\nInitial max_height is [10,10,10,10,10]\n\nFirst restriction: l=2, r=3, x=8. So positions 2 and 3 are set to 8.\n\nmax_height is [10,10,8,8,10]\n\nSecond restriction: l=3, r=4, x=7. So positions 3 and 4 are set to min(8,7) =7 and min(10,7)=7.\n\nmax_height is [10,10,7,7,7]\n\nsum is 10² +10² +7² +7² = 100 +100 +49 +49 = 298? Wait no, the sample output is 262. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait no. Wait in the second test case, the code reads n=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nThe restrictions are:\n\nFirst restriction: 2 3 8 → l=2, r=3, x=8. So for positions 2 and 3, their max_height is set to 8.\n\nSecond restriction: 3 4 7 → l=3, r=4. For i=3, current value is 8. x=7 is less than 8, so set to 7. For i=4, current value is 10, set to 7.\n\nSo the max_height array is:\n\npositions 1:10, 2:8, 3:7, 4:7.\n\nSum is 10² +8² +7² +7² = 100 + 64 +49 +49 = 262. Which is correct.\n\nAh, because the code uses the initial max_height as h (10) for all positions. So the code is correct.\n\nSo why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought the code had [10,10,8,8,10] after the first restriction. Then the second restriction sets positions 3 and 4 to 7. So the array becomes [10, 10, 7, 7, 7]. So positions 1 is 10, 2 is 8, 3 is 7, 4 is 7. So the sum is 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 +7^2 = 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: if there are no restrictions. Then the max_height is h for all positions. Sum is n * h².\n\nAnother case: overlapping restrictions.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, h=0, m=0. Then sum is 0² =0.\n\nEdge case 2: m=0. All positions can be h. So sum is n*h².\n\nEdge case 3: restrictions that cover the entire range. Like n=5, h=5, m=1, restriction [1,5, 3]. Then all positions are 3. Sum is 5*9=45.\n\nAnother edge case: a restriction that is redundant. For example, a restriction [1, 2, 5], and another [1,2, 4]. The code will process both. For each position in 1-2, the code will first set to 5, then to 4. So the final value is 4.\n\nSo the code correctly takes the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, write the code accordingly.\n\nBut note that in Python, the code needs to read from stdin. Also, note that for each test case, the code processes m lines.\n\nNow, implement that.\n\nBut in the code above, the code reads lines as follows:\n\nRead all lines into a list. Then process each test case.\n\nBut in the code, after reading n, h, m, the code reads m lines for the restrictions.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code may have to handle cases where there are multiple test cases, and the lines are read properly.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        line = lines[idx].strip()\n\n        if not line:\n\n            idx +=1\n\n            continue\n\n        # parse n, h, m\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, line.split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        max_height = [h] * (n + 1)  # 1-based indexing\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n\n            if idx >= len(lines):\n\n                break  # shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n            idx +=1\n\n            for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n                if x < max_height[i]:\n\n                    max_height[i] = x\n\n        total = 0\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n\n            total += max_height[i] **2\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, what if there are empty lines in the input? For example, if the input has blank lines between test cases. The code skips them by checking if the line is empty. But in the problem statement, the input is probably well-formed, so that's not necessary. However, the code handles it.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input, each test case is given as per the input description. So the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nBut in reality, the code reads the lines as per the input. So when the code is run with the sample input, the code will process each test case correctly.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height, and each restriction specifies the maximum allowable height for the tallest house in a specific range of spots.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Restrictions**: Each restriction imposes a limit on the maximum height of the tallest house within a specified range. For each spot, the maximum allowable height is determined by the minimum of all restrictions that apply to that spot.\n2. **Initialization**: Start with the maximum possible height for each spot, which is the given maximum height `h`.\n3. **Apply Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the maximum allowable height for each spot within the specified range to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n4. **Calculate Profit**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the heights of all houses.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        line = lines[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, h, m = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        max_height = [h] * (n + 1)  # 1-based indexing\n        for _ in range(m):\n            if idx >= len(lines):\n                break\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n            idx += 1\n            for i in range(l, r + 1):\n                if x < max_height[i]:\n                    max_height[i] = x\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            total += max_height[i] ** 2\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing.\n2. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize an array `max_height` where each element starts at the maximum allowable height `h`.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, iterate over the specified range of spots and update the maximum allowable height for each spot to ensure it adheres to the restriction.\n4. **Profit Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the heights of the houses, which are now constrained by the restrictions.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the constraints efficiently. The complexity is manageable due to the small constraints (up to 50 spots, restrictions, and height), making a direct approach feasible.",
