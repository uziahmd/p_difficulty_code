Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's try to understand what the problem is asking for.\n\nSo the problem is about directing the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The given flow values for each edge are already determined, but their directions are not. The task is to assign directions to each edge so that:\n\n1. For every vertex except the source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So, conservation of flow holds.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The resulting directed graph must not have any cycles.\n\nHmm. Also, the maximum flow is already computed, so the direction assignment must be such that the flow is a valid maximum flow.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, since the flow is a maximum flow, the sum of flows leaving the source should equal the total maximum flow. But how does that help here?\n\nThe key constraints are the flow conservation and acyclicity. Also, the directed graph must be acyclic. So perhaps we can model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how do we assign directions to edges to satisfy all these conditions?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each vertex v (not source or sink), the net flow must be zero. Which means that the sum of flows going into v equals the sum going out. \n\nBut since each edge has a fixed flow value, the direction of the edge determines whether it contributes to incoming or outgoing for each node.\n\nAnother observation: the problem requires the directed graph to be acyclic. So, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order such that all edges go from earlier nodes to later ones. That would ensure no cycles. But how to determine this order?\n\nWait, but the source (node 1) must have no incoming edges. So, in the topological order, node 1 must come first. Similarly, the sink (node n) can have incoming edges but no outgoing edges? Not necessarily. But the sink can have outgoing edges, but the flow conservation doesn't apply to it.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can construct a DAG where node 1 is the root, and all edges are directed in a way that follows some hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, think about the flow as a DAG with edges directed in such a way that there's a topological order. Then, for each node except the source and sink, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nWait, but how to model the flow conservation. Let me consider the flow as a function on the edges. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows directed out of v. \n\nSo, for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to v, with direction towards v, must equal the sum of flows on edges incident to v, directed away from v. Which implies that for each such node, the total flow through edges incident to it is even? No, because each edge contributes to exactly one direction. So for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum on those directed out. Which means that the total sum of flows on edges incident to v is twice the inflow (since inflow = outflow). Wait, no. Because each edge contributes once to either inflow or outflow. So, for example, if a node has edges with total flow sum S, then inflow plus outflow is S. But since inflow equals outflow, then 2*inflow = S. Therefore, S must be even? Or maybe not, because for the source and sink, the inflow and outflow are not required to be equal.\n\nBut the problem says that the flow is a maximum flow. So the source's outflow is the total maximum flow. The sink's inflow is the same. For other nodes, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nBut how does this help me?\n\nMaybe I need to model this as a directed graph where the direction of each edge is chosen such that the flow conservation holds, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nAnother idea: Since the graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. For example, node 1 is first, then others in some order, and node n last. Then, all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes. This ensures no cycles. But how to choose this order so that flow conservation holds?\n\nBut how to find such an order?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where the flow conservation holds. Let's consider the flow as a directed graph. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows entering equals the sum leaving. Which implies that the net flow (outflow - inflow) is zero. For the source, the net outflow is equal to the total flow. For the sink, the net inflow is equal to the total flow.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that the flow is a valid flow. Then, to ensure that the graph is acyclic, we can find a topological order.\n\nBut how to find such directions?\n\nWait, the problem says that the flow is already a maximum flow. So the given ci's are the flow values. So the sum of all flows leaving the source equals the maximum flow, and the sum of flows entering the sink equals that same value. For other nodes, the sum of flows entering equals the sum leaving.\n\nBut the problem is that the edges are undirected, and we need to assign directions so that the flow is valid and the graph is acyclic.\n\nLet me think of the flow as a directed graph. The flow conservation is already satisfied. The only thing left is to assign directions to the edges so that the flow is represented correctly, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAn alternative idea: The directed graph must be a DAG. So, we can assign directions such that the edges form a DAG with the source as the root and the sink as the end. So, perhaps we can perform a topological sort and direct all edges according to that order.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order that satisfies the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow as a DAG where each node (except source and sink) has equal inflow and outflow. So, the flow conservation is already satisfied. But the direction of edges is not known.\n\nWait, but the flow conservation is already given. So for each node except source and sink, the total flow through edges connected to it is even? Because inflow equals outflow, which implies that the sum of flows on edges connected to the node is 2 * inflow. So the total sum of flows on edges connected to the node must be even. But since the problem says that the input is valid (a solution exists), this must hold.\n\nBut how to proceed.\n\nAnother thought: The problem requires that the directed graph is acyclic. So, we can build a DAG where the edges are directed in such a way that there's a topological order. For example, we can assign a direction to each edge such that it goes from a node with lower potential to higher potential. Then, the DAG will be acyclic. But how to define the potentials.\n\nBut how to compute the potentials. Maybe using the flow values. For example, considering the flow as a directed graph, but since the original edges are undirected, we need to assign directions.\n\nWait, but the flow is a valid maximum flow. So, for each edge, the flow is either from u to v or from v to u. But how to find this direction.\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow as a directed graph. The flow conservation holds. Then, the underlying graph (ignoring direction) is the given graph. But how to assign directions to edges to make it a DAG.\n\nWait, but the flow is a valid flow. So, the residual network may have certain properties. However, perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nLet me think about the problem again. We need to assign directions to edges such that:\n\n- The flow conservation holds (for nodes except source and sink)\n- The source has no incoming edges.\n- The graph is acyclic.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in such a way that the flow is a valid flow, and the DAG condition holds.\n\nBut how to find such directions.\n\nAnother idea: Since the graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's say the topological order starts with the source (node 1), ends with the sink (node n), and all edges are directed from earlier to later nodes. Then, the graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows into it from earlier nodes must equal the sum of flows going out to later nodes. How can we ensure that?\n\nBut how to compute such a topological order.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of finding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the given flow values on edges, and satisfying the flow conservation.\n\nLet me think of the flow as a directed graph. For each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows entering equals the sum leaving. So, the net flow is zero.\n\nIn such a case, the directed graph must be a DAG. But how to construct it.\n\nWait, the flow is a valid maximum flow. So, the flow is a valid flow in the original undirected graph. But the direction of edges is not known.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the given ci's are the flow values. So, each edge has a certain flow, and the direction must be chosen such that for each edge, the flow is directed in one of the two possible directions.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning directions to edges such that the flow conservation holds, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAnother approach: Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG with the source as the root, and the sink as the leaf.\n\nLet me think of building a tree structure. For example, if we can find a spanning tree of the graph, and direct all edges in the tree away from the source. Then, for non-tree edges, direct them in a way that maintains the DAG property.\n\nBut how to handle the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal inflow and outflow. And the graph is acyclic.\n\nThis seems similar to finding an Euler tour, but not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find a way to assign directions such that for each node, the inflow equals the outflow, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the flow as a directed graph. For each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges entering v equals the sum on edges leaving v. So, for each such node, the total flow of edges incident to it is even (since sum_in = sum_out, sum_in + sum_out = total_flow = 2 * sum_in).\n\nBut how to use this.\n\nAnother idea: For each node, except source and sink, the net flow (sum of flows on edges directed away from the node minus sum of flows directed into the node) is zero. For the source, the net flow is the total flow (sum of flows leaving minus sum of flows entering, which is the total flow since no incoming edges). For the sink, the net flow is negative of that.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges to satisfy this.\n\nThis sounds like a problem of finding a directed graph where the net flow for each node is as required. But since the flow values are given, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations.\n\nBut solving such a system for large n and m (up to 2e5) is computationally impossible.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the graph must be acyclic, we can assign directions based on a topological order. Let's imagine that we have a topological order where node 1 is first, node n is last, and all edges are directed from earlier to later nodes. Then, the graph is acyclic. Now, for each node in the middle, the sum of flows entering from earlier nodes must equal the sum of flows leaving to later nodes.\n\nBut how to compute such a topological order.\n\nWait, but how can we compute this order? For example, for each node, we can compute the difference between the sum of flows directed into it and out of it. But since the direction hasn't been determined yet, this seems circular.\n\nAnother idea: Think of the problem as building a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that the flow is a valid flow, and the graph is a DAG. To achieve this, perhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source, and assign directions based on the traversal order.\n\nFor example, during a BFS traversal, whenever we visit a node, we direct the edges from the current node to the next node. This would create a DAG. But how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal inflow and outflow. To achieve this, we can model it as a directed graph where each node's inflow equals outflow, and the graph is a DAG.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as building a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG. For each node (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into the node equals the sum on edges directed out. \n\nTo do this, perhaps we can construct a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero. This is similar to finding an Eulerian trail, but for a DAG.\n\nWait, but how to find such a direction.\n\nAnother idea inspired by flow networks: In a standard flow network, the flow conservation holds for all nodes except source and sink. So, the given flow values (ci) are already such that the flow conservation holds. The problem is to assign directions to edges such that the flow is represented as a directed graph and the DAG condition holds.\n\nBut how to assign directions. For example, for each edge between u and v, the direction is chosen such that the flow is from u to v or v to u. The direction must be such that the overall flow is valid and the DAG is formed.\n\nBut how to find such directions.\n\nPerhaps the key is to find a way to assign directions so that the graph is a DAG, and for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows into the node equals the sum of flows out of it.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can assign directions to edges in such a way that the graph becomes a DAG, and the flow conservation holds. One way to ensure that the graph is a DAG is to assign directions based on a topological order. So, if we can find a topological order where the source is first and the sink is last, and for each node in the order, the sum of flows from previous nodes equals the sum of flows to later nodes.\n\nBut how to find such an order.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of finding a directed acyclic graph where the flow conservation holds. This can be modeled as a directed graph with certain properties. However, I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nWait, another idea. Since the graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a linear order such that all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes. Then, the graph is acyclic. Now, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows coming from earlier nodes (i.e., the inflow) must equal the sum of flows going to later nodes (the outflow). How can we ensure this?\n\nLet me think of the nodes in order. Suppose we have a list of nodes ordered as v1, v2, ..., vn, where v1 is the source (1), vn is the sink (n). For each node vi (i not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges from vi to nodes after it must equal the sum of flows on edges from nodes before vi to vi.\n\nBut how to compute this order.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an order where for each node, the inflow from earlier nodes equals the outflow to later nodes. \n\nThis feels similar to a problem where we need to process nodes in a certain order, adjusting the flow accordingly.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a certain \"balance\" that needs to be satisfied. For example, the balance is the difference between the inflow and outflow. For nodes other than source and sink, this balance must be zero. \n\nBut since the edges are undirected, and we can choose their direction, perhaps we can model this as a problem of finding a way to direct edges such that the balance is zero for all non-source/sink nodes.\n\nBut how to do this while ensuring the graph is acyclic.\n\nAnother thought: The graph must be a DAG, so we can assign a topological order. Once we have that, we can direct all edges in the order of the topological sort. But how to find the topological order such that the flow conservation holds.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we can perform a DFS traversal, and assign directions based on the traversal. For example, when we visit a node, we direct the edges to unvisited nodes as outgoing. This way, the graph is a DAG. But again, how to ensure the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to ensure that the flow conservation holds for each node.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute for each node (except source and sink) the total flow of edges incident to it. Since the flow conservation requires that the sum of flows into the node equals the sum of flows out, the total flow for the node must be even. But since the problem states that a solution exists, this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to use this.\n\nWait, for a node v, the total flow of edges incident to it is S. Then, the inflow is S/2, and outflow is S/2.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges so that for each node, the sum of flows directed into it is S/2.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that each node's inflow is S/2.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a flow decomposition, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For each node, we can compute the required net outflow. For the source, the net outflow is equal to the total flow. For the sink, the net inflow is equal to the total flow. For other nodes, the net outflow is zero.\n\nBut since the edges are undirected, and the direction is to be determined, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node has a required net outflow. Then, the problem reduces to finding an orientation of edges that satisfies these net outflow requirements.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of orienting edges in a graph to satisfy certain degree constraints. For example, in the case of an Eulerian trail, each node must have even degree, and we can orient the edges to form trails.\n\nBut in this case, the net outflow for each node is known. Let me think:\n\nLet’s denote for each node v, the required net outflow as d(v). For the source, d(1) = total_flow. For the sink, d(n) = -total_flow. For other nodes, d(v) = 0.\n\nThen, for each edge between u and v, we can choose to direct it from u to v (which contributes +c to u's net outflow and -c to v's net outflow), or from v to u (which contributes -c to u's net outflow and +c to v's net outflow).\n\nThe sum of all d(v) must be zero. Indeed:\n\nd(1) + d(n) + sum_{others} d(v) = total_flow - total_flow + 0 = 0. So yes.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid problem of finding an orientation of edges such that the net outflow for each node is d(v). \n\nThis is equivalent to finding a directed graph where the net outflow of each node is d(v).\n\nBut how to find such an orientation.\n\nThis problem is known as the \"orientation with prescribed net outflows\" problem. \n\nIn graph theory, this can be solved by constructing a directed graph where each edge is oriented in such a way that the net outflow is achieved. One way to do this is to model it as a flow problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is connected, and the required net outflows are feasible (as per the problem statement), we can use a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can start with the source node, and assign directions to edges connected to it. Since the source cannot have incoming edges, all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Then, for each such edge, the flow contributes to the net outflow of the source, and the net inflow of the other node.\n\nBut then, for the other nodes, we need to adjust their net outflows accordingly.\n\nFor example, suppose we have an edge between node 1 (source) and node u with flow c. We direct it from 1 to u. This contributes +c to the net outflow of 1, and -c to the net outflow of u. \n\nNow, for node u, its required net outflow is initially 0. After this step, the net outflow for u is -c. To balance this, we need to direct other edges connected to u in such a way that their contributions add up to +c.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be addressed with a BFS or DFS approach, where we process nodes and adjust their net outflows by directing edges appropriately.\n\nLet me formalize this. For each node, we maintain a variable called 'balance', which represents the required net outflow that still needs to be achieved. Initially, the balance for the source is total_flow, and for the sink it's -total_flow. For others, it's zero.\n\nWe can process nodes in a certain order, and for each node, direct edges to other nodes to reduce their balance.\n\nFor example, let's take the source node. Its balance is total_flow. For each edge connected to the source, we direct it away from the source. This reduces the source's balance by c (since we've contributed +c to its net outflow), and adds -c to the balance of the adjacent node.\n\nOnce the source is processed, we move to other nodes. For each node, if its balance is not zero, we need to direct edges to other nodes to adjust the balance.\n\nBut how to choose which edges to direct.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph where each node's balance is adjusted by directing edges. This resembles the problem of finding an Eulerian trail, but again, not sure.\n\nBut here's an idea inspired by the standard approach for finding an Eulerian trail: \n\nWe can perform a BFS or DFS traversal, maintaining the balance of each node. When visiting a node, we look for edges that can be directed to reduce the balance of the current node.\n\nFor example, suppose we are processing node u, and its balance is b. We need to find an edge from u to some other node v, such that directing it from u to v would help us adjust the balance. \n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\nFor each node u, if the current balance is positive, it means that we need to send more outflow from u. So, we can look for an edge connecting u to another node v where the balance of v is negative (so that directing the edge from u to v would decrease the balance of u by c and increase the balance of v by c).\n\nAlternatively, if the balance of u is negative, we need to receive more outflow into u. So, we look for an edge from some node v to u, which would contribute to u's balance.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThis seems like a possible approach. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the total_flow, which is the sum of flows of edges incident to the source (since the source has no incoming edges, all its edges are directed away from it, and thus the total_flow is the sum of flows of edges connected to it). Wait, no. The total_flow is the sum of flows leaving the source. But since the source's edges are directed away, the total_flow is indeed the sum of flows of edges connected to the source. However, this might not be accurate if the source is connected to multiple edges. But since the problem says that the given ci's are part of a valid maximum flow, this must be correct.\n\nBut how to calculate the total_flow. Well, for the source, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it is the total_flow. But since all edges connected to the source must be directed away, the total_flow is the sum of ci for edges connected to the source. However, this might not be correct, because the source could be connected to edges that are not directly part of the maximum flow. Wait, no. The given ci's are the flow values of the edges. So, the sum of flows leaving the source is the total_flow. But since the source can't have incoming edges, the sum of flows on edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Thus, the total_flow is the sum of flows on edges connected to the source. However, this may not be the case. For example, if the source has an edge to node u, and that edge is part of the flow, but the flow could be directed in either way. But according to the problem's constraints, the source must have no incoming edges. So for any edge connected to the source, it must be directed away from it. Hence, the total_flow is the sum of all ci's for edges connected to the source. \n\nWait, but the source can have multiple edges. For example, if there are two edges from source to node A and B, each with flow ci. Then the total_flow is ci1 + ci2. \n\nSo, the first step is to compute the total_flow as the sum of flows of all edges incident to the source. However, this is not correct. Because, in reality, the total_flow is the amount of flow leaving the source. But the source may have edges that are not part of the maximum flow. However, since the problem states that the given ci's are part of the maximum flow, the sum of flows leaving the source must equal the total_flow. But how to compute it?\n\nActually, the total_flow is the sum of flows leaving the source. Since the source can't have incoming edges, all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Therefore, the sum of flows on edges connected to the source is the total_flow. \n\nBut this is not necessarily true. For example, suppose the source is connected to node A with an edge of flow 10. But that edge could be part of a cycle in the undirected graph, and the flow is directed from A to source. However, the problem says that the source has no incoming edges. So this is not allowed. Hence, all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Therefore, the sum of the flows on those edges is the total_flow.\n\nSo, to compute the total_flow, we can sum the flows of all edges connected to the source. \n\nOnce we have the total_flow, we can proceed to assign directions to the edges.\n\nNow, back to the approach of using a balance for each node. Let's define balance[v] as the required net outflow for node v. Initially, balance[1] = total_flow, balance[n] = -total_flow, and balance[v] = 0 for other nodes.\n\nFor each edge, we need to direct it in a way that contributes to the balance of its endpoints.\n\nThe algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize balance for all nodes.\n\nCreate a data structure to keep track of the edges for each node (adjacency list).\n\nUse a queue or stack to process nodes. Start with the source node.\n\nWhile there are nodes with non-zero balance:\n\n   Take a node u with non-zero balance.\n\n   For each edge connected to u that hasn't been directed yet:\n\n      Let v be the other endpoint of the edge.\n\n      If balance[u] > 0: we want to direct the edge from u to v. This would reduce balance[u] by ci, and increase balance[v] by ci.\n\n      If balance[u] < 0: we want to direct the edge from v to u. This would increase balance[u] by ci (since the net outflow of u increases by -ci, because the edge is now directed into u, contributing to inflow, which decreases net outflow by ci. Or wait, let's think carefully.\n\nThe net outflow of u is the sum of flows on edges directed away from u minus the sum of flows on edges directed into u.\n\nWhen we direct an edge from u to v, it adds +ci to the net outflow of u and -ci to the net outflow of v. \n\nWhen we direct an edge from v to u, it adds -ci to the net outflow of u and +ci to the net outflow of v.\n\nSo, for a node u with balance[u] (required net outflow) being positive, we want to send as much as possible from u to others. So, we can pick an edge connected to u and direct it away from u.\n\nBut how to choose which edge to direct.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be handled with a BFS or DFS approach, processing nodes and directing edges as needed.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nWe can process the nodes in a BFS-like manner. Start with the source node. For each node u in the queue, we look at all its edges. For each edge (u, v) that hasn't been directed yet, we check if balance[u] is non-zero. If balance[u] is positive, we direct the edge from u to v, subtract ci from balance[u], and add ci to balance[v]. Then, we add v to the queue if balance[v] is non-zero. If balance[u] is negative, we need to direct the edge from v to u. But this would require that v has some balance that allows this.\n\nWait, but how to decide which edge to take when balance[u] is negative. For example, if u has a negative balance, it means that it needs to receive more flow. So, we need to find an edge connected to u that is directed into u. But how to find such edges.\n\nThis seems challenging. Perhaps, during the BFS, we can always process nodes with non-zero balance, and for each such node, we find an edge to direct in a way that reduces their balance.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have node u with balance[u] = +5. It has an edge to node v with ci = 3. We direct the edge from u to v. balance[u] becomes 5-3=2, balance[v] becomes 0+3=3. Now, v has balance 3. We add v to the queue. Next, when we process v, we look for edges. Suppose v has another edge to w with ci=2. We direct it from v to w. balance[v] becomes 3-2=1, balance[w] becomes 0+2=2. Add w to the queue.\n\nEventually, this process continues until all balances are zero.\n\nBut what if there's a situation where the node u has balance[u] = +5, but all edges are connected to nodes with balance zero? Then, we need to find an edge that can be directed in a way that reduces the balance of u.\n\nBut since the problem states that a solution exists, this situation must be resolvable.\n\nThis seems like a viable approach. The key is to process nodes with non-zero balance and direct their edges in a way that reduces the balance.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the total_flow as the sum of flows on edges connected to the source.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the total_flow is the sum of flows leaving the source. Since the source's edges must be directed away from it, the sum of flows of edges connected to the source is the total_flow. But how to compute that. For example, for each edge that connects to the source, we add its ci to the total_flow.\n\nYes. So, for all edges where ai == 1 or bi == 1, we add their ci to the total_flow.\n\nBut wait, the source can have multiple edges. So, the total_flow is the sum of all flows on edges connected to the source. But since the source's edges are directed away, their contribution is added to the total_flow.\n\nOnce we have the total_flow, we can set the balance for the source as total_flow and the sink as -total_flow.\n\nThen, for all other nodes, balance is zero.\n\nThen, we need to process the edges.\n\nBut how to track which edges have been directed. For each edge, we can track whether it has been processed or not.\n\nBut for large m (up to 2e5), we need an efficient way to process edges.\n\nLet me think of the following steps in code:\n\n- Build adjacency lists for each node, keeping track of the edges (and their indices).\n\n- For each node, maintain a list of edges that are not yet directed.\n\n- Use a queue to process nodes with non-zero balance.\n\n- For each node u dequeued, iterate through its edges. For each edge that hasn't been directed yet:\n\n   Let v be the other node.\n\n   If balance[u] > 0:\n\n      Direct the edge from u to v. So, set the direction for this edge to 0 (if the original was ai, bi) or 1 (if it was bi, ai). Wait, but how to track the original direction. For example, each edge is stored as (ai, bi, ci). When we direct it from u to v, we need to check if u is ai or bi.\n\n      For example, suppose the edge is between u and v, and the original input is (ai, bi, ci). If u is ai and v is bi, then direction is 0. If u is bi and v is ai, then direction is 1. Otherwise, it's an error? No, because the edge is undirected, but during processing, we're choosing the direction.\n\n      So, for each edge, once directed, we can record whether it is ai→bi (0) or bi→ai (1).\n\n      So, during processing, when we choose to direct the edge from u to v, we check if u is the first or second node in the original edge. If the original edge is (ai, bi), then if u is ai, we set direction 0. If u is bi, we set direction 1. Otherwise, we have a mistake, but since the graph is undirected, this can't happen. Because the edge is between u and v, and the original edge is stored as (ai, bi), which is one of u and v.\n\n   Then, subtract ci from balance[u], add ci to balance[v].\n\n   Mark the edge as directed.\n\n   If balance[v] is not zero, add it to the queue.\n\n   Break out of the loop for this edge, since we've processed it.\n\n   Else if balance[u] < 0:\n\n      We need to direct the edge from v to u. So, the direction is set accordingly. Then, add ci to balance[u], subtract ci from balance[v].\n\n      Mark the edge as directed.\n\n      If balance[v] is not zero, add it to the queue.\n\n      Break out of the loop for this edge.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Do nothing, since balance[u] is zero.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the case where balance[u] is zero. But we only process nodes with non-zero balance, so this shouldn't happen.\n\nBut during processing, after directing an edge, the balance of u may become zero, but we process nodes only when their balance is non-zero.\n\nThis seems like a viable approach.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the edge is between u and v, and we are trying to direct it from u to v, but v has a balance that is not compatible. However, since the problem guarantees a solution exists, this process should eventually terminate with all balances zero.\n\nLet me test this approach on the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nThe edges are:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2 with ci=10\n\nEdge 2: 1-2 with ci=10\n\nEdge 3: 3-1 with ci=5\n\nTotal_flow is sum of flows on edges connected to source (node 1). Edges connected to node 1 are edge 2 (1-2) and edge 3 (3-1). Their ci's are 10 and 5. So total_flow is 15.\n\nInitial balance:\n\nbalance[1] = 15\n\nbalance[2] = 0\n\nbalance[3] = -15\n\nNow, process node 1 (balance is 15).\n\nCheck its edges. Edge 2 (1-2) and edge 3 (1-3).\n\nTake edge 2 first. Since balance[1] is 15>0, direct it from 1 to 2. Subtract 10 from balance[1], balance[1] becomes 5. Add 10 to balance[2], which becomes 10. Add node 2 to the queue.\n\nThen, check edge 3 (1-3). balance[1] is 5>0. Direct it from 1 to 3. Subtract 5 from balance[1], balance[1] becomes 0. Add 5 to balance[3], which was -15, now becomes -10. Add node 3 to the queue.\n\nNow, queue has node 2 and node 3.\n\nProcess node 2 (balance is 10).\n\nIts edges are edge 1 (3-2), edge 2 (directed from 1 to 2). So, edge 1 is und",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies the conditions of a valid maximum flow, with no cycles and proper flow conservation at each node except the source and sink.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Flow Conservation**: For each node (except the source and sink), the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows.\n2. **Acyclic Graph Requirement**: The directed graph must be acyclic. This can be achieved by ensuring that edges are directed in a way that follows a topological order.\n3. **Balance Calculation**: Calculate the required net outflow for each node. The source has a positive net outflow equal to the total flow, and the sink has a negative net outflow equal to the total flow. All other nodes have zero net outflow.\n4. **Greedy Edge Direction Assignment**: Use a BFS approach to process nodes starting from the source. For each node, direct edges to reduce the balance (net outflow) until all balances are zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    edges = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]  # 1-based indexing\n    for i in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        adj[a].append((b, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, i))\n    \n    # Compute total_flow as sum of flows on edges connected to source (node 1)\n    total_flow = 0\n    for a, b, c in edges:\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            total_flow += c\n    \n    balance = [0] * (n + 1)\n    balance[1] = total_flow\n    balance[n] = -total_flow\n    \n    # To track which edges are processed\n    processed = [False] * m\n    direction = [0] * m  # 0 means original direction (ai -> bi), 1 otherwise\n    \n    q = deque()\n    q.append(1)\n    \n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        for (v, edge_idx) in adj[u]:\n            if processed[edge_idx]:\n                continue\n            # Check if this edge is already processed\n            # Find the original a and b for this edge\n            a_orig, b_orig, c_orig = edges[edge_idx]\n            if u == a_orig and v == b_orig:\n                # Edge is a_orig -> b_orig\n                pass\n            elif u == b_orig and v == a_orig:\n                # Edge is b_orig -> a_orig\n                pass\n            else:\n                # This should not happen since adj is built properly\n                pass\n            \n            if balance[u] > 0:\n                # Direct from u to v\n                direction[edge_idx] = 0 if (a_orig == u and b_orig == v) else 1\n                processed[edge_idx] = True\n                balance[u] -= c_orig\n                balance[v] += c_orig\n                if balance[v] != 0:\n                    q.append(v)\n                break\n            elif balance[u] < 0:\n                # Direct from v to u\n                direction[edge_idx] = 0 if (a_orig == v and b_orig == u) else 1\n                processed[edge_idx] = True\n                balance[u] += c_orig\n                balance[v] -= c_orig\n                if balance[v] != 0:\n                    q.append(v)\n                break\n    \n    for d in direction:\n        print(d)\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into edges and adjacency lists for efficient traversal.\n2. **Total Flow Calculation**: The total flow from the source is calculated by summing the flows of all edges connected to the source.\n3. **Balance Initialization**: Each node's balance is initialized based on its role (source, sink, or intermediate).\n4. **BFS Processing**: Using a queue, nodes are processed to direct edges such that the balance for each node is adjusted towards zero.
