For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the definitions properly. Let me re-read the problem statement to make sure I get the details right.\n\nA major triad is when, after ordering the notes X, Y, Z, the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. For a minor triad, it's the opposite: X to Y is 3 semitones and Y to Z is 4. The order of the notes in the triad doesn't matter since it's an unordered set. So I need to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any of them satisfy either the major or minor condition.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Convert each note into its corresponding semitone value. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H (which is B in some notations, but here according to the problem statement, the list is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right, so H is the 12th note. Wait, but the list has 12 elements. Let me count:\n\nOriginal list: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. That's 12 notes. So each note can be mapped to a number from 0 to 11. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Then, the next note after H is C again, which is 0. So the distance between two notes is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but considering the direction. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper one. So for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check: C (0) to C# (1) is 1, then D (2), D# (3), E (4). So yes, 4 semitones. But if we have E to C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because the distance is calculated as the number of steps moving upwards. So if you have two notes, X and Y, the distance between them is (Y - X) mod 12, but if Y is lower than X, then you add 12? Or perhaps the distance is (Y - X + 12) % 12? Wait no. For example, between E (4) and C (0), the distance is 8 semitones because moving up from E to C would require going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the way to calculate the distance between two notes is (target - start) mod 12, but if the result is negative, add 12? Wait, no. Wait, if you have X and Y, and you want the distance from X to Y along the scale (so that the distance is the number of semitones you need to move up from X to reach Y). So if Y is higher than X, then it's Y - X. If Y is lower than X, then it's (12 - X + Y). For example, X is E (4), Y is C (0). Then the distance is (0 -4 + 12) = 8. Which is correct. So the formula for the distance between X and Y (from X to Y) is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y - X + 12). Alternatively, (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if Y is less than X, then (Y - X) mod 12 would be the same as (Y - X + 12) mod 12. For example, Y=0, X=4: 0-4 = -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper one",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves converting musical notes into their corresponding semitone values and checking the distances between them according to the definitions of major and minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Semitones**: Convert each musical note (C, C#, D, ..., H) into a numerical value representing its position in the 12-note scale.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between any two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Since the order of notes in a triad doesn't matter, check all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Classification**: Determine if the triad is major, minor, or neither based on the distances between the notes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_semitone(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    semitones = [note_to_semitone(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(semitones):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_semitone` function converts each note to its corresponding index in the list of 12 notes, which represents the semitone positions.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `distance` function calculates the number of semitones from one note to another using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Triad Check**: The `is_major` and `is_minor` functions check if the distances between three notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad, respectively.\n4. **Classification**: The `classify_chord` function checks all permutations of the three notes to see if they form a major or minor triad. If none match, it returns \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the three notes to determine their classification accurately.",
