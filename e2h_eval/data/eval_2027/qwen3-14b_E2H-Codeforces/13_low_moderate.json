For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem mentions that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. So, for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me think: the sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E. So from C to E is 4 semitones. Right. And if you have E to C, since it's cyclic, the distance would be (12 - 4) = 8 semitones? Because going the other way around. But the problem says that the distance is always taken from the lower to upper. Wait, but how do you determine which is lower? Oh, perhaps the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones when moving forward from X to Y. So if X is before Y in the list, then the distance is the difference. But if Y is before X, then the distance would be (Y's position - X's position + 12) mod 12? Or wait, maybe the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that the distance is the minimal steps in the cyclic order? No, no. Wait the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the upper. So for example, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. But between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because you have to go from E up to C, which would be 8 semitones. So the distance is not symmetric. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? No, because if X is C (position 0) and Y is E (position 4), then the distance is 4. If X is E (position 4) and Y is C (position 0), then the distance would be (0 -4 + 12) = 8. So the distance from X to Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper, perhaps the distance is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). So for example, if X is E and Y is C, then the distance is (C's index - E's index) + 12? Because the distance is measured from lower to upper. Wait, but how do we know which is lower? Well, perhaps the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y's index - X's index) if Y is after X in the list, otherwise (Y's index - X's index + 12). So for example, if X is C (index 0) and Y is E (index 4), distance is 4. If X is E (index 4) and Y is C (index 0), then the distance is (0 -4 + 12) = 8. So that's how the distance is calculated. \n\nSo, for each pair of notes, we can compute the distance between them. Now, for a triad, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes to see if any of them satisfy the major or minor conditions.\n\nThe problem says that the triad is unordered, so the three notes can be arranged in any order. For example, for a major triad, there must be an ordering X, Y, Z such that distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. Similarly for minor, the distance between X and Y is 3 and between Y and Z is 4.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Assign each note to its index in the list of 12 notes. Let's create a dictionary mapping note names to their positions. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc. Wait, the note list is given as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is:\n\nLet me list the order:\n\nThe notes are ordered as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in a cyclic musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in the cyclic sequence of 12 notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, compute the distance in semitones from the first note to the second note considering the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Check Permutations**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third note match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Determine Result**: Based on the checks, determine if the triad is major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n    # Calculate the distance from a to b in semitones\n    a_idx = note_to_index(a)\n    b_idx = note_to_index(b)\n    return (b_idx - a_idx) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: The `note_to_index` function maps each note to its position in the list of 12 notes, which helps in calculating distances.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `distance` function computes the number of semitones from one note to another in the cyclic scale using modulo arithmetic.\n3. **Checking Major/Minor Triads**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` check if the distances between the notes in a given permutation match the criteria for major or minor triads.\n4. **Classifying the Chord**: The `classify_chord` function checks all permutations of the three notes to determine if they form a major, minor, or strange chord. The main function reads input, processes it, and prints the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
