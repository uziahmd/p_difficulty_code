    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to count the number of arrays of N sets, each containing integers from 1 to K, such that there's a rearrangement of the array where each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a set A to be a child of set B. The condition is that for every element x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1,2}, then B must have 2 and 3. Wait, no. Because each x in A needs to have x+1 in B. So for x=1, B must have 2. For x=2, B must have 3. So B must contain both 2 and 3. \n\nNow, the problem requires that there exists some permutation of the array of sets such that each consecutive pair satisfies this child relationship. So the challenge is to count all possible arrays of sets that can be ordered in such a way.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since the order can be rearranged, perhaps we can find some structure that allows us to model the sets in a way that their relationships can be ordered. Maybe the key is to model each set as a certain \"level\" or something that allows them to be ordered in a chain.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the entire array can be arranged into a sequence where each set is a child of the next. Let's think of the sets as nodes in a DAG, where there's an edge from A to B if A is a child of B. Then, the problem requires that the array can be ordered as a path through this DAG. But since we can arrange the array in any order, perhaps the problem reduces to ensuring that the sets can be ordered in a chain where each set is a child of the next. However, since the array has N elements, we need to find N sets that can be ordered in a sequence where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nBut how do we count all possible arrays of N sets that can be ordered in such a sequence?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model each set as a subset of {1, ..., K}, and find for each set S, some properties that allow it to be placed in a certain position in the sequence.\n\nLet me think about the constraints on the sets. Suppose we have a sequence of sets S_1', S_2', ..., S_N'. Each S_i' must be a child of S_{i+1}'. So for each x in S_i', x+1 is in S_{i+1}'.\n\nThis implies that for any element x in S_i', there is an element x+1 in S_{i+1}'. Therefore, if we look at the elements across the sequence, each occurrence of x in some set must be followed by x+1 in the next set. So, for example, if a set contains x, then in the next set, there must be x+1. But since the sequence is ordered, this suggests that the elements in the sets must form a chain where each element is followed by its increment in the next set.\n\nWait, but the sequence can be arranged in any order. So perhaps the sets can be ordered in such a way that their elements are non-decreasing in some way. Alternatively, perhaps each set can be associated with a certain \"maximum\" value or some other parameter that allows for ordering.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sets as being able to be ordered in a sequence where each set's elements are all less than or equal to some value, and the next set has elements that are higher. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of dependencies. For the sets to be arranged in a sequence where each is a child of the next, the entire collection of sets must form a chain of dependencies. For example, if we have two sets A and B, then either A can be a child of B, or B can be a child of A, or neither. But for the array to be rearranged into a sequence, the sets must form a linear order where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nBut considering that there are N sets, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: Each set can be assigned a certain \"rank\" such that in the sequence, each set's rank is higher than the previous. However, how to define this rank?\n\nAlternatively, think of the sets as being part of a DAG, and the problem requires that the DAG has a path of length N-1. But since the array can be arranged in any order, perhaps the DAG must have a topological order of length N. But I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAnother angle: For each set, define the minimal set of elements that must be present in the next set. But since the order can be arranged, perhaps the sets can be ordered in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets such that there exists a rearrangement where each set is a child of the next. A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, there exists an element x+1 in B.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Child Relationship**: For a set A to be a child of set B, every element x in A must have x+1 in B. This implies that elements in A are one less than elements in B.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use dynamic programming to count valid configurations. Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of ways to form a sequence of `i` sets such that the last set contains the value `j`.\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each position `i`, we consider adding a new set that can be a child of the previous set. This involves iterating over possible values and updating the DP table accordingly.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we use modulo `998244353` to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    N = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    K = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # dp[i][j]: number of ways to have i sets, with the last set having j as the maximum value\n    # But considering all possibilities, maybe we can model it differently.\n    # Let's think in terms of dp[i][j] representing the number of sequences of i sets where the last set has max value j.\n    \n    # However, since the sets can have any elements, perhaps we need to track for each i the number of ways to have a set that can be followed by another.\n    # Another approach: For each level, track the number of ways to have a set that can be placed at that level in the sequence.\n    \n    # Let's define dp[i] as the number of sequences of i sets that can be arranged in order.\n    # But how to compute transitions?\n    \n    # Let's think of the problem as building up the sequence step by step.\n    # The key insight is that for a sequence of length i, the last set can have any subset S, and the previous set must be a child of S.\n    # However, this seems complex. Instead, we can model it using the concept of \"levels\" for each element.\n    \n    # Let's consider that for each position in the sequence, the sets can be represented by their maximum element.\n    # For example, if a set has elements {1, 2}, its maximum is 2. If a set has elements {2}, its maximum is 2.\n    # Then, for a set with max value m, the next set must have max value >= m. Because if the previous set has max m, then the next set must contain m+1 (if the previous set has m).\n    # Wait, not necessarily. For example, a set with max value m could have elements like {m-1}, which requires the next set to have m. So the next set's max must be at least m.\n    \n    # Therefore, the maximum value of each set in the sequence must be non-decreasing. This is a crucial observation.\n    \n    # Thus, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of N sets where the max value of each set is non-decreasing, and for each consecutive pair, the previous set's max is m, and the next set's max is m' >= m. Additionally, for the previous set to be a child of the next, the next set must contain m+1 if the previous set contains m. But since the previous set's max is m, it may have elements up to m, and the next set must contain m+1 if the previous set has m. However, if the next set's max is m', then m' >= m, and if m' >= m+1, then it contains m+1. But if m' == m, then the next set cannot have m+1, so the previous set cannot have m. Therefore, the previous set must not have m if m' == m.\n    \n    # This seems complicated. Let's instead think in terms of the maximum value of each set. Let's say the sequence of sets has max values m_1, m_2, ..., m_N, which is non-decreasing. For each transition from m_i to m_{i+1}, we must ensure that if the current set has elements including some x, then the next set has x+1. But since the current set's max is m_i, it can contain elements up to m_i. The next set's max is m_{i+1} >= m_i. If m_{i+1} > m_i, then it must contain m_i + 1. If m_{i+1} == m_i, then the current set must not contain m_i, otherwise the next set would need to contain m_i + 1 which it doesn't.\n    \n    # However, this seems too restrictive. Perhaps we can model this by considering that for each set, the maximum value is m, and the number of subsets that can be formed with max value m. Then, the transitions between these subsets can be considered.\n    \n    # Let's define f(m) as the number of subsets whose maximum value is exactly m. This is equal to 2^{m-1} because for each of the numbers from 1 to m-1, they can be either included or not, and m must be included.\n    \n    # Now, for the sequence of sets, we can model it as choosing a sequence of max values m_1 <= m_2 <= ... <= m_N such that for each consecutive pair m_i and m_{i+1}:\n    # - if m_{i+1} > m_i, then it's allowed.\n    # - if m_{i+1} == m_i, then the previous set cannot have m_i (since it would require the next set to have m_i + 1 which it doesn't). But since the max of the previous set is m_i, it may or may not include m_i. Wait, no. If the max of the previous set is m_i, then it must include m_i. So if m_{i+1} == m_i, then the previous set has m_i in it, which requires the next set to have m_i + 1. But the next set has max m_i, which does not include m_i + 1. Therefore, this case is invalid.\n    \n    # Therefore, in the sequence of max values, we cannot have two consecutive equal values. Hence, the max values must be strictly increasing. Wait, but this contradicts the example given.\n    \n    # Let's check the first example: N=2, K=2. One of the valid arrays is [{1}, {}]. Rearranged as [{}, {1}], which would have max values 0 (empty set) and 1. But empty set's max is zero? Or perhaps we need to handle the empty set specially.\n    \n    # This suggests that the earlier approach might not be correct. Let's rethink.\n    \n    # Let's consider that the empty set can be placed anywhere, as it has no elements, so it is trivially a child of any set. Because for the empty set, there are no elements to check. So the empty set can be placed anywhere in the sequence.\n    \n    # This complicates the earlier approach. So, the problem allows for empty sets, and the max value for an empty set can be considered as 0. Then, for the sequence of max values, we can have non-decreasing sequences, but with some constraints.\n    \n    # Let's redefine the problem in terms of the max value of each set. Let's denote the max value as m_i for the i-th set in the sequence. The sequence must satisfy that for each i, m_i <= m_{i+1}, and for each i, if m_i > 0, then m_{i+1} >= m_i + 1. Wait, why? Because if the previous set has max m_i, then it contains m_i. So the next set must have m_i + 1. Hence, m_{i+1} must be at least m_i + 1. However, if the previous set is empty (m_i = 0), then the next set can have any max value >= 0.\n    \n    # So, the sequence of max values must satisfy:\n    # - For each i from 1 to N-1:\n    #   if m_i > 0, then m_{i+1} >= m_i + 1\n    #   if m_i = 0, then m_{i+1} can be any value >= 0\n    \n    # This seems to be a more accurate model. Now, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of max values [m_1, m_2, ..., m_N] that satisfy the above condition, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the sets for each position in the sequence.\n    \n    # Let's denote that for each position in the sequence, if the max value is m, then the number of possible sets is 2^{m-1} if m > 0 (since the set must contain m, and can contain any subset of {1, ..., m-1}), and 1 if m = 0 (only the empty set).\n    \n    # Now, the problem becomes counting the number of valid sequences of max values, and for each such sequence, multiplying by the product of the number of sets for each position.\n    \n    # To compute this efficiently, we can use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][m] be the number of ways to build a sequence of i sets ending with max value m. Then, for each i and m, we can transition from previous states.\n    \n    # However, given the constraints on N and K (up to 2e5), we need an efficient approach. Let's think about transitions.\n    \n    # For the first set (i=1), the max value can be any m from 0 to K. The number of ways for dp[1][m] is 1 if m=0, else 2^{m-1}.\n    \n    # For i > 1, for each possible m, we can look back at all possible previous max values m_prev that are allowed to transition to m. That is:\n    # - If m_prev = 0, then m can be any value from 0 to K.\n    # - If m_prev > 0, then m must be >= m_prev + 1.\n    \n    # However, directly iterating over all possible m_prev for each m would be O(N*K^2), which is too slow.\n    \n    # To optimize, we can precompute prefix sums. Let's think about the transitions:\n    \n    # For each i, and for each m, dp[i][m] = (sum of dp[i-1][m_prev] for m_prev=0) * (ways for m) + sum of dp[i-1][m_prev] for m_prev such that m_prev > 0 and m >= m_prev + 1) * (ways for m)\n    \n    # Alternatively, for each i, we can maintain two variables:\n    # - total_zero: the sum of dp[i-1][m_prev] where m_prev = 0\n    # - total_rest: the sum of dp[i-1][m_prev] where m_prev > 0\n    \n    # But even that might not be sufficient. Let's think again.\n    \n    # When transitioning to a new max value m:\n    # - The previous max can be 0, and the current m can be any value (0 to K).\n    # - The previous max can be any m_prev > 0 such that m >= m_prev + 1.\n    \n    # For the case when m_prev is 0, the contribution to dp[i][m] is dp[i-1][0] * ways(m)\n    # For the case when m_prev > 0, the contribution is the sum of dp[i-1][m_prev] for all m_prev such that m_prev <= m-1. Because m_prev <= m-1 => m_prev + 1 <= m.\n    \n    # So, for each m, the total contribution from m_prev > 0 is sum_{m_prev=1}^{m-1} dp[i-1][m_prev] * ways(m)\n    \n    # So, if we can precompute prefix sums of dp[i-1][m_prev], then we can calculate this quickly.\n    \n    # Let's define for each i, the prefix sum array s where s[m] = sum_{x=0}^m dp[i][x]\n    # Then, for the sum of m_prev from 1 to m-1, it would be s[m-1] - dp[i-1][0]\n    \n    # Putting it all together:\n    # dp[i][m] = dp[i-1][0] * ways(m) + (s_prev[m-1] - dp[i-1][0]) * ways(m)\n    \n    # Where s_prev is the prefix sum of dp[i-1].\n    \n    # However, this approach is still O(N*K), which is acceptable for N and K up to 2e5.\n    \n    # Now, let's proceed to implement this.\n    \n    # Precompute the ways for each m:\n    # ways[m] = 1 if m == 0, else 2^{m-1}\n    \n    # Since K can be up to 2e5, we need to precompute powers of 2 up to K.\n    \n    # Let's proceed with the code.\n    \n    max_k = K\n    # Precompute powers of 2 up to K\n    pow2 = [1] * (max_k + 2)\n    for i in range(1, max_k + 2):\n        pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] * 2) % MOD\n    \n    # ways[m] for m from 0 to K\n    ways = [0] * (K + 1)\n    ways[0] = 1\n    for m in range(1, K+1):\n        ways[m] = pow2[m-1]\n    \n    # Initialize dp\n    # dp is a 2D array, but since we only need previous row, we can use two 1D arrays\n    prev_dp = [0] * (K + 2)  # prev_dp[m] for m in 0..K\n    curr_dp = [0] * (K + 2)\n    \n    # Base case: i=1\n    for m in range(0, K+1):\n        prev_dp[m] = ways[m]\n    \n    for i in range(2, N+1):\n        # Compute prefix sums of prev_dp\n        prefix = [0] * (K + 2)\n        prefix[0] = prev_dp[0]\n        for m in range(1, K+1):\n            prefix[m] = (prefix[m-1] + prev_dp[m]) % MOD\n        \n        # Now compute curr_dp for this i\n        for m in range(0, K+1):\n            # contribution from previous max being 0\n            contrib_zero = prev_dp[0] * ways[m]\n            # contribution from previous max being >0 and m_prev <= m-1\n            if m == 0:\n                contrib_rest = 0\n            else:\n                contrib_rest = (prefix[m-1] - prev_dp[0]) % MOD\n                contrib_rest = contrib_rest * ways[m]\n            curr_dp[m] = (contrib_zero + contrib_rest) % MOD\n        \n        # Update prev_dp for next iteration\n        prev_dp, curr_dp = curr_dp, prev_dp\n        # Reset curr_dp to zero for next iteration\n        for m in range(K+1):\n            curr_dp[m] = 0\n    \n    # The answer is the sum of prev_dp[m] for m in 0..K\n    result = sum(prev_dp[:K+1]) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Powers of 2**: We precompute powers of 2 up to K to efficiently calculate the number of subsets for each possible maximum value.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: Initialize the base case for sequences of length 1.\n3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: For each step, compute prefix sums to efficiently calculate contributions from previous states.\n4. **Transition Between States**: For each possible maximum value, compute the number of valid sequences by considering contributions from previous states.\n5. **Result Calculation**: Sum up all valid sequences of length N to get the final result.",

Therefore, this case is invalid.\n    \n    # Therefore, in the sequence of max values, we cannot have two consecutive equal values. Hence, the max values must be strictly increasing. Wait, but this contradicts the example given.\n    \n    # Let's check the first example: N=2, K=2. One of the valid arrays is [{1}, {}]. Rearranged as [{}, {1}], which would have max values 0 (empty set) and 1. But empty set's max is zero? Or perhaps we need to handle the empty set specially.\n    \n    # This suggests that the earlier approach might not be correct. Let's rethink.\n    \n    # Let's consider that the empty set can be placed anywhere, as it has no elements, so it is trivially a child of any set. Because for the empty set, there are no elements to check. So the empty set can be placed anywhere in the sequence.\n    \n    # This complicates the earlier approach. So, the problem allows for empty sets, and the max value for an empty set can be considered as 0. Then, for the sequence of max values, we can have non-decreasing sequences, but with some constraints.\n    \n    # Let's redefine the problem in terms of the max value of each set. Let's denote the max value as m_i for the i-th set in the sequence. The sequence must satisfy that for each i, m_i <= m_{i+1}, and for each i, if m_i > 0, then m_{i+1} >= m_i + 1. Wait, why? Because if the previous set has max m_i, then it contains m_i. So the next set must have m_i + 1. Hence, m_{i+1} must be at least m_i + 1. However, if the previous set is empty (m_i = 0), then the next set can have any max value >= 0.\n    \n    # So, the sequence of max values must satisfy:\n    # - For each i from 1 to N-1:\n    #   if m_i > 0, then m_{i+1} >= m_i + 1\n    #   if m_i = 0, then m_{i+1} can be any value >= 0\n    \n    # This seems to be a more accurate model. Now, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of max values [m_1, m_2, ..., m_N] that satisfy the above condition, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the sets for each position in the sequence.\n    \n    # Let's denote that for each position in the sequence, if the max value is m, then the number of possible sets is 2^{m-1} if m > 0 (since the set must contain m, and can contain any subset of {1, ..., m-1}), and 1 if m = 0 (only the empty set).\n    \n    # Now, the problem becomes counting the number of valid sequences of max values, and for each such sequence, multiplying by the product of the number of sets for each position.\n    \n    # To compute this efficiently, we can use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][m] be the number of ways to build a sequence of i sets ending with max value m. Then, for each i and m, we can transition from previous states.\n    \n    # However, given the constraints on N and K (up to 2e5), we need an efficient approach. Let's think about transitions.\n    \n    # For the first set (i=1), the max value can be any m from 0 to K. The number of ways for dp[1][m] is 1 if m=0, else 2^{m-1}.\n    \n    # For i > 1, for each possible m, we can look back at all possible previous max values m_prev that are allowed to transition to m. That is:\n    # - If m_prev = 0, then m can be any value from 0 to K.\n    # - If m_prev > 0, then m must be >= m_prev + 1.\n    \n    # However, directly iterating over all possible m_prev for each m would be O(N*K^2), which is too slow.\n    \n    # To optimize, we can precompute prefix sums. Let's think about the transitions:\n    \n    # For each i, and for each m, dp[i][m] = (sum of dp[i-1][m_prev] for m_prev=0) * (ways for m) + sum of dp[i-1][m_prev] for m_prev such that m_prev > 0 and m >= m_prev + 1) * (ways for m)\n    \n    # Alternatively, for each i, we can maintain two variables:\n    # - total_zero: the sum of dp[i-1][m_prev] where m_prev = 0\n    # - total_rest: the sum of dp[i-1][m_prev] where m_prev > 0\n    \n    # But even that might not be sufficient. Let's think again.\n    \n    # When transitioning to a new max value m:\n    # - The previous max can be 0, and the current m can be any value (0 to K).\n    # - The previous max can be any m_prev > 0 such that m >= m_prev + 1.\n    \n    # For the case when m_prev is 0, the contribution to dp[i][m] is dp[i-1][0] * ways(m)\n    # For the case when m_prev > 0, the contribution is the sum of dp[i-1][m_prev] for all m_prev such that m_prev <= m-1. Because m_prev <= m-1 => m_prev + 1 <= m.\n    \n    # So, for each m, the total contribution from m_prev > 0 is sum_{m_prev=1}^{m-1} dp[i-1][m_prev] * ways(m)\n    \n    # So, if we can precompute prefix sums of dp[i-1][m_prev], then we can calculate this quickly.\n    \n    # Let's define for each i, the prefix sum array s where s[m] = sum_{x=0}^m dp[i][x]\n    # Then, for the sum of m_prev from 1 to m-1, it would be s[m-1] - dp[i-1][0]\n    \n    # Putting it all together:\n    # dp[i][m] = dp[i-1][0] * ways(m) + (s_prev[m-1] - dp[i-1][0]) * ways(m)\n    \n    # Where s_prev is the prefix sum of dp[i-1].\n    \n    # However, this approach is still O(N*K), which is acceptable for N and K up to 2e5.\n    \n    # Now, let's proceed to implement this.\n    \n    # Precompute the ways for each m:\n    # ways[m] = 1 if m == 0, else 2^{m-1}\n    \n    # Since K can be up to 2e5, we need to precompute powers of 2 up to K.\n    \n    # Let's proceed with the code.\n    \n    max_k = K\n    # Precompute powers of 2 up to K\n    pow2 = [1] * (max_k + 2)\n    for i in range(1, max_k + 2):\n        pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] * 2) % MOD\n    \n    # ways[m] for m from 0 to K\n    ways = [0] * (K + 1)\n    ways[0] = 1\n    for m in range(1, K+1):\n        ways[m] = pow2[m-1]\n    \n    # Initialize dp\n    # dp is a 2D array, but since we only need previous row, we can use two 1D arrays\n    prev_dp = [0] * (K + 2)  # prev_dp[m] for m in 0..K\n    curr_dp = [0] * (K + 2)\n    \n    # Base case: i=1\n    for m in range(0, K+1):\n        prev_dp[m] = ways[m]\n    \n    for i in range(2, N+1):\n        # Compute prefix sums of prev_dp\n        prefix = [0] * (K + 2)\n        prefix[0] = prev_dp[0]\n        for m in range(1, K+1):\n            prefix[m] = (prefix[m-1] + prev_dp[m]) % MOD\n        \n        # Now compute curr_dp for this i\n        for m in range(0, K+1):\n            # contribution from previous max being 0\n            contrib_zero = prev_dp[0] * ways[m]\n            # contribution from previous max being >0 and m_prev <= m-1\n            if m == 0:\n                contrib_rest = 0\n            else:\n                contrib_rest = (prefix[m-1] - prev_dp[0]) % MOD\n                contrib_rest = contrib_rest * ways[m]\n            curr_dp[m] = (contrib_zero + contrib_rest) % MOD\n        \n        # Update prev_dp for next iteration\n        prev_dp, curr_dp = curr_dp, prev_dp\n        # Reset curr_dp to zero for next iteration\n        for m in range(K+1):\n            curr_dp[m] = 0\n    \n    # The answer is the sum of prev_dp[m] for m in 0..K\n    result = sum(prev_dp[:K+1]) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
