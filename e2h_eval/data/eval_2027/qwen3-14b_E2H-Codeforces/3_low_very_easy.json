Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l. \n\nFirst, I think the approach here is to sort the lantern positions. Because if they're sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum gap. Then, the required d would be half of that maximum gap. Wait, but why?\n\nLet me think. Suppose there are two adjacent lanterns. Let's say they are at positions a and b, with a < b. The area between them that isn't covered by either lantern would be the middle part. The maximum distance from either lantern to the midpoint between them would be (b - a)/2. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d must be at least half the distance between them. Because if you have a gap between two lanterns, the worst case is the middle of that gap. So the maximum of these half gaps would be the minimal required d.\n\nBut wait, what about the ends? Like, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly for the end of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The required d must be at least a1, because otherwise the area from 0 to a1 -d would not be covered. Similarly for the end of the street. So the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d must be at least this distance.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to the end (l). The required d must be at least this distance.\n4. For each consecutive pair of lanterns, compute the distance between them, divide by two. Take the maximum of these values.\n5. The answer is the maximum among all the values from steps 2, 3, and 4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the first lantern might be at some position, and the area before it needs to be covered. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo let's outline the steps:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Initialize max_d as 0.\n- Check the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0], so the required d for that is a[0]. So max_d = max(max_d, a[0]).\n- Check the last lantern's position. The distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. So max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1]).\n- Then, iterate through the sorted array, for each i from 1 to n-1, compute a[i] - a[i-1], divide by 2. Compare with max_d and take the maximum.\n- Finally, return the max_d as the answer.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the steps would be:\n\n- The first and last lantern are the same. So the distance from 0 to a[0], and from a[0] to l. Then the maximum of those two. And since there's no other lanterns, the max_d is the maximum of those two. Which is correct.\n\nFor example, if the street is length 5, and the lantern is at position 2. Then the left side requires d >= 2, the right side requires d >= 3. So the answer is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: if the lanterns are at 0 and 5, and the street is length 5. Then the first step gives 0, the last step gives 0. Then the gap between them is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the input. The input is given as two integers n and l, then a list of n integers. So in Python, I can read the input, split into the numbers, sort them, and proceed.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase 1: All lanterns are at 0. Then the first step gives 0, the last step gives l - 0 = l. So the answer is l. But if n=1, then the max between 0 and l is l. Which is correct.\n\nCase 2: Lanterns are at both ends. For example, n=2, l=5, positions 0 and 5. Then the gap between them is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. Which is the answer.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are multiple lanterns in the same position",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can light up a segment of the street within a radius `d` from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check the Ends of the Street**: The first lantern might not be at the start of the street (0), and the last lantern might not be at the end of the street (l). We need to consider these distances as potential candidates for the radius `d`.\n3. **Calculate Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between them determines the required radius, which is half of this gap since the midpoint of the gap will be the farthest point from either lantern.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n    # Check the last lantern\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate gap calculations between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The distances from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street are considered.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is divided by 2 to determine the maximum radius needed to cover the midpoint of the gap.\n5. **Result**: The maximum value from all the above checks is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places, ensuring the result meets the required accuracy constraints.",
