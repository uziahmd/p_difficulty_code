Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is a straight line from 0 to l. Each lantern at position ai can light up points within distance d. So, the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on the street [0, l] is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, let's think about the approach. The key idea here is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because the largest gap would require the largest d to cover it. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the lanterns are sorted in order. Then, between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance between them is important. For example, if two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b), then the middle point between them is (a + b)/2. The distance from each lantern to this middle point is (b - a)/2. So, to cover the entire area between them, the radius d must be at least (b - a)/2. But wait, that's only if the lanterns are placed optimally. However, there's also the case where the first lantern isn't at 0 or the last isn't at l. So, we need to check the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to the end of the street. Those would also contribute to the required d.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. The required d for that is the first lantern's position minus 0. Because the lantern's light needs to reach 0. So if the first lantern is at a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. But the lantern's coverage needs to include 0. So the radius must be at least a1. Wait, no. Because the lantern's coverage is from a1 - d to a1 + d. So for 0 to be covered, a1 - d ≤ 0 ≤ a1 + d. Since d is positive. The maximum distance between 0 and a1 is a1. So the required d for this part is a1. Similarly, for the end of the street, the distance between the last lantern and l is l - a_n. So the required d must be at least that.\n\nBut then, between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]). For that gap, the required d is half of that, because the middle point between them is (a[i] + a[i+1])/2. The distance from each lantern to that point is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. So the maximum of all these gaps divided by two would be the required d for the middle parts.\n\nSo the overall minimum d is the maximum between:\n\n- The first lantern's position (if it's not at 0)\n- The last lantern's distance from l (if it's not at l)\n- The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is zero. Similarly for the last lantern. So those terms would be zero. So the maximum would be determined by the other terms.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. If it's not zero, then the initial max_d is the first lantern's position. Similarly for the last lantern. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute their difference, divide by two, and see if that's larger than current max_d.\n\nSo the maximum of all these values is the required d.\n\nLet me test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting: 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCheck first lantern is at 0, so no contribution. Last lantern is at 15, which is the end of the street, so no contribution. Now check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5. Correct.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2 5",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to light up an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can illuminate a segment of length `2d` around its position. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`). These distances are critical as they determine the minimum radius needed to cover the endpoints.\n3. **Calculate Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap determines the largest segment that needs to be covered by the lanterns' light, which requires the radius to be half of the maximum gap.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    if a[0] > 0:\n        max_d = a[0]\n    \n    # Check the last lantern\n    if a[-1] < l:\n        max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Endpoint Checks**: The distances from the start and end of the street to the nearest lanterns are checked. These values are potential candidates for the minimum radius `d`.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The maximum of these gaps divided by two is considered because the worst-case scenario for coverage is the midpoint between two lanterns.\n5. **Result Output**: The maximum value from the endpoint checks and the gap calculations is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure the required accuracy.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required by considering both the endpoints and the gaps between consecutive lanterns, ensuring that the entire street is illuminated.",
