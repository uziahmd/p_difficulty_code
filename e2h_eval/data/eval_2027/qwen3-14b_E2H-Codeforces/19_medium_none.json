The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. The districts form a tree since there's exactly one path between every pair. When we remove k districts, the remaining n - k districts must be connected. So the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree of size (n - k) with the maximum possible sum of 2^i values. Then, the districts not in this subtree are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how do we find such a subtree? Since the sum is based on the district numbers, which are exponentially increasing, we want to keep as many higher-numbered districts as possible. Because 2^i increases rapidly with i, higher-numbered districts contribute way more than lower ones. So the optimal strategy is probably to include as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the remaining districts are connected. So the idea is to find a subtree that includes the highest possible districts. For example, if we can include the highest (n - k) districts, but they are connected, then that's the best. But if they aren't connected, we have to adjust.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to select the districts with the largest numbers, but ensure that they form a connected subtree. However, since the tree is connected, maybe we can start from the highest node and perform some kind of traversal, adding nodes in a way that maintains connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where we need to choose which nodes to remove. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the highest-numbered nodes, the optimal solution would be to remove the smallest possible nodes, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think: the maximum sum is achieved when the kept nodes are the ones with the largest possible numbers. So, the plan is to keep the largest (n - k) nodes, but they must form a connected subtree. If they are connected, then that's our answer. If not, we need to remove some lower-numbered nodes and include higher ones, but how?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the largest (n -k) nodes may not form a connected subtree. For example, imagine a tree where the highest node is disconnected from others. But since the tree is connected, the highest node is connected to others through some path. So perhaps the way to proceed is to greedily include the highest nodes, and then check if they form a connected component. But how to do that?\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a problem of choosing a subtree of size m = n -k, and we need to maximize the sum. Since the sum is the sum of 2^i for each node in the subtree, which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of their values. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the optimal subtree will contain the largest possible nodes. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting the largest m nodes, and then making sure that they form a connected subtree. If they don't, we need to find the minimal number of lower nodes to include to make them connected.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where we need to select m nodes (m = n -k), and the selection must be connected. To maximize the sum, we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo here's an idea: start with the highest-numbered node, and then include all the nodes that are necessary to connect the higher-numbered nodes. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the optimal subtree must include the highest-numbered node. Because otherwise, if we exclude it, we can replace a lower node with it and get a higher sum. So the optimal subtree must include the highest node. Then, recursively, within the subtree, the next highest node, etc.\n\nThis suggests that we can perform a greedy approach where we start with the highest node, and then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree. But how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a subtree by selecting the nodes in order of decreasing value. For each node, we decide whether to include it in the subtree. However, including it requires that it is connected to the existing subtree. But how to manage that?\n\nWait, but maybe the problem can be transformed into selecting which nodes to exclude. Since we need to exclude exactly k nodes, and the remaining must be connected. The key is to find which k nodes to exclude such that the rest form a connected subtree, and the sum is maximized.\n\nSince the sum is maximized by excluding the smallest possible nodes, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected. However, if we just remove the k smallest nodes, the remaining might not be connected. So the challenge is to find which nodes to remove so that the remaining is connected, and the sum is maximum.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative idea comes from the fact that the sum is determined by the nodes kept. Since the sum is maximized when we keep the nodes with the highest values, perhaps the optimal way is to keep the highest m nodes, and then find the minimal number of nodes that need to be kept to connect them. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose the highest m nodes are not connected. Then, we need to include some lower nodes to connect them. However, since the total number of nodes is m, we can't include those lower nodes. Wait, no. Wait, m is n -k. So the total number of nodes kept is m. So if the highest m nodes are not connected, then we need to find a subset of m nodes that includes as many of the highest as possible, and is connected.\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to find a connected subtree that contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a tree and perform a priority-based selection. Let's think of the tree as being rooted at the highest node (node n). Then, we can perform a traversal where we prioritize keeping higher-numbered nodes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a variation of the maximum spanning tree. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: since the tree is connected, the optimal subtree of size m must be connected. To maximize the sum, the subtree should contain the m largest nodes. However, if they are not connected, then we need to include some of the lower nodes to connect them. However, since we can't include more than m nodes, we need to find a way to select the m nodes that include as many of the largest as possible, and are connected.\n\nBut how to find that set?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Start with the highest node (n). Then, for each subsequent node in descending order, check if it can be added to the current subtree. But how to check that?\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe another way: since the nodes are numbered from 1 to n, and their values are 2^i, which is exponentially increasing, the optimal subtree must consist of the node with the highest number (n), and then the next highest possible nodes that are connected to it.\n\nSo, perhaps we can build a subtree starting from node n, and greedily include the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: we need to remove exactly k nodes, and the remaining must be connected. The best way is to keep the nodes that are as large as possible. So, the idea is to keep all nodes except the k smallest ones, but if that's not connected, then we need to adjust.\n\nBut how to check if the remaining nodes (after removing the k smallest) are connected?\n\nBut even if they are not connected, perhaps there's a way to adjust which nodes to remove. However, given the exponential weights, the optimal solution would be to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to select the nodes to keep as follows:\n\nWe need to keep m = n -k nodes. We want to select the largest m nodes, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. If they are connected, that's the answer. If not, we need to remove some lower-numbered nodes and include some higher ones.\n\nBut how to check if the largest m nodes are connected?\n\nBut how can we check that? For example, if the tree is such that the largest m nodes are scattered, and not connected. Then, we need to find which ones to include.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative idea is to use a priority queue approach, where we start with the highest node and then add the next highest nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nThis sounds like a BFS or DFS approach, where we greedily add the highest nodes first.\n\nLet me think of this as a process. We can model this as building a subtree that starts with the highest node. Then, for each step, we look for the highest-numbered node not yet in the subtree that is adjacent to the current subtree. Adding that node will allow us to include it in the subtree, thus maximizing the sum.\n\nThis way, the subtree grows by adding the next highest possible node that is connected to the existing subtree.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's think through an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3. So m=3. We need to keep 3 nodes. The largest 3 nodes are 6,5,4. Are they connected?\n\nThe tree structure is:\n\nEdges are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3.\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. Node 6 is connected to 5. So the nodes 6,5,4: node 6 is connected to 2, which is connected to 4. So 6,4 are connected via 2. But 5 is connected to 6. So 6,5,4 are connected through 6-2-4. So the subtree consisting of nodes 6,5,4 is connected? Wait, but node 5 is connected to 6. So the three nodes 6,5,4 are connected. So why does the sample output remove 1,3,4? Wait, the sample output says that the kept nodes are 2,5,6. Which sum to 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. But according to the idea of keeping the largest m nodes, that would be 6,5,4. Their sum is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 = 64 +32 +16 = 112, which is larger. So why isn't that the answer?\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial reasoning is wrong. What's going on here?\n\nIn the sample input, the correct output is 1,3,4 removed. So the kept nodes are 2,5,6. But why not keep 4,5,6?\n\nAh, because perhaps the nodes 4,5,6 are not connected. Let me check the tree again.\n\nThe edges are:\n\nBetween 2 and 1.\n\nBetween 2 and 6.\n\nBetween 4 and 2.\n\nBetween 5 and 6.\n\nBetween 2 and 3.\n\nSo node 4 is connected to 2. Node 6 is connected to 2 and 5. So the nodes 4,5,6 are connected through node 2. So they are connected. So why isn't the sample output keeping them?\n\nBut the sample output says that the maximum sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100. But according to that, the sum for 4,5,6 would be 64 + 32 + 16 = 112. Which is higher. So why is the sample answer different?\n\nWait, this indicates that there's a mistake in my understanding of the sample input. Let me recheck the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nFirst input line is 6 3.\n\nThen the edges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3.\n\nSo the tree is structured as follows:\n\n- Node 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3.\n\n- Node 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the nodes 4,5,6 are connected as follows: 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So yes, they are connected. So keeping 4,5,6 would be a connected subtree. The sum would be 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 16+32+64 = 112. Which is higher than the sample's 100. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is to remove 1,3,4. Which leaves 2,5,6. But that's sum 4+32+64=100. Which is less than 112. So why is the sample explanation wrong? Or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the maximum possible is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100. But according to my calculation, keeping 4,5,6 gives a higher sum. So why is that not the case?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the number of fans of contestant from district i is 2^i. So for district 4, it's 2^4 = 16, district 5 is 32, district 6 is 64. Summing those gives 112. But the sample explanation says that the maximum is 100. So there's a contradiction here. Which means that I must have misunderstood something.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', ...]\n\nSample Output: ['1 3 4']\n\nWhich implies that the districts kept are 2,5,6. Which sum to 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 +32 +64 = 100.\n\nBut why isn't the sum higher? Why can't we keep 4,5,6?\n\nAh! Oh wait! Because the problem says that the president wants to remove k contestants. So the number of contestants remaining is n -k = 6-3=3. So the sample output removes 3 districts (1,3,4), leaving districts 2,5,6. But why can't we remove districts 1,2,3, and keep 4,5,6? Wait, no. Because k is 3. So we have to remove exactly 3 districts. So if we remove 1, 2, 3, then we are left with 4,5,6. But that's 3 districts. But the problem says that the remaining districts must be connected. Are 4,5,6 connected?\n\nDistrict 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6. So 4 and 6 are connected through 2. But if we remove 2, then district 4 is no longer connected to 6. Because the districts that are removed are 1,2,3. So 2 is removed. So the remaining districts are 4,5,6. But 4 is connected to 2 (but 2 is removed), so 4 is isolated. 6 is connected to 5. So the remaining districts are 4,5,6. But 4 is not connected to 5 or 6. Thus, the remaining districts are not connected. Hence, that selection is invalid.\n\nAh! That's the key point. So the mistake I made earlier was assuming that the districts kept are 4,5,6, but if we remove 1,2,3, then 2 is removed. So district 4 is connected only to 2 (which is removed). So 4 is not connected to any other district. Hence, the remaining districts are not connected. Therefore, the selection of 4,5,6 is invalid because they are not connected. Hence, the sample explanation is correct.\n\nSo the problem is that even though the nodes 4,5,6 are part of the original tree, if you remove certain nodes (like 2), they become disconnected. Hence, the selection of nodes to keep must form a connected subtree. So the way to think about this is that the subtree of kept nodes must be connected, regardless of the nodes that are removed.\n\nThus, the problem becomes: select a connected subtree of size m = n -k, which has the maximum possible sum of 2^i. How to find that?\n\nThe key insight is that since the sum depends on the individual node values, which are exponentially increasing, the optimal subtree must contain the largest possible nodes, but they must be connected. So the approach is to find a connected subtree that includes as many of the largest nodes as possible.\n\nNow, how to find such a subtree?\n\nAn efficient way is to start with the largest node (n), and then perform a BFS or DFS to collect the largest possible nodes that can be included in the subtree. However, since we need to select exactly m nodes, we need to collect the largest possible ones while maintaining connectivity.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nOne possible approach is to use a priority queue (max-heap) approach. Here's an idea:\n\n- We want to select the nodes with the highest values, but they need to be connected. So, we can start with the highest node (n), and then iteratively add the next highest nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to manage this? Let's think of it as building a subtree step by step. Initially, the subtree contains node n. Then, for each step until we have m nodes, we add the highest possible node that is adjacent to the current subtree. This way, we are always adding the highest possible node that can be connected to the subtree.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nThis sounds similar to Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, but instead of choosing the minimum edge, we're choosing the maximum node that can be added to the subtree.\n\nBut how to track which nodes are adjacent to the subtree?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. We need to collect m = n -k nodes.\n\n2. Start with the highest node (n) as the initial subtree.\n\n3. For each step, find all nodes not yet in the subtree that are adjacent to the subtree. Among these, select the one with the highest value and add it to the subtree.\n\n4. Repeat until the subtree has m nodes.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are always adding the highest possible node that can be connected to the existing subtree. This would maximize the sum.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently for large n (up to 1e6)?\n\nBecause for each step, we need to find the maximum node adjacent to the current subtree. However, for large trees, this could be O(n^2) in the worst case, which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the tree structure. Since the tree is undirected, and we can represent it as adjacency lists.\n\nWe can use a priority queue (max heap) to track the candidate nodes that can be added to the subtree. The candidates are those nodes adjacent to the current subtree but not yet in it.\n\nInitially, the current subtree is {n}. The candidates are the neighbors of n. We can push all these neighbors into a max heap, along with their values. Then, in each step, we extract the node with the highest value from the heap, add it to the subtree, and then add its neighbors (that are not already in the subtree or in the heap) to the heap.\n\nWait, but this approach may not work correctly. Because once a node is added to the heap, even if it's not selected, its neighbors can be considered later.\n\nBut this is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm. Let's think of this as a modified Dijkstra's approach where we greedily select the highest node to add to the subtree.\n\nLet me try to outline the algorithm:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- A set or array to track whether a node is in the subtree (included).\n\n- A priority queue (max heap) that holds the candidate nodes to be added. The priority is based on the node's value.\n\n- Start with the highest node (n) as included. Push all its neighbors into the heap.\n\nThen, for each of the next (m-1) steps:\n\n- Extract the node with the highest value from the heap.\n\n- Add it to the subtree.\n\n- Push its neighbors (not already in the subtree or in the heap) into the heap.\n\nThis way, we are building the subtree by always adding the highest possible node that is adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nThis approach ensures that the subtree is connected, since each new node is adjacent to the existing subtree. Also, the sum is maximized by always choosing the highest possible node available at each step.\n\nOnce we have collected m nodes, the ones not in the subtree are the ones to be removed. But since we need to output the k districts to remove, we can collect all nodes not in the subtree and sort them.\n\nLet me test this approach with the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=6, k=3, m=3.\n\nStart with node 6 (highest). Included = {6}.\n\nNeighbors of 6 are 2 and 5. Push 5 and 2 into the heap. The heap has 5 (value 5) and 2 (value 2). The max is 5.\n\nStep 1: extract 5, add to subtree. Now included is {6,5}.\n\nNeighbors of 5 are 6 (already included) and none else. So nothing added to heap.\n\nHeap now has 2 (value 2).\n\nStep 2: extract 2 (value 2), add to subtree. Now included is {6,5,2} (size 3, done).\n\nSo the included nodes are 6,5,2. The sum is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2 = 64 +32 +4 = 100, which matches the sample explanation. So the districts to remove are 1,3,4. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about the earlier idea of including 4,5,6?\n\nIn this approach, the algorithm would not select 4, because after including 6 and 5, the next step is to take 2, not 4. Because the heap has 2 (from the initial neighbors of 6). So why wasn't 4 considered?\n\nBecause when we added the initial neighbors of 6 (node 2 and 5), the heap contains 5 and 2. Then we take 5 first. Then, when processing node 5's neighbors, nothing is added. Then, the heap has 2. So the next node is 2. But node 2's neighbors are 1, 6, 4, 3. However, when adding node 2 to the subtree, we need to add its neighbors (excluding those already in the subtree). At that time, the subtree includes 6 and 5. So the neighbors of 2 are 1, 4, 3, and 6 (already in subtree). So we add 1,4,3 to the heap. But since we are done (we have already collected m=3 nodes), we stop.\n\nSo the algorithm works correctly for the sample.\n\nBut why didn't it pick node 4 instead of node 2? Because when we had the choice between node 2 and node 5 (initially), we picked node 5 (higher value). Then, after adding node 5, the next highest is node 2. But if we had chosen node 2 first, then we could have added node 4 later. However, the algorithm chooses the highest possible node at each step, which leads to the maximum sum.\n\nBut in this case, adding node 2 (value 2) gives a lower contribution than adding node 4 (value 4). However, the algorithm didn't choose it. Why?\n\nBecause the algorithm's priority is to select the highest node that is adjacent to the current subtree. So after adding node 6, the available candidates are 5 and 2. Between them, 5 is higher. So it's selected. Then, after that, the next candidate is 2, which is added. But if we had added node 2 first, then the subtree would have 6 and 2, and then we can add 4 or 5. Let's see:\n\nAlternative path:\n\nStart with 6. Candidates are 5 and 2. Suppose we choose 2 (value 2) first. Then, the subtree is 6 and 2. Now, the neighbors of 2 are 1, 6 (already in), 4, 3. So add 1,4,3 to the heap. The heap now contains 4 (value 4), 3 (value 3), 1 (value 1). Next step is to select 4. Add it to the subtree. Now the subtree has 6,2,4. Sum is 64 +4 +16 = 84, which is worse than the 100 from the original approach. Hence, the algorithm's choice of taking 5 first is better.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nThus, this approach seems to work. The key is to always select the highest possible node that is adjacent to the current subtree. This way, the sum is maximized.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this efficiently.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n1. Read n and k. Compute m = n -k.\n\n2. Build the adjacency list for the tree.\n\n3. Initialize a priority queue (max heap) for the candidate nodes. Since Python's heapq is a min-heap, we can store negative values.\n\n4. Initialize a visited array to track whether a node is included in the subtree.\n\n5. Start with node n. Mark it as visited. Push all its neighbors into the heap, along with their values.\n\n6. For each of the next (m-1) steps:\n\n   a. Pop the node with the maximum value from the heap.\n\n   b. Mark it as visited.\n\n   c. Push all its neighbors that are not yet visited into the heap.\n\n7. After collecting m nodes, the nodes not visited are the ones to be removed. Collect them, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that the remaining nodes are connected. However, the algorithm ensures that because each added node is connected to the existing subtree. So the collected nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently for n up to 1e6.\n\nBut in Python, using a priority queue for 1e6 elements may be slow. However, given that each node is pushed and popped once, the total operations are O(n log n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e6.\n\nBut let's think about the data structures:\n\nEach node can be pushed multiple times into the heap. Wait, no. Because once a node is marked as visited, it's not pushed again. Because when we process a node, we add its neighbors to the heap only if they are not visited. So each node is added to the heap once.\n\nWait, no. For example, consider a node A that is not visited. It is pushed into the heap when processing a neighbor. Then, when it is popped from the heap and processed, its neighbors are added. But if another neighbor of A is processed later, but A is already visited, then it's not pushed again. So each node is pushed into the heap once.\n\nTherefore, the total number of operations is O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for a max heap, we can use negative numbers. So the priority queue will store (-value, node) pairs.\n\nBut for the initial step, we start with node n, mark it as visited, and push all its neighbors into the heap.\n\nLet's proceed with code.\n\nFirst, read the input. For each test case (though the sample input shows two cases, but the actual problem has one input per run. Wait, the user provided two examples, but the problem says that the input is given as per the problem's input format. So the code must read from stdin once.)\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the input is given as two separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as first line with n and k, then n-1 lines with edges. The output is k numbers.\n\nBut the sample input seems to have two test cases. However, the user's input may be pasted as multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads a single test case. However, the sample input shows two examples. But in practice, the code should process one test case per run.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input description. Anyway, the code should read from stdin as per the problem's input format.\n\nSo the code will read n and k, then n-1 edges.\n\nImplementing the algorithm:\n\nWe'll need to build an adjacency list. For each node, a list of connected nodes.\n\nThen, the steps:\n\nInitialize visited as a boolean array of size n+1 (since nodes are numbered 1-based).\n\npriority queue is a heap. Initially, we start with node n. Mark it as visited. Then push all its neighbors into the heap.\n\nBut for the heap, each entry is (-value, node), since Python's heapq is a min-heap, and we want the max value.\n\nThen, for m-1 steps (since we have already added the first node):\n\nExtract the node with the highest value (pop from heap). Mark it as visited. Then, for each neighbor, if not visited, push into the heap.\n\nOnce we have m nodes, collect all the nodes not visited, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, what if m is 1? Then, we have to keep only node n, and remove all others. Which is handled correctly.\n\nNow, let's test this with the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=6, k=3, m=3.\n\nAdjacency list:\n\nnode 1: [2]\n\nnode 2: [1, 6, 4, 3]\n\nnode 3: [2]\n\nnode 4: [2]\n\nnode 5: [6]\n\nnode 6: [2,5]\n\nStart with node 6. Marked as visited.\n\nPush its neighbors: 2 and 5.\n\nHeap entries are (-5,5), (-2,2). Wait, no. The value is the node number. So the heap entries are (-5,5) and (-2,2). Because the node's value is its number. So the heap is ordered based on the node's number.\n\nWait, the node's value for the purpose of the priority is the node's number. Because the sum is 2^i, so higher i is better. So when we select nodes, we want to select those with higher numbers.\n\nYes. So the priority queue is based on the node's number.\n\nSo for the initial step, the neighbors of 6 are 2 and 5. Their numbers are 2 and 5. So the heap will have (-5,5) and (-2,2). The heap will pop the smallest (which is -5, corresponding to node 5).\n\nSo first step: pop 5. Add to visited. Then, check its neighbors (6 is already visited, and others?), but node 5's neighbors are 6. So no new nodes are added to the heap.\n\nNext, the heap has (-2,2). Pop it. Add to visited. Now, the visited nodes are 6,5,2. Which is m=3. Done.\n\nThe nodes not visited are 1,3,4. Which is the sample output.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother example: if m=3 and the tree allows to select 6,5,4, but the algorithm doesn't do that. But in the case where the tree allows that, would the algorithm select it?\n\nLet's imagine a scenario where node 4 is connected to node 6 directly. Then, the initial step would be to add 6, then the heap would have neighbors of 6 (say 4 and 5). Then, the algorithm would select 5, then 4. But that depends on the order.\n\nBut the algorithm will select the highest node available at each step.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, using a standard adjacency list is feasible.\n\nBut for Python, using a list of lists for adjacency is manageable.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nm = n -k.\n\nRead n-1 edges. Build adjacency list.\n\nInitialize visited as a list of booleans, size n+1.\n\nheap = []\n\nStart with node n. Mark as visited.\n\nfor neighbor in adjacency[n]:\n\n   push (-neighbor, neighbor) into heap.\n\nThen, for _ in range(m-1):\n\n   if heap is empty: break (but this shouldn't happen as m <=n)\n\n   current = heappop(heap)\n\n   node = current[1]\n\n   mark as visited.\n\n   for neighbor in adjacency[node]:\n\n      if not visited:\n\n          push (-neighbor, neighbor) into heap.\n\nOnce done, collect all nodes not visited. Sort them, output.\n\nBut wait, the code for the heap is using the node's number as the priority. So the heap is a max-heap based on the node's number.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in Python, for large n (up to 1e6), the standard heapq may be slow. However, given that each node is pushed once and popped once, and for n=1e6, it's O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nBut for Python, with n=1e6, the code may be tight on time. However, given that the problem constraints are up to 1e6, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys, heapq\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor _ in range(n-1):\n\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj[a].append(b)\n\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\nvisited = [False]*(n+1)\n\nheap = []\n\n# start with node n\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\nfor neighbor in adj[n]:\n\n    heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n\nm = n -k\n\n# need to collect m nodes. Already have 1 (node n). Need to collect m-1 more.\n\nfor _ in range(m-1):\n\n    if not heap:\n\n        break # shouldn't happen\n\n    current = heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n    node = current[1]\n\n    visited[node] = True\n\n    for neighbor in adj[node]:\n\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n            heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n\n# collect all unvisited nodes\n\nresult = []\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    if not visited[i]:\n\n        result.append(i)\n\nresult.sort()\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nBut wait, let's test this code with the first sample.\n\nSample input:\n\n6 3\n\nEdges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nadj[6] is [2,5].\n\nInitially, node 6 is marked as visited. Push 2 and 5 into the heap as (-2, 2) and (-5,5)? No, no. Wait, the code pushes (-neighbor, neighbor). So for neighbor 2, the tuple is (-2, 2). For neighbor 5, it's (-5,5). The heap is a min-heap, so the smallest tuple is popped first. So (-5,5) is smaller than (-2, 2), so when we do heappop, we get (-5,5) first. So node 5 is added. Then, for node 5's neighbors (6 is already visited, nothing else). Then, the heap has (-2,2). Pop it, add node 2. Then, check its neighbors. For node 2's neighbors, 1, 6 (visited), 4, 3. Those not visited are 1,4,3. So they are pushed into the heap as (-1,1), (-4,4), (-3,3). But since m-1 is 2 steps (since m=3, initial node is 1, then 2 steps). So after adding node 5 and 2, the loop ends. The visited nodes are 6,5,2. The unvisited are 1,3,4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works for the first sample.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input. Let's check.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n8 4\n\nEdges:\n\n2 6\n\n2 7\n\n7 8\n\n1 2\n\n3 1\n\n2 4\n\n7 5\n\nSo the tree is:\n\nLet me draw it:\n\nnode 2 is connected to 6,7,1,4.\n\nnode 7 is connected to 2, 8, 5.\n\nnode 1 is connected to 2, 3.\n\nnode 3 is connected to 1.\n\nnode 4 connected to 2.\n\nnode 5 connected to 7.\n\nnode 6 connected to 2.\n\nnode 8 connected to 7.\n\nn=8, k=4, m=4.\n\nThe code starts with node 8. Marked as visited. Its neighbors are 7. Push (-7,7) into the heap.\n\nThen, for m-1=3 steps:\n\nFirst step: pop 7. Mark as visited. Push its neighbors: 2, 8 (already visited), 5. So push 2 and 5. Heap now has (-5,5",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts form a tree structure, and each district's fan count is given by $2^i$, where $i$ is the district number. Our goal is to maximize the sum of these values for the remaining districts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since the fan count increases exponentially with the district number, we should prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Greedy Selection**: Start from the highest-numbered district and use a max-heap (priority queue) to always select the next highest-numbered district that can be connected to the current subtree.\n4. **Connected Subtree**: Ensure that the selected districts form a connected subtree by using a greedy approach where each new district added is adjacent to the existing subtree.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n    \n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    heap = []\n    \n    # Start with the highest node\n    start_node = n\n    visited[start_node] = True\n    for neighbor in adj[start_node]:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n    \n    m = n - k\n    # Need to collect m nodes, already have 1 (start_node), so m-1 more\n    for _ in range(m - 1):\n        if not heap:\n            break\n        current = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        node = current[1]\n        visited[node] = True\n        for neighbor in adj[node]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n    \n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an adjacency list representing the tree structure of the districts.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from the highest-numbered district (node `n`) and mark it as visited. Push all its neighbors into a max-heap (using negative values for Python's min-heap).\n3. **Greedy Selection**: Extract the highest-numbered node from the heap, mark it as visited, and push its neighbors into the heap if they haven't been visited yet. Repeat this until we have selected `n - k` nodes.\n4. **Result Collection**: After selecting the required number of nodes, collect all unvisited nodes (districts to be removed), sort them, and print the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always select the highest possible districts while maintaining connectivity, thus maximizing the total fan count efficiently.",
