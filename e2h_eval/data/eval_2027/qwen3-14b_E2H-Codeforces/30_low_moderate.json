Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. Each takes exactly n moves, and the order of taking digits depends on who is chosen each turn. The challenge is to find the sequence of H and M moves that gives the maximum total.\n\nHmm, the key here is that for each step, the choice between Homer and Marge depends on which option leads to a higher total sum. But since both players are taking digits, and the choices affect future steps, this seems like a dynamic programming problem. However, with n up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. So the state space might be manageable if we can find a way to represent it efficiently.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible states. At any point, the number of digits left is 2n - k, where k is the number of steps taken so far. Also, the number of moves Homer has made so far (let's say h) and Marge's moves (m) must satisfy h + m = k, and h ≤ n, m ≤ n. So the state can be represented by how many digits are left, and the counts of Homer and Marge's moves. Wait, but the actual digits left depend on which digits have been taken. Oh right, but the digits are processed in order. Wait, no. The digits are taken from the left. So the current state is determined by how many digits have been taken so far. For example, if the original number is A with 2n digits, then after taking k digits, the remaining digits are the suffix of A starting at position k. So the state can be represented by the current position (i.e., how many digits have been taken so far), and the number of Homer's moves so far (h). Because m is determined as k - h, where k is the current number of steps (k = i). Since each step is one move, the current position is i, and h can be from 0 to min(n, i). So the state is (i, h), where i ranges from 0 to 2n, and h ranges from 0 to n. For each state, we can decide whether to take H or M (if possible) and choose the option that maximizes the total sum.\n\nBut how do we compute the total sum? Well, when we take a digit, it's added to the respective player's number. However, the value of the number depends on the digits collected. But since we're trying to maximize the sum of S1 and S2, each digit's contribution depends on its position in the number. For example, a digit taken earlier contributes more to the value of the number. For instance, if Homer takes a digit in his first move, that digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1} (since he will take n digits in total, and each subsequent digit is added to the right). Similarly, for Marge's digits.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the total prize is S1 + S2, which is the sum of the two numbers. Let me think: Each time a player takes a digit, it's added to their number. For example, if Homer takes a digit d at step i, then this digit will be the (i-th) digit of his number, but since the digits are added to the end, the first digit taken is the most significant digit. So for Homer's number, the first digit he takes is the first digit (most significant) of his number, then the next one is the second, etc. Therefore, the value of Homer's number is sum_{k=1 to n} (digit_k * 10^{n - k} ), and similarly for Marge. \n\nBut when considering the total sum S1 + S2, each digit taken by Homer contributes to S1 and each digit taken by Marge contributes to S2. So for each digit taken at a certain position, the contribution to the total depends on which player takes it and the position in their respective numbers. \n\nSo, for example, if Homer takes the digit at step i (i.e., the i-th move overall), then this is his (h+1)-th move (since h is the number of moves he has made before this step). So the position in his number is h+1, and the value of that digit is digit * 10^{n - (h+1)}. Similarly for Marge. \n\nBut since the total is the sum of S1 and S2, we can calculate the contribution of each digit as we choose to assign it to H or M. \n\nThis suggests that during the DP process, for each state (i, h), we can track the maximum total sum achievable from that state onwards. The transitions would be: if we choose H",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a number A, where each player takes exactly n digits, and the goal is to maximize the sum of the numbers formed by their respective digits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach where the state is defined by the current position in the number A and the count of moves Homer has made so far. This helps in efficiently exploring all possible sequences of moves.\n2. **Recursive Decision Making**: For each state, we decide whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit based on which choice leads to a higher total prize. This decision is made recursively while considering future moves.\n3. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we memoize the results of subproblems using a cache. This ensures that each state is computed only once, significantly improving efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    length = 2 * n\n\n    # Precompute the powers of 10 up to n digits\n    power = [1] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        power[i] = power[i - 1] * 10\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(pos, h):\n        # pos: current position in A (number of digits taken so far)\n        # h: number of moves Homer has made so far\n        # returns (max_total, best_sequence)\n        if pos == length:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        m = pos - h\n        # remaining moves for Homer: n - h\n        # remaining moves for Marge: n - m\n        # current digit is A[pos]\n        digit = int(A[pos])\n        max_total = -1\n        best_seq = \"\"\n        # Try H if possible\n        if h < n:\n            remaining_h = n - h - 1\n            contribution = digit * power[remaining_h]\n            next_total, next_seq = dp(pos + 1, h + 1)\n            total = contribution + next_total\n            if total > max_total or (total == max_total and (best_seq == \"\" or next_seq)):\n                max_total = total\n                best_seq = \"H\" + next_seq\n        # Try M if possible\n        if m < n:\n            remaining_m = n - m - 1\n            contribution = digit * power[remaining_m]\n            next_total, next_seq = dp(pos + 1, h)\n            total = contribution + next_total\n            if total > max_total or (total == max_total and (best_seq == \"\" or next_seq)):\n                max_total = total\n                best_seq = \"M\" + next_seq\n        return (max_total, best_seq)\n\n    _, sequence = dp(0, 0)\n    print(sequence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming State**: The state `(pos, h)` represents the current position in the number A and the number of moves Homer has made so far. This allows us to track the remaining moves for both players and the digits left in A.\n- **Contribution Calculation**: For each digit taken by a player, its contribution to the total prize is calculated based on its position in the player's number. This is done using precomputed powers of 10 to efficiently determine the positional value.\n- **Recursive Decisions**: At each step, we decide whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit by evaluating the maximum possible total prize from that point onward, considering both possible choices.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently using memoization, leading to an optimal solution for maximizing the total prize money.",
