    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is defined as the max minus min of the array. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that when we take the remaining elements, their max and min difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to check for each element, what happens if we remove it. Then calculate the instability for each case and pick the minimum. But wait, if n is up to 1e5, then this approach would be O(n^2), which would be too slow. Because for each element, we'd have to find the max and min of the remaining elements. For each of those, O(n) time, leading to O(n²) total time. That's not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). When we remove one element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nWell, if the element we remove is the current maximum, then the new max is the second maximum. Similarly, if we remove the current minimum, the new min is the second minimum. Otherwise, removing an element that's neither max nor min doesn't change the max or min. Wait, but that's only if there are multiple instances of max or min. For example, if there are two max elements, then removing one of them leaves the other as the max. So, the key is to find for each possible scenario where removing an element affects the max or min.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's first sort the array. Because when the array is sorted, the min and max are at the ends. For example, in a sorted array, the original min is a[0], max is a[-1]. Now, if we remove one element, the new min and max would depend on which element we remove.\n\nWait, but for the sorted array, if we remove the first element (the original min), then the new min is a[1], and the max remains a[-1]. If we remove the last element (original max), the new max is a[-2], and min remains a[0]. If we remove an element in the middle, then the min and max remain the same as the original array. Wait, no. Wait, if the array is sorted, and we remove any element that's not the first or last, then the min is still a[0] and the max is still a[-1]. So the instability would be a[-1] - a[0]. However, if we remove the first element, the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If we remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. So, the minimum instability after removing one element would be the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], and the original instability (if we remove an element in the middle, but that's same as original instability? No, because if you remove an element in the middle, the instability is same as original. So, for example, if the original instability is max - min, which is a[-1] - a[0]. If you remove any element that is not the first or last, then the instability remains the same. Therefore, the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], and a[-1] - a[0] (if there are multiple elements in the array)).\n\nWait, but that's only if the array is sorted. Let me think again. Suppose the array is sorted. So, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Now, if I remove the first element, the instability becomes a[-1] - a[1]. If I remove the last element, it becomes a[-2] - a[0]. If I remove any other element, the instability remains a[-1] - a[0]. So, the minimal possible instability would be the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], and the original instability (if there are elements that can be removed without changing the instability)).\n\nWait, but the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If we remove an element that's not the first or last, then the instability remains the same. So, the minimal possible instability is the minimum of (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], and the original instability). But wait, the original instability is a[-1]-a[0], which is larger than a[-1]-a[1] (since a[1] is larger than a[0",
    "response": "To solve the problem of minimizing the instability after removing exactly one element from an array, we can use a **sorted approach**. This allows us to efficiently evaluate the impact of removing either the minimum or maximum value in the array.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- The **instability** of the array is defined as `max(a) - min(a)`.\n- Removing **one element** from the array will reduce its size by one.\n- If the array is sorted, the **minimum** is at the start and the **maximum** is at the end.\n- Removing either the **first** or **last** element in the sorted array may reduce the instability.\n- Removing any **middle** element does not change the max or min, so the instability remains the same.\n\n---\n\n### Efficient Strategy:\n\n1. **Sort the array**.\n2. Compute three possible values for instability:\n   - Remove the first element → instability = `a[-1] - a[1]`\n   - Remove the last element → instability = `a[-2] - a[0]`\n   - Any other element (middle) → instability = `a[-1] - a[0]` (original instability)\n3. The result is the **minimum** of these three values.\n\nThis strategy ensures that we only need to sort the array once and perform constant time operations, resulting in an **O(n log n)** time complexity, which is efficient enough for large inputs (up to 100,000 elements).\n\n---\n\n### Python Code Implementation:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Possible instabilities after removing one element\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]  # remove first element\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]  # remove last element\n    option3 = a[-1] - a[0]  # remove middle element (instability remains same)\n    \n    print(min(option1, option2, option3))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\n**Input:**  \n```\n4\n1 3 3 7\n```\n\n**Sorted array:** `[1, 3, 3, 7]`\n\n- Remove first element → `[3, 3, 7]` → instability = `7 - 3 = 4`\n- Remove last element → `[1, 3, 3]` → instability = `3 - 1 = 2`\n- Remove middle element → `[1, 3, 7]` → instability = `6`\n\nMinimum is `2`, so the output is `2`.\n\n---\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles all edge cases, including when the array has only two elements (then instability is always 0).",
