She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. We need to find the minimum number of seconds required for her to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem thoroughly. \n\nSo, there are n tabs, and the cursor is at position pos. She needs to leave only tabs from l to r. All other tabs must be closed. The operations allowed are moving left/right (each taking 1 second) or closing tabs to the left or right of the current position (each taking 1 second). But when she closes tabs, the a and b values (the min and max of the current open tabs) change. So, after closing some tabs, the available range changes.\n\nThe key here is to model the steps needed to close all tabs outside [l, r], considering that closing operations can be done once you're positioned correctly, but moving takes time.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the cases where the current [l, r] is already the entire set of tabs. Like in the third example where l=1 and r=5 and n=5. Then no operations are needed. So output is 0.\n\nOtherwise, we need to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. But how?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. Let's consider the initial position of the cursor and where the target range [l, r] is.\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, maybe she can close the tabs on the left and right. But how?\n\nBut first, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts: closing the tabs to the left of l, and closing the tabs to the right of r. However, these two operations might require moving the cursor to certain positions and then closing.\n\nBut the order in which these operations are done might affect the total time. For example, if she closes the left first, then the right, or vice versa, the movement steps may vary.\n\nWait, but when you close tabs on one side, the a and b values change. For instance, if you close all tabs to the left of the current position, then the new a is the current position's index. Similarly for closing to the right.\n\nBut since the final state is that the open tabs are exactly [l, r], then during the process, the a and b would be adjusted accordingly. However, the problem says that the initial a and b are 1 and n, respectively. But when closing tabs, the a and b are updated. However, in our case, we need to close all tabs outside [l, r], so the final a is l and final b is r.\n\nBut during the process, perhaps the steps involve moving to a certain position, then closing left or right. Let's think about the steps required to close the left part and the right part.\n\nLet me think of the necessary steps:\n\nFirst, we need to close all tabs to the left of l. To do that, the cursor must be at position l. Because if you are at position l, then closing all tabs to the left (which are from 1 to l-1) would be possible. Similarly, to close all tabs to the right of r, the cursor must be at position r, then close the right.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range? Then, perhaps moving to l or r would take some steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to close both sides with fewer steps. But I think the optimal approach would be to first close one side, then the other. But how?\n\nLet me take the first example:\n\nInput is 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The answer is 5.\n\nIn the explanation, the steps are:\n\nMove to tab 2 (from 3, takes 1 sec), then close left (but wait, if she's at tab 2, closing left would close tabs from a to i-1. Initially, a is 1. So closing left would close tabs from 1 to 1 (since i is 2). Then, the a becomes 2. Then she moves to tab 3 (takes 1 sec?), then to tab 4 (another sec), then closes right. But how does that work?\n\nWait, maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Move left from 3 to 2 (1 sec). Then close left (1 sec). Now, the a is 2, and the tabs from 1 are closed. Now, the open tabs are 2-6. But the target is 2-4. So she needs to close tabs 5 and 6. So she moves to 4 (from 2, moving right twice: 2->3 (1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while considering the constraints on moving and closing tabs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Target Range**: The goal is to leave only tabs from index l to r open. This means we need to close all tabs to the left of l and to the right of r.\n2. **Cursor Positioning**: Depending on the initial cursor position (pos), we need to move it to the appropriate positions to close the tabs efficiently.\n3. **Closing Tabs Efficiently**: Closing tabs to the left of l requires the cursor to be at position l, and closing tabs to the right of r requires the cursor to be at position r.\n4. **Calculate Moves**: Calculate the time required to move the cursor to the necessary positions for closing tabs on both sides and sum up the operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    pos = int(input[1])\n    l = int(input[2])\n    r = int(input[3])\n    \n    # If the current range is already [l, r], no actions needed\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Determine the steps needed to close left and right parts\n    steps = 0\n    \n    # Close left part: need to be at position l\n    if pos < l:\n        # Need to move right to l\n        steps += (l - pos)\n        # Then close left (1 sec)\n        steps += 1\n    elif pos > l:\n        # Need to move left to l\n        steps += (pos - l)\n        # Then close left (1 sec)\n        steps += 1\n    else:\n        # Already at l, close left\n        steps += 1\n    \n    # Now, after closing left, the a is l. Now handle the right part\n    # Need to be at r to close right\n    if pos < l:\n        # After closing left, the cursor is at l\n        current_pos = l\n    elif pos > l:\n        # After moving to l and closing left, the cursor is at l\n        current_pos = l\n    else:\n        # Already at l, after closing left, cursor is at l\n        current_pos = l\n    \n    if current_pos < r:\n        steps += (r - current_pos)\n        steps += 1\n    elif current_pos > r:\n        steps += (current_pos - r)\n        steps += 1\n    else:\n        # Already at r, close right\n        steps += 1\n    \n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the target range [l, r] is already the entire set of tabs, no operations are needed.\n2. **Closing Left Tabs**: Calculate the steps required to move the cursor to position l (if not already there) and then close all tabs to the left.\n3. **Closing Right Tabs**: After handling the left side, move the cursor to position r (if not already there) and close all tabs to the right.\n4. **Efficient Movement**: The movement and closing operations are calculated based on the shortest path from the initial cursor position to the required positions for closing tabs, ensuring minimal time consumption.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps required by considering both movement and closing operations optimally.",
