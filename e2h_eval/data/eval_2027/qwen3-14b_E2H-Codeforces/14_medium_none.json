He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find these n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or some other count?) that satisfy this. Wait, the example shows for m=1, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Wait why? Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors, but the count remains the same until the next multiple of 5. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nFor example, 5! has 1 zero. 6! is 720, which also ends with one zero. Similarly for 7!, 8!, 9! — each of these has exactly one trailing zero. Then 10! has two zeros. So for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. So that's five numbers. So the output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nBut how do I find for a given m, what are the possible n's?\n\nThe approach here is to find the possible n's that would result in exactly m trailing zeros. However, there's a catch. For some m, there might be no n's. For example, if m is 5, let's see. Let's compute the trailing zeros for n=24: 24//5 =4, 24//25=0 → total 4. For n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1 → total 6. So between 25 and 24, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that would produce exactly m zeros. The key idea here is that for each m, there's a range of n's that can produce it. But sometimes, there's no such n.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also give the same count.\n\nWait, but how do I find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower and upper bounds of n that would produce exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find those?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing. For example, as n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for any m, the set of n's that satisfy f(n) = m is a contiguous range. However, there might be cases where there's no n for a certain m.\n\nSo for example, for m=5, there's no n such that f(n)=5. So the answer would be 0.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the lower and upper bounds of n where f(n) = m. If such n exists, then the count is upper - lower + 1, and the numbers are from lower to upper inclusive.\n\nBut how to find those bounds?\n\nLet me think about how to find the possible n's for a given m.\n\nLet me first think about how to find the smallest n such that f(n) = m. Then find the largest n such that f(n) = m. If there is no such n, then return zero.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is equal to m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) = m and the maximal n where f(n) = m.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal and maximal n for a given m?\n\nLet me think about the binary search approach. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, we can find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if that n's f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the largest n where f(n) is exactly m. Then the numbers between those two would be the valid ones.\n\nWait, but how to find the largest n where f(n) = m? Well, since f(n) increases when n crosses a multiple of 5, perhaps the maximum n for which f(n) = m is the one before the next multiple of 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum n is the one where f(n) = m and f(n+1) > m. So, for example, for m=1, the maximum n is 9, because 10! has 2 zeros.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\nFind the minimal n where f(n) = m, and the maximal n where f(n) = m. Then the count is max_n - min_n + 1.\n\nBut how to find those values?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFirst, find the lower bound of n where f(n) = m. Let's call it low.\n\nThen find the upper bound, high, where f(high) = m and f(high+1) > m.\n\nIf there is no such low, then the answer is 0.\n\nBut how to find these bounds?\n\nTo find the lower bound, we can perform a binary search for the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) == m. If not, then no solution. Otherwise, the lower bound is n.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there are multiple n's that have f(n) = m. For example, m=1, the lower bound is 5, and the upper bound is 9.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Let's call it start.\n\n- Find the largest n where f(n) = m. Let's call it end.\n\nIf start doesn't exist, then return 0. Else, the answer is end - start + 1, and the numbers from start to end.\n\nBut how to find start and end?\n\nWell, for start, perhaps we can find the first occurrence of m in the f(n) sequence. For end, find the last occurrence.\n\nBut how to do that with binary search?\n\nAlternatively, for the start, we can find the minimal n where f(n) = m. For that, perhaps we can find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m, and then check if f(n) is m. If yes, then that's the start. But how to find the minimal n where f(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the first n where f(n) = m, which can be found by binary search.\n\nBut maybe another way: Let's think about the minimal n where f(n) = m. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, the minimal n is the first occurrence where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think of using binary search to find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m, and then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nOnce we have that, the maximum n for which f(n) = m is the largest n where f(n) = m. How to find that? Well, perhaps we can find the minimal n where f(n) >= m + 1, then subtract 1. Because the numbers between the minimal n for m and the minimal n for m+1 minus 1 would have f(n) = m.\n\nFor example, for m=1:\n\nfind the minimal n where f(n) >= m is 5. Then find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1 (which is 2) is 10. So the maximum n for m=1 is 10-1=9. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems like a good approach.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n_low where f(n_low) >= m.\n\n   Check if f(n_low) != m → then no solution. Return 0.\n\n   Else, find the minimal n_high where f(n_high) >= m+1. Then the maximum n for m is n_high - 1.\n\n   The numbers from n_low to n_high - 1 are all the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n   So the count is (n_high - 1) - n_low + 1 = n_high - n_low.\n\n   So the answer is the list of numbers from n_low to n_high - 1 inclusive.\n\nBut how to compute f(n)?\n\nThe function f(n) is the sum of n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo for example, for n=5, it's 1. For n=25, 5 + 1 =6.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to implementing this function, and then performing binary search to find n_low and n_high.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search for n_low:\n\nWe can set the left and right boundaries. What's the possible range of n for a given m?\n\nWell, since m can be up to 1e5, the maximum possible n for which f(n) = m would be 5*m. Because for example, for m=1, 5*1=5. But for m=5, there's no solution. But for m=6, the n is 25, which is 5*5=25. So maybe the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. Or even 5*m + 1, to be safe.\n\nWait, for example, for m=1, 5*1=5. For m=2, the n could be 10 (f(10)=2). So 5*m is 10. Which is correct. So perhaps the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m.\n\nBut let's think of m=100000. Then 5*m is 500000. But what's the actual n for that m? Well, the function f(n) for n=500000 is 500000/5 + 500000/25 + ... which is 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124,  something. So perhaps 5*m is not sufficient. Wait, but for a given m, the minimal n for which f(n) = m is less than or equal to 5*m. Because for each 5, you get at least one zero. So for m, the minimal n is at least 5*m. Wait, no. For example, m=1, 5*1=5. That's exactly the n. For m=2, the minimal n is 10, which is 5*2. For m=5, the minimal n is 25, which is 5*5. But for m=6, the minimal n is 25 (since f(25)=6). So 5*m would be 30. So 25 < 30. So maybe 5*m is a safe upper bound for binary search.\n\nBut perhaps for some m, the required n is higher than 5*m. Let me think. Suppose m=25. Let's compute f(100) = 100/5 + 100/25 + 100/125 = 20 +4 +0 = 24. So for m=25, the minimal n would be 105? Let's see:\n\nn=105: 105//5 =21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25. So yes. So 5*m = 125. So 105 is less than 125. So 5*m is a safe upper bound.\n\nThus, for binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. But perhaps even higher. Alternatively, we can use a higher upper bound, like 5*m + 5. But for binary search, even if the upper bound is higher, it's okay.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >= m would be between 0 and 5*m.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for the given m, perform binary search to find the minimal n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >= m.\n\nOnce found, check if count_zeros(n_low) is exactly m. If not, then return 0. Else, find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1. Then the maximum n is n_high - 1. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high - 1 are the answers.\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high - 1.\n\nSo the count is (n_high - 1) - n_low + 1 = n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to implement find_min_n(target)?\n\nThe function find_min_n(target) would perform a binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nLet me think about how to write that binary search.\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5 * target (or some upper limit). Then while low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= target → high = mid\n\n   else → low = mid + 1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nBut what if the target is larger than any possible count_zeros(n)? For example, m is very large, but the code is handling it. But since the problem says m can be up to 1e5, and for 5*m, count_zeros(5*m) is definitely >= m. Because count_zeros(5*m) is at least (5*m)/5 = m. So for example, when m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, and count_zeros(5e5) is 5e5/5 + 5e5/25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + ... which is more than m. So the binary search will find a value.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's no n with count_zeros(n) = m? For example, m=5 as discussed earlier.\n\nIn that case, when we find n_low for target m, count_zeros(n_low) is greater than m. So the check will fail, and we return 0.\n\nSo putting this together, the code structure would be:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n // 5\n\n        count += n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nThen, for the input m:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    res = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n\n    print(len(res))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nWait, but in the example given, for m=1:\n\nn_low is 5, n_high is find_min_n(2) which is 10. So the range is 5 to 9 inclusive. So list(range(5, 10)) is [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's test for m=5. Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(5) → what is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5?\n\nLet's compute for n=20: count_zeros(20) = 4. n=25: count_zeros is 6. So the minimal n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So the check fails, and output is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6. Then find_min_n(6) would be 25, since count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) is 25? Let's see. For target=7:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 <7. So the binary search would proceed.\n\nhigh is 5*7=35. Let's see:\n\nAt some point, the code would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nFor n=25, count is 6. n=25+5=30: count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → total 7. So the minimal n is 25?\n\nNo, wait. For n=25, count is 6. For n=25+1=26, count is same as 25. So the minimal n for target 7 is 25? No, because count_zeros(25) is 6 <7. So the binary search would look for higher values. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute find_min_n(7).\n\nlow starts at 0, high is 5*7=35.\n\nInitially, mid is (0+35)//2=17. count_zeros(17) is 3. <7 → low becomes 18.\n\nmid is (18+35)//2 = 26.5 → 26. count_zeros(26) is 5 (26//5=5, 26//25=1 → 5+1=6? Wait 26//5 is 5 (5*5=25, 26-25=1). Then 26//25 is 1. So total is 5+1=6. Still less than 7. So low becomes 27.\n\nmid is (27+35)//2 = 31. count_zeros(31) is 31//5=6, 31//25=1 → 7. So >=7. So high becomes 31.\n\nNow, low=27, high=31. mid is (27+31)/2=29. count_zeros(29) is 29//5=5, 29//25=1 → 6. <7 → low becomes 30.\n\nmid is (30+31)/2=30.5 → 30. count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7. So high becomes 30. Now low=30, high=30. Exit loop. So returns 30. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. Thus, for m=6, the n_low is 25, n_high is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29 inclusive. Let's check count_zeros(25) = 6. count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7. So the numbers 25-29: 5 numbers. So the answer would be 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works for that case.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the case where m is 0. Wait, but according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no, the input m is at least 1. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nBut in the sample input, there's an example where the input is '5' and the output is '0'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut first, the code must read input from stdin. The input is a single integer m. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nThe input is given as ['1', '5'] which probably represents two test cases. Wait, the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. But in the example, the input is given as a list, perhaps as part of a test case. But the user's code must read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code must read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows ['1', '5'] which may be a way to represent two test cases. But according to the problem statement, the code must read one m and output the answer.\n\nBut looking at the sample output, for input 1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for input 5, the output is '0'.\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. The problem says that the input is a single integer m. The sample input is given as a list, perhaps for the purpose of the example. But the actual code must read a single m from stdin.\n\nSo the code should read m as input.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read m via input().strip().\n\nBut in the example given, the input is ['1', '5'], which may be a way to show that for m=1, the output is ... and for m=5, the output is 0. But the code is supposed to handle a single m.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nCheck if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nThe numbers are from n_low to n_high-1 inclusive.\n\nThen output the count and the numbers.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the functions.\n\nBut for large m, say 1e5, the 5*m could be 5e5, which is manageable for binary search.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nThen, in the main code:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    res = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nWait, but for the case where m=1, the code would generate list(range(5, 10)), which is [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there are multiple numbers, but the code returns them correctly.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 1 → Output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Input 5 → Output is 0.\n\nLet's test m=5:\n\nfind_min_n(5) → what is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5?\n\nLet's compute for n=20: count_zeros(20) is 4. n=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So during binary search, the code would find 25 as the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(6) → which is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) is 30. So the list is 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So the output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nBut what about m=2?\n\nfind_min_n(2) → minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=2 is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. Then find_min_n(3) is 15. So the range is 10 to 14. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) = 2, 11: 2, 12:2, 13:2, 14:2. 15:3. So yes, 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there is only one n? For example, m=24. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(99) is 99//5=19 + 99//25=3 + 99//125=0 → 22. 100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0 → 24. So for m=24, the minimal n is 100. Then find_min_n(25) would be 100? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. So for target=25, find_min_n(25) would be 105? Let's compute count_zeros(105):\n\n105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0 → 25. So find_min_n(25) returns 105. So the range is 100 to 104. Let's check count_zeros(100) is 24, count_zeros(104) is 24. So the code would output 5 numbers (100-104). So for m=24, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if m=24 is achieved by only one n? No, because for n=100, 101, 102, 103, 104, the count_zeros is 24. So 5 numbers again. So the code works.\n\nBut what about when m is achieved by exactly one n? For example, when m is 5, but that's impossible. So maybe there's no case where the answer is 1. Because the count_zeros increases by 1 when you hit a multiple of 5, but between multiples of 5, the count_zeros increases by 1 for each multiple of 5. Wait, perhaps for some m, there's only one n. For example, when m is 25, let's see.\n\nWait, for n=100, count_zeros is 24. For n=105, count_zeros is 25. For n=105, 106, 107, 108, 109: count_zeros is 25. Then for n=110, count_zeros is 25 + 2 (because 110//5=22, 110//25=4, 110//125=0 → 22+4=26). So for m=25, the numbers are 105-109. So 5 numbers again. So it seems that whenever there's a solution, there are exactly 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause when you have a number n which is a multiple of 5, but not of 25, then adding 1, 2, 3, 4 to it will not increase the count_zeros. For example, n=5, count_zeros is 1. n=6, same. Up to 9. Then 10 adds another 5, so count_zeros increases by 2 (because 10/5=2, but previous was 1). So for numbers that are multiples of 5 but not 25, the count_zeros increases by 1. But when you cross a multiple of 25, the count_zeros increases by 2. So for example, when n=25, the count_zeros increases by 2 (from 24 to 26? No, earlier example said for 24, count_zeros(99) is 22, and 100 is 24. So perhaps the count_zeros increases by 2 when crossing 25. So for numbers between 25 and 29, the count_zeros is 6. So for m=6, there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code returns 5 numbers for any valid m. But why?\n\nBecause the minimal n for m is a multiple of 5. Because when you have a count_zeros of m, the minimal n is the first occurrence. For example, for m=1, it's 5. For m=6, it's 25. For m=24, it's 100. So when you find the minimal n, it's a multiple of 5. Then, the next numbers (n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4) will have the same count_zeros. Because adding those numbers doesn't add any new 5s. But when you reach n+5, which is the next multiple of 5, then the count_zeros increases by 1 (if it's not a multiple of 25), or more.\n\nThus, the range from n_low to n_high-1 is 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause the next n where count_zeros increases is when you reach the next multiple of 5. So for example, n_low is a multiple of 5. Then, the next multiple of 5 is n_low +5. So the numbers from n_low to n_low +4 (inclusive) will have the same count_zeros. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if n_low is a multiple of 25? For example, let's take m=6. The minimal n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then n_high is find_min_n(7) which is 30. So the range is 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So same as before.\n\nBut what if m is such that the minimal n is 25, and the next multiple of 5 is 30, which adds another 5. So count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 + 1 =7. So the count_zeros increases by 1. So the numbers from 25 to 29 (5 numbers) have count_zeros of 6.\n\nSo in all cases, when there is a solution, the answer is 5 numbers. But wait, what if the next multiple of 5 is not adding exactly 1 to the count_zeros?\n\nFor example, if the minimal n is 125. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(125) is 125//5 =25, 125//25=5, 125//125=1 → 25+5+1=31.\n\ncount_zeros(125+5=130) is 130//5=26, 130//25=5, 130//125=1 → 26+5+1=32. So the count_zeros increases by 1. So the numbers from 125 to 129 (5 numbers) will have count_zeros of 31.\n\nSo again, 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that for any valid m, the answer is either 0 or 5 numbers. But why in the sample input, the output is 5 numbers. So the code would return 5 numbers. But why does the code return 5 numbers?\n\nBecause the code returns the range from n_low to n_high-1. Which is n_high - n_low numbers. For example, in the first sample, n_high is 10, n_low is 5. 10-5=5 numbers. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nBut in the case where the next n_high is n_low +5, then the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if m is such that the next n_high is n_low + 5? For example, m=6, n_low=25, n_high=30. So 30-25=5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the next n_high is n_low + 1? Then the code would return 1 number. Is that possible?\n\nLet me think. Suppose m is such that the count_zeros(n) increases by more than 1 when moving from n to n+1. For example, when n is 24, count_zeros is 4. Then n=25, count_zeros is 6. So for m=5, there's no solution. So for m=4, the code would have n_low=20 (count_zeros(20)=4). Then n_high is find_min_n(5) which is 25. So the range is 20 to 24. Which is 5 numbers. So count_zeros(20) is 4, 21:4, 22:4, 23:4, 24:4. So yes, 5 numbers. So for m=4, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code returns 5 numbers whenever there is a solution.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut in the sample input, when m is 5, the output is 0. Which is handled correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut for m=0, but the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nCheck if count_zeros(n_low) == m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nThe answer is the list from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for large m (like 1e5), the code must run efficiently. Let's see.\n\nThe find_min_n function uses binary search with O(log (5m)) steps. Each step calls count_zeros which is O(log n). So overall, for each find_min_n, it's O(log (5m) * log n). Which is acceptable for m up to 1e5.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when m is 1e5, 5*m is 5e5. So for binary search, the high is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code is:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    res = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code would generate len(res) = 5, and the list is [5,6,7,8,9]. So that's correct.\n\nBut when the code is run for m=5, the code outputs 0.\n\nBut what about the case where the code returns 0?\n\nAnother test case: m=5, the code returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=24, which has 5 numbers.\n\nBut what about when m is 3?\n\nfind_min_n(3) is 15. count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values for `n` that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: We use binary search to efficiently find the smallest and largest values of `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros. This approach leverages the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zero count function.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**: Once the smallest value `n_low` that results in `m` trailing zeros is found, we then determine the smallest value `n_high` that results in `m+1` trailing zeros. The valid range of `n` values is from `n_low` to `n_high - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    res = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `target`. This helps in determining the lower bound of our valid range.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: After reading the input `m`, we determine the smallest `n_low` such that `count_zeros(n_low) == m`. If no such `n_low` exists (i.e., `count_zeros(n_low) != m`), we print 0. Otherwise, we find the smallest `n_high` for `m+1` and generate the list of valid `n` values from `n_low` to `n_high - 1`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the valid range of `n` values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large inputs.",
