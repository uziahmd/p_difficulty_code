He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo, given m, we need to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5! it's 120 (one zero). 6! is 720, same count. Up to 9! which is 362880. So all these numbers have exactly one trailing zero. But why? Because when you go from 5 to 9, the count of 5s increases only once (for 5, 10 would add another). Wait, but 5 is 5, 6 is 6, etc. So for each n between 5 and 9, the count of trailing zeros is 1. So how do we find those ranges?\n\nThe key idea here is that for a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. However, sometimes there might be no such n. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's think about the trailing zeros function. Let's call it f(n). For example, f(5) = 1, f(25) = 6 (since 25 contributes two 5s). Now, the function f(n) is non-decreasing. As n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for a given m, the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros would form a contiguous range. But how?\n\nWait, for example, if m is 5, what happens? Let's see:\n\nLet's compute f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4. Then 25//5 is 5, 25//25 is 1, total 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where f(n) is 5. Therefore, for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find if there exists any n such that f(n) = m, and if so, find all such n's.\n\nBut how to find them?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the minimum n such that f(n) = m. Let's call it low.\n\n2. Find the maximum n such that f(n) = m. Let's call it high.\n\nIf such n exists, then the numbers from low to high inclusive are all valid. The count is high - low + 1.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the possible n's by binary search. But how?\n\nFirst, we need to find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and then find the largest n where f(n) = m.\n\nWait, but how to find the range of n's where f(n) equals m.\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, the possible n's must be in a certain range. Let's think of the function f(n) as steps. Each time n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases. But when n crosses multiples of higher powers of 5, like 25, 125, etc., the count increases by more than 1.\n\nSo, for example, when m is 5, there is no n such that f(n)=5, because the count jumps from 4 (for n=24) to 6 (n=25). So for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nTherefore, the steps to solve the problem could be:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n such that f(n) = m. If there is no such n (i.e., the minimal n is not found), then output 0.\n\nBut how to find those n's?\n\nFirst, let's implement the function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for a given m, we need to find all n where count_zeros(n) == m.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can think that for each m, there is a range of n's where count_zeros(n) = m. However, sometimes there is no such range. For example, when m is 5, as discussed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Find the lower bound of n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's say, find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) = m.\n\n- Then find the upper bound, the largest n such that count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find these bounds?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call it left. Then check if count_zeros(left) is equal to m. If not, then there is no solution. Else, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call it right. Then the numbers from left to right-1 would be the ones with exactly m zeros.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for example, if m=1, then the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1 is 5. The next step is to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2, which is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are the ones with exactly 1 zero. So the count is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFind the lower bound (the first n where count_zeros(n) = m) by finding the first n where count_zeros(n) >=m and check if it's exactly m. Then find the upper bound as the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then subtract 1 to get the upper limit.\n\nBut how to find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=m?\n\nThis can be done via binary search. Since count_zeros(n) is non-decreasing.\n\nSo, for example, to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m, we can perform a binary search between 0 and some upper limit. What's the upper limit?\n\nWell, for m, the maximum possible n that can have count_zeros(n) = m is 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms are 0). But wait, perhaps even smaller. However, for binary search purposes, we can set the upper limit as 5*m. But maybe even higher? Let's think. For example, when m is 1, 5*1 is 5, which is the correct value. For m=6, the upper limit would be 25, since count_zeros(25) is 6. So 5*m is 30, which is higher than 25. So using 5*m as the upper limit for binary search is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps a better upper limit is 5*m. Because for any n, count_zeros(n) is at most n/5 + n/25 + ... which is less than n/4. So, if m is the target, then n can't be larger than 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. So, for binary search, the upper limit can be set as 5*m.\n\nWait, but for example, if m is 5, then the upper limit would be 25. But in this case, count_zeros(25) is 6, which is larger than m=5. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m is 25? But for m=5, there's no n where count_zeros(n) is exactly 5. So the code would check whether count_zeros(25) is equal to 5. It's 6, so no, so the answer is zero.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >= m.\n\n2. Check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, then there are zero solutions.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1.\n\n4. The numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are all the solutions. The count is (n_high - n_low).\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nn_low is 5 (count_zeros(5)=1). Then n_high is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2. That would be 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. So the count is 10-5=5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6. Let's see. The count_zeros(25) is 6. Then the next step is to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=7. Let's see. For 25, count is 6. 26, 27, 28, 29: same count. 30: count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 + 1 =7. So n_high is 30. So the range is 25 to 29. So 5 numbers. So the answer would be 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\nImplement a binary search function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nOnce that is done, for the given m, find the lower bound (n_low) as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m. Then check if count_zeros(n_low) ==m. If not, output 0. Else, find the upper bound (n_high) as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1. So the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to implement the binary search?\n\nLet me think about the binary search function.\n\nFunction find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but what if the high is not sufficient? For example, if the target is m=5. Let's see.\n\nBut in that case, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 would be 25? Because count_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). count_zeros(25) is 6. So the function returns 25. Then, check if count_zeros(25) ==5? No, it's 6. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nSo the steps for the problem are:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, the input m is >=1. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nThen:\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: then output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1, inclusive. So the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nSo the list is [n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1]\n\nBut how to handle cases where m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nBut the binary search is O(log (5*m)), which for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. So log2(5e5) is around 19 steps. So it's efficient.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? According to the input constraints, m is between 1 and 1e5, so no need.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the find_min_n function.\n\nNow, for the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nfind_min_n(1) returns 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. Then find_min_n(2) returns 10. So the numbers are 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5. find_min_n(5) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not 5. So output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. find_min_n(6) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) returns 30. So numbers from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would generate the correct output.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut for the code, the input is a single integer m. So read m from stdin.\n\nBut the example shows that the input can be multiple lines? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line containing an integer m. The example shows that the input is ['1', '5'], but that's probably part of the test case setup. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as:\n\nInput\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. But looking at the sample input, perhaps the actual code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows that for input 1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers, and for input 5, output is 0. But the way the sample is presented is perhaps that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: the only line of input contains an integer m. So the code should process a single m. However, the sample shows that for input 1 and 5, outputs are given. But perhaps that's part of a multi-test case scenario. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: the only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes.\n\nSo the code should read one m from input, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two cases. Probably, that's part of the example. Like, for example, when the input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. When the input is 5, output is 0. So the code should handle one m per run.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read m from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute the possible n's.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nImplement the binary search function:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for some target, the high may need to be higher. For example, when target is 1, 5*target is 5. Which is correct. But for m=6, 5*6=30. The find_min_n(6) would find 25. But 5*target is 30, which is higher than 25. So the binary search works.\n\nBut what if the target is very large? Let's see. For example, m=1e5. The 5*m is 5e5. But the actual n that gives m trailing zeros could be higher than that? Wait, no. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because:\n\ncount_zeros(5*m) = floor(5m/5) + floor(5m/25) + ... = m + floor(m/5) + floor(m/25) + ... which is >=m.\n\nSo the upper bound of 5*m is sufficient.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow, once we find n_low = find_min_n(m). Then check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find n_high = find_min_n(m+1). The numbers are from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nSo the list is [n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1]. The length is n_high - n_low.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample, n_high is find_min_n(2) = 10. So the numbers are 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m.\n\nThen:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but for the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut in code, the list is [5,6,7,8,9], which is generated by range(5, 10), which is 5,6,7,8,9. So yes.\n\nBut in Python, range(n_low, n_high) is from n_low to n_high-1. So yes.\n\nSo code.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the input constraints say m is at least 1.\n\nNow, let's test for m=5.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5). Let's compute:\n\nfind_min_n(5) will search between 0 and 25.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). So for target=5, the binary search would find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Which is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the code checks if count_zeros(25) ==5? No. So output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(6) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) returns 30. So the list is 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=2.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10? Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0). So yes. Then find_min_n(3) is 15. Because count_zeros(15) is 3. So numbers from 10 to 14. So 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, 10! is 3628800, which has two trailing zeros. 11! is 39916800 (two zeros?), no. Wait, 10! has 2 zeros. 11! is 11 * 10! so same number of zeros. Wait, no. Wait, 10! has 2 zeros. 11! has same count as 10! because 11 doesn't contribute any 5s. So for 10, 11, 12, 13, 14: their count is 2. Then 15! adds another 5 (from 15), so count_zeros(15) is 3. So the numbers are 10-14, which is 5 numbers. So code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code needs to read m from stdin. So:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'] — perhaps that's a way to represent multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer. So the code should read one line.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is part of a test case where multiple inputs are processed. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer. Therefore, the code should read a single integer m.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is a single integer. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line containing an integer m. So the code should process one m per run. However, the sample input shows two test cases. Perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description, but perhaps the actual code should process multiple test cases. Or perhaps the sample input is a way to show two different examples. For example, in the first case, the input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. In the second case, input is 5, output is 0. But the way the sample is written is perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer.\n\nThis is conflicting. However, looking at the problem's original statement:\n\nIn the input section, it says \"the only line of input contains an integer m\".\n\nSo the code should read one line, which is m.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines. However, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases. For example, the first input is 1, and the output is the first line, then the second input is 5, and the output is 0. But in reality, the code should process one input per run.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So the code should read one integer m, and output the answer for that m.\n\nThus, the code should read m as input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps in the sample input, the input is given as two separate cases, but the code is supposed to process one case. So the code should read one m.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case is m=1, and the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. The second case is m=5, output is '0'.\n\nSo the code is supposed to process one m per run.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute the answer.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n        numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, for the sample input m=1, the code would generate len(numbers) = 5, and the numbers are 5-9 (range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9). So the output is 5 followed by the numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case, m=5, returns 0.\n\nBut what about m=6? The code would output 5 numbers: 25-29.\n\nBut let's test for m=6:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(6) = 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed.\n\nn_high = find_min_n(7). Let's compute that.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7?\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(29) = 29//5=5, 29//25=1. Total 6. So 29 is 6. 30//5=6, 30//25=1. Total 7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So numbers is range(25,30) → 25,26,27,28,29. Length 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when m=0? Well, the problem says m is ≥1, so no need to handle.\n\nBut what about m=0?\n\nBut the code would return 0, since for m=0, the find_min_n(0) would be 0, but count_zeros(0) is 0, but the code would check if count_zeros(0) is 0. Then n_high = find_min_n(1) which is 5. So numbers is range(0,5) → 0,1,2,3,4. But the problem says positive integers n. So the code would output 5 numbers, but according to the problem statement, n must be positive. However, in the code, the find_min_n(0) returns 0, but count_zeros(0) is 0. So the code would output 0,1,2,3,4. However, the problem says positive integers. So 0 is not allowed. But the code is not handling that.\n\nWait, but the problem says that n is a positive integer. So in our code, when m=0, the code would generate numbers from 0 to 4. But 0 is not a positive integer. However, the problem says m ≥1, so this case is not considered.\n\nBut what about when m is such that the n_low is 0? For example, m=0. But since the problem says m≥1, this is not a case.\n\nBut in our code, for m=1, the n_low is 5, which is correct.\n\nBut what about when m is such that the n_low is 0? Well, since m≥1, and count_zeros(0) is 0, which is less than m. So the code would not generate 0 in the output.\n\nBut let's think. Suppose m=0. Then the code would generate numbers from 0 to 4. But according to the problem, n must be positive. So the code would output 0, but that's incorrect. However, since the problem says m is ≥1, this case is not present.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: m=1. The code returns 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: m=2. The code returns 5 numbers (10-14). Let's check count_zeros(10) is 2. Yes.\n\nAnother case: m=3. Let's see. find_min_n(3) would be 15 (count_zeros(15) = 3). Then find_min_n(4) is 20. Because count_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). So numbers are 15-19. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, testing for m=5. The code returns 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, code is ready. But need to make sure that the code handles the case when m is 0. But the problem says m is ≥1.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nBut the code's binary search is efficient.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If there are such integers, we must also list them in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, so the count of 5s dictates the number of trailing zeros.\n\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: The function `count_zeros(n)` computes the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing the integer divisions of $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc., until the quotient is zero.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To efficiently find the range of values $ n $ such that $ n! $ has exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search. We first find the smallest $ n $ where the trailing zeros count is at least $ m $. Then, we check if this count is exactly $ m $. If not, there are no valid $ n $. Otherwise, we find the smallest $ n $ where the count is at least $ m + 1 $ to determine the upper bound of our valid range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer $ m $.\n2. **Finding Lower Bound**: Using binary search, we find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $.\n3. **Validation Check**: If the count of trailing zeros at this lower bound is not exactly $ m $, we print 0 as there are no valid $ n $.\n4. **Finding Upper Bound**: If valid, we find the smallest $ n $ where the trailing zeros count is at least $ m + 1 $. The valid range of $ n $ values is from the lower bound to one less than this upper bound.\n5. **Output**: The count of valid $ n $ values and the values themselves are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable even for large values of $ m $.",
