    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nSo, a good tree has edges with weights 1 or -1. And for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Oh right, because each edge is connected to two vertices. So for every vertex, when you multiply all the edges connected to it, you get -1.\n\nWait, that seems like a constraint on the degrees of the tree? Or maybe not directly. Because each edge contributes to two vertices. For example, if an edge between u and v has weight w, then it's part of the product for both u and v.\n\nBut how can this condition be satisfied? Let's think about the product for each vertex. Let me consider the product of all edges adjacent to a vertex. For each vertex, that product must be -1.\n\nLet me think about the entire tree. Suppose I take the product of all the edge weights in the tree. Each edge is counted twice in the product of all vertex products. Because each edge is connected to two vertices. So the product of all vertex products would be (product of all edges)^2. But since each vertex's product is -1, the total product would be (-1)^n. Therefore:\n\n(product of all edges)^2 = (-1)^n\n\nBut the product of all edges is some value. Let's denote it as P. Then P^2 = (-1)^n. So P must be ±1, but squared equals (-1)^n. Wait, but (-1)^n can be 1 or -1. However, P squared is always positive. So for this equation to hold, (-1)^n must be 1. Which implies that n must be even. Wait, that's a contradiction unless n is even. Wait, but if n is odd, then (-1)^n is -1. Then P^2 would have to equal -1, which is impossible. Therefore, there are no good trees when n is odd?\n\nWait, that's a big conclusion. Let me check again. The product of all vertex products is (-1)^n. But the product of all vertex products is also (product of edge weights)^2, since each edge is counted twice. Therefore:\n\n(product of edge weights)^2 = (-1)^n.\n\nBut (product of edge weights)^2 is always 1, because any real number squared is positive. Wait, but if each edge is either 1 or -1, then the product of all edges is ±1. So when you square it, you get 1. Therefore, 1 = (-1)^n. Which implies that (-1)^n must be 1. Therefore, n must be even. Otherwise, there are no good trees. \n\nSo for odd n ≥ 1, the answer is zero. Wait, but the sample input includes n=2 (even), which works. For n=1, there's only one vertex. But the problem says that for each vertex, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. But for a single vertex, there are no edges. So the product is 1? But the condition requires it to be -1. Therefore, for n=1, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer is zero. \n\nLooking at the sample input where n=1, the output is 0, which matches. So this suggests that for n odd, the answer is zero. But wait, when n is even, then the equation holds. So for even n, there may be good trees. \n\nSo the first thing to note is that for n odd, the answer is zero. So in our code, we can immediately return 0 if n is odd. But what about when n is even?\n\nNow, for even n, how do we compute the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees?\n\nBut first, how many good trees are there? Well, the problem says that the total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}, but only some of them are good. \n\nBut perhaps we need to find the number of good trees, and then compute the sum of d(1,n) for each of them. But that seems difficult. However, perhaps there's a clever way to compute the sum without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For each vertex, the product of the edge weights adjacent to it is -1. Let me think about the degrees of the vertices. Suppose a vertex has degree k. Then the product of its edges is -1. Since each edge is ±1, the product is -1. So the product of the edges adjacent to a vertex is -1. Let's think about the parity of the degree. For example, if a vertex has degree 1, then the product is just the weight of that single edge, which must be -1. If the degree is 2, then the product of two edges is -1. So the product of two numbers (each ±1) is -1. That implies that exactly one of them is -1 and the other is 1. So for a vertex of degree 2, the edges must have different signs. \n\nBut how does this affect the structure of the tree? It seems that for each vertex, the number of edges with weight -1 adjacent to it must be odd. Because the product is -1, so the count of -1s must be odd. Because the product is (-1)^{number of -1s} multiplied by 1^{others}. So for each vertex, the number of edges with weight -1 adjacent to it is odd. \n\nThis seems like a key point. Let me think: For each vertex, the number of edges with weight -1 connected to it must be odd. \n\nNow, considering that each edge connects two vertices, if I assign a weight of -1 to an edge, it contributes to the count of both endpoints. So the sum over all vertices of the number of -1 edges adjacent to them is equal to twice the number of edges with weight -1. Because each such edge is counted twice. \n\nBut since each vertex has an odd count of -1 edges adjacent to it, the sum over all vertices is sum_{v} (odd) = n * (some odd number). But n is even. So sum is even. But the sum is twice the number of -1 edges. Which is even. So that's okay. \n\nSo, for even n, there's a possibility of such trees. Now, how can we model this? \n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of variables. For each edge, we can assign a weight of 1 or -1. However, the assignments must satisfy that for each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. \n\nBut this seems like a system of equations. Let me think about it. For each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. Let me take logarithms? No, since we are dealing with multiplicative constraints. Alternatively, take the product as a product of variables. \n\nAlternatively, think of each edge as a variable x_e ∈ {1, -1}. Then, for each vertex v, the product of x_e for all edges e incident to v is -1. \n\nThis seems like a system of equations. However, the variables are the edges. How many equations do we have? For each vertex, one equation. But since the product of all vertex equations gives (product of x_e)^2 = (-1)^n. Which for even n, is 1. Which is consistent with the product of x_e being ±1. \n\nBut how many independent equations are there? For a tree with n vertices, there are n-1 edges. The number of equations is n. However, the equations are not independent. For example, the product of all equations for the vertices is (product of x_e)^2 = (-1)^n. Which for even n, gives 1 = 1. So the equations are dependent. So the system has rank n-1. Therefore, the number of solutions is 2^{n-1 - (n-1)} } ? Wait, no. Because each equation is multiplicative. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the product of all equations gives a condition that is automatically satisfied. So, the number of equations is n, but with one dependency. So the system has n-1 independent equations. But how many variables? There are n-1 variables (edges). So for the system to be solvable, the number of equations must be compatible. \n\nBut in this case, the system is over-constrained. Wait, but for a tree, perhaps there's a unique solution once certain conditions are met. \n\nAlternatively, think of the equations as follows. For each vertex v, the product of edges adjacent to v is -1. Let me consider the product of all edges adjacent to v. Let me denote this as P_v = -1. \n\nNow, for a tree, the edges form a connected graph. Let me pick a root, say vertex 1. Let me think about the tree as a rooted tree. Then, for each node, except the root, there's a parent edge. \n\nBut how can we model the constraints? Let me think recursively. For example, suppose I have a tree structure. For each node, the product of its edges is -1. For the root, the product of all edges adjacent to it must be -1. But each of those edges connects to a child. \n\nBut perhaps this approach is too vague. Let's think of the problem as a system of equations. For example, for each edge, assign a variable x_e ∈ {±1}. For each vertex v, the product of x_e for edges adjacent to v is -1. \n\nLet me think of the variables as x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-1} (for the n-1 edges). Then, for each vertex v, we have an equation: product_{e adjacent to v} x_e = -1. \n\nBut solving this system seems challenging. However, for a tree, the structure is connected and acyclic. Perhaps we can find a way to assign variables. \n\nAlternatively, think of the equations as linear equations over GF(2), but since the product is -1, which is equivalent to the sum of exponents mod 2 being 1. \n\nLet me take the logarithm. Let me represent each x_e as (-1)^{a_e}, where a_e is 0 or 1. Then, the product of edges adjacent to v is (-1)^{sum_{e adjacent to v} a_e} = -1. Which implies that sum_{e adjacent to v} a_e ≡ 1 mod 2. So each vertex has an odd sum of a_e's for its adjacent edges. \n\nSo now the problem is transformed into finding the number of assignments of a_e ∈ {0, 1} to edges such that for each vertex, the sum of a_e's adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. \n\nThis is a system of linear equations over GF(2). Let's see. For each vertex, the sum of a_e for edges adjacent to it is 1. \n\nBut how many variables and equations? There are n-1 variables (edges) and n equations (one per vertex). But again, the equations are not independent. The sum of all equations is sum_{v} sum_{e adjacent to v} a_e = sum_{v} 1 mod 2. \n\nBut the left-hand side counts each edge twice (since each edge is adjacent to two vertices). So the left-hand side is 2 * sum_{e} a_e mod 2, which is 0. On the right-hand side, sum_{v} 1 is n mod 2. So 0 ≡ n mod 2. Which implies that n must be even. Which aligns with our previous conclusion. So when n is even, the system is consistent. \n\nSo, for even n, the system has solutions. How many solutions are there? The system has n equations, but they are dependent. The rank of the system is n-1. So the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 2^0 = 1? Wait, no. Wait, the number of variables is m = n-1. The number of independent equations is r = n-1. Because the sum of equations is 0 ≡ 0. So the rank is r = n-1. Therefore, the number of solutions is 2^{m - r} } = 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1. So there is exactly one solution? \n\nWait, that can't be right. For example, in the sample input where n=2. There is only one edge. The equations are for vertex 1 and vertex 2. The sum of a_e (the single edge) must be 1 for both vertices. So the equation is a_e = 1 mod 2. So the solution is a_e = 1. Which corresponds to the edge weight being -1. Which matches the first sample. \n\nSo for n=2, there is exactly one solution. Which makes sense. For n=4, according to the third sample, there are 16 good trees. Wait, but according to this analysis, there should be exactly one assignment of a_e's (the variables) that satisfy the equations. But each a_e determines the edge weight (x_e = -1^{a_e}), so the number of good trees is equal to the number of valid assignments of a_e's. But according to this, there's exactly one assignment. But the sample says for n=4, there are 16 good trees. Wait, this is conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Wait, the variables a_e are the exponents for the edge weights. But the problem allows for any tree structure. Oh! Oh right! The system of equations is for a fixed tree structure. So the previous analysis applies to a fixed tree. However, the problem considers all possible trees (structures) and their edge weight assignments. \n\nSo the total number of good trees is equal to (number of trees) × (number of valid edge weight assignments per tree). But according to the system of equations, for each tree structure, there is exactly one valid assignment of edge weights (since the system has exactly one solution). Wait, but that would imply that the total number of good trees is equal to the number of trees (n^{n-2}) multiplied by 1. But the sample says for n=4, there are 16 good trees. Let's check. \n\nFor n=4, the number of trees is 4^{2} = 16. According to the sample, there are 16 good trees. Which would match this. Because for each tree, there's exactly one valid assignment of edge weights. So the total is 16 × 1 = 16. Which matches the sample. So that seems correct. \n\nSo the conclusion is: for even n, each tree (structure) has exactly one valid edge weight assignment. Therefore, the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} (the number of trees) multiplied by 1. \n\nSo now, the problem reduces to: for each tree structure, compute d(1,n) under the unique valid edge weight assignment, and sum all these values over all possible tree structures. \n\nBut how do we compute this sum? Because for each tree structure, the edge weights are determined uniquely. So the challenge is to find the sum over all possible trees (structures) of d(1,n) under their unique edge weight assignment. \n\nSo the problem becomes: find the sum of d(1,n) over all possible trees on n vertices, where each tree has a unique edge weight assignment that satisfies the product conditions. \n\nBut how do we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nFirst, let's think about what d(1,n) represents. It is the sum of the weights of the edges along the unique path from node 1 to node n. \n\nBut for each tree, the edge weights are determined uniquely. So, perhaps we can find a way to express d(1,n) in terms of the structure of the tree, and then find the sum over all trees. \n\nBut how to find this sum? Let's think about the edge weights. For each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined. How?\n\nEarlier, we converted the problem into a system of equations over GF(2), where for each vertex, the sum of a_e (the exponents) for edges adjacent to it is 1. And we found that for each tree, there is exactly one solution to this system. \n\nLet me think of this system again. The variables are a_e (for edges). The equations are sum_{e adjacent to v} a_e = 1 mod 2 for each vertex v. \n\nHow can we solve this system? Let me think of the tree as a rooted tree. Let's pick node 1 as the root. Then, for each node, we can assign a value based on its parent. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose I have a tree rooted at node 1. For each node u (other than the root), there is a parent p(u). Let me define the edge between u and p(u) as e_u. \n\nNow, for the root node (node 1), the sum of a_e for all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. Let's say the root has degree k. Then, the sum of a_e's for its edges is 1. For each of its children, say node v, the sum of a_e's for edges adjacent to v is 1. But each node v has exactly one edge to its parent (e_v) and possibly other edges (to children). \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to express the variables in terms of the root. For example, if we set the variables for the edges in terms of the root's variables. \n\nAlternatively, think of the system as follows. Let me consider that the system has a unique solution. How can I compute the variables? \n\nLet me imagine that the tree is rooted at node 1. For each node, except the root, there is a unique path to the root. Let me think of the variables for the edges as follows. For each node u (other than the root), let me assign a variable a_{u} which represents the value of the edge between u and its parent. Then, for each node u, the sum of a_e's adjacent to it is 1. \n\nFor the root node, the sum of a_e's for its edges is 1. For a non-root node u, the sum of a_e's adjacent to it is the value of the edge to its parent (a_u) plus the sum of the variables of the edges to its children. \n\nBut this seems complex. However, perhaps there's a way to express the variables in terms of the root. \n\nLet me think for the non-root nodes. For a leaf node (other than the root), the sum of a_e's adjacent to it is 1. Since it has only one edge (to its parent), the sum is a_u = 1 mod 2. Therefore, for a leaf node, a_u = 1. \n\nBut for a node with multiple children, this might not hold. Wait, let's think recursively. Suppose we have a node u (non-root) with parent p. The sum of a_e's adjacent to u is the edge to p (a_u) plus the sum of the edges to its children. Let me call this sum S. Then S = 1 mod 2. \n\nBut for each child v of u, the sum of a_e's adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. For each child v, the sum includes the edge from v to u (which is a_v) and the edges from v to its own children. \n\nThis seems recursive. But perhaps there's a pattern. Let me think of the variables in terms of the depth of the nodes. \n\nAlternatively, think of the entire system. Since the system has a unique solution, perhaps we can find that the variables are determined by the following: for each edge, the value is determined by the parity of the number of nodes in some subtree. \n\nAlternatively, think of the system as follows. Let me choose an arbitrary root (say, node 1). For each node, the sum of a_e's adjacent to it is 1. \n\nLet me consider the root. Let me denote the edges from the root to its children as e_1, e_2, ..., e_k. Let me denote the variables for these edges as a_1, a_2, ..., a_k. The sum of these variables must be 1 mod 2. \n\nFor each child of the root (say, node v), the sum of a_e's adjacent to it includes the edge from the root to v (a_v) and the edges from v to its children. Let's denote the sum of those edges as s_v. Then, for node v, we have a_v + s_v = 1 mod 2. \n\nSimilarly, for each of v's children, say w, we have their own equations. \n\nBut this seems like a recursive relation. For example, for a node u, the sum of the a_e's adjacent to it is equal to the a_e of the edge from u to its parent plus the sum of the a_e's of the edges from u to its children. Let's denote this as:\n\nFor the root, sum_children_a = 1 mod 2.\n\nFor any other node u, a_parent(u) + sum_children_a(u) = 1 mod 2.\n\nLet me rearrange this for non-root nodes:\n\nsum_children_a(u) = 1 - a_parent(u) mod 2.\n\nBut this seems like a way to express the sum of children's edges for a node u. \n\nBut how can we find the variables? Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a tree rooted at node 1. Let me perform a post-order traversal. For each node u, after processing all children, I can determine the value of a_u (the edge from u to its parent). \n\nWait, but how? Let me think. For a node u, which is not the root, its parent is p. The sum of the a_e's adjacent to u is 1. The sum includes the edge to p (a_u) and the sum of the edges from u to its children. Let me call the sum of the edges from u to its children as S. So:\n\na_u + S = 1 mod 2.\n\nBut what is S? For each child v of u, the edge from u to v is a_v (the variable for the edge between u and v). However, for each child v, the sum of the edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2, which includes the edge from v to u (a_v) and the sum of the edges from v to its children. \n\nBut during the traversal, for each node u, after processing its children, we can calculate S as the sum of the a_v's for the children. Because each child v's edge to u is a_v. \n\nSo for node u, the sum S is the sum of a_v for all children v of u. Then:\n\na_u = 1 - S mod 2.\n\nBut how is this helpful? Because for each node u, the a_u is determined by the sum of the a_v's of its children. \n\nLet me take an example. Suppose u is a leaf node (not the root). Then, it has no children. So S is 0. Thus, a_u = 1 - 0 = 1 mod 2. Which matches our earlier thought that leaves (non-root) have a_u = 1. \n\nAnother example: consider a root with two children. Let's say the root is node 1, and children are node 2 and node 3. Both nodes 2 and 3 are leaves. Then, for node 2, S is 0, so a_2 = 1. Similarly, a_3 = 1. The sum of the root's edges is a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 1 = 2 mod 2 is 0. But the root's equation requires that sum to be 1 mod 2. Contradiction. Wait, this suggests that my reasoning is wrong. \n\nWait, but earlier analysis said that for even n, the system is consistent. But here, for n=3 (which is odd), but in this case, we have n=3 (but n must be even). So perhaps this example is invalid. Let's take n=4. Let's say the tree is a root (node 1) with three children (nodes 2, 3, 4). All are leaves. Then, for each of nodes 2,3,4, their a_u is 1. The sum of the root's edges is 1+1+1 = 3 mod 2 is 1. Which satisfies the root's equation. So yes, that works. \n\nSo for this tree, the edge weights are determined as follows: each edge from root to child is 1 (since a_u is 1, which means x_e = -1^1 = -1). Then, the product for the root is (-1)^3 = -1, which is correct. For each child, the product is just the edge to the root, which is -1. Correct. \n\nSo this example works. \n\nSo the general approach is: for each node u (non-root), the value of the edge from u to its parent is 1 minus the sum of the a_v's of its children (mod 2). \n\nBut how can we use this to find the value of d(1, n) for the tree?\n\nThe value d(1, n) is the sum of the weights of the edges along the path from 1 to n. Each edge's weight is -1^{a_e}, where a_e is 0 or 1. So the sum is sum_{e on path} (-1)^{a_e}.\n\nBut how can we find this sum for all trees?\n\nAlternatively, notice that for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined. So for each tree, the value of d(1,n) depends on the path from 1 to n and the a_e values along that path. \n\nBut how to compute the sum over all trees?\n\nPerhaps we can find for each possible tree structure, what is the contribution of d(1,n) to the total sum. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. For each tree, the value of d(1,n) is determined by the unique assignment of a_e's. Let's think of the path from 1 to n. Let's denote the edges on this path as e_1, e_2, ..., e_k, where k is the length of the path (which is n-1 for a tree, but the path from 1 to n is of length equal to the depth of n in the tree). \n\nEach edge e_i on this path has a certain value of a_e. The contribution of this edge to d(1,n) is (-1)^{a_e}. \n\nSo, the sum over all trees is the sum over all possible trees of [sum_{e on path} (-1)^{a_e}].\n\nBut how can we compute this? \n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can find the expected value of (-1)^{a_e} for an edge e on the path from 1 to n, and multiply by the number of trees where e is on the path. But this line of thinking may not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, notice that for any tree, the value of d(1,n) can be written as the sum of the weights of the edges on the path from 1 to n. Let's denote this sum as S. Our goal is to compute the sum of S across all trees. \n\nBut since S is additive, perhaps we can swap the order of summation. Instead of summing over trees and adding S, we can sum over all edges e, and for each edge e, compute the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by the expected value of (-1)^{a_e} for that edge in such trees. \n\nBut this requires knowing for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the expected value of (-1)^{a_e} given that e is on the path. \n\nBut how can we compute this?\n\nAlternatively, think about the contribution of each edge e to the total sum. For each tree, if e is on the path from 1 to n, then it contributes (-1)^{a_e} to the sum S. Therefore, the total sum is the sum over all edges e of [number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by E[(-1)^{a_e} | e is on the path]]. \n\nBut how to compute E[(-1)^{a_e} | e is on the path]?\n\nBut first, for each edge e, what is the probability that it is on the path from 1 to n in a random tree? And what is the expected value of (-1)^{a_e} given that e is on the path?\n\nBut perhaps we can find that for each edge e, the expected value of (-1)^{a_e} is zero. But that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find for each edge e, the value of (-1)^{a_e} in terms of the tree structure. \n\nLet me think about the variables a_e. For a given tree, the variables a_e are determined by the system of equations. So for each edge e, the value of a_e depends on the structure of the tree. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again about the system of equations. For each tree, the variables a_e are uniquely determined. For example, in the case where the tree is a star (root with all other nodes as children), the a_e for each edge is 1 (as in the earlier example). So the weight of each edge is -1. \n\nBut for a different tree structure, say, a chain. For example, n=4. Let's imagine the tree is a chain 1-2-3-4. \n\nLet's find the values of a_e. \n\nLet's root the tree at 1. The tree has edges (1-2), (2-3), (3-4). \n\nFor node 4 (a leaf), the sum of a_e's adjacent to it is a_3 (edge between 3 and 4) = 1 mod 2. So a_3 = 1. \n\nFor node 3: it has edges to 2 (a_2) and to 4 (a_3 = 1). The sum must be 1 mod 2. So a_2 + 1 = 1 → a_2 = 0. \n\nFor node 2: edges to 1 (a_1) and to 3 (a_2 = 0). Sum is a_1 + 0 = 1 mod 2 → a_1 = 1. \n\nFor node 1: edges to 2 (a_1 = 1). Sum is 1 mod 2. Which is correct. \n\nSo the variables are a_1 = 1, a_2 = 0, a_3 = 1. \n\nThus, the edge weights are:\n\n(1-2): -1^1 = -1\n\n(2-3): -1^0 = 1\n\n(3-4): -1^1 = -1\n\nThe path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4, with sum of weights -1 + 1 + (-1) = -1. \n\nSo for this tree, d(1,4) is -1. \n\nIn the sample input for n=4, the total sum is -10. Which is the sum of all trees' d(1,4). \n\nNow, for each edge e in the tree, what is the value of (-1)^{a_e}? \n\nBut how can we find this for any tree? \n\nLet me think about the variables a_e. For any tree, the variables are uniquely determined. Perhaps there's a way to find that for any edge e on the path from 1 to n, the value of a_e is equal to the parity of the number of nodes in the subtree below e. Or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, think of the system of equations. For any tree, the value of a_e can be determined by the following: when you remove the edge e, the tree splits into two subtrees. Let me assume that the edge e connects u and v, where u is closer to the root (node 1) than v. Then, the subtree rooted at v has s nodes. \n\nThen, for the system of equations, the value of a_e is determined by the size of the subtree. \n\nWait, in the earlier example of the chain 1-2-3-4. The edge between 1 and 2 has a_e = 1. The subtree rooted at 2 has 3 nodes. The edge between 2 and 3 has a_e = 0. The subtree rooted at 3 has 2 nodes. The edge between 3 and 4 has a_e = 1. The subtree rooted at 4 has 1 node. \n\nIs there a pattern here? Let me see:\n\nFor the edge between u and v, where v is in the subtree, the a_e is 1 if the size of the subtree is odd, and 0 if even?\n\nIn the first case, the subtree size is 3 (odd) → a_e = 1. Second case, subtree size is 2 (even) → a_e = 0. Third case, subtree size is 1 (odd) → a_e = 1. Yes, this seems to fit. \n\nLet me check another example. Take the star tree with root 1 and children 2,3,4. Each edge has a_e = 1. The subtree size for each edge is 1 (since the subtree is just the child node). Which is odd → a_e = 1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: suppose the tree is 1 connected to 2, and 2 connected to 3 and 4. So the root is 1, with child 2, which has children 3 and 4. \n\nFor edge between 1 and 2: the subtree size is 3 (nodes 2,3,4). Odd → a_e = 1. \n\nFor edge between 2 and 3: subtree size is 1 (node 3) → a_e = 1. \n\nFor edge between 2 and 4: subtree size is 1 → a_e = 1. \n\nNow, for node 2, the sum of a_e's adjacent to it is a_1 (edge to 1) + a_3 (edge to 3) + a_4 (edge to 4) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 mod 2 = 1. Correct. \n\nFor node 1: sum of a_e's is a_1 = 1 → correct. \n\nFor node 3: sum of a_e is a_3 = 1 → correct. Same for node 4. \n\nYes, this seems to work. So the value of a_e for an edge e is 1 if the size of the subtree below e is odd, and 0 otherwise. \n\nWait, but how is this determined? \n\nBecause when you process the tree in a post-order traversal, the value of a_e for an edge from parent u to child v is determined by the sum of the a_e's of the children of v. Which, for the case of a leaf node, is zero. Then a_e for the edge from u to v is 1 - 0 = 1. \n\nBut for a node v with children, the sum of their a_e's is computed, and then the a_e of the edge from v's parent to v is 1 minus that sum. \n\nThis seems to lead to the conclusion that the value of a_e for an edge is equal to the parity of the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at v. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the subtree rooted at v has s nodes. Then, the value of a_e for the edge between u (parent) and v is 1 if s is odd, else 0. \n\nLet me see why. For a leaf node, s=1 (odd) → a_e = 1. For a node v with children, the sum of the a_e's of the children's edges is sum_{children w} (parity of their subtree sizes). Let's say that the sum is s_children. Then, the a_e for the edge between u and v is 1 - s_children mod 2. \n\nBut what is the parity of the subtree rooted at v? It's 1 + sum of the sizes of the children's subtrees. So s = 1 + sum (s_w). \n\nThe parity of s is (1 + sum (s_w)) mod 2. \n\nBut the a_e for the edge between u and v is 1 - sum (a_w) mod 2. \n\nBut what is sum (a_w)? Each a_w is the parity of the size of the subtree rooted at w. \n\nSo sum (a_w) mod 2 is sum (s_w mod 2) mod 2. \n\nSo, the a_e for the edge from u to v is 1 - sum (s_w mod 2) mod 2. \n\nBut the parity of s (the size of the subtree rooted at v) is (1 + sum (s_w mod 2)) mod 2. \n\nLet me denote s_parity = (1 + sum (s_w mod 2)) mod 2. \n\nThen, a_e = 1 - sum (s_w mod 2) mod 2. \n\nLet me express this in terms of s_parity. \n\nsum (s_w mod 2) = (s_parity - 1) mod 2. \n\nSo substituting into a_e:\n\na_e = 1 - (s_parity - 1) mod",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the distances $d(1, n)$ for all \"good\" edge-weighted trees with $n$ vertices. A tree is considered good if each vertex has a product of edge weights incident to it equal to -1. The solution involves leveraging properties of trees and modular arithmetic to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: A tree is good if each vertex has an odd number of edges with weight -1. This constraint leads to specific structural properties of the tree.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic Insight**: For even $n$, there are valid configurations of edge weights that satisfy the conditions. For odd $n$, no such configurations exist, leading to a result of 0.\n3. **Tree Structure and Edge Contributions**: Each edge's contribution to the distance $d(1, n)$ can be determined based on the size of the subtree rooted at the child node. If the size is odd, the edge weight is -1; otherwise, it is 1.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Using combinatorial insights and properties of trees, we derive that the sum of contributions from all valid trees can be computed using precomputed factorials and modular inverses.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial\n    max_n = 5 * 10**5 + 10\n    fact = [1] * (max_n)\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n)\n    for i in range(1, max_n):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    \n    inv_fact[max_n-1] = pow(fact[max_n-1], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_n-2, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    def comb(n, k):\n        if k < 0 or k > n:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD\n    \n    # The answer is (-1)^(k) * (n-1 choose k) * (n^{n-2}) ) * something?\n    # Wait, according to the analysis, the total sum is:\n    # For each tree, the distance d(1,n) is the sum of the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n    # Each edge contributes -1 if the size of the subtree is odd, else 1.\n    # But the sum over all trees is (n^{n-2}) * (-1)^{something} ?\n\n    # According to the sample for n=4, the sum is -10.
