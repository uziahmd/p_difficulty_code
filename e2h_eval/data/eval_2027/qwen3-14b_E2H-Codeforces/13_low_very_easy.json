For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone? Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Wait, the problem says that the distance between consecutive notes is one semitone, and that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me check that.\n\nFor example, C to C# is 1 semitone. Then C to D is 2, C to D# is 3, C to E is 4. So yes, that's correct. So the distance between two notes is the number of semitones between them when moving upwards. So for example, the distance from X to Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. Wait, but how do we calculate the distance between two notes?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones.\"\n\nWait, so the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones when you go from X to Y in the upward direction. So if X is lower than Y, then it's the difference. But if Y is lower than X, then it's (12 - (X-Y))? Or perhaps, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that the distance is always the minimal number of semitones when moving upwards. Wait, no. Because the example says between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's see:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So from C to E: C to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, D to D# is 3, D# to E is 4. So yes, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. But if you have E to C, then the distance would be 8 semitones because you have to go E to F (1), F to F# (2), F# to G (3), G to G# (4), G# to A (5), A to B (6), B to H (7), H to C (8). So that's 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if the result is negative, add 12? Or perhaps, the distance is calculated as (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). Wait, but how to compute that.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance between them is (y_pos - x_pos) if y is higher than x, else (y_pos - x_pos + 12). But since the notes are arranged in a cycle, the distance between X and Y can be calculated as (y_pos - x_pos) % 12. Wait, no. Because if X is C (position 0), Y is E (position 4), then (4-0) =4. Which is correct. If X is E (position 4) and Y is C (position 0), then (0 -4) is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y - X + 12) semitones. So the formula is (y_pos - x_pos) if y is higher than x, else (y_pos -x_pos + 12). Which is equivalent to (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. But since the mod can be negative, but in Python",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent each note as an index in a list of musical notes. This helps in quickly calculating the semitone distances between notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using their indices. The distance is computed as the difference in their positions modulo 12, ensuring it is always a positive value.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if they form a major or minor triad:\n   - A major triad has distances of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note.\n   - A minor triad has distances of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef get_distance(a, b):\n    # Calculate the distance from a to b (a to b upwards)\n    a_idx = note_to_index(a)\n    b_idx = note_to_index(b)\n    return (b_idx - a_idx) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    d1 = get_distance(x, y)\n    d2 = get_distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    d1 = get_distance(x, y)\n    d2 = get_distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note to Index Conversion**: The `note_to_index` function converts a musical note to its corresponding index in the list of all notes. This allows for quick distance calculations.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function computes the number of semitones between two notes, considering the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Triad Check Functions**: `is_major` and `is_minor` functions check if a permutation of three notes forms a major or minor triad based on the specified semitone distances.\n4. **Classification Function**: The `classify_chord` function checks all permutations of the input notes to determine if they form a major, minor, or strange chord.\n5. **Main Function**: Reads input, processes the notes, and prints the result based on the classification.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the three notes are checked efficiently, providing the correct classification for the given chord.",
