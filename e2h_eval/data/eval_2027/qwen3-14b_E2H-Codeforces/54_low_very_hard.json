Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Mister B wants to find three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a regular polygon, each interior angle can be calculated. But wait, the problem isn't about the interior angles of the polygon. Instead, it's about choosing three vertices such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) has sides passing through two other vertices (v1 and v3). So the angle is formed by two chords of the polygon.\n\nLet me think about the geometry here. For a regular n-gon, all the vertices lie on a circle. So the angle at v2 depends on the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2. Since the polygon is regular, the central angles between consecutive vertices are equal. Let's consider the central angle between two adjacent vertices as 2π/n radians, or 360/n degrees.\n\nNow, for any three points v1, v2, v3 in the polygon, with v2 being the vertex of the angle, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps away v1 and v3 are from v2 along the perimeter. Let's say there are k steps from v2 to v1 clockwise, and m steps from v2 to v3 clockwise. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the actual angle depends on the arc lengths between these points.\n\nWait, maybe there's a formula for this. Let me think. Suppose we have a regular polygon with n sides. Let's fix v2 as a vertex. Then, if there are k vertices between v2 and v1 (in one direction), and l vertices between v2 and v3 (in the other direction), then the angle at v2 would be determined by the arcs between these points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v2 and between v3 and v2. Let me think of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle. The angle formed at v2 by points v1 and v3 depends on the arcs between these points.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. If there are k steps between v2 and v1 (along one side of the polygon), then the arc between them is k * (360/n) degrees. Similarly for the other side.\n\nBut the angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that an angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half the measure of the central angle for that arc. So, if I have points A, B, C on a circle, then angle ABC is half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't contain B.\n\nWait, but in our case, the angle is at v2, with v1 and v3 on the sides. So the angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Because in the circle, the angle formed by two chords at a point is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.\n\nSo for example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the arc between them (not containing v2) would be (n-2) steps? No, wait. Let me think again. Suppose the polygon is a regular pentagon (n=5). Let's take v2 as a vertex. If v1 is the next vertex clockwise, and v3 is the previous vertex counter-clockwise, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2 would be 3 steps (since the total circle is 5 steps, and the arc that includes v2 is 1 step (from v1 to v2 to v3?), no. Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps in the polygon when going around the circle in one direction. Then the arc length between them is k*(360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of that arc's measure if the arc is the one that's opposite to the angle. Wait, no. Let me think of the standard case: in a regular polygon, the angle formed by three consecutive vertices (like v1, v2, v3) is the internal angle of the polygon. For a regular n-gon, each internal angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But according to the inscribed angle theorem, that angle would be half of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Let's see: in a regular polygon, the arc between v1 and v3 (when they are adjacent to v2) would be (n-2)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and using efficient calculations to determine the optimal vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Geometry**: In a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the arcs subtended by those vertices. Using the inscribed angle theorem, we can determine the angle based on the number of steps between vertices.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For a regular n-gon, the central angle between adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} $. The angle at a vertex formed by two other vertices is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.\n3. **Optimal Angle Selection**: We need to find the number of steps `k` such that the angle formed is closest to `a`. This involves checking different values of `k` and calculating the corresponding angle.\n4. **Efficient Search**: Since the number of vertices is large (up to 100,000), we need an efficient method to check possible values of `k` and find the closest angle to `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import math\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Calculate the central angle between two adjacent vertices\n    central_angle = 360.0 / n\n    \n    # The angle at v2 is half of the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2\n    # For a regular polygon, the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is (k) * central_angle\n    # where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 (excluding v2)\n    # So the angle is (k * central_angle) / 2\n    # We need to find k such that this angle is as close as possible to a\n    \n    # However, since the polygon is convex and regular, for any three vertices, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 must be less than 180 degrees.\n    # Therefore, the maximum possible k is floor((n-2)/2)\n    # Because the arc between v1 and v3 cannot be more than half the circle (180 degrees)\n    \n    # The actual angle is (k * central_angle) / 2\n    # We need to find the k that makes this as close as possible to a\n    \n    # Let's compute the optimal k\n    # The angle we want is a_deg = a\n    # The angle for k steps is angle_k = (k * central_angle) / 2\n    # So we need to find k such that |angle_k - a| is minimized\n    \n    # The possible k ranges from 1 to (n-2)//2\n    # Because when k is (n-2)//2, the arc is (n-2)/2 * central_angle, which is (n-2)/2 * 360/n = 180*(n-2)/n < 180\n    \n    # Find the k that minimizes |angle_k - a|\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    \n    # Compute the maximum possible k\n    max_k = (n - 2) // 2\n    \n    # Check all possible k from 1 to max_k\n    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):\n        angle_k = (k * central_angle) / 2.0\n        diff = abs(angle_k - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # If there are multiple k with same diff, choose the smallest one?\n            # Since the problem allows any, just keep the first found\n            pass\n    \n    # Now, best_k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 (not containing v2)\n    # To form the angle, we need to pick v2 as a vertex, then v1 and v3 such that they are best_k steps apart\n    # Let's pick v2 as 1, then v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + best_k + 1 ?\n    # Wait, need to think about how to place the vertices\n    \n    # For example, in a regular n-gon, if we fix v2 as vertex 1, then v1 could be vertex 2, and v3 would be vertex (2 + best_k + 1) ?\n    # Or perhaps, considering that between v1 and v3 there are best_k steps, and v2 is in between them?\n    \n    # Let's take v2 as vertex 1. Then, v1 can be vertex 2, and v3 is vertex 2 + best_k + 1?\n    # Wait, no. Let me think again.\n    \n    # For the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) to be best_k * central_angle, we need that the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is best_k.\n    # So if we choose v2 as vertex 1, then v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex 2 + best_k + 1? Not sure.\n    \n    # Another approach: For a given best_k, the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) has best_k steps.\n    # So, the positions of v1 and v3 should be such that they are best_k steps apart, with v2 lying on the arc between them (the other arc).\n    \n    # For example, if best_k is 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step. So, v1 and v3 are adjacent, and v2 is opposite.\n    \n    # To construct such a triplet, let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k + 1?\n    # Wait, for example, in a square (n=4), best_k for a=45 is 1. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 step (central_angle is 90). So the angle is (90)/2 = 45, which is correct.\n    # So for n=4, best_k=1, then v1 is 2, v2 is 1, and v3 is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4? Wait, 2 and 4 are two steps apart (since n=4). But the arc between them not containing v2 (1) would be 2 steps? That's 2*90=180 degrees. Then angle is 90 degrees. Which is not 45.\n    # Hmm, something's wrong here.\n    \n    # Let me re-express the angle formula. The angle at v2 is half of the arc between v1 and v3 that does NOT contain v2. So, the arc between v1 and v3 that does NOT contain v2 has length k * central_angle, where k is the number of steps between them along that arc. Then, the angle is (k * central_angle) / 2.\n    \n    # So, for example, in a square (n=4), if v2 is vertex 1, and v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that does NOT contain v2 is the arc going from 2 to 4 via 3, which is 2 steps. So the angle is (2 * 90)/2 = 90 degrees. Which is the case for the sample input 4 68, where the best angle is 90.\n    \n    # But for the case where a=45, we need an arc of 1 step between v1 and v3 (so that the angle is 45). How to get that? For example, if v2 is vertex 2, and v1 is vertex 1, and v3 is vertex 3. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is the arc from 1 to 3 through 4, which is 2 steps (since n=4). So angle is (2 * 90)/2 = 90 again. Not helpful.\n    \n    # Alternatively, if v2 is vertex 1, v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex 3. Then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is from 2 to 3, which is 1 step. The angle is (1 * 90)/2 = 45 degrees. Exactly what we need!\n    \n    # So, in this case, the triplet is v1=2, v2=1, v3=3. Which gives angle 45 degrees. Which matches the second sample input.\n    \n    # So, the way to choose v1 and v3 is to have them be adjacent to each other and separated by best_k steps. Wait, no. For best_k=1, the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is 1 step. So, v1 and v3 are adjacent, and v2 is on the other side of the arc.\n    \n    # So, to create such a configuration, we can choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k. Wait, but in the example above, best_k=1, so v3 would be 2+1=3. Which is exactly what we needed.\n    \n    # So the general approach is: choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k. But we need to ensure that this doesn't exceed n. Wait, in the case of n=4, best_k=1, 2+1=3 <=4. So yes.\n    \n    # But wait, what if best_k is larger? For example, if n=5 and best_k=2. Then v3 would be 2 + 2 = 4. Which is valid.\n    \n    # So the triplet is (v1, v2, v3) = (2, 1, 2 + best_k). But need to check if 2 + best_k exceeds n. If it does, then we need to wrap around, but since best_k is chosen such that the arc is less than 180 degrees, this shouldn't happen.\n    \n    # So, for the general case, the triplet is (2, 1, 2 + best_k). However, this may not work for all cases. For example, if best_k is 1 and n=3, then 2+1=3, which is valid. The triplet is (2, 1, 3), which is correct for the first sample input.\n    \n    # Therefore, the code can be written as follows:\n    \n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n    \n    # But wait, if v3 exceeds n, we need to wrap around. However, since best_k is at most (n-2)//2, and 2 + best_k <= 2 + (n-2)//2. Let's see for n=3, (n-2)//2 = 0.5 floored to 0. So best_k is 0? No, because k starts from 1. Wait, earlier code may have a mistake here.\n    \n    # Let me recheck the calculation of max_k. For n=3, the maximum k is (3-2)//2 = 0. So the loop runs from 1 to 0, which is not executed. That's a problem.\n    \n    # So, the calculation of max_k must be adjusted. For n=3, the possible k is 1. Because the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step (since n=3, the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 step, and the angle is (1 * 120)/2 = 60 degrees).\n    \n    # So the correct max_k is floor((n-2)/2). Wait, for n=3, (n-2) is 1, divided by 2 is 0.5, floor is 0. But the valid k is 1. So this suggests that the previous approach to calculate max_k is incorrect.\n    \n    # Let me re-express the possible values of k. The arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 must be less than 180 degrees. The arc length is k * central_angle. So k * central_angle < 180.\n    \n    # Since central_angle = 360/n, we have k < 180 * n / 360 = n/2. So k can be up to floor((n-1)/2 - 1) ? Or perhaps k can be up to floor((n-2)/2). Let me think again.\n    \n    # For example, n=4: 360/4 = 90. The arc length must be less than 180. So k * 90 < 180 => k < 2. So k can be 1. So max_k is 1.\n    \n    # For n=5: 72 degrees per step. 72*k < 180 => k < 2.5 => k can be 1 or 2. So max_k is 2.\n    \n    # For n=3: 120 degrees per step. 120*k < 180 => k < 1.5 => k=1. So max_k is 1.\n    \n    # So the maximum k is floor((n-1)/2 - 1)? No, perhaps the maximum k is floor((n-2)/2). For n=3, (n-2)/2 = 0.5 → floor is 0. But k=1 is allowed. So that's not correct.\n    \n    # The correct max_k is floor((n-2)/2) + 1? Or perhaps the maximum k is floor((n-2)/2). Wait, for n=3, (n-2) is 1. floor(1/2) is 0. But k can be 1. So this suggests that the initial approach to compute max_k is incorrect.\n    \n    # Let's re-calculate the maximum k. The arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) must be less than 180 degrees. The number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is k. So k * (360/n) < 180 → k < n/2. So k can be at most floor((n-1)/2). For example, for n=3, floor((3-1)/2) = 1. For n=4, floor((4-1)/2) = 1. For n=5, floor((5-1)/2) = 2. Which aligns with our previous examples.\n    \n    # So the correct max_k is floor((n-1)/2). Thus, the code for max_k should be:\n    max_k = (n - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Now, let's re-calculate the best_k.\n    \n    # Reinitializing the variables\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    \n    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):\n        angle_k = (k * central_angle) / 2.0\n        diff = abs(angle_k - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k? Or any?\n            # Since the problem allows any, just keep the first found\n            pass\n    \n    # Now, with best_k determined, construct the triplet.\n    # As discussed, choosing v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k.\n    # But need to ensure that v3 <= n.\n    # For example, if n=3 and best_k=1, 2 + 1 = 3 ≤ 3.\n    # For n=4 and best_k=1, 2 + 1 = 3 ≤ 4.\n    # So yes.\n    \n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n    \n    # However, if best_k is larger than n-2, then 2 + best_k might exceed n.

Not sure.\n    \n    # Another approach: For a given best_k, the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) has best_k steps.\n    # So, the positions of v1 and v3 should be such that they are best_k steps apart, with v2 lying on the arc between them (the other arc).\n    \n    # For example, if best_k is 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step. So, v1 and v3 are adjacent, and v2 is opposite.\n    \n    # To construct such a triplet, let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k + 1?\n    # Wait, for example, in a square (n=4), best_k for a=45 is 1. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 step (central_angle is 90). So the angle is (90)/2 = 45, which is correct.\n    # So for n=4, best_k=1, then v1 is 2, v2 is 1, and v3 is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4? Wait, 2 and 4 are two steps apart (since n=4). But the arc between them not containing v2 (1) would be 2 steps? That's 2*90=180 degrees. Then angle is 90 degrees. Which is not 45.\n    # Hmm, something's wrong here.\n    \n    # Let me re-express the angle formula. The angle at v2 is half of the arc between v1 and v3 that does NOT contain v2. So, the arc between v1 and v3 that does NOT contain v2 has length k * central_angle, where k is the number of steps between them along that arc. Then, the angle is (k * central_angle) / 2.\n    \n    # So, for example, in a square (n=4), if v2 is vertex 1, and v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that does NOT contain v2 is the arc going from 2 to 4 via 3, which is 2 steps. So the angle is (2 * 90)/2 = 90 degrees. Which is the case for the sample input 4 68, where the best angle is 90.\n    \n    # But for the case where a=45, we need an arc of 1 step between v1 and v3 (so that the angle is 45). How to get that? For example, if v2 is vertex 2, and v1 is vertex 1, and v3 is vertex 3. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is the arc from 1 to 3 through 4, which is 2 steps (since n=4). So angle is (2 * 90)/2 = 90 again. Not helpful.\n    \n    # Alternatively, if v2 is vertex 1, v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex 3. Then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is from 2 to 3, which is 1 step. The angle is (1 * 90)/2 = 45 degrees. Exactly what we need!\n    \n    # So, in this case, the triplet is v1=2, v2=1, v3=3. Which gives angle 45 degrees. Which matches the second sample input.\n    \n    # So, the way to choose v1 and v3 is to have them be adjacent to each other and separated by best_k steps. Wait, no. For best_k=1, the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is 1 step. So, v1 and v3 are adjacent, and v2 is on the other side of the arc.\n    \n    # So, to create such a configuration, we can choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k. Wait, but in the example above, best_k=1, so v3 would be 2+1=3. Which is exactly what we needed.\n    \n    # So the general approach is: choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k. But we need to ensure that this doesn't exceed n. Wait, in the case of n=4, best_k=1, 2+1=3 <=4. So yes.\n    \n    # But wait, what if best_k is larger? For example, if n=5 and best_k=2. Then v3 would be 2 + 2 = 4. Which is valid.\n    \n    # So the triplet is (v1, v2, v3) = (2, 1, 2 + best_k). But need to check if 2 + best_k exceeds n. If it does, then we need to wrap around, but since best_k is chosen such that the arc is less than 180 degrees, this shouldn't happen.\n    \n    # So, for the general case, the triplet is (2, 1, 2 + best_k). However, this may not work for all cases. For example, if best_k is 1 and n=3, then 2+1=3, which is valid. The triplet is (2, 1, 3), which is correct for the first sample input.\n    \n    # Therefore, the code can be written as follows:\n    \n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n    \n    # But wait, if v3 exceeds n, we need to wrap around. However, since best_k is at most (n-2)//2, and 2 + best_k <= 2 + (n-2)//2. Let's see for n=3, (n-2)//2 = 0.5 floored to 0. So best_k is 0? No, because k starts from 1. Wait, earlier code may have a mistake here.\n    \n    # Let me recheck the calculation of max_k. For n=3, the maximum k is (3-2)//2 = 0. So the loop runs from 1 to 0, which is not executed. That's a problem.\n    \n    # So, the calculation of max_k must be adjusted. For n=3, the possible k is 1. Because the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step (since n=3, the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 step, and the angle is (1 * 120)/2 = 60 degrees).\n    \n    # So the correct max_k is floor((n-2)/2). Wait, for n=3, (n-2) is 1, divided by 2 is 0.5, floor is 0. But the valid k is 1. So this suggests that the previous approach to calculate max_k is incorrect.\n    \n    # Let me re-express the possible values of k. The arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 must be less than 180 degrees. The arc length is k * central_angle. So k * central_angle < 180.\n    \n    # Since central_angle = 360/n, we have k < 180 * n / 360 = n/2. So k can be up to floor((n-1)/2 - 1) ? Or perhaps k can be up to floor((n-2)/2). Let me think again.\n    \n    # For example, n=4: 360/4 = 90. The arc length must be less than 180. So k * 90 < 180 => k < 2. So k can be 1. So max_k is 1.\n    \n    # For n=5: 72 degrees per step. 72*k < 180 => k < 2.5 => k can be 1 or 2. So max_k is 2.\n    \n    # For n=3: 120 degrees per step. 120*k < 180 => k < 1.5 => k=1. So max_k is 1.\n    \n    # So the maximum k is floor((n-1)/2 - 1)? No, perhaps the maximum k is floor((n-2)/2). For n=3, (n-2)/2 = 0.5 → floor is 0. But k=1 is allowed. So that's not correct.\n    \n    # The correct max_k is floor((n-2)/2) + 1? Or perhaps the maximum k is floor((n-2)/2). Wait, for n=3, (n-2) is 1. floor(1/2) is 0. But k can be 1. So this suggests that the initial approach to compute max_k is incorrect.\n    \n    # Let's re-calculate the maximum k. The arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) must be less than 180 degrees. The number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is k. So k * (360/n) < 180 → k < n/2. So k can be at most floor((n-1)/2). For example, for n=3, floor((3-1)/2) = 1. For n=4, floor((4-1)/2) = 1. For n=5, floor((5-1)/2) = 2. Which aligns with our previous examples.\n    \n    # So the correct max_k is floor((n-1)/2). Thus, the code for max_k should be:\n    max_k = (n - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Now, let's re-calculate the best_k.\n    \n    # Reinitializing the variables\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    \n    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):\n        angle_k = (k * central_angle) / 2.0\n        diff = abs(angle_k - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k? Or any?\n            # Since the problem allows any, just keep the first found\n            pass\n    \n    # Now, with best_k determined, construct the triplet.\n    # As discussed, choosing v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k.\n    # But need to ensure that v3 <= n.\n    # For example, if n=3 and best_k=1, 2 + 1 = 3 ≤ 3.\n    # For n=4 and best_k=1, 2 + 1 = 3 ≤ 4.\n    # So yes.\n    \n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n    \n    # However, if best_k is larger than n-2, then 2 + best_k might exceed n. But since k is up to floor((n-1)/2), for n ≥3, 2 + floor((n-1)/2) ≤ 2 + (n-1)/2. For example, if n=5, floor((5-1)/2) = 2, 2+2=4 ≤5. So it's safe.\n    \n    print(v1, v2, v3)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
