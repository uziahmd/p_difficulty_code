And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all these sums. The output needs to be precise with at least six decimal digits.\n\nSo the input is n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output is the average of all the sums of consecutive k-day periods.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to compute the sum for each window of size k and then take the average. But since n can be up to 2e5, a naive approach that checks each window by adding all k elements each time would be O(n*k), which would be too slow for large n and k. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 1e5, then n-k+1 is about 1e5, and each sum would take 1e5 operations, leading to 1e10 operations. That's definitely not going to work.\n\nSo I need an efficient way to compute the sum of all consecutive k-day periods. The sliding window technique comes to mind here. Let me recall how that works.\n\nThe idea is to compute the sum of the first window (the first k elements), then for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element that's entering. This way, each sum is computed in O(1) time after the initial sum, leading to an overall O(n) time complexity.\n\nYes, that's the way to go. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this sum to a total sum variable.\n3. Then, for each next window (from position 1 to n - k), subtract the element that's no longer in the window (a[i-1]) and add the new element (a[i + k - 1]). Add this new sum to the total.\n4. Once all windows are processed, divide the total by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the initial sum? Let's think about the example given:\n\nIn the first sample input: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]. The initial sum is 3+4=7. Then the next window is 4+7=11. The total sum is 7+11=18. The number of windows is 3-2+1=2. So average is 18/2=9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that's correct. Now, the steps are:\n\nCalculate the initial window sum. Then iterate from i=1 to (n -k) times, updating the sum each time.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then read the array. Then compute the initial sum. Then iterate through the array, updating the sum and adding to the total.\n\nBut how to handle the initial sum? Let's code that.\n\nFor example, in Python, the initial sum can be calculated with sum(a[0:k]). Then, for each i in 1 to (n -k) steps, the new sum is previous_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]. Wait, because the window starts at i, so the previous window was starting at i-1. So when moving to the next window, we remove the element at position i-1 and add the element at position i + k - 1 (since the window starts at i, ends at i + k -1).\n\nWait, let me think. For the first window, it's from index 0 to k-1. The next window is from index 1 to k. So the new element is at index k, and the element leaving is index 0. So for the i-th window (starting at i), the sum is previous_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1].\n\nYes. So the loop would run from i=1 to (n -k) times. Wait, the number of windows is (n -k +1). So the initial sum is for the first window. Then, there are (n -k) more windows. So the loop should run (n -k) times, each time adding the new sum.\n\nSo the total number of windows is (n -k +1). So the code would be:\n\ntotal = 0\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal += current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n -k +1):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\nThen, average = total / (n -k +1)\n\nBut in Python, the indices are zero-based. Let me check for the first example:\n\nn=3, k=2. So the first window is indexes 0 and 1. Then the next window is indexes 1 and 2. So for i=1, the new sum is current_sum (7) - a[0] (3) + a[1+2-1] = a[2] (7). So 7-3+7= 11. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the loop runs for i from 1 to (n -k) times. Wait, the range for the loop is from 1 to (n -k) +1? Because in Python, range is exclusive on the upper bound.\n\nWait, the number of iterations after the first window is (n -k) times. Because the first window is 1, then (n -k) more. So for example, when n=3, k=2, n -k = 1. So the loop runs once.\n\nSo the loop should run from i=1 to (n -k) times. So in code:\n\nfor i in range(1, (n -k) +1):\n\nBut in Python, range is exclusive on the upper bound. So the code would be:\n\nfor i in range(1, (n -k) +1):\n\nBut (n -k) +1 is (n -k +1). So the range is from 1 to (n -k +1) exclusive. Which would give exactly (n -k) iterations. Because the first iteration is i=1, then up to i = (n -k) ?\n\nYes. For example, if n -k is 1, then the range is from 1 to 2, which is one iteration (i=1).\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the sum of all the windows, then divide by the number of windows.\n\nNow, the question is about handling large numbers. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily big, so no problem. However, when we compute the average, we need to make sure that we perform floating point division correctly.\n\nNow, the output requires that the answer is printed with enough decimal digits. The examples show that even when the result is an integer, like 9, it's printed with 10 decimal digits. So the code must print the result with at least 6 decimal digits, but perhaps more.\n\nSo, the code should calculate the average as a float, and then format it with 10 decimal digits, for example.\n\nNow, the edge cases:\n\nCase 1: k = n. Then there is only one window, which is the entire array. So the average is the sum of all elements divided by 1. So the code should handle that.\n\nCase 2: k =1. Then each window is a single element, and the average is the average of all elements. So the code would compute the sum of all elements (since each window is one element, and there are n windows) and divide by n. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, k=1. Then the average is the only element.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the problem is to read multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the input examples:\n\nWait, the sample input shows multiple test cases. For example, the first input line is ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'].\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, there are multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different test cases. So perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases as part of the input, but the problem statement might have a mistake. Or perhaps the sample input is in a format where each test case is given in a separate line. But according to the problem statement, the input is for a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the Input section, it says:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ... \n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. But perhaps that's a formatting error. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nLooking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nThis suggests that the input consists of multiple test cases, each being a separate input. However, the problem's original description may have been different. But according to the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nBut the original problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, which might be a mistake. For example, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the actual input is one test case. But perhaps the user intended that the code should process multiple test cases, but the problem statement doesn't mention that.\n\nWait, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k. So the code should process a single test case. Therefore, the sample input given in the problem is possibly incorrect. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the problem is that the user has given multiple test cases in the sample input, but the actual problem expects that the code reads multiple test cases.\n\nWait, but the problem's sample input is written as a list of strings. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting mistake. Because in programming competition problems, usually, each test case is given as a separate input. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines for a single test case.\n\nBut the user's note says that the third example has n=8, k=2, and the output is 28964.2857... So perhaps the sample input is actually three separate test cases, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So, the code should read one test case. But the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. However, given that the sample input includes multiple test cases, perhaps the actual problem requires that the code processes multiple test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is presenting the sample input as a list of inputs, but the actual problem expects that the code reads from stdin, which would have multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description may not mention that. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the original problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThen another input:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nThen another input:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nBut the sample output is three lines. So perhaps the actual problem is that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n and k. So perhaps the problem is that the code should read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut the original problem's input description does not mention that. However, the sample input and output suggest that there are multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code handles multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to know? Well, the original problem's sample input shows that the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line with n and k, the second line with the array.\n\nBut the problem's original description says that the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the code must read multiple test cases. But the problem's original statement is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the third example's output is 28964.2857142857. Let's check that.\n\nIn the third example, n=8, k=2. The array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. The number of weeks is 8-2+1=7. The sum of each week is:\n\nWeek 1: 1+2 =3\n\nWeek 2: 2+4=6\n\nWeek3:4+100000=100004\n\nWeek4:100000 + 123 = 100123\n\nWeek5:123 +456 =579\n\nWeek6:456 +789=1245\n\nWeek7:789 +1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3 +6 +100004 +100123 +579 +1245 +790 = ?\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\nAdd 100004 → 100013\n\nAdd 100123 → 200136\n\nAdd 579 → 200715\n\nAdd 1245 → 201,960?\n\nWait 200715 + 1245 = 201,960?\n\nYes. Then add 790 → 202,750.\n\nSo total sum is 202750. Divide by 7 → 202750 /7 = ?\n\nLet me compute 202750 /7.\n\nWell, 7*28964 = 202748. Then 202750 - 202748 = 2. So 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.285714..., which matches the sample output. So the sample output is correct.\n\nBut the problem is that the code must process multiple test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line with n and k, the second line with the array.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So how to reconcile this?\n\nWell, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads from standard input, which may contain multiple test cases. However, the problem's original statement is ambiguous. But given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code must read all test cases from the input. How to do that in Python?\n\nIn Python, the standard way to read multiple test cases is to read all lines from stdin, split them into individual test cases. But how to parse them?\n\nBut the problem's input format for each test case is:\n\nEach test case is two lines: first line has n and k, second line has n integers.\n\nSo the code should read lines until EOF, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? For example, the input could be read as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, process the lines in pairs. For example, for i in 0, 2, 4, etc., take lines[i] as the n and k line, lines[i+1] as the array line.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe second test case is:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nThird test case is:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo the code must process each pair of lines.\n\nThus, the code will read all lines, and process them in pairs. So the code should read all lines, then for each pair of lines, process them as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the number of lines is odd? Probably, the problem ensures that the input is correct, with even number of lines.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n    process lines[i] and lines[i+1]\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '3 2\\n3 4 7' — but that's probably a mistake in the way the sample input is presented. Because in reality, the input is two lines per test case. So the code should read two lines per test case.\n\nSo, assuming that the code is to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut the problem's original description may not mention that. However, given the sample input and output, that's the only way to explain it. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut then why the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k? Well, perhaps the problem's original statement is incorrect, and the actual problem requires processing multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, the code structure is as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nParse n and k from the first line.\n\nParse the array from the second line.\n\nCompute the average as described.\n\nPrint the result with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, the code must be written accordingly.\n\nNow, the code for each test case:\n\nImplement the sliding window approach.\n\nBut what about when k equals n? Then the number of windows is 1. So the sum is sum(a), divided by 1.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nIn Python, for each test case:\n\nn, k = map(int, first_line.split())\n\na = list(map(int, second_line.split()))\n\nThen compute the sum of all consecutive k-day periods.\n\nBut for large n (up to 2e5), and multiple test cases, the code must be efficient. However, the sliding window approach is O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code steps for each test case:\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\nCompute the total sum of all windows.\n\nThen divide by the number of windows (n -k +1).\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the initial sum, if k is 0? No, the constraints say 1 ≤ k ≤ n. So k is at least 1.\n\nSo, code:\n\nfor each test case:\n\nn, k = ... \n\na = list of integers.\n\nif n ==0: impossible, since k >=1 and n >=k.\n\nnumber_of_windows = n -k +1\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, number_of_windows):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / number_of_windows\n\nprint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, for the loop, the range is from 1 to number_of_windows. Because the initial sum is for the first window, then we have (number_of_windows -1) more windows. So the loop runs (number_of_windows -1) times. So the code for the loop is:\n\nfor i in range(1, number_of_windows):\n\n    ...\n\nBut in Python, range is exclusive on the upper bound. So, for example, if number_of_windows is 2, then range(1, 2) is one iteration (i=1). Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the first sample input.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\na = [3,4,7]\n\nnumber_of_windows = 3-2 +1 = 2.\n\ncurrent_sum = 3+4=7. total =7.\n\nloop runs for i=1 (range(1, 2)):\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] (3) + a[1+2-1] = a[2] (7). 7-3+7=11. total becomes 7+11=18.\n\naverage is 18/2=9.0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, k=1. a=[10]. number_of_windows is 1. total is 10. average is 10.0.\n\nThird test case: n=8, k=2. The array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]. The number of windows is 7. The code computes the sum of each window and adds them all.\n\nNow, for the code, the initial sum is 1+2=3. Then, for i from 1 to 6 (since number_of_windows is 7, the loop runs from 1 to 7-1=6, so 6 iterations).\n\nLet me see:\n\ni=1: subtract a[0] (1) and add a[1+2-1] = a[2] (4). new sum is 3-1+4=6. total becomes 3+6=9.\n\ni=2: subtract a[1] (2), add a[3] (100000). new sum is 6-2 + 100000 = 100004. total is 9+100004= 100013.\n\ni=3: subtract a[2] (4), add a[4] (123). sum is 100004 -4 +123 = 100123. total becomes 100013 + 100123 = 200136.\n\ni=4: subtract a[3] (100000), add a[5] (456). sum is 100123 -100000 +456 = 579. total is 200136 +579 = 200715.\n\ni=5: subtract a[4] (123), add a[6] (789). sum is 579 -123 +789 = 1245. total is 200715 + 1245 = 201960.\n\ni=6: subtract a[5] (456), add a[7] (1). sum is 1245 -456 +1 = 790. total is 201960 +790 = 202750.\n\nThen average is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle this.\n\nNow, the problem is to code this in Python, handling multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in the sample input, each test case is two lines. So the code must read all lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nNow, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n        # process lines[i] and lines[i+1]\n\n        n, k = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n        # process the test case\n\n        number_of_windows = n -k +1\n\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n        total = current_sum\n\n        for j in range(1, number_of_windows):\n\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[j-1] + a[j + k -1]\n\n            total += current_sum\n\n        average = total / number_of_windows\n\n        # print with 10 decimal digits\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, what if the number_of_windows is zero? No, since k <=n, n -k +1 >=1.\n\nBut for example, when n=1 and k=1, number_of_windows is 1, and the loop runs from 1 to 1, which is not executed. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in Python, when you have range(1, 1), it's empty. So the loop is not executed. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code for the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nThe code will process three test cases.\n\nFirst test case: outputs 9.0000000000.\n\nSecond test case: n=1, k=1. sum is 10. average is 10.0. Output is 10.0000000000.\n\nThird test case: outputs 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut how to format the output correctly?\n\nThe code uses \"{0:.10f}\".format(average). However, when the average is an integer, like 9.0, it will be printed as 9.0000000000, which is correct. However, in Python, when using .10f, it rounds the number to ten decimal places. But the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So the code's approach is sufficient.\n\nBut let's check for the third sample. The average is 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714..., which when printed with 10 decimal digits would be 28964.2857142857. But the sample output is '28964.2857142857'.\n\nBut the code uses the format string with 10 decimal digits. So that's correct.\n\nBut in Python, when using the .10f format, it rounds the number. However, the problem allows for any answer with absolute or relative error up to 1e-6. So the code's approach is correct.\n\nNow, what about when the average is something like 0.12345678901234? Printing with 10 decimals would give 0.1234567890, which is accurate enough.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer must have at least six digits after the decimal point. So the code's approach of printing ten digits is sufficient.\n\nNow, the code is ready. However, there's a possible problem with the sum of the first k elements. For large k and large n, sum(a[:k]) could take O(k) time. But for n up to 2e5, and per test case, this is O(n) time. So the overall time is acceptable.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, each with O(n) time, it's acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for very large n and k, sum(a[:k]) may be slow. However, given the constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps, for the first window, we can compute the sum with a loop. But in practice, the built-in sum function is optimized and should be fast enough.\n\nNow, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFor the first test case, the code produces 9.0000000000.\n\nSample Output is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, k=1. Output is 10.0000000000.\n\nThird test case: 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714... which is printed as 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut the sample output is '28964.2857142857' which matches.\n\nBut in Python, when you use the format string, how does it handle the decimal digits?\n\nLet me check:\n\nFor example, 202750 /7 is 28964.285714285714...\n\nWhen printed with .10f, it would be rounded to 10 decimal digits. Let's calculate:\n\nThe exact value is 28964.285714285714...\n\nThe first 10 decimals are 2857142857. So the value is 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut in Python, when you print with .10f, it rounds to the 10th decimal. So let's see:\n\n>>> x = 202750 /7\n\n>>> x\n\n28964.285714285714\n\n>>> print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(x))\n\n28964.2857142857\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code must be written. Also, note that the code must read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nNow, considering that in some cases, the input may have multiple test cases, and the code processes them all.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day periods (weeks) from a given list of daily sleep times. The solution must efficiently handle large input sizes and provide results with high precision.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: To efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive k-day period, we use the sliding window technique. This allows us to compute each window sum in constant time after the initial sum calculation.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first k elements to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Iterate Through Windows**: For each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n4. **Average Calculation**: Sum all the window sums and divide by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        n_k_line = lines[i]\n        a_line = lines[i+1]\n        n, k = map(int, n_k_line.split())\n        a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n        number_of_windows = n - k + 1\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total = current_sum\n        for j in range(1, number_of_windows):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[j-1] + a[j + k - 1]\n            total += current_sum\n        average = total / number_of_windows\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing each test case individually.\n2. **Sliding Window Initialization**: The sum of the first k elements is computed once to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This adjustment ensures each window sum is computed in constant time.\n4. **Precision Handling**: The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirements, ensuring the absolute or relative error does not exceed 1e-6.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large inputs and ensures accurate results with optimal performance using the sliding window technique.",
