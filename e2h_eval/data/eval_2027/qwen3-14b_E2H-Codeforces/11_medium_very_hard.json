A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine how many toasts each friend can make, given certain resources. All friends must make the same number of toasts. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the inputs. The input consists of several integers: n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend). \n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of toasts (let's call it t) such that each friend can make t toasts. So for all friends together, the total required resources must not exceed what's available.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\n1. Drink: Each toast requires nl ml per friend. For n friends, each toast requires n * nl ml. The total available drink is k * l ml. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Wait, because for each toast, all friends are having one. So for t toasts, total drink needed is t * n * nl. So the total available is k*l. So t can't exceed (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\n2. Lime slices: Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices are needed. The total available slices are c * d. So maximum t based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\n3. Salt: Each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, total is n * np grams. The available salt is p grams. So maximum t based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nOnce we calculate these three values, the answer is the minimum of these three. Because all three constraints must be satisfied. So the maximum possible t is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nWait, but let me check the example given. Let's take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends. \n\nDrink: 4 *5 =20 ml. Each toast requires 3 *3 =9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl. \n\nIn the first sample, for drink: total available is 4*5=20. For each toast, 3 friends *3ml each = 9ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note. Then the limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (since 3 friends each have one). So 80 /3 is 26.666, floor 26. But in the note, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, wait, that seems conflicting. Oh wait, no. Wait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait how?\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait the note says that in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nOriginal note says: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but why? Because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices are needed. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the maximum t for limes is (c*d) // n. \n\nIn the first sample, c=10, d=8. So 10*8=80 slices. n=3. So 80//3 is 26. So why does the note say that limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nWait there's a contradiction here. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices are required. Therefore, total slices required for t toasts is t * n. So the maximum t based on limes is (c*d) // (n). \n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check the numbers. In the first sample, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, (c*d) is 10*8=80 slices. So for t toasts, you need n * t slices. So 3 * t ≤ 80 → t ≤ 26.666. So the maximum is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait perhaps I got the problem statement wrong. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So per toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the maximum t is (c*d) // (n). \n\nBut in the note, the example says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. How does that happen? Let me check the numbers again. For the first sample input, the numbers are:\n\nn=3, c=10, d=8. So total slices is 10 * 8 = 80. If each toast requires one slice per friend, then for one toast, 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That implies that perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice per person, but maybe per toast, each friend needs one slice. But maybe per toast, each friend needs one slice. So for each toast, n slices. But in the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would require that 80 * n slices. But that's impossible. \n\nWait the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". So perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend, but that the calculation is (c*d) divided by 1, not by n. That would be a misunderstanding. But why?\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the maximum number of toasts is (c * d) // (n). \n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So in the first sample, that would imply that 80 is (c*d) divided by something. For the first sample, c*d is 80. So if the denominator is 1, then 80. But why?\n\nWait maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per person. But perhaps the problem is that for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. So per toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. \n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would require that n * t ≤ c*d. So t ≤ (c*d)/n. \n\nIn the first sample, c*d is 80, n is 3. So 80/3 is 26.666. So the maximum t is 26. However, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that the problem is considering that each toast requires one slice, regardless of the number of friends. That would be a different scenario. \n\nWait perhaps I misread the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So if there are t toasts, each friend will have t slices (one per toast). So for each toast, each friend has one slice. So for each toast, n slices are needed. So for t toasts, n * t slices. \n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be (c*d) = 80 slices. So for 80 toasts, n*t = 3*80 = 240 slices. But 80 slices is way less than 240. So that's impossible. So there's a contradiction here. Which means that I must have misunderstood the problem statement. \n\nWait looking back at the note's explanation:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts, but then divides by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2. So how is that possible? \n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the note is considering that each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices. So the total number of toasts possible with limes is (c*d) // n. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would mean that (c*d) // n = 80. But in the first sample, c*d is 80, n is 3. 80//3 is 26. So that doesn't match. \n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So how is that possible? There's a contradiction here. Which means I must have misread the problem statement. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the maximum t is (c*d) // (n). \n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that (c*d) is 80 * n. But in the first sample, c*d is 10 * 8 = 80. So that would be 80 = 80 * n → n=1. But in the first sample, n=3. So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong? No, that's unlikely. Let me think again. \n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How? Let me see. Maybe the problem is that each toast requires one slice per friend, but the note is calculating (c*d) as the number of toasts, but that's not considering the number of friends. \n\nBut that would be incorrect. So maybe the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice per person. But for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices. So the total number of toasts is (c*d) divided by n. \n\nBut according to the note, in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be (c*d) / 1. So perhaps the problem is that the note is considering that each toast requires one slice per person, but that the number of toasts is (c*d) divided by 1, not by n. Which would be a mistake. \n\nBut that would contradict the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend, but the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the note is not considering the division by n. Let me check the note's calculation again. \n\nThe note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 20ml of drink. It is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts. \n\nWait, why 20/3? Because each toast requires 3 friends × 3ml per friend. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n × nl ml. So for t toasts, it's t × n × nl. \n\nIn the first sample, nl is 3. So for each toast, 3 × 3 = 9 ml. The total available is 20. So 20 / 9 is 2.222. So floor is 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait that's not matching. \n\nWait this is a problem. According to the note, the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But according to my calculation, it's 20/(n × nl) = 20/(3×3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.222. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe I got the problem statement wrong. Let me recheck the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So per toast, each friend needs nl. So for one toast, each friend has nl, so total for all friends is n × nl. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / (nl) = 20 / 3 = 6.666. So that would suggest that per toast, the total drink is nl, not n × nl. \n\nSo that's a contradiction. \n\nWait this indicates that I have misread the problem statement. Let me recheck the problem statement again. \n\nProblem statement: \n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each friend has one portion of nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / 3 = 6.666. So that suggests that for each toast, the total drink is nl. \n\nSo that's a contradiction. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking at the note's explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, the drink is 4 * 5 = 20. The note says that it's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. \n\nSo that suggests that the total drink per toast is 3 ml. Which would be nl. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, nl is the amount per friend. So if there are n friends, then for one toast, each of them has nl, so total per toast is n × nl. \n\nBut according to the note, the total per toast is nl. Which would imply that the problem statement is different. \n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement once more. \n\nProblem statement says: \n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo, for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, all friends together need n * nl ml. \n\nBut in the note, they have 20 ml, which is enough for 6 toasts. Let's compute that. \n\nIf 20 ml is enough for 6 toasts, then per toast, the total drink is 20 / 6 = 3.333 ml. Which would be n × nl = 3 × 3 = 9 ml. But that's not matching. \n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So 20 divided by 3 equals 6.666, which is floored to 6. \n\nBut 20 / 3 = 6.666. So how does that relate to the drink? \n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the note is considering that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total for all friends is nl. That would be a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me check the original problem statement again. \n\nThe problem says: \n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo, for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. \n\nBut in the note, they have 20 ml. So how many toasts can they make? \n\nIf each toast requires n * nl ml, then 20 / (n * nl) = 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222. So floor is 2. Which is the answer given in the sample. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. So where does this come from? \n\nThis suggests that the note may have a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total for all friends is nl. Which would be a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total per toast is nl. Which would be impossible unless n=1. \n\nThis is very confusing. But the sample input and output must be correct. Let's think about the first sample input and output. \n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. Output is 2. \n\nThe note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the min is 6. So how did they get 6? \n\nSo according to the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How? \n\nLet me think about the drink calculation. The total available is 4 *5 = 20 ml. \n\nIf the drink per toast is 3 ml (nl=3), then 20 /3 is 6.666. So floor is 6. But why is that the case? \n\nThat would imply that per toast, the total drink is nl, not n × nl. Which would mean that the problem statement is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total for all friends is nl. Which would be impossible for multiple friends. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters of drink in total, not per friend. \n\nBut the problem statement says \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink.\" So per friend, per toast, nl. \n\nBut the note's calculation suggests that the drink is divided by nl. \n\nThis is very confusing. Let me look at the sample input and output again. \n\nIn the first sample, the output is 2. The note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. \n\nSo the min is 6. So how is the drink calculation leading to 6? \n\nIf the drink is 20 ml, and the per toast is 3 ml (nl=3), then 20 /3 = 6.666 → 6. So that's the value. \n\nSo this suggests that the drink per toast is nl, not n × nl. \n\nWhich would mean that the problem statement is wrong. Or perhaps the problem statement says that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total per toast is nl. Which is only possible if n=1. \n\nBut this seems contradictory. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each friend needs nl milliliters per toast, but the total for all friends is nl. Which would be impossible. \n\nBut the sample indicates that the drink calculation is (k*l) / nl. \n\nSo for the first sample, 20 /3 = 6.666, which is floored to 6. \n\nThen, the limes are 10 *8 = 80 slices. And the note says that this is enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that each toast requires one slice. So per toast, one slice. Which would mean that for each toast, each friend gets one slice. But that would require n slices per toast. \n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be (c*d) / 1 = 80. So that suggests that each toast requires one slice, not n slices. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nPerhaps the problem statement is written incorrectly. Let me recheck the problem statement once again. \n\nThe problem says: \n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, n slices. \n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts, which would require that the number of slices is 80. So for one toast, 1 slice. \n\nSo this is conflicting. \n\nThis suggests that there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires one slice of lime, not per friend. So for each toast, one slice is needed. \n\nBut that would contradict the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. \n\nBut the note says that for the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would require that (c*d) >= t * n. \n\nSo for the first sample, c*d is 80. t is 80. So 80 >= 80 * n → n=1. But the first sample has n=3. \n\nSo that's impossible. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the note. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is referring to the number of toasts that can be made with the limes, assuming that each toast uses one slice. So for example, if there are 80 slices, then you can make 80 toasts, each requiring one slice. But that would imply that each toast requires one slice, not one per friend. \n\nBut the problem statement says that each friend needs a slice. So for each toast, each friend has one slice. So for n friends, n slices per toast. \n\nSo this is very confusing. \n\nMaybe I should try to derive the correct formula from the sample. \n\nSample input 1: \n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total drink is 20. \n\nnl=3. \n\nThe note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. \n\nSo that suggests that the drink per toast is nl, not n × nl. \n\nSimilarly, for the limes: c=10, d=8 → 80 slices. The note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that suggests that each toast uses 1 slice. \n\nAnd for the salt: p=100, np=1. The note says that it's enough for 100 toasts. Which would imply that each toast uses np grams, not n × np. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formulas for the maximum possible toasts are:\n\n- Drink: total_drink = k*l → max_drink_toasts = total_drink // nl \n\n- Limes: total_slices = c*d → max_lime_toasts = total_slices // 1 \n\n- Salt: total_salt = p → max_salt_toasts = total_salt // np \n\nThen, the answer is min(max_drink_toasts, max_lime_toasts, max_salt_toasts) // n ?\n\nWait, but in the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Which suggests that the min is 6, then divided by 3. \n\nSo that would imply that the maximum number of toasts per friend is (min(...)) // n. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nLet me think: if the total possible toasts (t_total) is the minimum of the three values, then each friend can make t_total // n toasts. \n\nBut why? \n\nFor example, in the first sample, the total possible toasts is 6. But since there are 3 friends, each can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts. \n\nBut why is the total possible toasts 6? \n\nBecause for each toast, the drink is nl, not multiplied by n. \n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters of drink for each friend. But the total per toast is nl * n? Or not? \n\nThis is getting very confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters of drink for each friend, but the total for all friends is nl * n. \n\nBut the sample shows that the drink is 20, and nl is 3. So 20 / (3 * 3) = 2.222, which is 2. \n\nBut the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. \n\nThis is very conflicting. \n\nBut since the sample's note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2, we can infer that the formulas for the three resources are:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k * l) // nl \n\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // 1 \n\nsalt_toasts = p // np \n\nThen, the answer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts) // n \n\nBut why? \n\nBecause the total number of toasts that can be made is the minimum of the three values, and since each toast requires that each friend makes one toast, then the number of toasts per friend is total_toasts // n. \n\nWait, no. Let me think: if the total number of toasts that can be made is t_total, then each friend can make t_total // n toasts? \n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of toasts that can be made is t_total, and since each toast requires that all friends participate, then each friend can make t_total toasts. But that would not require dividing by n. \n\nBut the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. \n\nSo that implies that the total possible toasts is 6, and then divided by 3 friends to get 2 per friend. \n\nBut why would the total possible toasts be 6? \n\nThis suggests that the total possible toasts is the number of toasts that can be made with all resources, and each toast is shared by all friends. So for example, each toast requires that all friends take part in it. So for each toast, each friend has their share of drink, lime slice, and salt. \n\nBut then, the total number of toasts possible is limited by the resources. \n\nLet me think about this. \n\nLet's say that t is the number of toasts that can be made. Each toast requires:\n\n- For drink: each friend consumes nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend consumes t * nl ml. Total for all friends: n * t * nl ml. This must be <= k*l. \n\n- For lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So for t toasts, each friend needs t slices. Total slices needed: n * t. This must be <= c * d. \n\n- For salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. For t toasts, each friend needs t * np grams. Total for all friends: n * t * np grams. Must be <= p. \n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nt <= (k*l) / (n * nl) \n\nt <= (c*d) / (n) \n\nt <= p / (n * np) \n\nThen, the maximum t is the minimum of those three values. \n\nSo in the first sample:\n\nk*l = 20 \n\nn * nl = 3 * 3 = 9 → 20 /9 = 2.222 → floor 2 \n\nc*d / n = 80 /3 = 26.666 → floor 26 \n\np / (n * np) = 100/(3 *1) = 33.333 → floor 33 \n\nSo the minimum is 2. Which is the correct answer. \n\nBut the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. So why is that? \n\nThis suggests that the note is wrong. Or perhaps the note is explaining it incorrectly. \n\nBut the sample output is 2, which aligns with this calculation. \n\nSo perhaps the note is incorrect. Or perhaps the note is using a different approach. \n\nBut the sample output is correct, so I need to proceed with the correct calculations. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the maximum possible toasts t based on each resource:\n\ndrink_t = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_t = (c * d) // n \n\nsalt_t = p // (n * np)\n\nThen, the answer is min(drink_t, lime_t, salt_t)\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\ndrink_t = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2 \n\nlime_t = 80 //3 = 26 \n\nsalt_t = 100//(3*1) = 33 \n\nmin is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nThe note's explanation seems to be incorrect, but the actual calculation leads to the correct answer. \n\nSo the correct approach is to compute these three values and take the minimum. \n\nNow, let's test the other samples. \n\nSecond sample input: ['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nLet's parse the numbers: \n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000 \n\nnl=4. \n\ndrink_t = 1000 / (5 *4) = 1000/20 = 50 \n\nc=1, d=19 → total slices 1*19=19. lime_t = 19 //5 = 3 \n\nsalt: p=90, np=3. salt_t = 90/(5*3) = 90/15 = 6 \n\nso min(50,3,6) is 3 → output is 3. Which matches the sample output. \n\nThird sample input: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink 1,000,000 \n\nnl=50 → drink_t = 1e6 / (10 *50) = 1e6 /500 = 2000 \n\nc=25, d=23 → total slices 25*23=575 → lime_t = 575 //10 = 57 \n\nsalt: p=1, np=1 → salt_t = 1/(10 *1) = 0.1 → 0. \n\nso min(2000,57,0) is 0 → output 0. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo this approach works. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the input values n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. \n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l \n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl) \n\ntotal_slices = c * d \n\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n \n\ntotal_salt = p \n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np) \n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts) \n\nprint(result) \n\nNow, implement this in Python. \n\nBut wait, what if any of the denominators is zero? No, the problem says that all inputs are positive integers. \n\nSo no division by zero. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers. \n\nThen compute the three values and take the minimum. \n\nLet me test with the first sample input. \n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → \n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink = 20 \n\ndrink_toasts = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2 \n\nc=10, d=8 → total_slices = 80 → lime_toasts = 80//3 = 26 \n\np=100, np=1 → salt_toasts = 100//(3*1) = 33 \n\nmin(2, 26, 33) → 2 → correct. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers. \n\nIn Python, the input is read from stdin. For example, the first sample input is given as a list of strings, but in actual code, the input is read as a single line. \n\nThe code:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, convert to integers. \n\nThen compute the three values. \n\nSo code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n\nYes. \n\nTesting the second sample input: \n\nInput line: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → \n\ndrink: 100 *10 = 1000, divided by 5*4=20 → 50 \n\nlime: 1*19=19 divided by 5 → 3 \n\nsalt: 90 / (5 *3) = 90/15=6 → min(50,3,6) → 3. Correct. \n\nThird sample: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 \n\ndrink: 1000*1000 = 1,000,000 divided by 10*50=500 → 2000 \n\nlime: 25*23=575 divided by 10 → 57 \n\nsalt: 1 divided by 10*1=10 → 0. \n\nmin is 0. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nNow, handle edge cases. For example, when any of the denominators is larger than the numerator, leading to zero. \n\nLike if the salt is insufficient. \n\nAnother case: when n=1, and all resources are sufficient. \n\nFor example: n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1. \n\ndrink: (1*1)/(1*1) = 1 \n\nlime: (1*1)/1 = 1 \n\nsalt: 1/(1*1) = 1 → min is 1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother case: when the division is exact. \n\nSo the code seems correct. \n\nThus, the Python script is as follows.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available from the bottles.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available from the limes.\n   - **Salt**: Use the given grams of salt directly.\n\n2. **Determine Maximum Possible Toasts for Each Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: The total drink available divided by the required drink per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total lime slices available divided by the number of friends (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt**: The total salt available divided by the required salt per toast for all friends.\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value among the maximum possible toasts calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into individual integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total milliliters of drink available is calculated as `k * l`. The maximum number of toasts based on drink is determined by dividing this total by the product of the number of friends and the milliliters required per toast per friend (`n * nl`).\n\n3. **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices available is `c * d`. The maximum number of toasts based on lime slices is determined by dividing this total by the number of friends (`n`), since each toast requires one slice per friend.\n\n4. **Salt Calculation**: The maximum number of toasts based on salt is determined by dividing the total grams of salt by the product of the number of friends and the grams of salt required per toast per friend (`n * np`).\n\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value among the maximum possible toasts calculated for each resource, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied. This value is printed as the final result.",
