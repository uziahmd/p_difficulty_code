After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs and what each part contributes.\n\nThe input numbers are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend?), wait no: Wait, the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. Oh right. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml of drink, one slice, and np grams of salt.\n\nSo, for one toast, all n friends would consume n * nl ml of drink. Because each of the n friends has one toast. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend needs one slice per toast). And for salt, each toast requires n * np grams, since each friend needs np grams per toast.\n\nSo the total resources needed for t toasts would be:\n\nDrink: t * n * nl ml. Because for each toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. Multiply by t toasts.\n\nLime slices: t * n slices. Because each toast requires n slices (each friend one slice).\n\nSalt: t * n * np grams. Because each toast requires n * np grams.\n\nNow, the available resources are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d slices.\n\nSalt: p grams.\n\nSo, the maximum number of toasts t that can be made is determined by the minimum between:\n\n- (total drink) / (n * nl) → because total drink must be >= t * n * nl → t <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\n- (total lime slices) / (n) → because t * n <= c*d → t <= (c*d)/n\n\n- (total salt) / (n * np) → t <= p/(n * np)\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values, but since t has to be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a toast), we take the floor of each of these values and then take the minimum.\n\nWait, but how do we compute each of these?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total drink is 4*5=20 ml.\n\nEach toast requires per friend 3 ml (nl=3). For each toast, total drink needed is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So total toasts possible from drink is 20 / 9 = 2.222..., which floors to 2.\n\nLime slices: c=10, d=8 → 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices (n=3). 80 / 3 is 26.666, floor to 26. But wait, the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, what's the calculation here?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why? Because each toast requires n slices (3), so 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666... toasts. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that seems conflicting. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nIn the first sample, the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Wait, but why? Because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, there are n slices needed. So for 1 toast, 3 slices. So for 80 slices, you can have 80 / 3 = 26.666 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. So for t toasts, n*t slices are needed. So the total available slices is c*d. So the maximum t is (c*d) // (n). So in the first sample, c*d is 10 * 8 = 80. Divided by n=3, gives 26.666, floor to 26. But according to the sample explanation, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which is conflicting. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, but why is the limes enough for 80 toasts? According to the sample explanation, it's 80 toasts. But according to my calculation, the limes would allow for 80 / 3 = 26.666 toasts. So why does the sample explanation say that limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime per toast. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that for each toast, only one slice is needed. But that would be the case if the problem said that each toast requires one slice in total, not per friend. So perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices are required. Therefore, for t toasts, n * t slices are needed. Therefore, the maximum t is (c*d) // (n). \n\nBut in the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that for the first sample, (c*d) is 10 * 8 = 80. Then, the maximum t is 80 / (n) = 80 / 3 = 26.666. So the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which contradicts that. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, that would require that each toast uses only one slice. So perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice in total, not per friend. So maybe I have misread the problem.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime ...\". So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for example, if there are 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So the sample input says that there are 10 limes, each cut into 8 slices. So total slices is 80. So for the first sample, the number of toasts possible based on limes would be 80 / 3 = 26.666, which would be 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that the limes are being used as 80 slices per toast. Which would be impossible unless the problem says that each toast requires one slice in total. \n\nSo where is the error here? Let me look at the sample explanation again. \n\nThe sample explanation says:\n\nOverall the friends have 20 ml of drink, which is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 80 toasts, salt for 100. Then the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Wait, why divide by 3? Because the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3? But that doesn't make sense. Because the min of those three numbers is 6, which would be the number of toasts. But then why divide by 3?\n\nWait this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong. But that's impossible. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\nAh! So the question is, how many toasts per friend. So if the total number of toasts is T, then each friend makes T toasts. So for example, if T is 2, each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\nSo the problem is to find T such that:\n\n- Total drink is >= T * n * nl (because each toast per friend needs nl ml. So per T toasts per friend, each friend has T toasts, so per friend, T * nl ml. For all friends, total is n * T * nl.)\n\nSimilarly, for the lime slices: each toast per friend needs a slice. So per T toasts per friend, each friend has T slices. So total slices needed is n * T.\n\nSalt: per toast per friend, np grams. So total salt needed is n * T * np.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nTotal drink >= n * T * nl → T <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nTotal slices >= n * T → T <= (c*d) / n \n\nTotal salt >= n * T * np → T <= p/(n * np)\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible T is the minimum of the three values (each computed as floor division, but perhaps using integer division with floor).\n\nSo in the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total drink is 20. \n\nnl=3. So n * nl = 3 *3 =9. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so T can be 2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 → total slices 80. n=3. So 80 /3 = 26.666, so T can be 26.\n\nSalt: p=100, n * np = 3 *1=3. 100 /3 is 33.333. So T can be 33.\n\nThe minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to this calculation, the limes would allow T up to 26. So why does the sample explanation say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts? Because perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"In the first sample: ... the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait this suggests that the sample explanation is considering the limes as allowing 80 toasts, and then dividing by 3. But according to our previous analysis, that's not correct. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps the problem is different. Let me think again.\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. How is that calculated?\n\nIf the drink is 20 ml, and each toast requires per friend 3 ml. So per toast, for all friends, it's 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222 toasts. But the sample explanation says 20 /3 =6. Which suggests that the sample explanation is considering that each toast requires 3 ml in total, not per friend. So that would be a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nSo this indicates that there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. For T toasts, total drink is T * n * nl.\n\nIn the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, total drink is 3*3=9. So for 20 ml, maximum T is 20//9=2.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that they are calculating T as (total drink) / (nl) per toast, but that would be if each toast requires nl ml per friend, but for T toasts per friend, total per friend is T * nl. For all friends, that would be n * T * nl. But the sample explanation seems to be considering that the total drink is divided by nl, which would be (k*l)/nl, then divided by n? Or perhaps the sample explanation is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is considering the total number of toasts (total across all friends), not per friend. Let me think.\n\nSuppose that the question is asking for the total number of toasts that can be made (i.e., total across all friends), and then the answer is that divided by n to get per friend. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nThe problem says: \"How many toasts can each friend make?\" So the answer is T, which is the same for all friends.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the drink is considered as 20 ml. If each toast requires 3 ml per friend, then for T toasts per friend, each friend uses T * 3 ml. For 3 friends, total is 3*T*3 =9T. Which must be <= 20. So T can be 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be if each toast requires 3 ml in total. So for example, if each toast is for all friends, but that's not the case.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps the sample explanation is wrong. But that's unlikely. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait looking at the sample explanation again: \n\n\"In the first sample: ... the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nSo the min is 6, divided by 3 gives 2. So that suggests that the sample explanation is calculating the total possible toasts (across all friends) as 6, then dividing by the number of friends to get per person. Which would imply that the original calculation for the drink was (k*l) / nl, then divided by n.\n\nSo for the drink, (k*l) is 20, divided by nl=3 gives 6.666..., which is 6. Then divided by n=3 gives 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Because if the total number of toasts across all friends is T_total, then each friend makes T_total / n toasts. But that would be the case if each toast is a single toast for all friends. But that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is wrong. But the sample output is correct. So perhaps the way to model the problem is:\n\nEach toast is a single toast for all friends. So for each toast, each friend takes part. So for each toast, the total drink required is n * nl (each friend needs nl per toast). So for T toasts, total drink is T * n * nl. Which is the same as before. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, they calculate the drink as (k*l) / nl = 20 / 3 =6. Which would be T_total =6. Then T_total / n = 6 /3=2. Which is the correct answer. But how is that derived?\n\nBecause T_total is the number of toasts (each toast is one per all friends). So for T_total toasts, each friend makes T_total toasts. So the total drink required is T_total * n * nl. Which must be <= k*l. So solving for T_total:\n\nT_total <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nBut the sample explanation is saying that T_total is (k*l)/nl. Which would be incorrect. Unless there's a mistake in the sample explanation.\n\nBut this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, but the actual calculation is correct. So how can we reconcile this?\n\nLet me think again. Let me take the first sample:\n\nSample Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nWhich means:\n\nn=3 friends.\n\nk=4 bottles, each l=5 ml. So total drink is 4*5=20.\n\nEach friend needs per toast: nl=3 ml. So for one toast, each friend has 3 ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is 3 * 3 =9 ml.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts (T) that can be made is 20 // 9 = 2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, they are calculating the drink as 20 /3 =6. Which is 6. Then divided by 3 (n) gives 2. Which is the same answer. But why?\n\nBecause 20 /3 is 6.666, which is the maximum T_total (number of toasts in total) if the drink required per toast is 3 ml. But that would be the case if each toast required 3 ml in total, not per friend. \n\nSo this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, but the actual answer is correct. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that I have misunderstood the problem. Maybe the nl is the total per toast, not per friend. \n\nLet me re-read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So per toast, per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, all friends together need n * nl ml. For T toasts, it's T * n * nl.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be T_total =6. Which would be if for each toast, the total drink required is 3 ml. So that would be if nl is the total per toast, not per friend. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. How can this be resolved?\n\nLooking back to the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input for the first case is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. The output is 2.\n\nAccording to the correct calculation, the drink allows for 20/(3*3) = 2.222, which is 2. The lime allows 80/(3) = 26.666, which is 26. Salt allows 100/(3*1) = 33.333. So the minimum is 2, which is correct.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, the limes for 80, and the salt for 100. Then the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Which gives the same result. But how is the 6 derived?\n\nIn this case, the 6 is (k*l)/nl = 20 /3 =6.666, floored to 6. Then divided by n=3 gives 2. Which is the same as the correct answer. So perhaps the sample explanation is using a different approach. But why?\n\nMaybe the problem is that the sample explanation is considering that the total number of toasts (T_total) that can be made is limited by:\n\ndrink: (k*l) / nl → since each toast requires nl per friend, but T_total toasts would require T_total * nl per friend. But since there are n friends, total drink is T_total * nl * n. So the drink constraint is T_total * nl *n ≤ k*l → T_total ≤ (k*l)/(nl *n). \n\nBut the sample explanation is calculating (k*l)/nl, which is (k*l)/nl = (k*l) / (nl) = T_total * n. So T_total = (k*l)/(nl *n) = (k*l)/(nl) /n. So the sample explanation is taking (k*l)/nl as the total toasts multiplied by n, then dividing by n to get T_total. \n\nBut in any case, the final result is the same. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate for each resource the maximum number of toasts possible, and then take the minimum of them. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate for each resource:\n\n- drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So max_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\n- limes: total_slices = c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So max_toasts_limes = total_slices // n \n\n- salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So max_toasts_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\ndrink: 20 / (3 *3) = 20 /9 = 2.222 → 2\n\nlimes: 80 /3 = 26.666 → 26 \n\nsalt: 100/(3 *1) = 33.333 → 33 \n\nmin(2, 26, 33) = 2 → correct.\n\nIn the sample explanation, they are calculating:\n\ndrink: 20 /3 =6.666, then divided by 3 (n) gives 2.222, which is floor to 2. Which is the same as the correct approach. So perhaps the sample explanation is wrong in its description, but the actual calculation is the same. \n\nSo the conclusion is that the correct way to calculate is for each resource, compute how many toasts can be made, given that each toast requires n * nl ml, etc. \n\nSo the code should compute the three values as:\n\nmax_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nmax_lime = (c * d) // n \n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nthen answer is min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nBut let's test this against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → 4*5=20\n\nnl=3. So max_drink is 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 =2.\n\nc=10, d=8 → 80 slices. max_lime is 80//3=26.\n\np=100, np=1 → 100 // (3*1) = 33. \n\nmin(2,26,33) → 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000.\n\nnl=4. So max_drink = 1000/(5*4) = 1000/20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → total slices is 19. max_lime is 19//5=3.\n\nsalt: p=90, np=3. max_salt is 90/(5*3) = 90/15=6. \n\nso min(50,3,6) → 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink is 1e6.\n\nnl=50. max_drink = 1e6 / (10 * 50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 → total slices 25*23=575. max_lime = 575//10=57.\n\nsalt: p=1, np=1 → max_salt = 1/(10*1) = 0. So min(2000,57,0) → 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nSo the code needs to compute these three values and take the minimum.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as integers. The input is a single line with n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nSo, for each input line, split into the variables.\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\nmax_lime = total_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nmax_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut need to handle division correctly. Since in Python, integer division with // truncates towards negative infinity, but since all values are positive, it's okay.\n\nBut what if n * nl is zero? No, because the input constraints state that all numbers are at least 1. So n, nl are ≥1. So n * nl ≥1.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me test the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → variables:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nmax_drink = (4*5) // (3*3) → 20//9=2.\n\nmax_lime = (10*8) //3 → 80//3=26.\n\nmax_salt = 100 // (3*1) → 100//3=33. min is 2.\n\nSample Output is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: the third sample input:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink is 1,000,000.\n\nnl=50 → max_drink = 1e6 / (10 *50) = 1e6 /500 = 2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 → 25*23=575. max_lime is 575//10=57.\n\nsalt: p=1, n * np =10 *1=10. 1//10=0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line, split into the variables. For each line in the input (but the input is given as a list of lines, but the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nSo the input is a single line. However, in the example, the input is given as a list of three examples. But when the user runs the code, it's supposed to read from stdin. So for example, in the sample input, the user would input one line at a time. But in the problem's example, the input is given as multiple lines, but perhaps that's for the purpose of the example. \n\nWait the problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line contains ... \n\nSo the code should read one line from stdin, split into the 8 integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given in the problem:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut this is probably for testing purposes. The actual code should read one line from input.\n\nSo the code should read a single line from standard input, split into the 8 integers.\n\nThus, the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen compute the three values as discussed.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\nmax_lime = total_slices // n\n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut wait, what if the division is zero? Like, if n * nl is larger than total_drink, then max_drink is zero. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the third sample input:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000. \n\nn * nl = 10 *50 =500. So 1e6 // 500 = 2000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. Therefore, for `t` toasts, the total resources needed will be scaled by the number of friends `n`.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total available resources:\n   - Total drink available is the product of the number of bottles and the milliliters per bottle.\n   - Total lime slices available is the product of the number of limes and the slices per lime.\n   - Total salt available is given directly.\n3. **Determine Maximum Possible Toasts**: For each resource, calculate the maximum number of toasts that can be made considering the total resource availability and the requirements per toast:\n   - Drink: Total drink divided by the drink required per toast for all friends.\n   - Lime slices: Total slices divided by the slices required per toast for all friends.\n   - Salt: Total salt divided by the salt required per toast for all friends.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum of the maximum possible toasts calculated for each resource, as the limiting resource will determine the maximum number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\nmax_lime = total_slices // n\n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The input values are read and converted into integers.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: The total available drink, lime slices, and salt are computed.\n- **Maximum Toasts Calculation**: For each resource, the maximum number of toasts that can be made is determined by integer division of the total resource by the resource required per toast for all friends.\n- **Result Determination**: The minimum value among the maximum toasts calculated for each resource is taken as the result, ensuring all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limits.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and ensures that all constraints are respected.",
