The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. The constraints are n up to 500, which is quite big. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each pair of permutations p and q, we need to check two conditions: p < q lexicographically, and inv(p) > inv(q). The answer is the count of such pairs modulo mod.\n\nBut considering that n can be 500, the total number of permutations is n! which is way too big to iterate over all possible pairs. So brute force is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties here. Since permutations are involved, maybe we can find some mathematical relations or dynamic programming approaches.\n\nLet me first think about the total number of pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q. Since all permutations are distinct, for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. The total number of unordered pairs is (n!)^2 / 2. But since we're considering ordered pairs where p < q, the count is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. However, this is only if we consider all pairs where p != q. But in our case, the problem requires p and q to be distinct? Well, since p is lex smaller than q, they must be different. So the total number of such pairs is (total_permutations choose 2), which is (n! * (n! - 1))/2. But we need to count among these how many satisfy inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how can we compute that?\n\nLet me think about the inversion counts. For any two distinct permutations p and q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). But since p and q are distinct, they can't be equal. However, there might be pairs where their inversion counts are equal. So the total number of pairs where p < q is T = (n! * (n! - 1))/2. Now, the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (T - same_count)/2, where same_count is the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). Because for each pair where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. And for those pairs where inv(p) = inv(q), they contribute nothing to either.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Suppose for all pairs (p, q) with p < q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) if there are no pairs with equal inversions. But when there are pairs with equal inversions, then the total number of such pairs would be (T - same_count)/2. Because the rest are split equally between the two possibilities.\n\nBut is that true? Let me think. For each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Suppose we look at all pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). Let's say S is the set of all unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). Then, for each such pair, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. So if we consider the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), plus the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p) (which is same as inv(p) < inv(q)), then the sum would be equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) != inv(q). But since the total number of unordered pairs is C(n!, 2), and same_count is the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) = inv(q), then the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) != inv(q) is C(n!, 2) - same_count. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) would be equal to (total_unordered_pairs_without_same - same_count)/2 ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me denote:\n\nLet A be the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet B be the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q).\n\nLet C be the number of ordered pairs (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we use dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Inversion Count Calculation**: Use dynamic programming to precompute the number of permutations with a specific number of inversions for all possible lengths up to n.\n2. **Lexicographical Order Consideration**: Since we need pairs where p is lexicographically smaller than q, we consider all unordered pairs of permutations and adjust for the lexicographical condition.\n3. **Symmetry and Equal Inversions**: For each pair of permutations with different inversion counts, exactly half of the pairs will have p < q and the other half will have q < p. We subtract the cases where inversion counts are equal from the total and divide by 2 to get the required count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    mod = int(input[1])\n\n    max_n = n\n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n\n    # dp[i][j] = number of permutations of length i with j inversions\n    dp = [[0] * (max_inv + 1) for _ in range(max_n + 1)]\n    dp[1][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n        for j in range(max_inv + 1):\n            for k in range(j + 1):\n                dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][k]\n                if j - k >= 0:\n                    dp[i][j] %= mod\n\n    # Precompute factorial\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % mod\n\n    total_perms = fact[n]\n    total_pairs = (total_perms * (total_perms - 1)) // 2\n    total_pairs_mod = total_pairs % mod\n\n    # Compute same_count: number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) == inv(q)\n    same_count = 0\n    for inv in range(max_inv + 1):\n        cnt = dp[n][inv]\n        same_count = (same_count + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2) % mod\n\n    # The answer is (total_pairs - same_count) // 2 mod mod\n    ans = (total_pairs_mod - same_count) % mod\n    ans = (ans * pow(2, mod - 2, mod)) % mod  # inverse of 2 modulo mod\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Table (dp)**: We use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of permutations of length `i` with exactly `j` inversions. This is computed using a recurrence relation based on inserting the next element into all possible positions.\n2. **Factorial Calculation**: Precompute factorials modulo `mod` to efficiently calculate the total number of permutations and their pairs.\n3. **Total Pairs Calculation**: Calculate the total number of unordered pairs of permutations and adjust for the lexicographical order by considering symmetry and subtracting pairs with equal inversion counts.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Ensure all operations are performed modulo `mod`, including division by 2 using modular inverse to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required count using dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics, ensuring it handles the constraints effectively.",
