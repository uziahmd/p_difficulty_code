    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. So when I remove one element, I want to minimize that difference. The key here is to figure out which element to remove so that the new max and min of the remaining array have the smallest possible difference.\n\nLet me think about the original array. Suppose the array is sorted. If I sort it, then the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. But when I remove one element, the new instability depends on which element I remove.\n\nFor example, if I remove the first element, then the new array's min is a[1], and the max is a[-1]. The instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If I remove the last element, the instability is a[-2] - a[0]. But what if there are duplicates? Like in the example given: [1,3,3,7]. When we remove 7, the max is 3 and min is 1, so difference is 2. If we remove the first element (1), the new array is [3,3,7], instability is 7-3=4. So the best is to remove the max or the min, but not sure in all cases.\n\nSo the idea is that for each element, when you remove it, the new min and max can be determined. However, checking for each element by removing it and calculating the new min and max would be O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for n up to 1e5. So we need an efficient way.\n\nWait, but if the array is sorted, maybe we can find the optimal element to remove quickly. Let's consider that the array is sorted. Let's say the original array is sorted as a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}.\n\nIf we remove an element that's not the first or last, then the min and max of the remaining array would still be a_0 and a_{n-1}, unless that element is the only one that's the min or max. For example, if we remove a_1, then the min is a_0 and the max is a_{n-1} (assuming n is at least 3). So the instability would be a_{n-1} - a_0. But if we remove a_0, then the new min is a_1, and max is a_{n-1}, so instability is a_{n-1} - a_1. Similarly, if we remove a_{n-1}, the instability is a_{n-2} - a_0.\n\nBut in this case, the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a_{n-1} - a_1) and (a_{n-2} - a_0). Because for all other elements, removing them doesn't change the min and max. So the instability would be the same as the original, which is a_{n-1} - a_0. Therefore, the optimal choice is to remove either the first element or the last element, but not any others. Wait, but what if there are multiple elements with the same value?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The original instability is 4. If I remove the first element (1), the instability is 5-2=3. If I remove the last element (5), instability is 4-1=3. If I remove any other element, like 3, the instability is 5-1=4, which is worse. So the best is to remove either first or last.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 3, 7]. Sorted. Original instability is 6. If I remove the first element (1), instability is 7-3=4. If I remove the last element (7), instability is 3-1=2. Which is better. So the answer here is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the conclusion is that when the array is sorted, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[n-2] - a[0]) and (a[n-1] - a[1]). Because those are the two options: remove the first element (so new min is a[1], max is a[n-1]), or remove the last element (new min is a[0], max is a[n-2]).\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple elements in the middle that can be removed to get a better result? For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Original instability is 5. If we remove 6, the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, instability is 6-2=4. But if we remove 2, the instability is 6-1=5. So no improvement. So the minimal is 4.\n\nBut suppose another case: [1, 2, 5, 6]. Original instability is 5. If I remove 5, the array becomes [1,2,6], instability 5. If I remove 6, the array is [1,2,5], instability 4. If I remove 2, the array is [1,5,6], instability 5. If I remove 1, array is [2,5,6], instability 4. So the minimal is 4, which is achieved by removing either first or last element.\n\nSo in all these examples, the minimal instability is achieved by removing either the first or the last element. So perhaps the solution is to sort the array and compute the minimum between (a[n-2] - a[0]) and (a[n-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if there are more than two elements that are the same? For example, [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then removing any element gives instability 0. So in this case, the answer is 0. Which would be covered by the formula since (a[n-2] - a[0]) is 0 and (a[n-1] - a[1]) is 0.\n\nAnother example: [1, 1, 3, 3]. Original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the first element (1), the array is [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the last element (3), the array is [1,1,3], instability is 3-1=2. But if we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is 2. But according to the formula, the min between a[n-2] - a[0] (which is 3-1=2) and a[n-1] - a[1] (3-1=2). So the answer is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 5]. Original instability is 5-1=4. If I remove the first element (1), instability is 5-3=2. If I remove the last element (5), instability is 5-1=4. So the minimal is 2. Which is the case of removing the first element. So the formula would take the min between (a[n-2] - a[0]) = 5-1=4 (since a[n-2] is 5?), wait wait, the array is [1,3,4,5,5]. So n is 5. a[0] is 1, a[1] is 3, a[2] is 4, a[3] is 5, a[4] is 5. So when considering removing the first element, the new array is [3,4,5,5]. The instability is 5-3=2. Which is a[n-1] (5) minus a[1] (3). So that's the second option (a[n-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut according to the formula, the two options are (a[n-2] - a[0]) and (a[n-1] - a[1]). For this case, a[n-2] is a[3] =5. So 5 - a[0] =5-1=4. And a[n-1] - a[1] is 5-3=2. So the minimum between 4 and 2 is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. Thus, the minimal instability is the minimum between these two possibilities.\n\nWait, but what about if there are elements in the middle that can be removed to get a better result? Let me think of a scenario where that's possible.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If I remove 4, the array becomes [1,2,5], instability 4. If I remove 5, instability is 4-1=3. If I remove 2, the array is [1,4,5], instability 4. If I remove 1, instability is 5-2=3. So the minimal is 3. Which is the minimum between (a[n-2] - a[0] = 4-1=3) and (a[n-1] - a[1] =5-2=3). So the formula works here.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]. Original instability is 6. If I remove 6, the array becomes [1,3,4,7], instability 7-1=6. If I remove 7, the instability is 6-1=5. If I remove 1, instability is 7-3=4. Which is better. So the formula would compute (a[n-2] - a[0]) which is 6-1=5 (since a[n-2] is 6, a[0] is 1). And a[n-1] - a[1] is 7-3=4. So the minimum between 5 and 4 is 4, which is correct.\n\nSo in this case, the formula works. So the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between (the instability after removing the first element) and (the instability after removing the last element). Because when you remove any other element, the instability remains the same as the original (since the min and max are still the same). Wait, but what if the array has multiple elements that are the same as the min or max?\n\nFor example, let's say the array is [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]. The original instability is 3-1=2. If I remove one of the 1s, the instability becomes 3-1=2 (since there's still a 1 left). If I remove one of the 3s, the instability becomes 3-1=2. But if I remove the 2, the instability is 3-1=2. So in this case, no matter which element you remove, the instability is 2. So the formula would compute (a[n-2] - a[0]) = 3-1=2 and (a[n-1] - a[1]) = 3-1=2. So the minimum is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo in all cases, the minimal possible instability is the minimum between the two options: removing the first element or removing the last element. So the algorithm would be:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if n is 2? Then, when you remove one element, the array has one element, so the instability is zero. For example, input is 2 elements, say 1 and 100000. Then, removing either gives an array with one element, so instability is zero. Which is the case in the sample input. So for n=2, the answer is 0. Which is handled by the formula: a[-2] is a[0], so a[-2] - a[0] is 0. Similarly, a[-1] - a[1] is 0. So the minimum is 0.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- If n == 2, then the answer is 0.\n\n- Else, compute min( (a[-2] - a[0]), (a[-1] - a[1]) )\n\nWait, but what if there are other elements that can be removed to get a better result? Let me think again. For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 100]. The original instability is 99. If I remove 100, the instability is 7-1=6. If I remove 1, the instability is 100-2=98. But what if there is an element in the middle that can be removed to get a better result? Like, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5, 6]. Wait, but after sorting, the array is [1,2,3,4,5,6,100]. Then, the options are:\n\nRemoving the first element (1) gives instability 100 - 2 = 98.\n\nRemoving the last element (100) gives instability 6 - 1 = 5. Which is better.\n\nBut what if there's an element that is not the first or last, but removing it would allow the instability to be lower?\n\nLike, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100]. After sorting, the array is [1,2,3,4,5,100]. The original instability is 99. If I remove 100, instability is 5-1=4. If I remove 1, instability is 100-2=98. But what if I remove 5? Then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,100], instability is 100-1=99. Worse. So no. So the best is to remove the last element.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 100, 101]. After sorting, [1,2,100,101]. Removing the first element gives instability 101-2=99. Removing the last gives 100-1=99. But if we remove 100, the array is [1,2,101], instability is 100. If we remove 101, the array is [1,2,100], instability is 99. So the minimal is 99, which is the min between the two options.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to sort the array, then compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\nRead n, then read the array. Sort it. Then, if n == 2, output 0. Else, compute the min between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but let me check the first example. The first example input is 4 elements: [1,3,3,7]. After sorting, it's [1,3,3,7]. So a[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1. So 3-1=2. a[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3. 7-3=4. The min is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example is the second input: n=2, [1, 100000]. Output is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 2, 3]. The options are removing first (instability 3-2=1), or removing last (instability 2-1=1). So the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 1]. The answer is 0.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n, then list of numbers. Sort them. If n == 2, print 0. Else, compute min between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if n is 3? Let's see:\n\nFor example, array [1, 3, 5]. After sorting, the options are:\n\nremove first element: [3,5] -> instability 2.\n\nremove last element: [1,3] -> instability 2.\n\nso the answer is 2. Which is min(5-1=4? No. Wait, according to the formula, a[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1. 3-1=2. a[-1] is 5, a[1] is 3. 5-3=2. So min is 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but what about when n is 3?\n\nYes, for example, n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. The options are option1 is a[-2] (2) - a[0] (1) =1. option2 is a[-1] (3) - a[1] (2) =1. min is 1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's think about another example where the array is [1, 5, 5, 5, 5]. So sorted. n=5. The options are:\n\noption1 is a[-2] (5) - a[0] (1) =4.\n\noption2 is a[-1] (5) - a[1] (5) =0. So the answer is 0. Which is correct because removing the first element gives [5,5,5,5], instability 0.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as two lines. First line is n, second line is the array.\n\nBut in the example given in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\nWait, but that's probably for testing. But the actual input is read from stdin. So the code should read n from stdin, then read the next line as the array.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next line, split into integers, store as list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nIf n == 2: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute option1 and option2 as above, and print min of them.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted as [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1: a[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1 → 2.\n\noption2: a[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3 → 4. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 2, 3]. Output 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 1]. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, [1, 5, 5, 5, 5]. Output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about n=5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. option1 is a[-2] (4) - a[0] (1) =3. option2 is a[-1] (5) - a[1] (2) =3. So min is 3. Which is correct, since removing 1 gives [2,3,4,5] instability 3. Removing 5 gives [1,2,3,4] instability 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when n is 1? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
