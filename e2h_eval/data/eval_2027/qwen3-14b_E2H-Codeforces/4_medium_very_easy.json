The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine the number of times each player loses in n rounds of rock-paper-scissors, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their own sequences. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the sequences work. For example, Nikephoros's sequence A is repeated cyclically. So for round i (starting from 0?), he uses A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus's sequence B. \n\nThe main challenge here is that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round one by one. So we need an efficient way to calculate the number of losses without iterating through all n rounds.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The key is to find patterns that repeat over time. Since both sequences are cyclic, the combination of their moves will also have a cycle. The total number of possible combinations of moves is m * k. So the entire sequence of rounds will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Wait, because the cycles of A and B may not align. For example, if A has length m and B has length k, then after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the pattern of moves between the two players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. \n\nSo the idea is to compute the number of losses in one full cycle (of length L = LCM(m, k)), then multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the result for the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, let's compute how many full cycles there are and the remainder. Let's say total_rounds = n. Then:\n\nfull_cycles = total_rounds // L\nremainder_rounds = total_rounds % L\n\nSo for each full cycle, we can precompute the number of times Nikephoros loses (say, loss_a_per_cycle) and Polycarpus loses (loss_b_per_cycle). Then multiply those by full_cycles. Then, for the remainder_rounds, we compute the losses in the first remainder_rounds rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how do we compute the losses per cycle?\n\nWell, for each round in the cycle (from 0 to L-1), we can compute the move of A and B. For each such round, determine who wins, and increment the counts accordingly.\n\nBut L can be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1,000,000. Since m and k are up to 1000 each, LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6. So for n up to 2e9, even if we process 1e6 rounds once, it's manageable. Because 1e6 is acceptable for a loop in Python.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute L = LCM(m, k). But how to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need to compute GCD first.\n\n2. Precompute for each round in 0..L-1, the moves of A and B, and count how many times each loses in that cycle.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_rounds // L, and the remainder is total_rounds % L.\n\n4. Multiply the per-cycle counts by full_cycles, and add the counts for the first remainder_rounds rounds in the cycle.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round in the cycle?\n\nFor a given round i (0-based?), the move of A is A[i % m], and B's move is B[i % k]. \n\nSo for each i in 0 to L-1, we can calculate the moves and check who wins.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to L-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine who wins. For each such pair, we can check:\n\nif a_move beats b_move: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is increased by 0, and Polycarpus's loss count by 1? Wait no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so his count increases. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros's count increases. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check if a wins, b wins, or draw.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a beats b): then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1).\n\nWait no. The problem says that the loser gets pinched. So for example, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser. So Nikephoros's loss count is 0, and Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1.\n\nSo for each round, we need to determine whether Nikephoros loses (so add 1 to his count) or Polycarpus loses (add 1 to his count), or none.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a and b are same: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\nif a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So Nikephoros's count remains same, but Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nif b beats a: then Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1, and Polycarpus's remains same.\n\nSo how to check if a beats b?\n\nWe can have a helper function, like:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # a wins\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # b wins\n\nSo for each a and b, we can check the result.\n\nOnce we have that, for each round in the cycle, we can compute the outcome.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute the total number of rounds n.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute the number of full cycles: full_cycles = n // L\n\nremainder = n % L\n\nNow, for each of the L rounds in the cycle, compute the number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus in that cycle. Let's call them per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\nThen, total_nik = full_cycles * per_cycle_nik + count_remainder_nik\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * per_cycle_poly + count_remainder_poly\n\nSo the question is how to compute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly, and also the counts for the first remainder rounds.\n\nSo for that, we can precompute for each i in 0 to L-1, the outcome of that round, and accumulate the counts for the entire cycle.\n\nBut for the remainder rounds, we need to process the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nSo, for the entire cycle, we can create two arrays, say, for each round in 0 to L-1, the number of times Nikephoros loses (0 or 1) and Polycarpus loses (0 or 1). Then, for the full cycles, multiply by full_cycles. For the remainder, we take the first 'remainder' rounds and sum their contributions.\n\nBut for large L (up to 1e6), even with 1e6 iterations, it's manageable in Python.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute the per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\nThen compute the remainder.\n\nBut how to compute LCM?\n\nImplementing GCD first. For example, using math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nSo:\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\nBut perhaps using math.gcd is better. But need to handle 0? No, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo LCM(m, k) = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n\nOnce we have L, then proceed.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nWe can generate for each i in 0 to L-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen check who wins, and accumulate the counts.\n\nSo for the entire cycle, we can compute:\n\ncycle_nik = 0\n\ncycle_poly = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to L-1:\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if a beats b:\n\n        cycle_poly += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        cycle_nik += 1\n\nThen, for the remainder rounds, we need to process the first 'remainder' rounds (from 0 to remainder-1), and sum the same way.\n\nBut for that, perhaps during the initial processing of the cycle, we can also create a list of the per-round contributions. For example, create two arrays: nik_loss and poly_loss, each of length L, where nik_loss[i] is 1 if Nikephoros lost in the i-th round of the cycle, else 0. Similarly for poly_loss[i].\n\nThen, the total for the cycle is sum(nik_loss) and sum(poly_loss).\n\nBut for the remainder, we can take the first 'remainder' elements and sum them.\n\nBut for L up to 1e6, storing these arrays is feasible.\n\nBut for Python, even 1e6 elements is manageable.\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nCompute L.\n\nprecompute for each i in 0..L-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine if it's a win for a, b, or draw.\n\nThen, for each i, record the contribution to nik and poly.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nnik = 0\n\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(L):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so poly gets a loss\n\n        poly += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, so nik gets a loss\n\n        nik += 1\n\nSo, for the cycle, we have nik and poly counts.\n\nBut then, for the remainder, we need to compute the same for the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nSo perhaps, during the initial loop, we can also create a prefix sum array for nik and poly. For example, prefix_nik[i] is the number of times Nikephoros lost in the first i rounds of the cycle. Similarly for prefix_poly. Then, for remainder rounds, we can take prefix_nik[remainder] and prefix_poly[remainder].\n\nBut building prefix sums would take O(L) time and space, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial loop, we can compute the total for the cycle, and also compute the prefix sums.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nOnce we have the per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly, and the prefix arrays, then:\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * per_cycle_nik + prefix_nik[remainder]\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * per_cycle_poly + prefix_poly[remainder]\n\nBut how to compute the prefix arrays?\n\nWe can have two arrays, prefix_nik and prefix_poly, where prefix_nik[i] is the number of losses for Nikephoros in the first i rounds (from 0 to i-1?), or something like that. Let me think.\n\nLet me think of the loop as processing rounds 0 to L-1. For each round i, we can compute the contribution to nik and poly. Then, for the prefix arrays, we can have prefix_nik[0] = 0, prefix_nik[1] = contribution of round 0, prefix_nik[2] = contribution of rounds 0 and 1, etc. So for the first r rounds (r is remainder), the sum is prefix_nik[r].\n\nSo, during the loop, we can build these prefix arrays.\n\nBut for L up to 1e6, even building two arrays of size L+1 is manageable.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nInitialize prefix_nik = [0]*(L+1)\n\nprefix_poly = [0]*(L+1)\n\nfor i in range(L):\n\n    compute a and b\n\n    determine if a wins, b wins, or draw\n\n    if a wins:\n\n        poly += 1\n\n    elif b wins:\n\n        nik += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        pass\n\n    prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + (nik_contribution for this round)\n\n    prefix_poly[i+1] = prefix_poly[i] + (poly_contribution for this round)\n\nWait, but for each round, the contribution for nik is 1 if he lost, else 0. Similarly for poly.\n\nSo during the loop, for each round i (from 0 to L-1):\n\ncurrent_nik = 0 or 1\n\ncurrent_poly = 0 or 1\n\nthen, prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + current_nik\n\nSimilarly for prefix_poly.\n\nSo during the loop, for each i, we can compute current_nik and current_poly, and update the prefix arrays.\n\nBut how to compute current_nik and current_poly?\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprefix_nik = [0]*(L+1)\n\nprefix_poly = [0]*(L+1)\n\nfor i in range(L):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        current_nik = 0\n\n        current_poly = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # a wins, so poly loses\n\n            current_nik = 0\n\n            current_poly = 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # b wins, so nik loses\n\n            current_nik = 1\n\n            current_poly = 0\n\n    prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + current_nik\n\n    prefix_poly[i+1] = prefix_poly[i] + current_poly\n\nThen, for the full cycles, the total is full_cycles * (prefix_nik[L] and prefix_poly[L]).\n\nAnd for the remainder, it's prefix_nik[remainder] and prefix_poly[remainder].\n\nSo the total for Nikephoros is:\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[L] + prefix_nik[remainder]\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[L] + prefix_poly[remainder]\n\nYes.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 2e9, but L is up to 1e6, this approach is feasible.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo n=7, A is \"RPS\" (length 3), B is \"RSPP\" (length 4). \n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo L=12. Let's compute for each i from 0 to 11.\n\nFor each i, compute a and b:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 11.\n\nFor example:\n\ni=0:\n\na = A[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nb = B[0%4] = B[0] = R → draw. current_nik and poly are 0.\n\ni=1:\n\na is A[1%3] = A[1] = P\n\nB[1%4] = B[1] = S → P vs S. S beats P? Wait, the rules: scissors beats paper. So S beats P. So B's move is S, which beats a's P. So B wins. So Nikephoros loses → current_nik is 1, current_poly 0.\n\nSo in this round, Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSimilarly, proceeding for all 12 rounds.\n\nBut let's check the sample input's example.\n\nThe sample input says that for 7 rounds, the output is 3 2. Let's see how this would fit.\n\nIn the first sample, the total for the cycle (L=12) would be:\n\nLet me compute the per_cycle counts.\n\nBut perhaps in the sample, n=7 is less than L=12, so full_cycles is 0, remainder is 7. So the total is the first 7 rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → S beats P → Nikephoros loses (so his count is 1).\n\nRound 3: S vs P → S beats P? Wait, the sample explanation says that in the third round, S (Nikephoros) vs P (Polycarpus). Wait, S beats P, so Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So in that round, Nikephoros's loss count is 0, and Polycarpus's is 1.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the first round is round 1 (probably 1-based?), but in our code, the rounds are 0-based.\n\nBut perhaps the sample explanation is for rounds 1-7. Let me recheck.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7.\n\nA is RPS (m=3), B is RSPP (k=4).\n\nSo for each round 0 to 6 (since n=7, remainder is 7):\n\nLet me compute the rounds:\n\nRound 0: i=0 → A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw.\n\nRound 1: i=1 → A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S. P vs S: S beats P → B wins. So Nikephoros loses → nik +=1.\n\nRound 2: i=2 → A[2%3] = S, B[2%4] = P. S vs P: S beats P → A wins. So Polycarpus loses → poly +=1.\n\nRound 3: i=3 → A[3%3=0] = R, B[3%4=3] = P. R vs P → P beats R → B wins. Nikephoros loses → nik +=1.\n\nRound 4: i=4 → A[4%3=1] = P, B[4%4=0] = R. P vs R → P beats R → A wins → poly +=1.\n\nRound 5: i=5 → A[5%3=2] = S, B[5%4=1] = S. Draw. No change.\n\nRound 6: i=6 → A[6%3=0] = R, B[6%4=2] = P. R vs P → B wins. Nikephoros loses → nik +=1.\n\nSo total for the first 7 rounds:\n\nNikephoros's losses: rounds 1,3,6 → 3 times.\n\nPolycarpus's losses: rounds 2,4 → 2 times. Which matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nSo according to the code, for L=12, the first 7 rounds would have prefix_nik[7] = 3 and prefix_poly[7] = 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that case.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich outputs 0 0.\n\nBecause all rounds are R vs R → draws. So no losses.\n\nSo code would compute L = LCM(8,1) = 8. For each round, the moves are R vs R. So all prefix_nik and prefix_poly are zero. So for n=5, full_cycles = 0, remainder=5. So total is 0 and 0.\n\nSo code works here.\n\nNow, what about when n is larger than L?\n\nFor example, suppose n is 13, L is 12. Then full_cycles = 1 (13//12=1), remainder is 1. So the total is (per_cycle_nik * 1) + prefix_nik[1], etc.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, the code needs to read the input. The input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A.\n\nThird line contains sequence B.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem statement, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, but that's probably a mistake. The actual input is three lines: first line is n, second line is A, third line is B.\n\nSo in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich is the first sample.\n\nSo in Python, the code should read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut the code must read from stdin.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nBut first, compute LCM(m, k). Let's implement that.\n\nIn Python, the math.gcd function can be used. However, note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of the inputs. So for positive integers, it's okay.\n\nSo:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut for m and k.\n\nOnce that is done, compute L = lcm(m, k).\n\nThen, create the prefix arrays.\n\nBut for L up to 1e6, and m and k up to 1e3, this is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nCompute L = lcm(m, k).\n\nThen, create prefix_nik and prefix_poly arrays of size L+1.\n\nInitialize them to 0.\n\nThen, for i in 0 to L-1:\n\ncompute a and b.\n\nCheck if a == b.\n\nElse check if a beats b.\n\nThen, compute current_nik and current_poly.\n\nThen, prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + current_nik\n\nSame for prefix_poly.\n\nOnce that is done, compute full_cycles = n // L\n\nremainder = n % L\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[L] + prefix_nik[remainder]\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[L] + prefix_poly[remainder]\n\nprint(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the code would compute for L=12, full_cycles = 7//12 = 0, remainder=7. Then, prefix_nik[7] is 3, prefix_poly[7] is 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase when n is 0? But according to the problem statement, n >= 1.\n\nAnother case when m=1 and k=1. Then L=1. So for each round, same as the single element. So for n= any number, the per_cycle counts are computed once, multiplied by n.\n\nAnother case when the sequences are such that all rounds are draws. Then, the output is 0 0.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for very large L (like 1e6), the code may take some time, but for Python, 1e6 iterations are manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    L = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n    # Precompute prefix arrays\n\n    prefix_nik = [0]*(L+1)\n\n    prefix_poly = [0]*(L+1)\n\n    for i in range(L):\n\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n\n            current_nik = 0\n\n            current_poly = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            # Determine who wins\n\n            if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n\n                # A wins, so B loses. So Nikephoros (A) is winner, so Polycarpus (B) gets a spot.

Let's test that.\n\nIn code:\n\nm=3, k=4. LCM(3,4)=12. So L=12.\n\nThe code computes for i from 0 to 11.\n\nAs discussed earlier, for the first 7 rounds, the code gives prefix_nik[7] = 3, prefix_poly[7] = 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo n=5, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). LCM(8,1) = 8. For each round in 0..7:\n\nA's move is R (since i%8 is 0..7, but A is all R. B's move is R (since i%1 is 0 for all i. So all rounds are R vs R. So prefix_nik and prefix_poly are all 0. So for n=5, remainder is 5, so total is 0 and 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is R, B is S. So LCM(1,1)=1. For i=0, a is R, b is S. A wins. So poly gets 1. So total is 0 (Nikephoros's loss) and 1 (Poly's loss). So output is 0 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1, A is S, B is R. Then, B wins. So Nikephoros loses. Output is 1 0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, considering that for very large L (like 1e6), the code may take some time, but since the constraints are acceptable (m and k up to 1e3, LCM up to 1e6), it's manageable.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their own sequences. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results for a potentially very large number of rounds (up to 2 billion) without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k` rounds. This LCM value, denoted as `L`, allows us to break down the problem into manageable segments.\n3. **Precompute Results**: For each round within one full cycle (`L` rounds), precompute the number of losses for each player. This helps avoid redundant calculations for repeated cycles.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Using the precomputed results, calculate the total number of losses by considering the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds after these full cycles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    L = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    prefix_nik = [0] * (L + 1)\n    prefix_poly = [0] * (L + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            current_nik = 0\n            current_poly = 0\n        else:\n            if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n               (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n               (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n                current_nik = 0\n                current_poly = 1\n            else:\n                current_nik = 1\n                current_poly = 0\n        \n        prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + current_nik\n        prefix_poly[i+1] = prefix_poly[i] + current_poly\n    \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    remainder = n % L\n    \n    total_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[L] + prefix_nik[remainder]\n    total_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[L] + prefix_poly[remainder]\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences of moves for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the length of the repeating cycle of moves.\n3. **Prefix Arrays**: Two arrays, `prefix_nik` and `prefix_poly`, are used to store cumulative counts of losses for each player over the cycle length `L`.\n4. **Cycle Processing**: For each round within the cycle, determine the moves of both players and update the prefix arrays based on the outcome of each round.\n5. **Final Calculation**: Calculate the total number of losses by considering the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds after these cycles, using the precomputed prefix arrays for efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle up to 2 billion rounds efficiently by leveraging cycle detection and precomputation, avoiding the need for brute-force simulation of each round.",
