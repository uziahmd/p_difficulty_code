The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, we can't simulate each round directly. So we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the approach. Both players have their own sequences that repeat cyclically. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then, check who wins and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can calculate the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of full cycles, then add the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of A and B. Let's call it LCM(m, k). Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the pattern of moves for both players will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the sequences are cyclic. So for each round i, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k]. So the combination of moves depends on the positions in their respective sequences.\n\nSo the idea is that the pattern of outcomes between the two players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. So if we can compute the number of losses for each player in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, then multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the results from the remaining rounds (n mod LCM(m, k)).\n\nBut first, let's calculate the LCM. To compute LCM(a, b), we can use the formula LCM(a, b) = a * b / GCD(a, b). So we need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive here, it's fine.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, let's call it cycle_length. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length, and the remaining rounds is remainder = n % cycle_length.\n\nSo for each full cycle, we can precompute how many times Nikephoros loses (count_n) and Polycarpus loses (count_p). Then, multiply those counts by total_cycles. Then, for the remaining remainder rounds, simulate each round and add the counts.\n\nBut how do we compute count_n and count_p for one cycle?\n\nFor each round in 0 to cycle_length - 1, we can compute the moves of A and B. Then determine who wins. For each such round, we can accumulate the counts.\n\nBut cycle_length could be up to m*k. Since m and k are up to 1000, their product is up to 1e6. So for each cycle, we need to process up to 1e6 rounds. Which is acceptable, because even for n up to 2e9, the per-cycle processing is manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n\n- Precompute for each of the cycle_length rounds, the number of times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses in that cycle.\n\n- Then, total_n = total_cycles * count_n + count_in_remainder_n.\n\nSame for total_p.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute for each of the cycle_length rounds, the outcome.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute for each round i (from 0 to cycle_length-1) what the moves are.\n\nFor each i, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nThen, compare the two moves and determine who wins.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to cycle_length-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nCheck the outcome between a and b.\n\nSo for each of these, we can compute whether Nikephoros wins, loses, or draw.\n\nSo for each such pair, we can determine if Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus gets a spot), or vice versa.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n, then read A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute the LCM of m and k.\n\nThen, compute for the cycle_length rounds, the counts.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM?\n\nImplementing LCM:\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\nThen, lcm = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\nBut in Python, there's math.gcd, but note that in Python versions before 3.5, math.gcd may not be available. However, assuming that the code is written for Python 3.5+, we can use math.gcd.\n\nBut since the code needs to be written in Python, perhaps using math.gcd is okay.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, then:\n\ncycle_length = lcm.\n\nNow, for the full cycles:\n\nfull_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nremainder_rounds = n % cycle_length\n\nSo, for each full cycle, we have count_n and count_p.\n\nThen, for the remainder_rounds, we need to simulate each round from 0 to remainder_rounds-1, and compute the counts.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nCompute the counts for one cycle (count_n_cycle, count_p_cycle).\n\nThen, total_n = full_cycles * count_n_cycle + count_n_remainder.\n\nSame for p.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute count_n_cycle and count_p_cycle.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can loop over each i from 0 to cycle_length - 1:\n\nfor i in range(cycle_length):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    determine outcome.\n\nBut with cycle_length up to 1e6, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, how to determine the outcome between a and b.\n\nThe rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beats paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nIf same, draw.\n\nSo for a and b:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a, b) is (R, S) or (S, P) or (P, R): then a wins, so Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, and Polycarpus's is +1? Wait no. Wait, the problem says the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so his count increases by 1. If Nikephoros loses, then his count increases by 1.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check if Nikephoros loses, which would add 1 to his count. Or if Polycarpus loses, add 1 to his count.\n\nSo for each a and b:\n\nif a wins: then Polycarpus loses. So Nikephoros's loss count is 0, and Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nif b wins: Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1, and Polycarpus's count is 0.\n\nif draw: nothing.\n\nSo how to code this.\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b, and returns (n_loss, p_loss) where n_loss is 1 if Nikephoros loses, else 0. Similarly for p_loss.\n\nAlternatively, for each a and b, determine who wins.\n\nLet me think:\n\nif a == b: (0, 0)\n\nelse:\n\nif (a, b) is in the set of winning combinations for a:\n\nthen Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. So (0, 1).\n\nElse, Nikephoros loses, so (1, 0).\n\nSo what are the winning combinations for a?\n\nWinning combinations for a:\n\na is R and b is S.\n\na is S and b is P.\n\na is P and b is R.\n\nSo, for a and b, if (a, b) is one of those three, then Nikephoros wins. Otherwise, if they are different, then Polycarpus wins.\n\nSo, for example, if a is R and b is P: then b wins (paper beats rock). So Nikephoros loses.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    # check if a wins\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return (0, 1)  # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses. So Nikephoros's count (his losses) is 0, Polycarpus's count is +1.\n\n    else:\n\n        return (1, 0)  # Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\nSo for each round, we can compute this.\n\nOnce that is done, for the cycle_length rounds, we can compute the sum of n_loss and p_loss.\n\nOnce we have that, multiply by full_cycles, then compute the same for the remainder_rounds.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A as a string.\n\nRead B as a string.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute the LCM of m and k.\n\ncycle_length = lcm.\n\nCompute for each i in 0 to cycle_length-1:\n\nsum_n_cycle += n_loss for that round.\n\nsum_p_cycle += p_loss for that round.\n\nThen, full_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\nremainder = n % cycle_length.\n\nThen, compute sum_n_remainder and sum_p_remainder by looping through 0 to remainder-1, and for each i, compute the outcome.\n\nTotal_n = full_cycles * sum_n_cycle + sum_n_remainder.\n\nTotal_p = full_cycles * sum_p_cycle + sum_p_remainder.\n\nBut wait, for the remainder rounds, we need to process each of the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut how to compute that? For example, if remainder is 3, then for i in 0,1,2.\n\nSo, for the remainder, we can loop from 0 to remainder-1, and for each i, compute the moves and the outcome.\n\nNow, the problem is that for very large n, but since the cycle_length is up to 1e6, and the remainder is up to cycle_length-1, which is 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\" (length 3), B is \"RSPP\" (length 4). LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo cycle_length is 12.\n\nThen, for each of 12 rounds, compute the outcome.\n\nBut the sample input has 7 rounds. So full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, remainder = 7.\n\nSo the code will process the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the output is 3 and 2.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet's compute the first 7 rounds.\n\nRound 0:\n\ni=0:\n\nA[0%3] = A[0] = R.\n\nB[0%4] = B[0] = R. Draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1: i=1.\n\nA[1%3] = A[1] = P.\n\nB[1%4] = B[1] = S.\n\nP vs S. S beats P? Wait, S is scissors, P is paper. Scissors beats paper. So B's move is S, which beats A's P. So Nikephoros loses. So (1,0).\n\nSo Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 2: i=2.\n\nA[2%3] = S. B[2%4] = P.\n\nS vs P: S beats P. So Nikephoros wins. So (0,1). Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 3: i=3.\n\nA[3%3=0] = R. B[3%4=3] = P. R vs P: P beats R. Nikephoros loses. (1,0).\n\nRound 4: i=4. A[4%3=1] = P. B[4%4=0] = R. P vs R: P beats R. Nikephoros wins. (0,1).\n\nRound 5: i=5. A[5%3=2] = S. B[5%4=1] = S. Draw. (0,0).\n\nRound 6: i=6. A[6%3=0] = R. B[6%4=2] = P. R vs P: Nikephoros loses. (1,0).\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds, the counts are:\n\nNikephoros's losses: rounds 1,3,6: total 3.\n\nPolycarpus's losses: rounds 2,4: total 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would compute for the cycle_length=12 rounds, but in this case, since n=7 is less than 12, full_cycles is 0, and the remainder is 7.\n\nSo the code would process 7 rounds.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nThe second example input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). LCM(8,1) is 8.\n\nFor each round in 0-7:\n\nA[i%8] is R, B[i%1] is R. All draws. So for any number of rounds, the counts are 0 and 0. Hence, output is 0 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut for very large n (up to 2e9), but the cycle_length is up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000, their product is up to 1e6). So for the code, even with 1e6 iterations, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n from input. But note that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nWait, in the example given in the problem, the input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in formatting. Probably the actual input is:\n\nThe first line is n, then the second line is A, third line is B.\n\nSo in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nBut the second input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo the code should read n, then A, then B.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nimport sys, math.\n\nBut for the code, the input can be read via input(). However, sometimes when reading from stdin, it's better to read all lines at once. But for the purposes of code submission, perhaps:\n\nRead n as int(input())\n\nThen A = input().strip()\n\nThen B = input().strip()\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        while b:\n\n            a, b = b, a % b\n\n        return a\n\n    g = gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = (m * k) // g\n\n    # Now compute for each of the lcm rounds, the counts.\n\n    # Initialize counts for one cycle\n\n    count_n_cycle = 0\n\n    count_p_cycle = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        # Determine outcome\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            pass\n\n        else:\n\n            # Check if a wins\n\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n                # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (count_p_cycle +=1)\n\n                count_p_cycle +=1\n\n            else:\n\n                # Nikephoros loses, count_n_cycle +=1\n\n                count_n_cycle +=1\n\n    # Now compute full_cycles and remainder\n\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n\n    remainder = n % lcm\n\n    # total_n = full_cycles * count_n_cycle + count_n_remainder\n\n    # same for p\n\n    # Now compute the remainder part\n\n    count_n_remainder = 0\n\n    count_p_remainder = 0\n\n    for i in range(remainder):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            pass\n\n        else:\n\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n                count_p_remainder +=1\n\n            else:\n\n                count_n_remainder +=1\n\n    total_n = full_cycles * count_n_cycle + count_n_remainder\n\n    total_p = full_cycles * count_p_cycle + count_p_remainder\n\n    print(total_n, total_p)\n\nBut wait, in the code above, for the remainder rounds, the code loops from 0 to remainder-1, which is correct.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nn=7, m=3, k=4. lcm is 12.\n\nfull_cycles = 7//12 = 0. remainder =7.\n\ncount_n_cycle is the sum for 12 rounds. But in the first sample, the code would compute for 12 rounds. But in the sample, the first 7 rounds are processed in the remainder part.\n\nBut for the first sample, the code would compute count_n_cycle as the number of times Nikephoros loses in 12 rounds. However, since the remainder is 7, the code would process 7 rounds in the remainder part.\n\nBut in the sample, the code's remainder part would process 7 rounds, which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the count_n_cycle and count_p_cycle are for the entire cycle of lcm rounds. However, when full_cycles is zero, the code uses the remainder part.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the remainder is zero? Then, the remainder part is zero rounds, so no processing needed.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut let's check for the first sample.\n\nIn the first sample, the code for the remainder part (7 rounds) would process 0-6 (i from 0 to 6). Which is the same as the sample's 7 rounds.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly equal to lcm.\n\nThen, remainder is zero, and the code uses full_cycles = 1, and the remainder part is zero. So the total is count_n_cycle and count_p_cycle.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase when m=1 and k=1. So LCM is 1. For each round, the same moves. So for n=2e9, the code would compute full_cycles = 2e9, and the counts per cycle is 0 (if same) or 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when A and B have sequences that result in all draws. Then both counts are zero.\n\nAnother case: when one sequence is longer than the other, but their LCM is big.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut let's check the code for the second sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\nn=5\n\nA is RRRRRRRR (length 8)\n\nB is R (length 1)\n\nlcm(8,1)=8.\n\ncount_n_cycle: for 8 rounds, each round A is R, B is R. So all draws. So count_n_cycle and count_p_cycle are zero.\n\nfull_cycles =5//8=0, remainder=5. So for the remainder part, 5 rounds, same as above. So counts are zero. Output 0 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is R, B is S. Then, a is R, b is S. a wins, so Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus has 1 spot. So output is 0 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is S, B is R. Then, B wins. So Nikephoros loses. Output 1 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, for very large numbers, the code may take some time, but since the loop for the cycle is up to 1e6 steps, and the remainder is up to 1e6 steps, it's acceptable.\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, the LCM can be up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code above, the code for the 'gcd' function is inside the main function. But in Python, that's okay.\n\nWait, but the code for the gcd is inside the main function. But the code for the gcd is written as:\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\nBut in Python, that's okay.\n\nBut perhaps using math.gcd would be better. However, note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nBut for Python versions where math.gcd exists, but for code submission, perhaps better to use math.gcd.\n\nWait, but in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists, but for the code, perhaps it's better to use math.gcd.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = (m * k) // g\n\n    # Now compute for each of the lcm rounds, the counts.\n\n    count_n_cycle = 0\n\n    count_p_cycle = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        # Determine outcome\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            pass\n\n        else:\n\n            # Check if a wins\n\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n                # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (count_p_cycle +=1)\n\n                count_p_cycle +=1\n\n            else:\n\n                # Nikephoros loses, count_n_cycle +=1\n\n                count_n_cycle +=1\n\n    # Now compute full_cycles and remainder\n\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n\n    remainder = n % lcm\n\n    # Now compute the remainder part\n\n    count_n_remainder = 0\n\n    count_p_remainder = 0\n\n    for i in range(remainder):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            pass\n\n        else:\n\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n                count_p_remainder +=1\n\n            else:\n\n                count_n_remainder +=1\n\n    total_n = full_cycles * count_n_cycle + count_n_remainder\n\n    total_p = full_cycles * count_p_cycle + count_p_remainder\n\n    print(total_n, total_p)\n\nBut in the code above, when using math.gcd, but in some cases, when m or k is 0? No, because the constraints say 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input again. The first sample input:\n\nn=7\n\nA=RPS (len 3)\n\nB=RSPP (len 4)\n\nlcm is 12.\n\ncount_n_cycle is the number of times Nikephoros loses in 12 rounds.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nBut for the first 12 rounds, let's see:\n\nFor each i from 0 to 11.\n\nBut I think that in the code, for the first sample, the count_n_cycle and count_p_cycle would be computed for 12 rounds.\n\nBut the code would then multiply by full_cycles (which is 0) and add the remainder part (7 rounds) which gives the correct answer.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, where each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible due to the potential size of the input. Instead, we leverage the periodic nature of the sequences to optimize our solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use sequences that repeat cyclically. This means their moves repeat every length of their respective sequences.\n2. **Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every LCM of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute results for one full cycle and then scale it up.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: Calculate the number of losses for each player within one full cycle of the LCM length. This helps in efficiently computing the total losses over a large number of rounds by using the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = (m * k) // g\n    \n    count_n_cycle = 0\n    count_p_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            count_p_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            count_n_cycle += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    count_n_remainder = 0\n    count_p_remainder = 0\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            count_p_remainder += 1\n        else:\n            count_n_remainder += 1\n    \n    total_n = full_cycles * count_n_cycle + count_n_remainder\n    total_p = full_cycles * count_p_cycle + count_p_remainder\n    \n    print(total_n, total_p)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B` for Nikephoros and Polycarpus respectively.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` determines the period after which the combined sequence of moves repeats.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round within one LCM period, we determine the outcome of each round and count the losses for both players.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: We calculate the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds after these cycles. Using the precomputed counts from one cycle, we multiply by the number of full cycles and add the results from the remaining rounds to get the total losses for each player.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
