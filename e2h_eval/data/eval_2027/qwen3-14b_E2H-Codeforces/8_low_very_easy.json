Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo the problem is about assigning directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the flow is valid. The given flows are already determined, and we just have to assign directions. The conditions are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So it's a conservation of flow condition.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The resulting directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the constraints. The key here is that the directed graph must be acyclic. Also, the flow conservation holds for all intermediate nodes. Since the original graph is connected, and the solution exists, perhaps there's a way to model this as a DAG with certain properties.\n\nWait, the problem says that the flow is a maximum flow. But maybe that's not directly relevant here. The problem gives us the flow values, and we just need to assign directions such that the flow is valid and the graph is acyclic.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For any node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows going into it must equal the sum going out. Which implies that the net flow at v is zero. So, if we think of each edge's direction as contributing to the net flow, then for each such node, the total incoming equals outgoing.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow is conserved.\n\nBut how to ensure that the graph is acyclic? Well, maybe we can arrange the nodes in some topological order. For example, if we can assign directions such that all edges go from earlier nodes in the order to later ones, then the graph is acyclic. That would satisfy the no-cycles condition.\n\nSo, perhaps the idea is to find a topological order of the nodes, and then direct each edge from the node that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. But how to choose this order such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, since the source (node 1) has no incoming edges, perhaps we can build a DAG where node 1 is the first in the topological order, and the sink (node n) is last. Then, all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later ones. But how to ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nWait, but the flow conservation is about the sum of incoming and outgoing flows. Let's think in terms of the net flow. For each node v (other than source and sink), the net flow (sum of outgoing minus incoming) must be zero. But since the edges are directed, for each edge, if it's directed from u to v, then the flow contributes +c to u's outgoing and +c to v's incoming. So for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed out of v minus the sum of flows on edges directed into v must be zero. Except for source and sink.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of each edge as contributing to the net flow of the nodes. For example, if we have an edge between u and v, and we direct it from u to v, then u's net flow increases by c (since it's outgoing) and v's net flow decreases by c (since it's incoming). Wait, no. The net flow for a node is (outgoing) - (incoming). So for a directed edge u→v, the outgoing of u increases by c, and the incoming of v increases by c. So the net flow for u is increased by c, and for v it's decreased by c. \n\nBut for the intermediate nodes, their net flow must be zero. So, the sum of all edges directed out of a node minus the sum directed into it must be zero. Which is equivalent to the sum of all flows on edges directed out of the node equals the sum of flows on edges directed into the node.\n\nBut how can we assign directions to edges to satisfy this?\n\nAnother thought: The problem resembles building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal inflow and outflow. This is similar to the flow conservation in a flow network, but here the flows are fixed and we're only choosing directions.\n\nBut since the flow is already a maximum flow (as per the problem statement), maybe the given flows already satisfy that the total flow from source to sink is correct. However, the problem says that the flow is correct, but we just need to assign directions.\n\nLet me think of this as a directed graph. For each edge, the direction is chosen so that the flow conservation holds for intermediate nodes. But how?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as building a directed acyclic graph (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to assign directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies flow conservation conditions for all intermediate nodes, ensures the source node has no incoming edges, and the graph remains acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Topological Ordering**: We can use a topological sort to ensure the graph is acyclic. By assigning directions from earlier nodes to later nodes in the topological order, we avoid cycles.\n2. **Flow Conservation**: For each intermediate node (excluding the source and sink), the sum of flows entering the node must equal the sum of flows exiting the node. This can be achieved by ensuring that the net flow at each intermediate node is zero.\n3. **BFS Traversal**: Starting from the source node, we perform a BFS traversal to assign directions to edges. This ensures that edges are directed away from the source and maintain acyclicity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        a = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        b = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        c = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        adj[a].append((b, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, i))\n\n    # We need to assign directions such that the graph is acyclic and flow conservation holds.\n    # We can build a DAG with topological order, starting from node 1.\n    # Use BFS to assign directions, ensuring that each edge is directed from parent to child in the BFS tree.\n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n    direction = [0] * m  # 0 means original direction (ai -> bi), 1 means reversed.\n\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(1)\n    visited[1] = True\n\n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        for (v, idx) in adj[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                parent[v] = u\n                # The edge is between u and v.
