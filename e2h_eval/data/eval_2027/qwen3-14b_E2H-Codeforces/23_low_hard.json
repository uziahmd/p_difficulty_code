In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimal number of draws required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. The output for each case is the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nSo for each of the three cases given in the input, I have to compute the answer.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each set of three tiles, I need to check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to make it possible.\n\nBut how do I check if a set of tiles can form a mentsu, possibly after adding some tiles?\n\nWait, the problem says that after drawing extra tiles, she can have a mentsu. So the total tiles after adding will be 3 + k, where k is the number of drawn tiles. But the mentsu requires exactly three tiles. So the idea is that among all the tiles she has (original plus drawn), there must be a subset of three that form a mentsu. However, the problem says that she can draw any tiles she wants. So the question is, what's the minimal k such that adding k tiles allows her to have a mentsu.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think. For the original three tiles, maybe they can form a mentsu with some additional tiles. For example, if she has two tiles of the same suit and number, then adding another same tile would make a triplet. Or if she has two consecutive numbers in the same suit, adding one more to complete the sequence.\n\nBut the problem is that the original three tiles may not form a mentsu, but with adding some tiles, they can. So I need to check all possibilities of possible mentsu that can be formed by adding some tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nSo the approach is: for the given three tiles, check all possible ways to form a mentsu, and calculate the minimal number of tiles needed to reach that.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: The three tiles already form a mentsu. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: They can form a mentsu by adding 1 tile. For example, if two tiles are part of a triplet, and adding one more. Or if two tiles are consecutive in a sequence, and adding one more.\n\nCase 3: Need to add two tiles. For example, if the three tiles can form a triplet with two additions, or a sequence with two additions.\n\nBut what's the minimal possible? Let's think.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nOtherwise, check if there's a way to form a mentsu by adding one tile. If yes, return 1.\n\nIf not, check if it's possible with two tiles. Return 2.\n\nBut wait, is there a case where you need to add three tiles? Let's think. Suppose the three tiles are all different suits and numbers, so no way to form a triplet or sequence. Then, adding three tiles could form a triplet. For example, if the original three are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then adding three tiles of 1m would make a triplet. But that's three additions. However, perhaps there's a better way. Wait, but what's the minimal possible?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer can't be more than 2? Or maybe?\n\nWait, let's think of the worst case. Suppose the three tiles are all different suits and numbers. For example, 1m, 2p, 3s. How can we get a mentsu?\n\nOption 1: Form a triplet. We need three of the same tile. So, for example, add two more 1m tiles. Then the three tiles would be 1m, 1m, 1m. So that's adding two tiles. So the answer is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe forming a sequence. But since the original three are in different suits, adding tiles to form a sequence would require adding two tiles. For example, suppose I want to form a sequence in m. So the original has 1m. Need to add 2m and 3m. That's two tiles. So the answer is 2. So in this case, the answer is 2.\n\nAnother example: suppose the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, adding a 3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current hand of three tiles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Immediate Mentsu**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid mentsu. If they do, no additional tiles are needed.\n2. **Check for Possible Triplet Formation**: If the three tiles can form a triplet with one additional tile, the answer is 1. If they can form a triplet with two additional tiles, the answer is 2.\n3. **Check for Possible Sequence Formation**: If the three tiles can form a sequence with one additional tile, the answer is 1. If they can form a sequence with two additional tiles, the answer is 2.\n4. **Handle Edge Cases**: If none of the above conditions are met, the minimum number of tiles needed is determined by checking all possible combinations of adding tiles to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_triplet(tiles):\n    return tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]\n\ndef is_sequence(tiles):\n    # Check if all suits are the same\n    if tiles[0][1] != tiles[1][1] or tiles[0][1] != tiles[2][1]:\n        return False\n    # Extract numbers and sort\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n    return nums[0] + 1 == nums[1] and nums[1] + 1 == nums[2]\n\ndef min_draws(tiles):\n    # Check if already has a mentsu\n    if is_triplet(tiles) or is_sequence(tiles):\n        return 0\n\n    # Check if can form a triplet with one more tile\n    count = {}\n    for t in tiles:\n        count[t] = count.get(t, 0) + 1\n    for t in count:\n        if count[t] == 2:\n            return 1  # need one more to make triplet\n\n    # Check if can form a sequence with one more tile\n    suits = set(t[1] for t in tiles)\n    if len(suits) == 1:\n        nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n        # Check for possible sequences\n        # For example, [1,2,3] is already a sequence, but we have it already checked\n        # Now check if there's a way to add one tile to complete a sequence\n        # Check if there's a gap of 1 between any two numbers\n        if (nums[1] - nums[0] == 1 and nums[2] - nums[1] == 2):\n            return 1  # need nums[1]+1\n        if (nums[1] - nums[0] == 2 and nums[2] - nums[1] == 1):\n            return 1  # need nums[0]+1\n        if (nums[1] - nums[0] == 1 and nums[2] - nums[1] == 1):\n            return 0  # already a sequence\n        if (nums[0] == nums[1] - 1 and nums[1] == nums[2] - 2):\n            return 1  # need nums[2]-1\n        if (nums[0] == nums[1] - 2 and nums[1] == nums[2] - 1):\n            return 1  # need nums[0]+1\n        if nums[0] == nums[1] - 1 and nums[2] - nums[1] == 2:\n            return 1  # need nums[1]+1\n        if nums[1] - nums[0] == 2 and nums[2] - nums[1] == 2:\n            return 1  # need nums[0]+1\n        # If all other cases, maybe not possible with one\n    else:\n        # Check if any two are same suit\n        same_suit = None\n        for t in tiles:\n            if same_suit is None:\n                same_suit = t[1]\n            elif t[1] == same_suit:\n                pass\n            else:\n                same_suit = None\n                break\n        if same_suit is not None:\n            nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n            # Check if the two numbers are consecutive or can form a sequence with one\n            # For example, if two numbers are 1 and 2, need 3\n            # Or 1 and 3, need 2\n            # Or 2 and 3, need 1\n            if nums[0] + 1 == nums[1]:\n                return 1  # need nums[1] + 1\n            elif nums[0] + 2 == nums[1]:\n                return 1  # need nums[0] + 1\n            elif nums[1] + 1 == nums[2]:\n                return 1  # need nums[0] + 1\n            elif nums[1] + 2 == nums[2]:\n                return 1  # need nums[1] + 1\n            elif nums[0] + 1 == nums[2]:\n                return 1  # need nums[0] + 1 or nums[2] - 1\n            else:\n                pass\n\n    # If not possible with one, check if possible with two\n    # For triplet: need two more tiles of same type\n    # For sequence: need to have two numbers in a row, and need one more\n    # Or other possibilities\n    # For example, if there are two different suits, but can form a sequence with two additions\n    # But this part is complex, so we can assume that the minimal is 2 if not possible with 1\n    # However, let's think again\n\n    # If the above checks didn't find anything, then the minimal is 2\n    # Because even in worst case, you can add two tiles to form a triplet\n    return 2\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    cases = input.split('], ')\n    for case in cases:\n        case = case.strip().replace('[', '').replace(']', '')\n        if not case:\n            continue\n        tiles = case.split()\n        # Process each case\n        # Check if the input is in the format like ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', ...]\n        # So split the input into individual tile strings\n        # Wait, the original input is given as three strings.
