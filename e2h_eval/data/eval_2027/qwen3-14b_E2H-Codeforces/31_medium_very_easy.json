Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need to find the minimal number of such cards required.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimal number of cards needed to sum up to T, where each card's value is between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers in that range, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the absolute value of T. Because if T is positive, we can use positive numbers; if it's negative, use negatives. But since the problem allows any combination, maybe the minimal number depends on how much T is and the maximum allowed per card.\n\nFor example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Each card can contribute up to 2. So the minimal number is ceil(5/2) = 3 (since 2+2+1=5). Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Wait, but each card can be as high as x. So for T, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of (abs(T)/x). But wait, let's think:\n\nSuppose T is 5, x is 2. The maximum per card is 2. So 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, so ceiling is 3. Which would be 2+2+1. So yes, 3 cards.\n\nBut what if T is 4 and x is 2? Then 4/2 is 2, so two cards. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, so ceiling is 2. Which is 2 + 1. So two cards.\n\nSo the general formula seems to be that the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, maybe there's a case where even if you have some remainder, you can adjust with one card. Let me think again.\n\nWait, suppose T is 6, x is 3. Then 6/3 is exactly 2. So two cards. That's correct.\n\nIf T is 7 and x is 3. 7/3 is 2.333..., so ceiling is 3. 3+3+1=7. So three cards. Correct.\n\nBut what if T is 0? Then no cards are needed. So that's a special case.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards. Let's call it sum_found.\n\n2. The target T is -sum_found. If T is zero, return 0.\n\n3. Otherwise, compute the absolute value of T, say abs_T.\n\n4. The minimal number of cards is ceil( abs_T / x ), but wait, perhaps not. Wait, because each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number is the ceiling of (abs_T / x). But wait, let's think about when abs_T is divisible by x. For example, if abs_T is 4, x is 2. 4/2=2. So two cards. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if abs_T is 5 and x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666..., so ceiling is 2. Which would be 3 + 2 = 5. So two cards. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula is ceil( abs_T / x ). But how to compute that in Python?\n\nIn Python, we can compute it as (abs_T + x - 1) // x. Because for example, 5 +3-1 =7, 7//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCompute sum_found. Then T = -sum_found. If T is zero, answer is 0. Else, compute abs_T = abs(T). Then the answer is (abs_T + x -1 ) // x.\n\nWait, but let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2. abs_T is 2. x is 2. So (2 +2-1)//2 = (3)//2=1. Which matches the sample output of 1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. T is 4. abs_T is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Which matches the sample output of 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if sum_found is 0, then answer is 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum_found is 5, x is 3. T is -5. abs_T is 5. (5 +3-1)/3 =7/3=2. So 2 cards. Which would be 3 + 2 =5. Correct.\n\nWhat if sum_found is 1, x is 1. Then T is -1. abs_T is 1. (1 +1-1)/1=1/1=1. So one card. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: sum_found is 3, x is 2. T is -3. abs_T is 3. (3 +2-1)/2 =4/2=2. Which would be 2+1=3. So two cards. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_found = sum of the list.\n\nIf sum_found is zero, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute T = -sum_found.\n\nabs_T = abs(T).\n\nresult = (abs_T + x -1 ) // x\n\nOutput result.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nBut wait, let me check the input format. The input is given as two lines. First line has n and x. Second line has n integers.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of two examples. But in the actual problem, the input is read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nWhich would be read as n=3, x=2, and the list is [-1, 1, 2].\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead first line as n, x.\n\nRead second line as list of integers.\n\nCompute sum_found.\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nSo code in Python:\n\nRead input:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_found = sum(arr)\n\nif sum_found == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    t = -sum_found\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    res = (abs_t + x -1) // x\n\n    print(res)\n\nWait, but let's test the second sample input.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2\n\nsum_found is -4. So t is 4. abs_t is 4. x is 3.\n\n(4 +3-1) //3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: sum_found is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum_found is 5, x is 5. Then (5 +5-1)/5 =9//5=1. So 1 card. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum_found is 6, x is 5. Then (6 +5-1)/5 =10//5=2. Which is 5+1=6. So two cards. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's check edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, x=1, and the card is 1. sum_found is 1. t is -1. abs_t is 1. (1 +1-1)//1 =1//1=1. So output 1. Correct.\n\nEdge case 2: sum_found is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother edge case: x=1, sum_found is 3. Then (3 +1-1)/1 =3. So 3 cards. Which is 1+1+1=3. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum_found is -3, x=1. Then t is 3. Same as above.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Target Determination**: Determine the target sum needed to balance the found cards to zero. This target is the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the maximum absolute value allowed on a card (x). The formula used is `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`, which effectively computes the ceiling of the division of the absolute target by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(arr)\nif sum_found == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(-sum_found)\n    res = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is read to get the number of found cards (n) and the maximum absolute value (x). The second line contains the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more is needed to balance the total sum to zero.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target sum needed to balance the found cards is the negative of their sum.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using the formula `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`, we determine the minimum number of cards required. This formula ensures we take the ceiling of the division, which gives the minimum number of cards needed to reach the target sum using the maximum allowed value per card (x).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in constant time after reading the input, making it optimal for the given constraints.",
