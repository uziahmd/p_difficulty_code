Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that the line segments connecting each pair don't intersect. And since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible permutations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The key point is that any two line segments (from spaceship to base) must not cross each other. So for a given assignment (a matching between R and B), we need to check that all the line segments are non-intersecting.\n\nBut how do I check if two line segments intersect? Oh right, there's a computational geometry method for that. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, that might simplify things. Wait, the note says that no three points are on the same line. So when checking for intersections between two line segments, we don't have to worry about overlapping lines, but just about crossing each other.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check if R equals B. Because a perfect matching requires that the number of spaceships equals the number of bases. Oh wait, the problem says that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. So yes, R must equal B. Wait, the input says R and B can be up to 10, but the first line says R and B. So the first thing is that if R != B, then output is No. Because you can't have a perfect matching. So that's the first check.\n\nWait the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" which implies that R must equal B. So if R != B, then output No. So in the code, first check if R != B, then immediately return No.\n\nOtherwise, when R = B, we need to check if there exists a permutation of the bases (or spaceships) such that when each spaceship is connected to a base in the permutation, none of the line segments cross.\n\nSo for example, if R = B = 3, then we can generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each spaceship must be matched to exactly one base). For each permutation, check if all the line segments between spaceship i and base permutation[i] are non-intersecting.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nLet me think about the line segment intersection. For two line segments AB and CD, they intersect if the orientation of A, B, C is different from the orientation of A, B, D, and similarly for C, D, A and C, D, B. Also, need to handle cases where points are colinear but the segments overlap. However, the problem states that no three points are colinear, so that case is impossible. Because if AB and CD are colinear, then points A, B, C, D would lie on the same line, which would violate the problem's condition. Therefore, for any two line segments in our problem, they can't be colinear. So the only way they can intersect is if they cross each other, i.e., the orientations are different.\n\nSo the standard line segment intersection check can be used here, with the knowledge that no three points are colinear, so we don't have to handle the case where the segments are colinear and overlapping.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each possible permutation of the bases (since R=B), check if all the line segments between the i-th spaceship and the permuted base do not intersect with each other.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations? Since R can be up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! which is 3.6 million. Wait 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments for intersection. For each permutation, there are R*(R-1)/2 pairs of line segments. For R=10, that's 45 pairs. For each pair, we check if they intersect.\n\nSo total operations would be 3.6 million * 45 = around 163 million operations. That's acceptable for Python? Well, considering that each check is simple, perhaps. But maybe for R=10, it's manageable.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that R and B are up to 10. So for R=10, the code may take some time, but since the constraints are small, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCheck if R != B: output No.\n\nElse:\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible matching between spaceships and bases).\n\nFor each permutation, check if all pairs of line segments (spaceship i to base permutation[i]) do not intersect.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies this, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement the line segment intersection check.\n\nSo first, I need to write a function that takes two line segments (each as two points) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nHow to implement that?\n\nThe standard approach is to compute the orientation of three points.\n\nOrientation function: for three points p, q, r, returns 0 if colinear, 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise.\n\nBut since the problem says that no three points are colinear, we don't have to handle the 0 case.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input ensures that no three points are colinear. So when checking for two line segments, their endpoints are all distinct, and no three are colinear. So for two line segments AB and CD, the four points are all distinct and no three are colinear.\n\nTherefore, the line segments AB and CD can only intersect if they cross each other, i.e., the orientations of A, B, C and A, B, D are different, and the orientations of C, D, A and C, D, B are different.\n\nSo the function to check if two segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    # returns True if AB and CD intersect\n\n    def orientation(p, q, r):\n\n        # returns 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise\n\n        val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1]-p[1]) - (q[1]-p[1])*(r[0]-p[0])\n\n        if val == 0:\n\n            return 0  # colinear, but problem says this can't happen\n\n        return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # if the orientations are different for both pairs, then they intersect\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but what about cases where one of the segments' endpoints lies on the other segment? For example, if AB is a segment, and C is on AB. But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. So if C is on AB, then A, B, C are colinear, which is not allowed. Hence, such cases cannot exist. Therefore, the above function is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the function can be implemented as such.\n\nNow, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments. For example, for the permutation [b1, b2, b3], we have line segments (s1, b1), (s2, b2), (s3, b3). We need to check that for all i < j, the segments (s_i, b_i) and (s_j, b_j) do not intersect.\n\nSo, for each permutation, generate all pairs of segments, check if any pair intersects. If any pair does, the permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nOnce any valid permutation is found, output \"Yes\".\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read R spaceships coordinates, then B bases coordinates.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the B bases (since each permutation is a possible assignment of bases to spaceships).\n\nFor each permutation, check all pairs of segments for intersection. If none found, return Yes.\n\nIf none of the permutations work, return No.\n\nBut wait, in Python, permutations can be generated using itertools.permutations.\n\nBut note that the bases are given as a list. So for example, if the bases are stored as a list called bases, then permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut for R=B=3, the permutation would have 3 elements, and each element is a base's coordinates.\n\nNow, for each permutation, the i-th spaceship (spaceships[i]) is connected to permutation[i].\n\nSo for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments between (spaceship i, base perm[i]) and (spaceship j, base perm[j]).\n\nSo, for all i < j, check if the segments (spaceships[i], perm[i]) and (spaceships[j], perm[j]) intersect.\n\nIf any of these checks returns True, the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    # parse input\n\n    first_line = input[0].split()\n\n    R = int(first_line[0])\n\n    B = int(first_line[1])\n\n    if R != B:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        return\n\n    spaceships = []\n\n    for i in range(1, R+1):\n\n        x, y = map(int, input[i].split())\n\n        spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n\n    bases = []\n\n    for i in range(R+1, R+1 + B):\n\n        x, y = map(int, input[i].split())\n\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n\n    # Now generate all permutations of the bases\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n\n        # check all pairs of segments in this permutation\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(R):\n\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n                # check if segment (spaceships[i], perm[i]) and (spaceships[j], perm[j]) intersect\n\n                if segments_intersect(spaceships[i], perm[i], spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n\n                    valid = False\n\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if valid:\n\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut then, how to implement the segments_intersect function.\n\nImplementing that function as discussed.\n\nBut wait, the function needs to check whether two line segments AB and CD intersect. So the parameters are A, B, C, D. So in the code, for each pair of segments (spaceship i to perm[i], and spaceship j to perm[j]), we pass A = spaceships[i], B = perm[i], C = spaceships[j], D = perm[j].\n\nBut wait, the line segments are AB and CD. So the code for segments_intersect is as discussed.\n\nNow, code for the function:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    # returns True if AB and CD intersect\n\n    def orientation(p, q, r):\n\n        # returns 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise\n\n        val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1]-p[1]) - (q[1]-p[1])*(r[0]-p[0])\n\n        if val == 0:\n\n            return 0  # but according to problem statement, this can't happen\n\n        return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the segments could share an endpoint. But according to the problem statement, no two points coincide. So for example, if A is C, but the problem says that no two points are same. So AB and CD can't have overlapping endpoints. So the code is safe.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that no two points coincide. So in the input, all the spaceship positions and base positions are unique. However, in the permutation, a base could be assigned to a spaceship, but that's allowed. But in the code, for the segments between spaceship i and base perm[i], the endpoints are unique. So for two different segments, their endpoints are unique. Because each spaceship is connected to exactly one base, and each base is connected to exactly one spaceship. So the segments can't share endpoints except for the ones that are part of the same segment.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo spaceships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nIn the first example, the sample output is Yes. For example, connecting in order. Let's check if the segments between (0,0) and (-2,1), (2,0) and (0,3), (3,1) and (2,2) have any intersections.\n\nCheck between first and second segments: AB is from (0,0) to (-2,1), CD is (2,0) to (0,3). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute orientations.\n\nA=(0,0), B=(-2,1), C=(2,0), D=(0,3)\n\norientation(A,B,C): compute (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x = -2 - 0 = -2\n\nC.y - A.y = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nB.y - A.y = 1 - 0 = 1\n\nC.x - A.x = 2 - 0 = 2\n\nso value is (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2. Which is negative. So orientation is 2.\n\nThen orientation(A,B,D): D is (0,3). So compute same way.\n\nC is D here. So:\n\n(B.x - A.x) = -2, (D.y - A.y) = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\n(B.y - A.y) = 1, (D.x - A.x) = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nvalue is (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6. Negative. So orientation is 2 again. So o1 and o2 are same. So the first condition (o1 != o2) is false. So the segments AB and CD do not cross. So the code returns false.\n\nSo the code would not consider them as intersecting. So that's correct.\n\nThen check between first and third segments. AB is (0,0) to (-2,1), CD is (3,1) to (2,2). Let's see.\n\nA=(0,0), B=(-2,1), C=(3,1), D=(2,2).\n\norientation(A,B,C) is:\n\n(B.x - A.x) = -2, (C.y - A.y) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n(B.y - A.y) = 1, (C.x - A.x) = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\nvalue = (-2)*1 - 1*3 = -2 -3 = -5 <0 → orientation 2.\n\norientation(A,B,D) is:\n\nD is (2,2). So same calculation:\n\nvalue = (-2)*(2 - 0) - 1*(2 - 0) ?\n\nWait, the formula is (B.x - A.x)*(D.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(D.x - A.x).\n\nWhich is (-2)*(2 - 0) - (1)*(2 - 0) → (-2)*2 - 1*2 = -4 -2 = -6 <0 → orientation 2 again. So o1 and o2 are same. So no intersection.\n\nThen check between the second and third segments. AB is (2,0) to (0,3), CD is (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck if these two segments intersect.\n\nCompute o1: orientation of AB with C (3,1). \n\nA is (2,0), B is (0,3), C is (3,1).\n\nval = (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x = 0-2 = -2\n\nC.y - A.y = 1-0=1\n\nB.y - A.y = 3-0=3\n\nC.x - A.x = 3-2=1\n\nval = (-2)*1 - 3*1 = -2 -3 = -5 <0 → orientation 2.\n\no2: orientation of AB with D (2,2). \n\nSame A and B.\n\nval = (-2)*(2 - 0) - 3*(2 - 2) → (-2)*2 - 3*0 = -4. So again orientation 2. So o1 and o2 same. So no intersection.\n\nThus, in this permutation, all pairs of segments don't intersect, so the code returns Yes.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSecond input is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. Since R != B, output is No. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nBut what about when R=B=2, and there are two possible permutations. For example, suppose the spaceships are (0,0) and (0,1), and the bases are (1,0) and (1,1). Then the two permutations are [ (1,0), (1,1) ] and [ (1,1), (1,0) ].\n\nIn the first permutation, the segments are (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1). These are parallel lines, no intersection. So valid.\n\nIn the second permutation, the segments are (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0). These two lines cross each other. So the code would check for that.\n\nFor segments (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0):\n\nCheck orientations.\n\nA=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(0,1), D=(1,0).\n\norientation(A,B,C) is (1-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) → (1)(1) - (1)(0) = 1>0 → orientation 1.\n\norientation(A,B,D) is (1-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(1-0) → 1*0 -1*1 = -1 <0 → orientation 2. So o1 != o2.\n\nThen check orientation(C,D,A) and (C,D,B).\n\nC=(0,1), D=(1,0), A=(0,0). Compute orientation(C,D,A):\n\n(D.x - C.x) = 1-0=1, (A.y - C.y) = 0-1=-1.\n\n(D.y - C.y) = 0-1=-1, (A.x - C.x) = 0-0=0.\n\nval = (1)*(-1) - (-1)*0 = -1 - 0 = -1 <0 → orientation 2.\n\norientation(C,D,B) is (D.x - C.x)*(B.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y)*(B.x - C.x).\n\nD.x - C.x = 1-0=1.\n\nB.y - C.y = 1-1=0.\n\nD.y - C.y = -1.\n\nB.x - C.x = 1-0=1.\n\nval = 1*0 - (-1)*1 = 0 +1 = 1>0 → orientation 1.\n\nSo o3 and o4 differ. So the segments intersect. So the code returns True for this pair, which makes the permutation invalid. So the code would check that and find that the first permutation is valid, and output Yes.\n\nBut if the code checks all permutations, then in this case, the first permutation is valid, so output Yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the permutations are generated from the bases. So for R=2 and B=2, the code will generate all permutations of the bases. Each permutation is a possible assignment.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut need to make sure that the code reads the input correctly.\n\nNow, the input is given as a list of lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, no. Wait the input is given as a single string, split into lines. Wait in the sample input, the first line is '3 3', then three lines for the spaceships, then three lines for the bases. The second example is '2 1' followed by two lines for spaceships, then one line for bases.\n\nBut the code reads the input as input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines(). So for the first example, the first line is '3 3', then the next three lines are the spaceships, then the next three lines are the bases. So in code, for R=3 and B=3, the first line is parsed as R and B, then the next R lines are the spaceships, then the next B lines are the bases.\n\nBut in the code, the code for reading the spaceships is:\n\nfor i in range(1, R+1):\n\n    x, y = ... input[i]\n\nBut wait, the first line is input[0], then the next R lines are input[1], input[2], ..., input[R]. Then the next B lines are input[R+1], ..., input[R+B].\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code for reading the input is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in the code, the bases are read as for i in range(R+1, R+1 + B). Let's see: for example, R=3, B=3. Then R+1 is 4. The next B lines are input[4], input[5], input[6], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut in Python, the permutations function returns tuples of the elements. So for bases, which is a list of tuples, the permutations will be generated as tuples of those tuples. So for each perm in permutations(bases), perm is a tuple of the base points.\n\nNow, the code for checking the segments.\n\nNow, the code for segments_intersect is written as a helper function.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut in Python, functions inside functions can be a problem. So perhaps the code should have the helper function inside the main function, or as a separate function.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nImplement the helper function inside the main function, or outside.\n\nBut for code structure, perhaps better to have it as a helper.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    def orientation(p, q, r):\n        val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n        if val == 0:\n            return 0\n        return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    first_line = input_lines[0].split()\n    R = int(first_line[0])\n    B = int(first_line[1])\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for i in range(1, R+1):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[i].split())\n        spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n    bases = []\n    for i in range(R+1, R+1 + B):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[i].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n    # Generate all permutations of the bases\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # Check if segments (spaceships[i], perm[i]) and (spaceships[j], perm[j]) intersect\n                if segments_intersect(spaceships[i], perm[i], spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the code, the permutations are generated for the bases. But what if the bases are in a different order? For example, if there are multiple permutations that could work, but the code checks all of them.\n\nBut this should be correct.\n\nNow, test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nIn this case, the code will generate all 3! = 6 permutations. One of them is the one where the first spaceship is connected to the first base, etc. As discussed earlier, this permutation is valid.\n\nSample Output is Yes.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nHere, R=2 and B=1. So output is No.\n\nNow, another test case: when R=B=2, and the two possible permutations have one valid and one invalid.\n\nBut code would check both permutations.\n\nNow, what about when there are two possible permutations, but one is valid and the other is not. For example, if the spaceships are at (0,0) and (0,1), and the bases are at (1,0) and (1,1). Then the first permutation (base1, base2) would have segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1), which are parallel and not intersecting. The second permutation (base2, base1) would have segments (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0), which cross. So the code would find the first permutation and output Yes.\n\nAnother case: when R=B=1. Then there is only one permutation, and no segments to check. So output is Yes.\n\nSo code should handle that.\n\nBut what if R=B=1? The code would generate one permutation, and the for loops for i and j would not run (since R=1, i ranges from 0 to 0, j starts from i+1=1, which is beyond range. So valid remains True, and output is Yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: R=B=2, and the two segments cross. For example, spaceships are (0,0) and (2,2), bases are (2,0) and (0,2). The permutation [ (2,0), (0,2) ] would have segments (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These are parallel, no intersection. So valid. But if the permutation is [ (0,2), (2,0) ], then the segments are (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0), which are vertical lines, no intersection. So in this case, both permutations are valid. So code outputs Yes.\n\nBut if the permutation is (0,0) connected to (2,0) and (2,2) connected to (0,2), then the segments are horizontal and parallel, no intersection.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother case: R=B=2, and the two segments cross. For example, spaceships are (0,0) and (2,2), bases are (2,0) and (0,2). The permutation [ (2,0), (0,2) ] gives segments (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These are parallel. No intersection. So valid. But if the permutation is [ (0,2), (2,0) ] gives segments (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0), which are vertical lines, no intersection. So code returns yes.\n\nBut if the spaceships are (0,0) and (1,1), and the bases are (1,0) and (0,1). Then, the permutation [ (1,0), (0,1) ] gives segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1), which are parallel. No intersection. So valid.\n\nAnother case: if the permutation is [ (0,1), (1,0) ] then the segments are (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0), which are vertical lines. No intersection. So code returns yes.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nAnother case: when two segments cross. Suppose R=B=2, spaceships are (0,0) and (2,2), bases are (1,1) and (1,3). Then, the permutation [ (1,1), (1,3) ] would have segments (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(1,3). Do these cross?\n\nCheck the segments AB (0,0)-(1,1) and CD (2,2)-(1,3).\n\nCompute orientations.\n\nA=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(2,2), D=(1,3).\n\norientation(A,B,C) is (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x) = (1-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) = 1*2 - 1*2 = 0. But according to problem statement, no three points are colinear. But in this case, the points A, B, C are colinear. But according to the problem statement, the input ensures that no three points are colinear. So this case would not be present in the input. Therefore, the code can assume that this situation is not present.\n\nBut the code would return 0 in the orientation function. However, since the problem says that no three points are colinear, this case would not exist. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, in the code, the function segments_intersect returns True if the segments intersect. So for each pair of segments, if any pair returns True, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base and each base is assigned exactly one spaceship, with the constraint that no two connecting paths (line segments) intersect in the 2D plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, output \"No\" immediately since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of the bases, consider it as a potential assignment of bases to spaceships.\n3. **Check Intersections**: For each permutation, check all pairs of line segments formed by connecting each spaceship to its assigned base. Use computational geometry to determine if any two line segments intersect.\n4. **Orientation Check**: Use the orientation method to determine if two line segments intersect. This method checks the relative orientation of points to determine if the segments cross each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    def orientation(p, q, r):\n        val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n        if val == 0:\n            return 0\n        return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    first_line = input_lines[0].split()\n    R = int(first_line[0])\n    B = int(first_line[1])\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for i in range(1, R+1):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[i].split())\n        spaceships.append((x, y))\n    bases = []\n    for i in range(R+1, R+1 + B):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[i].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                if segments_intersect(spaceships[i], perm[i], spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into spaceships and bases coordinates.\n- **Permutations Check**: All permutations of bases are generated to check every possible assignment of bases to spaceships.\n- **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, we check if any pair of line segments (connecting spaceships to their assigned bases) intersect using the orientation method. This method leverages the cross product to determine the orientation of points and check for intersections efficiently.\n- **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (R and B up to 10), generating permutations and checking intersections is computationally feasible, ensuring the solution works within acceptable time limits for small inputs.",
