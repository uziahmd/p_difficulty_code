A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs and what each part contributes.\n\nThe inputs are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. Let me recall what each represents:\n\n- n: number of friends.\n- k: number of bottles of drink. Each bottle has l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n- c: number of limes. Each cut into d slices. So total lime slices is c * d.\n- p: grams of salt.\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. Or wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml?\n\nYes. Because each of the n friends has to have their own portion. So for each toast, the total drink required is n * nl.\n\nSimilarly, for each toast, each friend needs a slice of lime. So per toast, total slices needed is n. Because each friend uses one slice. So if there are t toasts, then total slices needed is n * t.\n\nSame with salt: per toast, each friend needs np grams. So total per toast is n * np grams. So for t toasts, total salt needed is n * np * t.\n\nBut the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as possible, provided that all drink the same amount. So the number of toasts per friend is t. So the total for each resource is:\n\nDrink: total available is k*l. Required for t toasts is t * n * nl. So we must have t * n * nl <= k*l.\n\nLime slices: total available is c*d. Required for t toasts is t * n. So t * n <= c*d.\n\nSalt: total available is p. Required for t toasts is t * n * np. So t * n * np <= p.\n\nSo the maximum possible t is the minimum of (k*l // (n * nl), (c*d) // (n), p // (n * np)).\n\nWait, but let me check that.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. Total drink is 4*5=20. For each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 *3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. So that gives 2 toasts. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Each toast needs 3 slices (n=3). So 80 /3 is 26.666, floor 26. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nWait in the first sample, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, because each toast requires n slices (n=3 friends). So for t toasts, it's 3*t slices. The total available is 80. So 3t <=80 → t ≤ 26.666. So why does the sample say that limes are enough for 80 toasts? Oh, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample explanation:\n\nIn the first sample: the limes are enough for 10 *8=80 toasts. Wait, but why? Oh, perhaps the sample explanation is considering per toast per friend. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So per toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the total slices available is c*d. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - Total soft drink available is calculated as the product of the number of bottles and the volume per bottle.\n   - Total lime slices available is calculated as the product of the number of limes and the number of slices per lime.\n   - Total salt available is given directly.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - For each toast, each friend needs a certain amount of soft drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt. Therefore, for `t` toasts, the total requirements are:\n     - Soft drink: `t * n * nl`\n     - Lime slices: `t * n`\n     - Salt: `t * n * np`\n\n3. **Compute Maximum Possible Toasts**:\n   - Calculate the maximum number of toasts possible based on each resource constraint.\n   - The final answer is the minimum of these values since all resources must be sufficient for the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\n# Calculate maximum toasts based on each resource\ntoast_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n\ntoast_by_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n# The answer is the minimum of the three\nprint(min(toast_by_drink, toast_by_lime, toast_by_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: We first compute the total volume of soft drink and the total number of lime slices available.\n- **Resource Constraints**: For each resource (soft drink, lime slices, salt), we determine how many toasts can be made by dividing the total available resource by the required amount per toast.\n- **Final Answer**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Hence, we take the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make while adhering to the constraints of the available resources.",
