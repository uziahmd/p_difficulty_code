Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that none of the connecting lines intersect. Hmm. So, the key here is to check for each possible perfect matching whether all the line segments between matched pairs are non-intersecting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Since R and B are up to 10, the total number of possible perfect matchings would be R! (if R equals B). For example, when R=B=3, there are 6 possible matchings. For each of these, I need to check if all the line segments between the matched pairs don't intersect with each other.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the R spaceships and B bases. Since R and B are small, this is feasible.\n2. For each matching, check if any two line segments cross each other. If none do, then output \"Yes\".\n3. If none of the matchings work, output \"No\".\n\nBut how to generate all possible perfect matchings? Well, for R=B=n, it's permutations. For example, if we have n spaceships and n bases, each permutation represents a possible way to assign each spaceship to a base. So for each permutation, we can check if the lines between the i-th spaceship and the permuted i-th base are non-intersecting.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So, for example, if R and B are not equal, then it's impossible. Wait, the input says that R and B are given. Wait the problem says that the assignment must be a perfect matching. So that requires that R equals B. Otherwise, it's impossible. Oh right! Because a perfect matching requires that each element is matched exactly once. So if R != B, then the answer is automatically No. Wait, but looking at the input description: the first line has R and B. For example, in the sample input, the first case is 3 3, which is okay. The second sample input is 2 1. Then the answer is No because you can't have a perfect matching (since 2 != 1). So the first thing to check is if R != B, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo the first step in code is to check if R != B. If so, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for R = B, generate all possible permutations of the bases (or spaceships?), and for each permutation, check if all the line segments between the i-th spaceship and the i-th base in the permutation are non-intersecting.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nI need a function that takes two line segments (each defined by two points) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, any two line segments that share a common point (like endpoints) are not considered as intersecting? Or does the problem consider overlapping endpoints as intersections?\n\nThe problem says that the paths (straight lines) should not intersect. So if two lines share an endpoint, that's allowed? Or not?\n\nWait, the problem says that any two paths (from a base to its assigned spaceship) should not intersect. So, if two lines share an endpoint, that's not considered as intersecting. Because each line is from a base to a spaceship. So for example, if two lines are connected to the same spaceship, but that's allowed. But the problem says that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, so each spaceship is part of exactly one line. Therefore, two lines can't share a spaceship or a base. So the lines are between different pairs. Therefore, for two line segments in the matching, they can't share an endpoint. So the only way they can intersect is if they cross each other in the middle.\n\nBut the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, any two line segments can't have overlapping endpoints. So, when checking for intersection between two line segments, the only possibility is that they cross each other in the middle, not touching any endpoints.\n\nSo, the function to check if two line segments intersect needs to return True if they cross each other, but not if they just touch at endpoints.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nI remember that there's a standard method for checking if two line segments intersect. Let me think.\n\nFirst, check if the two segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Check if the segments AB and CD intersect by using the orientation method. The standard approach is to use the orientation of points to determine if the segments cross.\n\nBut perhaps I can use the cross product approach. Also, since the problem states that no three points are colinear, so the cases where the lines are colinear can be ignored, but since the problem says that no three points are colinear, that's not possible.",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining if we can assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that no two connecting lines intersect, we proceed with a systematic approach that leverages the small constraints (R and B are at most 10). The solution involves checking all possible perfect matchings between spaceships and bases, and for each matching, ensuring that none of the connecting line segments intersect.\n\n---\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Check if R ≠ B**: If the number of spaceships is not equal to the number of bases, it's impossible to have a perfect matching, so we immediately return \"No\".\n\n2. **Generate All Permutations**: For each permutation of bases, consider the assignment where the i-th spaceship is matched with the i-th base in the permutation.\n\n3. **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation, check whether any pair of line segments (connecting the matched spaceship-base pairs) intersect. If no intersections are found, return \"Yes\".\n\n4. **Intersection Detection**: Implement a helper function to determine if two line segments intersect using vector cross product logic.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\n- We use `itertools.permutations` to generate all permutations of the bases.\n- For intersection detection, we use the standard computational geometry technique involving orientation checks.\n- Since the input guarantees that no three points are colinear and no two points coincide, we don't need to handle degenerate cases like overlapping endpoints or collinearity.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef read_input():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    R, B = map(int, data[0].split())\n    spaceships = [tuple(map(int, data[i+1].split())) for i in range(R)]\n    bases = [tuple(map(int, data[R+1+i].split())) for i in range(B)]\n    return R, B, spaceships, bases\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # Returns:\n    # 0 if colinear,\n    # 1 if clockwise,\n    # 2 if counterclockwise\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # Check if segments a1a2 and b1b2 intersect\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n\n    # General case\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Special Cases\n    # a1 lies on b1b2\n    if o1 == 0 and on_segment(b1, a1, b2):\n        return True\n    # a2 lies on b1b2\n    if o2 == 0 and on_segment(b1, a2, b2):\n        return True\n    # b1 lies on a1a2\n    if o3 == 0 and on_segment(a1, b1, a2):\n        return True\n    # b2 lies on a1a2\n    if o4 == 0 and on_segment(a1, b2, a2):\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef on_segment(p, q, r):\n    # Check if point q lies on segment pr\n    return (min(p[0], r[0]) <= q[0] <= max(p[0], r[0]) and\n            min(p[1], r[1]) <= q[1] <= max(p[1], r[1]))\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B, spaceships, bases = read_input()\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    from itertools import permutations\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        intersect = False\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                # Check if segment (spaceships[i], perm[i]) intersects with (spaceships[j], perm[j])\n                if segments_intersect(spaceships[i], perm[i], spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n                    intersect = True\n                    break\n            if intersect:\n                break\n        if not intersect:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Reading**: The code reads the input and separates the spaceship and base coordinates.\n- **Permutations**: It generates all possible ways to match spaceships to bases.\n- **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, it checks if any pair of line segments (from the matching) intersect using a geometric algorithm.\n- **Efficiency**: This brute-force approach is feasible due to the small size of R and B (up to 10), resulting in at most 10! = 3,628,800 permutations.\n\nThis ensures correctness and handles all edge cases as specified.",
