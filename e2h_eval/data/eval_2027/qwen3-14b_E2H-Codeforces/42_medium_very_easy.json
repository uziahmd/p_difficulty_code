Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about copying files and tracking two progress bars. The first shows the percentage of the current file copied, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both percentages are floored to integers. After each byte copied, these values update. I need to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment.\n\nHmm. So the task is to find all such numbers where there's a moment when both progress bars show that number.\n\nFirst, I need to model the process of copying each byte and check for each byte what the two percentages are. But since the files can be up to 1000 bytes each, and n up to 100, the total number of bytes is up to 100*1000 = 10^5. For each byte, checking both percentages would be feasible.\n\nWait, but even with 1e5 bytes, for each byte, we have to calculate two percentages. Then collect all the numbers where both are equal. Then output the sorted list of those numbers.\n\nBut how do I model the process?\n\nLet me think. For each byte copied, there's a current file i, and a position x within that file (x ranges from 1 to a_i). Wait, but the problem says that after copying byte x of file i, the first progress bar shows floor(100*x / a_i). And the total progress is floor(100*(sum of previous files + x) / total_sum).\n\nBut the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0 for both. Also, after each byte is copied, the progress bars update. So for each byte copied, we need to compute both percentages.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the total_sum of all a_i.\n\n2. Iterate through each file, and for each byte in the file, compute the current percentage (for the file) and the total percentage.\n\n3. For each such pair, record the value if they are equal. Then collect all such values, and output the unique ones sorted.\n\nBut wait, how do I track the bytes? Let's think of it as for each file i, and for each x from 1 to a_i, we have a moment where the current file is i, and x bytes have been copied in that file. But also, the total bytes copied so far is sum_prev + x, where sum_prev is the sum of the sizes of the previous files.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the prefix sums of the a_i array. Let's say prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a_1, prefix_sums[2] = a_1+a_2, etc. So for the i-th file (starting from 1?), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i-1], and during processing the x-th byte of this file, the total bytes copied is sum_prev + x.\n\nThen, for each byte x in each file i:\n\ncurrent_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\ntotal_percent = floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum)\n\nIf current_percent == total_percent, then add that value to a set.\n\nAlso, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0 for both. So 0 should be included. But according to the note in the first example, when there's one file, the progress bars are always the same. So for the initial state, 0 is included. But how do we capture that?\n\nBecause when the first byte is copied, the progress bars are 100*1/a_i and ... etc. But before any bytes are copied, the progress bars are 0. So perhaps we need to check the initial state (0,0) as a possible value. However, in the code, when we process each byte, the initial 0 is not captured unless we handle it.\n\nWait, the problem says that the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is both bars showing 0. So that's a valid moment. So 0 must be considered. However, when processing the first byte, the initial 0 is not captured by the loop. Because the loop is for each byte copied. So the initial state is a separate case.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nInitialize a set with 0, since that's the initial state. Then process each byte, and check if current and total percentages are equal. If so, add to the set. Then, after processing all bytes, the set contains all the required values.\n\nWait, but the note in the first example says that for a single file, the progress bars are always the same. So for each byte x, the current percent and total percent are the same. But in that case, the initial 0 is included. But for example, when the first byte is copied, the current percent is 100*1/a_i, and the total percent is same. So the code would capture all those values. However, the initial 0 is not captured in the loop, because the loop starts when the first byte is copied. So we need to make sure that the initial 0 is added to the set.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- Initialize a set with 0.\n\n- For each file i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   - sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   - for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n      - current_percent = (100 * x) // a_i\n\n      - total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n      - total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n      - if current_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\nBut wait, the sum_prev for the i-th file (assuming 0-based index) is prefix_sums[i], and the total bytes is sum_prev + x.\n\nBut the prefix_sums can be precomputed as follows. Let's say the original array is a = [a1, a2, ..., an]. Then prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a1, prefix_sums[2] = a1+a2, etc. So for the i-th file (starting from 1?), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i-1].\n\nSo for example, for the first file (i=0 in 0-based), sum_prev is prefix_sums[0] = 0. Then for x from 1 to a[0], the total bytes is 0 + x.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list a of n integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums as a list where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nThen, for each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nBut also, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0. So the set starts with 0.\n\nBut wait, what about the end of the process? For example, after all bytes are copied, the progress bars are both 100. But according to the problem statement, after each byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. So when the last byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. So the 100% is included if the total bytes is equal to the total_sum. For example, when the last byte is copied, total_bytes is total_sum. Then total_percent is (100 * total_sum) // total_sum = 100. Similarly, current_percent is (100 * a_i) // a_i = 100. So that's captured in the loop.\n\nSo the initial 0 is added, and the rest are handled in the loop.\n\nBut what about the case when the total_sum is zero? Well, the problem says that each a_i is at least 1. So total_sum is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nNow, the problem is to collect all the numbers that are present in the set. Then output them sorted.\n\nBut let's test with the first example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nSo n=1, a=[6]. total_sum=6.\n\nprefix_sums is [0,6].\n\nProcessing the first (and only) file:\n\nsum_prev is 0.\n\nfor x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x)/6, floored.\n\ntotal_bytes = 0 + x = x. total_percent = (100x)/6, same as current_percent. So all these x will have same values. So the set includes 0, and all the percentages generated by x from 1 to 6.\n\nBut the output is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nWait, let's compute for x from 1 to 6:\n\nFor x=1: 100*1/6 = 16.666... floored to 16.\n\nx=2: 200/6=33.333... floored to 33.\n\nx=3: 300/6=50 → 50.\n\nx=4: 400/6=66.666... → 66.\n\nx=5: 500/6=83.333... → 83.\n\nx=6: 600/6=100 → 100.\n\nSo the set includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nSo the code correctly includes 0 and the values from each x.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nn=2, a = [100,500]. total_sum is 600.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 100, 600].\n\nFor the first file (i=0, sum_prev=0, file size 100):\n\nx from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100x//100 = x.\n\ntotal_bytes = x → total_percent = 100x//600.\n\nSo for x=1: current is 1, total is 0.166... → 0. So not equal.\n\nOnly when x is such that x equals 100x//600.\n\nBut for example, when x=6: 6*100/600 = 1. So current is 6, total is 1. Not equal.\n\nBut when x=0, which is the initial state, both are 0. So 0 is in the set.\n\nBut during the processing of the first file, for x from 1 to 100, the current percent is x, and total percent is (100 * x) // 600.\n\nWe need to check when x equals that value.\n\nFor example, when x=600 * k / 100 → but x is up to 100. Let's see:\n\nSuppose x is 6 → 100 * 6 / 600 = 1 → 1. So current is 6, total is 1 → no match.\n\nBut when x= 600 * p / 100 → x= 6p. But since x is up to 100, p can be up to 100/6 ~ 16.66. So p up to 16.\n\nFor example, when p=1, x=6 → 1. So current is 6, total is 1. Not equal. So no match here.\n\nSo during the first file, maybe there are no matches except for 0?\n\nBut in the sample output for the second input, the output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. So the 0 is included, and then during the second file.\n\nLet me think. The second file is 500 bytes. sum_prev is 100. So for x from 1 to 500, total_bytes = 100 + x.\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 500.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * (100 + x)) // 600.\n\nWe need to find x where these two are equal.\n\nFor example, let's take x= 495. Then current_percent is (100 * 495)/500 = 99.0 → 99. total_bytes is 100+495=595. total_percent is 100 * 595 / 600 = 99.166... → 99. So yes, 99 is in the set.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 496 → current is 100*496/500 = 99.2 → 99. total is 100*(100+496)/600 = 100*596/600 = 99.333 → 99. So same value. So 99 is added.\n\nSimilarly, when x= 500, total_bytes is 600. total_percent is 100. current is 100*500/500 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nBut what about the other values in the sample output, like 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100?\n\nSo during the processing of the second file, there are multiple x values where current and total percentages are equal.\n\nSo the code would capture those. So the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all these possibilities.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums. Let's say prefix_sums is a list where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. So for i in 0..n, prefix_sums[i] is sum of first i elements.\n\nThen, create a set called result, initialized with 0.\n\nThen for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nOnce all are processed, collect the set, sort it, and print each element separated by newlines.\n\nBut wait, the sample output for the first input is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich includes 0 and the values generated during the processing of the first file. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about the case when during the processing of a file, multiple x's produce the same percentage. For example, if two different x's produce the same value. But the set will store it once, so that's okay.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix_sums:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n\ntotal_sum = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nresult = {0}\n\nThen loop over each file:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current == total:\n\n            result.add(current)\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list.\n\nBut wait, the initial 0 is added. But during processing, for example, when x is 0, but that's not part of the loop. However, the initial 0 is added. But what if during processing, the 0 is generated again? For example, if during some x, current and total are 0. But the initial 0 is already in the set. So adding it again doesn't matter.\n\nBut for example, when the first byte is copied, the current and total may be 0. For example, if the first file is 1000 bytes. Then x=1: current is 0.1% → 0. total is (100 * 1)/total_sum. Suppose total_sum is 1000. Then total is 0.1% → 0. So current and total are 0. So 0 is added again. But since it's a set, it's stored once. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\ntotal_sum is 600.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 100, 600]\n\nProcessing first file (i=0, sum_prev=0, file_size=100):\n\nfor x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent = 100x//100 = x.\n\ntotal = 100*(0 +x) // 600 = (100x)//600.\n\nWe need x == (100x)//600 ?\n\nLet me see. For x=0, it's 0, but that's already in the set.\n\nFor x=1, 100*1//600 = 0. So current is 1, total is 0 → not equal.\n\nSame for x=5: current is 5, total is 0.833 → 0. Not equal.\n\nOnly when x is such that x = (100x)//600.\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\nx = floor( (100x)/600 )\n\nWhich implies that x ≤ (100x)/600 < x+1.\n\nMultiply all terms by 600:\n\n600x ≤ 100x < 600(x+1)\n\n600x ≤ 100x → 500x ≤ 0 → x ≤ 0. But x ≥ 1. So no solution. Therefore, during the first file, there are no matches except 0.\n\nThen, during the second file (i=1, sum_prev=100, file_size=500):\n\nfor x in 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent is (100x) // 500.\n\ntotal_bytes is 100 + x.\n\ntotal is (100*(100 + x)) // 600.\n\nWe need these two to be equal.\n\nLet me denote current = (100x)/500 = x/5 → floor(x/5).\n\ntotal = (100*(100 + x))/600 = (100 +x) * (1/6) → floor((100 +x)/6).\n\nSo we need x/5 floored equals (100 +x)/6 floored.\n\nLet me find x such that floor(x/5) = floor( (100 +x)/6 )\n\nLet me denote k = floor(x/5) = floor( (100 +x)/6 )\n\nWe can find x for which this holds.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each x from 1 to 500, compute both values and check equality.\n\nBut for the sample output, the answer includes 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nLet me check x= 495:\n\ncurrent = (100 * 495) // 500 = 99.\n\ntotal_bytes = 100 + 495 = 595. 595 * 100 / 600 = 99.166..., floored to 99. So yes, 99 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 496: current is (496*100)/500 = 99.2 → 99. total is 596 * 100 /600 = 596/6 = 99.333... → 99. So same value. So added.\n\nSame for x= 497, 498, 499, 500:\n\nx=497 → current 99.4 → 99. total is 597/6 = 99.5 → 99.\n\nx=498 → current 99.6 → 99. total 598/6 = 99.666... → 99.\n\nx=499 → current 99.8 → 99. total 599/6 = 99.833... → 99.\n\nx=500 → current is 100. total is 600/6 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nSo for x from 495 to 500, the current and total percentages are 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 100. So 99 and 100 are added.\n\nBut why in the sample output for this case, the numbers are 0,95,96,97,98,99,100?\n\nAh, perhaps there are other x values where the current and total percentages are equal. For example, let's take x= 595 - 100 = 495? Or maybe other ranges.\n\nWait, let's think of when the total is 95. Let's see:\n\nLooking for k=95. So:\n\nfloor( (100 +x)/6 ) = 95 → 95 ≤ (100+x)/6 <96 → multiply by 6: 570 ≤ 100 +x < 576 → 470 ≤x < 476.\n\nAt the same time, floor(x/5) = 95 → 95 ≤x/5 <96 → 475 ≤x < 500.\n\nSo the intersection of 470 ≤x <476 and 475 ≤x <500 is x in [475, 476).\n\nSo x can be 475.\n\nCheck x=475:\n\ncurrent = 475 /5 = 95 → yes.\n\ntotal = (100+475) = 575 → 575 /6 = 95.833... → floor 95. So yes. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, x=475 is in the second file. So during processing this x, the code adds 95 to the set.\n\nSimilarly, for k=96:\n\nfloor((100 +x)/6) =96 → 96*6 = 576 ≤ 100 +x < 97*6=582 → 476 ≤x < 482.\n\nfloor(x/5) =96 → 96*5=480 ≤x < 97*5=485.\n\nThe intersection is x in [480, 482) → x=480, 481.\n\nCheck x=480:\n\ncurrent is 480/5 =96.\n\ntotal is 100+480 =580 → 580/6= 96.666... → 96. So yes. So 96 is added.\n\nx=481: 481/5 is 96.2 → 96. total is 581/6= 96.833... → 96. So yes.\n\nSimilarly for k=97:\n\nfloor((100 +x)/6)=97 → 97*6=582 ≤ 100 +x < 98*6=588 → 482 ≤x < 488.\n\nfloor(x/5) =97 → 97*5=485 ≤x < 490.\n\nIntersection is x in [485, 488). So x=485,486,487.\n\nCheck x=485: current is 485/5=97. total is 100+485=585. 585/6= 97.5 → 97. So yes. So 97 is added.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for k=95,96,97,98,99,100, there are x's that satisfy the condition. Hence, the sample output includes those numbers.\n\nSo the code would capture those, and the initial 0. Thus, the output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the only thing to note is that in Python, for integer division, using '//' does floor division. However, in Python, when dealing with negative numbers, it's towards negative infinity, but since all values here are positive, it's okay.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n from input. Then read the list a.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\nInitialize the set with 0.\n\nThen loop through each file and each x in the file.\n\nFinally, collect the sorted list.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as a list of strings. Wait, no. The input is given via standard input. So in the code, the user will read from stdin.\n\nBut for the code submission, the code must read from stdin.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen compute prefix_sums.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is ['1\\n6', ...], but that's for the example. In practice, the code will read from stdin.\n\nOnce the code is written, the code can be tested.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then a.\n\nCompute prefix_sums:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n\ntotal_sum = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current == total:\n\n            result.add(current)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but the sample outputs have the numbers separated by newlines. For example, the first sample output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is each number on its own line. So the code should print each number in the sorted list on a separate line.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the first sample input:\n\nn=1, a=[6]. The code adds 0, and for x from 1-6, the current and total are same. So the set will have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Sorted as such.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one, which gives 0,95,...,100.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if all files are 1 byte? For example, n=2, a=[1,1]. total_sum=2.\n\nProcessing first file:\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent = 100*1//1 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes = 0+1=1 → 100*1//2 = 50. 100 != 50 → not added.\n\nSecond file:\n\nsum_prev = 1.\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent is 100*1//1=100.\n\ntotal_bytes is 1+1=2 → 100*2//2=100. So 100 == 100 → added. So the set has 0, 100.\n\nSo the output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a=[1]. Then during x=1, current is 100, total is 100. So the set includes 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[1, 1]. The initial 0 is added. Then during processing, the first file x=1 gives current 100, total 50. Not added. During processing the second file, x=1 gives current 100, total 100. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: n=1, a=[1000]. Then the code would generate all the percentages for each x from 1 to 1000. For example, when x= 1000, it's 100. So the set includes 0 and all the percentages generated. But since the problem says that the output must include all numbers between 0 and 100 that are present in the set.\n\nNow, what about when the same value is generated multiple times? The set handles that.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when total_sum is 1. For example, n=1, a=[1]. Then the total_sum is 1. For x=1, total is (100 * 1) // 1 = 100. So the set includes 0, 100. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a = [1, 2]. total_sum = 3.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 1, 3].\n\nProcessing first file (i=0, sum_prev=0, file_size=1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent = 100 *1 //1 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes = 1 → 100*1//3 = 33. So not equal.\n\nProcessing second file (i=1, sum_prev=1, file_size=2):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent = 100 *1 //2 = 50.\n\ntotal_bytes = 1+1=2 → 200//3 = 66. So no.\n\nx=2:\n\ncurrent is 100 *2 //2 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes is 1+2=3 → 300//3=100. So added. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nSo output is 0 and 100.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the Python code as outlined should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to integers and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation:** Compute prefix sums to efficiently calculate the total bytes copied up to each file.\n3. **Progress Calculation:** For each byte copied in each file, compute the current file progress and the overall progress. Check if these values are equal and collect such values.\n4. **Initial State Handling:** Ensure the initial state (0% for both progress bars) is included in the result set.\n5. **Result Compilation:** Collect all valid percentages, sort them, and print them in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    prefix_sums = [0]\n    for num in a:\n        prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n    \n    total_sum = prefix_sums[-1]\n    result = {0}\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n        file_size = a[i]\n        for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n            current = (100 * x) // file_size\n            total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n            total = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n            if current == total:\n                result.add(current)\n    \n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for num in sorted_result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read using standard input functions. The first line gives the number of files, and the second line provides the sizes of these files.\n2. **Prefix Sums:** These are used to quickly determine the cumulative size of files up to any given point, which helps in calculating the overall progress efficiently.\n3. **Progress Calculation:** For each byte copied in each file, we compute the current file progress and the overall progress. If both values match, they are added to a set to ensure uniqueness.\n4. **Initial State:** The initial state where both progress bars show 0% is explicitly added to the result set.\n5. **Output:** The results are sorted and printed in ascending order to meet the problem requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check each byte's contribution to both progress bars and collect all valid percentages, resulting in an optimal solution for the given constraints.",
