Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about pairing left and right boots with compatible colors. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') is compatible only with another 'a' or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'. So, for each left boot and right boot, we need to check if their colors are compatible.\n\nBut since we want maximum pairs, we need an efficient way to match them. Let's think about how to model this. Maybe we can process the pairs in a way that uses the '?'s optimally.\n\nLet me think of possible steps:\n\n1. For each left boot and right boot, we can try to pair them if they are compatible. However, since each boot can be used once, we need to find a matching that maximizes the count.\n\nBut considering the size of n (up to 150,000), we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution. Brute-force approaches like checking all possible pairs would be too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps we can use a greedy approach. Let's think of grouping the colors and using counts.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- First, for each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots and right boots. Then, for each color, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum of left and right counts. But then, the '?'s can be used to fill in the gaps.\n\nWait, but the '?' can be paired with any color. So maybe we should first pair specific colors, and then use the '?'s for the remaining ones.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nWe can create two dictionaries: one for left boots (counting each color, including '?'), and one for right boots. Then, for each color that is not '?', we can pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, handle the '?'s.\n\nBut how? Let's think:\n\nFor example, suppose we have left color 'a' with count L_a, and right color 'a' with count R_a. The number of pairs here is min(L_a, R_a). Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots (for color 'a') can't be paired with others except '?'. But maybe we can use the '?'s to pair with them.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to first pair the non-question marks. Let's think:\n\nFirst, process all pairs where both are specific colors. Then, for the remaining, use the '?'s.\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n- For each color c (from 'a' to 'z'), count the number of left boots with color c (excluding '?') and right boots with color c (excluding '?'). For each such c, the number of pairs between left c and right c is min(left[c], right[c]). Then, subtract these from left and right counts. Then, the remaining left and right boots (which are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched) can be paired with '?'s.\n\nWait, but the '?'s can be used in multiple ways. Let's think again.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. For each color c (not '?'), pair as many left c with right c as possible. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, we can pair 3 of them. Then, subtract those from the counts. Now, the left 'a's are all used up, and the right 'a's have 2 left.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left boots (which may be '?' or some other colors) and the remaining right boots (same), we can pair them using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to handle this? Let's think about the remaining left and right boots. Let's collect all the left boots that are not yet paired (could be '?' or specific colors) and same for right. Then, for each left boot that is not '?', we can pair it with a '?' on the right, and vice versa. Also, the '?'s can pair with each other.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs here?\n\nLet me think: The number of pairs here is the sum of:\n\n- The number of left '?' plus the number of right '?' minus the number of pairs that can be made between them. Wait, no. Because each '?' can be paired with any other.\n\nBut maybe the optimal way is to pair as many as possible between the non-? left and ? right, then between ? left and non-? right, then pair the remaining ?s.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. After step 1, let's have:\n\nleft_remaining: the number of left boots that are not yet paired. These could be specific colors or '?'.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nBut perhaps we can think of:\n\nThe number of non-? left boots (call this L) and non-? right boots (R). But these may have been already processed. Wait, no. After step 1, all non-? left and right boots that could be paired with their same color have been paired. The remaining non-? left boots can't be paired with any right boots except with '?'.\n\nSo, for example, after step 1, suppose there are some left boots with color 'a' that couldn't be paired (because there were not enough right 'a's). These can be paired with '?' on the right. Similarly for the right boots with color 'b' that couldn't be paired with left 'b's.\n\nSo, here's what I think:\n\nAfter pairing all same-color non-? pairs, we have:\n\nFor each color c (non-?), left_count[c] is the number of left boots with color c not yet paired, and similarly for right_count[c].\n\nThen, for the remaining left boots (non-? and ?), and remaining right boots (non-? and ?), we can:\n\n- Pair the left non-? with right ?. For each left non-? (say, color c), we can pair it with a right ?.\n\nSimilarly, pair right non-? with left ?.\n\nAnd finally, pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nSo, how to do this?\n\nLet me think of:\n\nWe can collect all the left non-? boots (those that are not yet paired) into a list. Similarly for the right non-? boots. Then, for each left non-? boot, we can pair it with a right ? (if available). Similarly for right non-? with left ?. Then, pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to track the counts?\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to calculate the maximum possible pairs:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\n- left_non_q: the number of left boots that are not '?' and not yet paired. These are the left boots that have some color c, but their corresponding right c was not enough.\n\nSimilarly, right_non_q: the number of right boots that are not '?' and not yet paired.\n\nleft_q: the number of left '?' boots not yet paired.\n\nright_q: the number of right '?' boots not yet paired.\n\nThen, the maximum pairs in this phase is:\n\nmin(left_non_q, right_q) + min(right_non_q, left_q) + min( (left_q - used_in_prev) + (right_q - used_in_prev), ... )\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nWe can pair left_non_q with right_q. Let's say we take as much as possible here. Then, pair right_non_q with left_q. Then, the remaining ?s can be paired between left and right.\n\nBut the total number of pairs from this phase is:\n\npairs = min(left_non_q, right_q) + min(right_non_q, left_q) + min( (left_q - used_left) + (right_q - used_right), ... )\n\nWait, perhaps after pairing left_non_q with right_q, and right_non_q with left_q, the remaining ?s can be paired as min( (left_q - used_left) + (right_q - used_right) ) ?\n\nNo, because the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min(left_q_remaining + right_q_remaining, ... ? No. Because each pair uses one left and one right. So, for example, if there are x left ? and y right ?, the maximum pairs is min(x, y) + (max(x, y) - min(x, y)) ? No. Wait, no. Because each pair must consist of one left and one right. So the maximum is min(x, y) + (the rest can't be paired because they are in same side). So the maximum is min(x, y) + 0? No. Wait, no. If you have x left ? and y right ?, you can pair them as min(x, y) pairs. The remaining (x - min(x,y)) left ? and (y - min(x,y)) right ? can't be paired. So the total for this part is min(x, y).\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet me first calculate:\n\npair1 = min(left_non_q, right_q)\n\npair2 = min(right_non_q, left_q)\n\nAfter that, the remaining left_q is left_q - pair2. Because pair2 used some left_q (the ones that are paired with right_non_q).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again:\n\nInitially, left_q is the number of left ? not yet paired.\n\nSimilarly for right_q.\n\npair1 is the number of left_non_q (non-?) that are paired with right_q (?). So, for this, we take as many as possible. So pair1 = min(left_non_q, right_q). After that, the remaining right_q is right_q - pair1. And left_non_q is left_non_q - pair1.\n\nThen, pair2 is min( right_non_q, left_q ). So after that, the remaining left_q is left_q - pair2, and right_non_q is right_non_q - pair2.\n\nNow, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min( left_q_remaining, right_q_remaining ). So total pairs from this phase is pair1 + pair2 + min( left_q_remaining, right_q_remaining )\n\nBut wait, how?\n\nLet me take an example:\n\nSuppose after step 1, we have:\n\nleft_non_q = 2 (say, color 'a')\n\nright_non_q = 3 (say, color 'b')\n\nleft_q = 5\n\nright_q = 4.\n\nThen pair1 is min(2,4) = 2. So pair1=2. Then, right_q becomes 4-2=2.\n\npair2 is min(3,5) = 3. So pair2=3. Then, left_q becomes 5-3=2.\n\nNow, remaining left_q is 2, right_q is 2. So pair3 is min(2,2)=2. So total pairs from this phase is 2+3+2=7.\n\nBut what's the total possible? Let's see:\n\nOriginal left_non_q (2) can be paired with right_q (4) â†’ 2 pairs.\n\nOriginal right_non_q (3) can be paired with left_q (5) â†’ 3 pairs.\n\nLeft_q after that is 5-3=2, right_q after that is 4-2=2. So pair them as 2 pairs. Total 2+3+2=7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\ntotal_pairs = pair1 + pair2 + min( (left_q - pair2), (right_q - pair1) )\n\nBut how to track these variables?\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe overall maximum pairs is:\n\nsame_color_pairs + pair1 + pair2 + pair3.\n\nWhere same_color_pairs is the sum over all colors c of min(left[c], right[c]).\n\nBut how to compute left_non_q and right_non_q?\n\nWait, after processing same_color_pairs, the left_non_q is the sum over all colors c of (left[c] - min(left[c], right[c])) ?\n\nNo. Because for each color c, the left[c] is the original count of left boots with color c, and same for right[c]. Then, same_color_pairs is min(left[c], right[c]) for each c. Then, after that, the remaining left[c] is left[c] - same_color_pairs, but no, that's not correct. Because for each color c, the number of left boots used in same_color_pairs is min(left[c], right[c]). So the remaining left[c] is left[c] - min(left[c], right[c]).\n\nWait, for example, if left[c] is 3 and right[c] is 5, then same_color_pairs is 3. So the remaining left[c] is 0, and the remaining right[c] is 5-3=2.\n\nSo, the left_non_q is the sum of all left[c] (for non-? colors) after same_color_pairs. But wait, no. Because the left_non_q is the number of left boots that are not '?' and not yet paired. So, for each color c (non-?), the remaining left[c] is the number of left boots with color c that are not yet paired. Similarly for right.\n\nSo, after same_color_pairs, the left_non_q is the sum over all non-? colors of (original left counts of c minus same_color_pairs for c). Similarly for right_non_q.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the same_color_pairs processing, we can track for each color c (non-?), how many are left. Let me think of data structures.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Count the number of left boots for each color (including '?'), same for right.\n\n- For each color c in a-z (excluding '?'), compute the same_color_pairs as min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Add this to the total. Then, subtract that from left_count[c] and right_count[c]. For example, if left_count[c] was 5 and right_count[c] was 3, then after pairing, left_count[c] becomes 5-3=2, and right_count[c] becomes 0.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for same_color_pairs, we take min(left, right). So for each c, the number of pairs is min(left[c], right[c]). So, after that, the remaining left[c] is left[c] - min(left[c], right[c]).\n\nBut for the left boots that are not paired in same_color_pairs, they are left in left_count[c] (for non-? colors) and can be paired with ?s.\n\nBut then, the left_non_q is the sum of left_count[c] for all non-? colors. Similarly for right_non_q.\n\nWait, but left_count includes the '?'s. Oh no, perhaps I need separate counts for non-? colors and ?.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nWe can have:\n\nleft_counts = a dictionary where for each color (including '?'), we have the count of left boots.\n\nSimilarly for right_counts.\n\nThen, for same_color_pairs, for each color c in a-z:\n\npairs = min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])\n\ntotal_pairs += pairs.\n\nThen, subtract pairs from left_counts[c] and right_counts[c].\n\nBut after that, the left_counts[c] for non-? colors will have the number of left boots of color c that are not paired with same color right boots. Similarly for right_counts[c].\n\nSo, after this, the left_non_q is the sum of left_counts[c] for all c != '?'. Similarly for right_non_q.\n\nBut also, the left_q is left_counts['?'], and right_q is right_counts['?'].\n\nSo, now, the steps are:\n\nCompute:\n\nleft_non_q = sum of left_counts[c] for c in a-z (excluding '?')\n\nright_non_q = sum of right_counts[c] for c in a-z (excluding '?')\n\nleft_q = left_counts['?']\n\nright_q = right_counts['?']\n\nThen, proceed as before.\n\nNow, the pair1 is min(left_non_q, right_q). Let's take that number of pairs. But how to track which specific boots are paired here?\n\nAh, but the problem requires not just the count but also the actual pairs. So, the initial approach of counting is necessary, but we also need to track which boots are used in each step.\n\nThis complicates things because we need to track the indices of the boots.\n\nSo, the challenge is not only to compute the maximum number of pairs but also to output the actual pairs.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each color c (non-?), pair left boots of color c with right boots of color c. For each such pair, record the indices.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently? For example, for each color c, collect all the left indices with color c, and all the right indices with color c. Then, pair them up as much as possible.\n\nOnce that's done, we can mark those boots as used and not consider them again.\n\nThen, proceed to the next steps.\n\nSo, for the first part, we can:\n\n- For each color c in a-z:\n\n   - collect the list of left indices with color c (excluding ?)\n   - collect the list of right indices with color c (excluding ?)\n   - pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) elements. For example, pair the first element of left with first of right, etc.\n\n   - Record these pairs.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired in this step), we need to process the next steps.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already used? We need to keep track of which left and right boots have been used in the pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps we can have two boolean arrays: used_left and used_right. Initially, all are False. When a boot is paired, we mark it as True.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False]*n.\n\nFor each color c in a-z (non-?):\n\n   left_list = list of indices i where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   right_list = list of indices j where r[j] == c and not used_right[j]\n\n   num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for k in 0..num_pairs-1:\n\n       pair left_list[k] with right_list[k]\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[k]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[k]] = True\n\n       add to the result list\n\nOnce that is done, we have the same_color_pairs.\n\nThen, the next steps are to pair the remaining left and right boots.\n\nSo, for the next steps, we need to collect the remaining left boots (those not used) that are non-? and those that are ?.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nWell, for the remaining left boots that are non-? (i.e., not used and not '?'), we can collect them in a list. Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut again, we need to collect them efficiently.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 150,000, we need O(n) time for these steps.\n\nSo, for the next steps:\n\nCollect all the remaining left boots (non-? and not used) into a list left_non_q_list. Similarly, collect all the remaining right boots (non-? and not used) into right_non_q_list. Also collect the remaining left ? boots (not used) into left_q_list and right ? boots into right_q_list.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can loop through all the left boots, check if they are not used and not '?', and collect them into left_non_q_list. Similarly for the others.\n\nOnce we have these lists:\n\nleft_non_q_list = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_non_q_list = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] != '?']\nleft_q_list = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q_list = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] == '?']\n\nNow, the next step is to pair left_non_q_list with right_q_list as much as possible.\n\nFor example, for each left in left_non_q_list, we can pair it with a right in right_q_list. How many such pairs can we make? It's min(len(left_non_q_list), len(right_q_list)).\n\nSimilarly for right_non_q_list with left_q_list.\n\nBut how to pair them? For example, take the first elements of left_non_q_list and pair with first elements of right_q_list, etc.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_non_q and right_q are those that couldn't be paired. Then, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired between themselves.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nStep 1: pair same color non-? as before.\n\nStep 2: collect left_non_q_list, right_non_q_list, left_q_list, right_q_list.\n\nStep 3: pair as many as possible between left_non_q_list and right_q_list.\n\nFor this, take the first m elements, where m is min(len(left_non_q_list), len(right_q_list)).\n\nFor each i in 0 to m-1:\n\n   pair left_non_q_list[i] with right_q_list[i]\n\n   mark them as used.\n\nAdd to the result.\n\nStep 4: pair as many as possible between right_non_q_list and left_q_list.\n\nAgain, take m = min(len(right_non_q_list), len(left_q_list)), and pair them.\n\nAdd to result.\n\nStep 5: pair the remaining left_q and right_q as much as possible. Take min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)) pairs. For example, pair first elements of left_q_remaining with first elements of right_q_remaining.\n\nBut how to track the remaining after steps 3 and 4?\n\nAlternatively, after steps 3 and 4, collect the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut perhaps, after steps 3 and 4, the left_q_list and right_q_list have some elements left. Let me think:\n\nAfter step 3, the left_non_q_list has len(left_non_q_list) - m elements, where m is the number of pairs made in step 3. Similarly, right_q_list has len(right_q_list) - m elements.\n\nBut in code, perhaps after step 3, we can take the remaining elements of left_non_q_list and right_q_list. But perhaps it's easier to process them as follows:\n\nWe can take the left_non_q_list and right_q_list, and pair as many as possible. So:\n\nm = min(len(left_non_q_list), len(right_q_list))\nfor i in range(m):\n    pair left_non_q_list[i] with right_q_list[i]\nmark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for step 4:\n\nm = min(len(right_non_q_list), len(left_q_list))\nfor i in range(m):\n    pair right_non_q_list[i] with left_q_list[i]\nmark them as used.\n\nThen, for step 5:\n\nCollect the remaining left_q (those not used) and right_q (those not used). Let's call them left_q_remaining and right_q_remaining.\n\nThen, pair as many as possible between them. Again, take min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)) pairs. For example, pair first elements of left_q_remaining with first elements of right_q_remaining.\n\nBut how to collect these remaining lists?\n\nAlternatively, after step 3 and 4, the left_q_remaining is the original left_q_list minus those elements used in step 4. But perhaps it's easier to collect them again.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. However, given that the steps are O(n) time, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps, in code, after steps 3 and 4, we can collect the left_q_remaining and right_q_remaining as:\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in left_q_list if not used_left[i]]\nWait, no. Because during steps 3 and 4, some elements of left_q_list might have been used in step 4. Wait, no. Step 3 pairs left_non_q with right_q. Step 4 pairs right_non_q with left_q. So, during step 4, elements of left_q_list are being used. So, after step 4, the left_q_list may have some elements left. But perhaps it's easier to collect the remaining left_q and right_q after steps 3 and 4.\n\nBut perhaps, instead of collecting the lists again, during steps 3 and 4, we can process the lists and take the first m elements and pair them, then the remaining elements are the ones not processed.\n\nSo, for example, in step 3, after pairing m elements, the remaining left_non_q_list is the elements from index m onwards. Similarly for the right_q_list.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nIn code, perhaps:\n\nAfter step 3:\n\npaired_m = min(len(left_non_q_list), len(right_q_list))\nfor i in range(paired_m):\n    pair left_non_q_list[i] with right_q_list[i]\nmark them as used.\n\nThen, the remaining left_non_q_list is left_non_q_list[paired_m:], but these are not used anymore. However, they are not needed anymore, because they are non-? and couldn't be paired with any right_q. So, they are left in the system but can't be paired further except with ? on the right, which are already processed.\n\nBut after step 3, the right_q_list has len(right_q_list) - paired_m elements left.\n\nSimilarly for step 4.\n\nThen, for step 5, collect the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nWell, after steps 3 and 4, the left_q is the original left_q_list minus those elements used in step 4. Similarly for right_q.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to collect all left boots that are not used and are '?', and same for right.\n\nSo, after steps 1-4, collect:\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q_remaining = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] == '?']\n\nThen, pair as many as possible between them. So, m = min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)), and pair first m elements.\n\nSo, putting all this together.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python, considering the constraints of n up to 150,000.\n\nBut what about the time complexity? Each step is O(n), so overall O(n) time.\n\nBut for the first step, for each color, we need to collect the left and right indices. How to do that efficiently?\n\nWe can pre-process for each color, a list of indices. For example, for the left boots, create a dictionary where for each color c, we have a list of indices where l[i] == c. Similarly for the right boots.\n\nSo, during the first step, for each color c in a-z, we can get the left list and right list, and pair as much as possible.\n\nBut for that, we need to have these lists.\n\nBut in code:\n\npreprocessing:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_indices = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_indices = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    c = l[i]\n    left_color_indices[c].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    c = r[i]\n    right_color_indices[c].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in a-z (excluding '?'):\n\nleft_list = left_color_indices.get(c, [])\nright_list = right_color_indices.get(c, [])\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\nBut then, we need to mark these indices as used. However, in this approach, the same indices may be considered again in other steps. So, perhaps we need to process them in a way that once they are paired, they are not considered again.\n\nBut the problem is that during the first step, when we pair left and right boots of same color, we need to mark them as used so that they are not considered in the later steps.\n\nThus, during the first step, we can collect all the pairs for same color, and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nSo, during the first step:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = left_color_indices[c]\n    right_list = right_color_indices[c]\n\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n        add (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) to the result list\n        mark used_left[left_idx] = True\n        mark used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, this approach would not work because, for example, the same left index may appear in multiple colors. However, since the left indices are stored in the left_color_indices for their color, and once they are marked as used, they will not be considered again.\n\nBut this approach may not work because, for example, the same left index could be in multiple color lists (but no, because each left boot is in exactly one color list, depending on its color).\n\nYes, because each left boot is in exactly one color list (based on its color). So, once we process the color c, and pair the left indices, they are marked as used and not processed again.\n\nThus, this approach is correct.\n\nBut for the same color processing, the order of processing colors may not matter. For example, processing 'a' first, then 'b', etc.\n\nOnce that is done, the used arrays are updated, and the remaining steps can proceed.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False] * n.\n\nCreate left_color_indices and right_color_indices as defaultdict(list).\n\nFor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n    append i to left_color_indices[l[i]]\n\n    append i to right_color_indices[r[i]]\n\nresult = []\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = left_color_indices[c]\n    right_list = right_color_indices[c]\n\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n        result.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect the remaining lists:\n\nleft_non_q_list = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_non_q_list = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] != '?']\nleft_q_list = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q_list = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] == '?']\n\nThen, pair left_non_q_list with right_q_list:\n\nm = min(len(left_non_q_list), len(right_q_list))\nfor i in range(m):\n    left_idx = left_non_q_list[i]\n    right_idx = right_q_list[i]\n    result.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, pair right_non_q_list with left_q_list:\n\nm = min(len(right_non_q_list), len(left_q_list))\nfor i in range(m):\n    left_idx = left_q_list[i]\n    right_idx = right_non_q_list[i]\n    result.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q_remaining = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] == '?']\n\nm = min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining))\nfor i in range(m):\n    left_idx = left_q_remaining[i]\n    right_idx = right_q_remaining[i]\n    result.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nFinally, output len(result) followed by the pairs.\n\nBut wait, in the third step (pairing right_non_q with left_q), the code uses the left_q_list, which is the list of left boots that are '?', not used. But when we process the right_non_q_list, which are the right boots that are not used and not '?', and pair them with left_q_list (the left '?'), then for each pair, we take right_non_q_list[i] and left_q_list[i].\n\nBut how to ensure that the right_non_q_list and left_q_list have sufficient length?\n\nBut the code takes min(len(right_non_q_list), len(left_q_list)) pairs, so that's okay.\n\nBut this approach may not be optimal. For example, there could be cases where pairing some right_non_q with left_q and others with left_non_q would yield more pairs. However, given the time constraints, this greedy approach is likely to be optimal.\n\nBut why is this approach correct?\n\nBecause in the first step, we paired all same-color non-? boots. Then, for the remaining non-? boots, we pair them with ? on the opposite side. Then, the remaining ?s are paired between themselves.\n\nThis should give the maximum possible pairs.\n\nTesting this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFor example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output is 5 with certain pairs.\n\nBut let's not get into that now. Let's think of possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All left and right are '?'. Then, the maximum pairs is n, and each left is paired with a right. Which the code would handle correctly.\n\nEdge case 2: All left are 'a', and right are 'a'. The code pairs them all.\n\nEdge case 3: Left has 'a' and right has 'b'. No pairs. But if there are ?s, then they can pair.\n\nAnother edge case: left has one 'a', right has one '?'. They can pair. The code would pair them.\n\nAnother case: left has one '?', right has one '?'. Paired.\n\nAnother case: left has one 'a', right has one '?', and left has one '?', right has one 'a'. The code would pair the first 'a' with the right '?', then the left '?' with the right 'a'.\n\nBut what if there are multiple possibilities? The code's approach is to pair the first elements of the lists. Which is acceptable since any valid pairing is allowed.\n\nNow, the code's correctness depends on the order of processing. For example, in the first step, when pairing same color, the order of processing the colors may affect the number of pairs. But no, because for each color, we pair as much as possible, regardless of order.\n\nBut for the same color, the order of the indices in the list may affect which pairs are chosen, but since the problem allows any valid pairing, it's okay.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. But for large n (up to 150,000), creating lists for each color may be memory intensive, but manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for n up to 1.5e5, the code should handle it.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Time for creating the left_color_indices and right_color_indices. For each of the n characters, appending to a list. That's O(n) time.\n\n- Then, for each color in 'a' to 'z', processing the lists. Since there are 26 letters, that's O(n) total.\n\n- Then, the steps for collecting the remaining lists. Each of these steps is O(n).\n\n- Then, pairing steps, which are O(n) in total.\n\nSo overall, the code is O(n) time and space.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut note that in Python, for the first step, we can loop through each color in 'a' to 'z', and for each, process their lists.\n\nBut how to generate the list of colors from 'a' to 'z'? Well, in Python, we can do:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\nBut in code:\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False] * n.\n\nCreate left_color_indices and right_color_indices as defaultdict(list).\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    left_color_indices[l[i]].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    right_color_indices[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, process same color pairs:\n\nresult = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = left_color_indices.get(c, [])\n\n    right_list = right_color_indices.get(c, [])\n\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n        result.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect the remaining lists:\n\nleft_non_q_list = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_non_q_list = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] != '?']\nleft_q_list = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q_list = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] == '?']\n\nThen, pair left_non_q with right_q:\n\nm = min(len(left_non_q_list), len(right_q_list))\n\nfor i in range(m):\n\n    left_idx = left_non_q_list[i]\n\n    right_idx = right_q_list[i]\n\n    result.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, pair right_non_q with left_q:\n\nm = min(len(right_non_q_list), len(left_q_list))\n\nfor i in range",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of left and right boots based on their colors. A boot's color can be a specific letter or a wildcard ('?'), which can pair with any color. The goal is to determine the maximum number of such pairs and output the indices of the boots forming these pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Same Color Pairing**: First, we pair left boots with right boots that have the same specific color. This is done by iterating through each possible color (from 'a' to 'z') and pairing as many left and right boots as possible.\n2. **Wildcard Pairing**: After handling same-color pairs, we handle wildcards ('?').
