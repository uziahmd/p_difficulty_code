Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair. \n\nSo, first, I need to figure out how to pair them optimally. Let's think about the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') can only pair with another 'a' or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'. \n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. Maybe we can first pair the specific colors with each other, then use the question marks to fill in the remaining gaps. But how?\n\nLet's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots that have the same specific color. For example, if there's a left boot with 'a' and a right boot with 'a', pair them. But since there might be multiple instances, we need to count how many of each color are present on both sides.\n\nBut wait, the order matters here. Because for each color, the number of pairs we can make is the minimum of the count of that color on the left and on the right. However, once these are paired, the question marks can be used for the leftovers.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. For example, some colors may have more on one side than the other. Then the question marks can be used to pair with those excess colors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should first pair as many specific colors as possible, then use the question marks to pair with the remaining specific colors and each other.\n\nBut how do we manage the pairing process efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- For each color (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have that color (left_count), and how many right boots have that color (right_count). For each such color, the number of pairs we can make is min(left_count, right_count). But once we pair those, the remaining left and right boots for that color can't be paired with others except with '?'.\n\nBut wait, no. Suppose for color 'a', there are 3 left and 2 right. So we can pair 2 of them. The remaining left 'a's can't be paired with anything except with '?', but the right ones can be paired with '?'.\n\nSo maybe the steps are:\n\n1. For all colors except '?', pair as many as possible between left and right. For each color c, take the min of left[c] and right[c], and add that to the total. Then, subtract those from left and right counts.\n\nBut wait, this might not be optimal. Because maybe pairing some left 'a's with right '?'s could allow more overall pairs. Hmm. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to first pair the non-question mark colors where possible, and then use the question marks to pair with the remaining non-question marks and each other.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have:\n\nLeft: [a, a, ?]\nRight: [a, ?, ?]\n\nIf we pair the two a's (left 0 and right 0), then the left has one a and one ?, and the right has two ?. Then we can pair the left a with a right ?, and the left ? with a right ?. Total of 3 pairs.\n\nAlternatively, if we pair the left a's with the right ?, then maybe we can pair two a's with two ?s (but how?), but then the right a would be left. But that would give 2 pairs. So the first approach is better.\n\nSo, pairing specific colors first is better. So the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFirst, process all specific colors (non-?) and pair them as much as possible. Then, use the remaining question marks on left and right to pair with remaining specific colors and each other.\n\nBut how to track which left and right boots are available for pairing.\n\nBut since the problem requires us to output the actual pairs, not just the count, we need to track the indices of the boots and pair them accordingly.\n\nSo here's the idea:\n\nWe can create for each color (excluding '?') a list of indices where that color appears on the left and on the right.\n\nThen, for each color c (not ?), we can pair the left and right boots of that color. For example, if there are m left boots of c and n right boots of c, we can pair min(m, n) of them. Let's say we pair them in the order they appear.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired with same color) can be paired with ?s.\n\nBut then, the ?s can be used to pair with the remaining specific colors and also with other ?s.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Pair same-colored non-? boots.\n\n2. For the remaining left boots (which have non-? colors) and right boots (same), pair them with ?s.\n\n3. Pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about data structures. For each color, we can have lists of indices for left and right.\n\nBut since we need to pair them, maybe we can process the colors in some order. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each color c (excluding '?'), we can collect all left indices and right indices. For example, left_colors[c] = list of indices where l[i] == c. Similarly for right_colors.\n\nThen, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(len(left_colors[c]), len(right_colors[c])). We can pair them. But how to choose which left and right indices to pair? Well, for the purpose of maximum pairs, it doesn't matter which ones we choose, as long as we pair as many as possible. So we can pair the first x elements from left and right lists.\n\nBut once we pair them, we need to remove those from the left and right lists. Wait, but maybe it's easier to keep track of which indices have been used already.\n\nAlternatively, we can create two arrays (for left and right) that indicate whether a boot is available for pairing. Initially, all are available. Then, for each color, we pair the available ones.\n\nBut for large n (up to 150,000), we need an efficient way.\n\nBut perhaps, for the first step, we can iterate through each color (except ?), and for each, pair the left and right boots of that color. Once paired, mark those indices as used.\n\nThen, for the second step, we can collect all remaining left boots (those that are not used yet and have non-? color) and pair them with right boots that are ? and not yet used. Similarly for the other direction. And then pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, after pairing the same-colored non-? boots, we can collect:\n\n- left_non_q: list of left boots that are not ? and not yet paired.\n\n- right_non_q: list of right boots that are not ? and not yet paired.\n\n- left_q: list of left boots that are ? and not yet paired.\n\n- right_q: list of right boots that are ? and not yet paired.\n\nThen, for the next step, we can pair left_non_q with right_q and vice versa. For example, for each left_non_q boot (color c), we can pair it with a right_q boot. Since the right_q can be any color, so each left_non_q can be paired with a right_q. Similarly, each right_non_q can be paired with a left_q.\n\nBut how many such pairs can we make?\n\nThe number is the minimum between (number of left_non_q + number of right_non_q) and (number of left_q + number of right_q) ?\n\nNo, because each left_non_q can pair with a right_q, and each right_non_q can pair with a left_q. So the total possible is min( len(left_non_q) + len(right_non_q), len(left_q) + len(right_q) ) ?\n\nBut perhaps not. Because for example, if there are 3 left_non_q and 2 right_q, then we can pair 2 of them. Then, the remaining left_non_q can't be paired unless there are left_q to pair with right_non_q.\n\nBut perhaps the way to maximize is to pair as many left_non_q with right_q and right_non_q with left_q as possible.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\nFor the remaining non-? boots (left_non_q and right_non_q), pair them with ?s on the opposite side.\n\nLet me think of this as:\n\nEach left_non_q can be paired with a right_q (since ? is compatible with any color).\n\nEach right_non_q can be paired with a left_q.\n\nSo, the number of such pairs is min( len(left_non_q), len(right_q) ) + min( len(right_non_q), len(left_q) )\n\nBut after pairing those, the remaining ?s can be paired between left and right. The number of such pairs is min( len(left_q) - (number used in previous step), len(right_q) - ... )\n\nBut how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, after pairing same-colored non-? boots, the remaining left and right boots are:\n\nLeft boots: either ? or non-? (but not paired yet)\n\nRight boots: same.\n\nSo, for the next step, we can collect all left ? and non-? (unpaired), and same for right.\n\nThen, for each left non-? boot (unpaired), we can try to pair it with a right ? (unpaired). Similarly, for each right non-? boot (unpaired), pair with a left ? (unpaired).\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining ?s can be paired between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose after step 1, we have:\n\nLeft has 2 non-? (say, color 'a') and 3 ?.\n\nRight has 1 non-? (color 'b') and 4 ?.\n\nIn step 2:\n\nPair the 2 left non-? (a) with 2 right ?s. Then, pair the 1 right non-? (b) with 1 left ?. Now, left has 3-1=2 ?s left, and right has 4-2=2 ?s left. Then, pair the 2 left ? with 2 right ?.\n\nTotal pairs added: 2+1+2=5.\n\nSo, the approach is to first pair left non-? with right ?, and right non-? with left ?. Then pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, for this, perhaps:\n\n- Collect all unpaired left non-? boots (call them L_non_q) and unpaired right non-? boots (R_non_q).\n\n- Collect unpaired left ? (L_q) and unpaired right ? (R_q).\n\nThen, for each boot in L_non_q, pair with R_q (as long as R_q has available).\n\nSimilarly for R_non_q and L_q.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining L_q and R_q can be paired as min(len(L_q), len(R_q)) pairs.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nNow, the problem is that we need to track which boots are used, and which are not. So perhaps, for each boot, we can have a boolean array indicating if it's used or not.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right arrays of size n, all False.\n\nThen:\n\nStep 1: For each color c (excluding '?'), pair the left and right boots of that color. For example, for color c, collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used. Similarly for right. Then, pair as many as possible. For each pair, mark them as used.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently. For example, for each color c, we can have a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, for the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)), we can pair them. For example, for i in range(min(len(left_list), len(right_list))), pair left_list[i] with right_list[i].\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, and for each color, it's manageable.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, we have some used boots.\n\nThen, step 2: collect all left boots not used, which are non-? (i.e., l[i] != '?'). Let's call this list L_non_q. Similarly, collect R_non_q (right boots not used, and r[i] != '?').\n\nAlso, collect L_q (left boots not used, l[i] == '?'), and R_q (right boots not used, r[i] == '?').\n\nThen, for step 2a: pair L_non_q with R_q. For each left boot in L_non_q, pair with a right boot in R_q. How many can we pair? The minimum between len(L_non_q) and len(R_q). So, for each such pair, take the first elements from each list.\n\nSimilarly, step 2b: pair R_non_q with L_q. Take min(len(R_non_q), len(L_q)) pairs.\n\nAfter that, the remaining L_q and R_q can be paired as min(len(L_q_remaining), len(R_q_remaining)) pairs.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIn code:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nCollect L_non_q = [i for i in 0..n-1 if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nSimilarly for R_non_q, L_q, R_q.\n\nThen:\n\npair_L_non_q_with_R_q = min(len(L_non_q), len(R_q))\nTake the first pair_L_non_q_with_R_q elements from L_non_q and R_q, pair them.\n\nSimilarly for R_non_q and L_q.\n\nThen, the remaining L_q and R_q can be paired as min(len(L_q_remaining), len(R_q_remaining)).\n\nBut how to track which elements are used after these steps.\n\nSo, for each of these steps, we need to iterate through the lists and mark the indices as used.\n\nBut how to generate these lists. For example, for L_non_q, we can collect all indices where l[i] is not '?' and not used.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps during step 1, we can build for each color the list of indices, and then process them.\n\nBut perhaps, for code, the following approach can be taken:\n\nFirst, process same-color pairs.\n\nThen, collect all left and right indices that are not used and have specific colors.\n\nThen, process the pairing between left non-? and right ?.\n\nThen, process the pairing between right non-? and left ?.\n\nThen, process the pairing between left ? and right ?.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as arrays of booleans, size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nCreate a dictionary for left colors (excluding ?) and right colors (excluding ?). For example, left_counts is a defaultdict(list), where for each color c, left_counts[c] contains the list of indices i where l[i] == c and not used yet. Similarly for right_counts.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can first pre-process all the left and right colors, and then for each color c, process the pairs.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if l[i] != '?':\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n    if r[i] != '?':\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map, we can process pairs. Wait, but this is not exactly correct. Because for each color c, we need to pair the left and right boots of that color. For example, for color c, the number of pairs is min(len(left_color_map[c]), len(right_color_map[c])).\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, for each color c, take the first x elements from left and right lists, where x is the min.\n\nBut then, after pairing, we need to mark those indices as used. However, the problem is that in this approach, the left and right lists are built before any pairing. So, perhaps this is not the right way.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, the left and right lists are built for all the non-? colors. Then, for each color, we can pair the left and right boots of that color. But once paired, we need to mark those indices as used so that they are not considered again in other steps.\n\nBut how to track which indices have been used. Because, for example, if we pair a left index i with a right index j, then both are marked as used.\n\nSo, perhaps, the code for step 1 would be:\n\nfor c in all colors (except '?'):\n\n    left_list = left_color_map[c]\n    right_list = right_color_map[c]\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n        # pair them\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n        add to the answer list (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\nBut this is not entirely correct. Because, for example, if a color is present in both left and right, but after pairing, the left and right lists for that color are modified. However, in the code above, the left_list and right_list are fixed once built. So, perhaps the code is okay.\n\nWait, but the left_color_map and right_color_map are built before processing. So, for example, if there are multiple colors, and for each color, we process the pairs, but once a left index is used, it can't be used again in other color pairs. However, since in the left_color_map, the list contains only the non-? colors, and once those are paired, they are marked as used and not considered in other steps.\n\nBut this approach would miss some cases where a left boot is not paired with a same-color right boot, but could be paired with a ?.\n\nWait, no. Because in this approach, the same-color pairs are processed first. Then, the remaining non-? boots are handled in steps 2a and 2b.\n\nBut the problem is that the code above would not work as written. Because the left_color_map and right_color_map are built once, and for each color, the code tries to pair as many as possible. However, once a left or right boot is used in a pair, it's not available anymore. However, in this approach, the left and right lists are static. So, for example, if a left boot is paired with a right boot of same color, then the same left boot can't be used again. However, the code above would process all colors, and for each, pair as per the initial lists. But this would lead to overcounting, because the same left boot may be in multiple color lists (if it's in a color that's processed multiple times? No, because each left boot is in exactly one color list (the color of the boot). So, once a left boot is used in a pair, it's not part of any other color's list. So, the code is okay.\n\nBut how to collect the left_color_map and right_color_map. Because in the initial code, the left_color_map is built with all non-? left boots. So, when we process a color c, the left_list and right_list contain all the indices for that color. Then, during pairing, some of them are marked as used, and thus not considered in other steps.\n\nBut this approach would not account for the fact that, after pairing some same-color boots, the remaining ones can be paired with ?s. So, the code for step 1 is okay.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, then we need to collect the remaining non-? boots (those not used) and process them with the ?s.\n\nSo, for step 2a: pair left non-? (not used) with right ? (not used).\n\nTo collect these, we can:\n\nleft_non_q = []\nright_q = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?':\n        left_non_q.append(i)\n    if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?':\n        right_q.append(i)\n\nSimilarly for right_non_q and left_q.\n\nThen, the number of pairs we can make here is min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q)).\n\nFor each pair, take the first elements from left_non_q and right_q, and mark them as used.\n\nSame for right_non_q and left_q.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q and right_q, pair them as min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nBut how to collect the left_q and right_q.\n\nSo, after step 1:\n\nCollect:\n\nleft_non_q = list of indices where l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]\n\nright_non_q = list of indices where r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]\n\nleft_q = list of indices where l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]\n\nright_q = list of indices where r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]\n\nThen:\n\nfor step 2a:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))):\n\n    pair left_non_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nSimilarly, step 2b:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q))):\n\n    pair right_non_q[i] with left_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nThen, step 3:\n\nremaining_left_q = [indices in left_q not used in step 2a or 2b]\n\nremaining_right_q = [indices in right_q not used in step 2a or 2b]\n\nthen, pair as many as possible between them.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q.\n\nBut perhaps, after step 2a and 2b, the left_q and right_q have some elements left. So, for step 3, we can take the remaining left_q and right_q, and pair them.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nafter step 2a and 2b:\n\nnew_left_q = [indices in left_q that were not used in step 2a or 2b]\n\nnew_right_q = [indices in right_q that were not used in step 2a or 2b]\n\nthen, for i in range(min(len(new_left_q), len(new_right_q))):\n\n    pair new_left_q[i] with new_right_q[i]\n\nBut how to track which elements are used.\n\nBut in code, during step 2a, when we pair left_non_q and right_q, we can iterate over the indices in left_non_q and right_q and mark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for step 2b.\n\nSo, putting all together.\n\nNow, the code needs to collect all the pairs in a list.\n\nBut how to handle the indices. For example, in step 1, when pairing same-color boots, we can iterate through each color and pair the first min elements.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, building the left_color_map and right_color_map may take O(n) time.\n\nNow, considering that the constraints are up to 150,000, the code must be O(n) time.\n\nNow, the code outline in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as lists of False.\n\nInitialize answer list.\n\nProcess step 1:\n\nCreate left_color_map and right_color_map.\n\nleft_color_map is a defaultdict(list) where for each color c (not '?'), we have a list of indices.\n\nSimilarly for right_color_map.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map:\n\n    if c is in right_color_map:\n\n        left_list = left_color_map[c]\n\n        right_list = right_color_map[c]\n\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n            add (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) to answer.\n\nBut wait, this approach may not be correct. Because for a color c, if it's present in both left and right, but the code processes it once. But what if a color is present in both left and right, but the code processes it once. However, the code would process all colors in left_color_map, which includes all colors present in left (non-?).\n\nBut perhaps, for example, for color 'a', left has 3 and right has 2, so we pair 2. Then, the remaining left 'a's are not used, and will be processed in step 2a.\n\nBut this approach would work.\n\nBut the problem is that the code as written would process each color once. However, the left_color_map and right_color_map are built before any pairing. So, for example, if a color is present in both left and right, the code would process it once, but the same color may be processed again if it's present in another way. But no, because the left_color_map contains all the non-? left boots, and the code loops through each color in left_color_map, which is all the colors in the left.\n\nBut this approach may not be correct. Because for example, suppose color 'a' is present in both left and right. The code processes the color 'a' once, and pairs the left and right boots. But what if the same color is processed again? No, because the code loops through the keys of left_color_map once. So, the code would process each color once.\n\nBut perhaps, the code should loop through all possible colors (including those in right_color_map but not in left_color_map). However, since for a color c, if it's not in left_color_map, then there are no left boots of that color, so no pairing is possible. Hence, the code is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the code should loop through all possible colors (like all lowercase letters) and check if they are present in both left and right. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, the code can iterate through the keys of left_color_map and check if they are present in right_color_map.\n\nBut in practice, the code above would process all colors that are present in left (non-?), and for each, if they are also present in right (non-?), then pair as many as possible.\n\nBut perhaps, the code should process all colors, including those that are present in right but not in left. However, for those, there's no left boots, so no pairing.\n\nSo, the code for step 1 is okay.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, then step 2a, 2b, and 3.\n\nBut how to collect the left_non_q, etc.\n\nSo, after step 1, for step 2:\n\nCollect left_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right_non_q, left_q, right_q.\n\nThen, for step 2a:\n\nTake the first min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\nFor example:\n\npairs_a = min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(pairs_a):\n\n    left_idx = left_non_q[i]\n\n    right_idx = right_q[i]\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    answer.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\nSimilarly for step 2b:\n\npairs_b = min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q))\n\nfor i in range(pairs_b):\n\n    right_idx = right_non_q[i]\n\n    left_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    answer.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\nThen, for step 3, collect the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not used_left[i]]\n\nremaining_right_q = [i for i in right_q if not used_right[i]]\n\npairs_c = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q))\n\nfor i in range(pairs_c):\n\n    left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n\n    right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    answer.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\nBut how to collect left_q and right_q. Because in step 2, the left_q and right_q are collected before processing step 2a and 2b. So, perhaps:\n\nAfter step 1, collect:\n\nleft_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, process step 2a as above.\n\nBut in code, how to collect left_q and right_q.\n\nBut this would take O(n) time for each collection.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output is 5, with certain pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly compute that.\n\nAnother example:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n7\n\nabaca?b\n\nzabbbcc\n\nOutput is 5.\n\nBut perhaps the code would process that.\n\nBut how about the case where there are overlapping colors.\n\nNow, what about the case where a left ? can be paired with a right ?.\n\nYes, step 3 handles that.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the order in which we process the colors in step 1? For example, if a color is processed first, and pairs are made, but perhaps there's a better way. However, since all same-color pairs are being made, the order does not affect the maximum count. So, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python efficiently.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, the code's time complexity is O(n) for each step. For example:\n\nStep 1: O(n) to build the left_color_map and right_color_map. Then, for each color, O(k) where k is the number of elements in the lists. Overall, O(n) time.\n\nSteps 2a, 2b, 3: O(n) time.\n\nThus, the code is efficient.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut how to read the inputs. Wait, the first example given in the problem statement shows that the input is given as a list of test cases. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the user provided a sample input that seems to have multiple test cases. But according to the problem description, the input is for a single test case. Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains l.\n\nThird line contains r.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem seems to be multiple test cases. However, perhaps that was a formatting error. For example, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but the actual input for the problem is a single test case. So, the code should read n, l, r from standard input.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem seems to have four test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input, but the actual code should read one test case per run.\n\nSo, the code should read n, then l, then r.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for example, the first input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nWhich seems to be four separate test cases. But the problem's actual input format is for one test case. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input, and the actual code should read a single test case.\n\nThus, the code should read:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l.\n\nRead r.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut now, the code.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nBut for handling large n, using lists for used_left and used_right.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    # Read n, l, r\n    # However, the input is read as lines.

Because for the left_color_map and right_color_map, the code is built with all non-? characters. However, during step 1, when we process each color, the code checks if it exists in right_color_map. However, in the code above, for each color in left_color_map, we check if it is in right_color_map. However, the left_color_map may contain colors that are not present in the right. But that's okay. For example, if a color is present in left but not in right, then nothing is done.\n\nBut the code for step 1 is correct.\n\nBut what about the case where a color is present in both left and right, but the code processes it once. For example, the code loops through all colors in left_color_map, and for each, if present in right_color_map, pairs them.\n\nBut this is correct.\n\nBut the code for step 1 may have a problem. Because the left_color_map and right_color_map are built before any pairing. So, for example, if a color is present in both left and right, but after pairing some of them, the remaining ones are not considered again. Which is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10, l='codeforces', r='dodivthree'\n\nBut let's see:\n\nl is 'c o d e f o r c e s' (indices 0-9)\n\nr is 'd o d i v t h r e e' ?\n\nNot sure, but the code should compute the maximum",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots based on their colors. Each boot can be either a specific color (denoted by a lowercase letter) or an indefinite color (denoted by a question mark '?'). A specific color is compatible with itself or an indefinite color, while an indefinite color is compatible with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Same Color Pairing**: First, pair all left boots with right boots that have the same specific color. This ensures that we maximize the use of specific color matches.\n2. **Indefinite Color Pairing**: After handling specific color pairs, use the remaining indefinite color boots (marked by '?') to pair with the remaining specific color boots. This ensures that we utilize the flexibility of indefinite colors to cover leftover specific color boots.\n3. **Remaining Indefinite Pairs**: Finally, pair any remaining indefinite color boots between left and right boots. This step ensures that we make use of all possible indefinite color pairings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = data[1]\n    r = data[2]\n\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    answer = []\n\n    # Step 1: Pair same color non-? boots\n    left_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    # Iterate over all colors in left_color_map\n    for color in left_color_map:\n        if color in right_color_map:\n            left_list = left_color_map[color]\n            right_list = right_color_map[color]\n            num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(num_pairs):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                used_left[left_idx] = True\n                used_right[right_idx] = True\n                answer.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n\n    # Step 2: collect remaining non-? and ?\n    left_non_q = []\n    right_non_q = []\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            if l[i] != '?':\n                left_non_q.append(i)\n            else:\n                left_q.append(i)\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            if r[i] != '?':\n                right_non_q.append(i)\n            else:\n                right_q.append(i)\n\n    # Step 2a: pair left_non_q with right_q\n    min_a = min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(min_a):\n        left_idx = left_non_q[i]\n        right_idx = right_q[i]\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n        answer.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n\n    # Step 2b: pair right_non_q with left_q\n    min_b = min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q))\n    for i in range(min_b):\n        right_idx = right_non_q[i]\n        left_idx = left_q[i]\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n        answer.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n\n    # Step 3: pair remaining ?s\n    remaining_left_q = []\n    remaining_right_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n            remaining_left_q.append(i)\n        if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?':\n            remaining_right_q.append(i)\n\n    min_c = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q))\n    for i in range(min_c):\n        left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n        right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n        answer.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n\n    print(len(answer))\n    for a, b in answer:\n        print(a, b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into lines for processing.\n2. **Color Mapping**: We create mappings for both left and right boots based on their colors, excluding indefinite colors ('?').\n3. **Same Color Pairing**: For each color present in both left and right boots, we pair them up to the maximum extent possible.\n4. **Indefinite Pairing**: After handling specific color pairs, we use indefinite color boots to pair with remaining specific color boots.\n5. **Final Indefinite Pairs**: Finally, any remaining indefinite color boots are paired together to maximize the total number of pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently utilize all possible compatible pairs, leveraging both specific and indefinite color rules to achieve the optimal solution.",
