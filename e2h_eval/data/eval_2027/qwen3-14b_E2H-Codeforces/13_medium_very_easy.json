For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, let me understand the definitions again. For a major triad, there must be an ordering X, Y, Z where X to Y is 4 semitones, Y to Z is 3. For minor, the distances are 3 and 4 respectively. The total between X and Z would be 7 in both cases, but that's probably not needed here.\n\nSo the approach is: for the three given notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the distances), and for each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut how do I calculate the distance between two notes?\n\nThe notes are in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its position in this list. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, ..., H is 11. Then, the distance from note A to note B is (B - A) mod 12? Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between C and E, which is 4 semitones. Let's see: C is 0, E is 4. So 4-0 =4. But if we have E to C, then the distance is (C - E + 12) mod 12? Wait, no. Because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So if you have two notes, the distance is calculated as (upper - lower) mod 12? Or maybe not mod 12, but considering the cyclic nature.\n\nWait, the problem says that between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone. So the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. Between C and D is 2, etc. So for two notes, the distance is (position of Y - position of X) mod 12? Wait, but when you have X and Y, if X is before Y in the list, then the distance is Y - X. But if Y is before X, then the distance would be (Y + 12 - X) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, if you have X and Y, then the distance is the number of semitones you move upwards from X to reach Y. So if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then moving up from E to C would require going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 semitones. So the distance is (Y - X + 12) % 12? No, wait. Because (Y - X) mod 12 would be (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. So that's correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, but in the problem statement, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. So for X being E and Y being C, the distance is (C's position - E's position) mod 12? Which would be (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. So that's correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Wait, but if Y is higher than X, then it's Y - X. If Y is lower, then (Y - X) mod 12 would be negative, but adding 12 to make it positive. So for example, X is E (4), Y is C (0): (0 -4) = -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper, so if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So yes.\n\nSo first, I need to create a mapping from note names to their positions. Let's see:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Let me index them from 0 to 11.\n\nSo:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but what about the note H? Because in some notations, B is the same as H. Oh, right, the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is the 12th note. Wait, the list is 12 elements. So the order is:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nSo for example, H is 11, and then the next note is C (0).\n\nSo for a given note, I can get its position. So I need a dictionary that maps each note name to its index. For example, note_map['C'] = 0, note_map['C#'] = 1, etc.\n\nOnce I have that, for any two notes, I can compute their distance.\n\nNow, for the three notes in the input, I need to check all permutations of the three notes. Because the order matters for checking the major and minor conditions.\n\nFor example, given three notes, say, X, Y, Z, I need to check all possible orderings (permutations) of these three notes. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 semitones, and second to third is 3 (for major). Or for minor, first to second is 3 and second to third is 4.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, there are multiple permutations. For example, for three distinct notes, there are 6 permutations. However, since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, perhaps we can find if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations (each possible order of the three notes).\n\n- For each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor criteria.\n\n- If any permutation meets the major criteria, then output 'major'.\n\n- Similarly for minor.\n\n- If neither, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Well, in Python, itertools.permutations can generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all permutations and see if any of them meet the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the input: three notes. For example, input is a list of three strings, like ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\n2. Create a note_map dictionary that maps each note to its index.\n\n3. For each permutation of the three notes:\n\n   a. Check for major: distance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3.\n\n   b. Check for minor: distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4.\n\n4. If any permutation satisfies major, return 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, return 'strange'.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two notes?\n\nFor two notes, say, a and b, the distance is (note_map[b] - note_map[a]) % 12. Wait, but in the example given:\n\nFor the first example input, 'C E G' — the permutation is [C, E, G]. Let's compute the distances.\n\ndistance between C and E: E is index 4, C is 0. 4-0=4. So that's correct. Then E to G: G is 7. 7 -4=3. So yes, that's major.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' — the permutation is B, C#, F. Let's compute:\n\nB is index 10. C# is 1. So distance from B to C#: (1 -10) mod 12 is ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then C# to F: F is 5. 5 -1 =4. So that's 3 and 4, which is minor.\n\nSo the code needs to compute the distances correctly.\n\nSo, for each permutation, for the first two notes, compute the distance between first and second. Then between second and third.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, create the note_map. Let's create a list of the notes in order, then assign each index.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, note_map = {note: index for index, note in enumerate(notes_order)}.\n\nBut wait, in the input, the notes are given in the format like 'C', 'C#', 'D', etc. So that's correct.\n\nNow, for the input, the user gives three notes. For example, in the first sample input, it's ['C E G'].\n\nSo, for each of the three notes, we can split the input string into a list. For example, input is read as a line, split into three elements.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead the input line. For example, input is read via input().split().\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of three strings, but in the actual code, the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, the sample input is:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is the only line contains 3 space-separated notes. So for example, the sample input is:\n\nC E G\n\nand another input line is C# B F, etc. But the sample shows that the input is given as a list of three elements, but that's probably a formatting error. The problem says that the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. So for example, the sample input is:\n\nC E G\n\nand the output is major.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is written as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], which is probably a way to represent three test cases. But the actual code should read a single line of input, which is three notes.\n\nSo the code will read input().split(), which splits the line into three elements.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is 'C E G', then input().split() gives ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nNow, the code needs to process that.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\n- Read the three notes into a list, say, notes = input().split()\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three notes. Since the order matters, for each permutation, check the conditions.\n\nBut in Python, itertools.permutations(notes, 3) will generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut since the three notes are unique (the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, but perhaps the input can have duplicates? Well, the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But since the input is three notes, perhaps they can be same? But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, the problem says that the input is a triad, which is a set of three notes. But perhaps the input may have duplicates? Well, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So perhaps the code can proceed regardless.\n\nBut for the purposes of the code, even if there are duplicates, the code can check all permutations.\n\nBut for example, if all three notes are same, then the distances between them would be zero, so no major or minor.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can proceed.\n\nNow, for each permutation in permutations(notes):\n\nCheck for major: distance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3.\n\nCheck for minor: distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'.\n\nSimilarly for minor.\n\nOnce any permutation is found to satisfy major or minor, we can return the corresponding result.\n\nSo the code can loop through all permutations, check for major and minor, and if found, return the answer.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImport itertools.permutations.\n\nCreate the note_map.\n\nThen:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (note_map[y] - note_map[x]) % 12\n\n    d2 = (note_map[z] - note_map[y]) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, print \"strange\".\n\nBut wait, the code has to check all permutations. For example, if there are multiple permutations that satisfy the condition, but the code returns on the first occurrence. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there can't be both a major and minor possibility. So once any permutation meets the major or minor condition, we can return immediately.\n\nSo the code can check each permutation in order, and if any permutation meets the major condition, output 'major' and exit. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut what about permutations that are the same? For example, if the same note is present multiple times. But the code would still process all permutations.\n\nBut for the code, the permutations function will generate all possible orderings, even if there are duplicates. However, since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, the code can process them.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut first, the note_map. Let's define the list of notes in order.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nBut wait, what about the note 'H'? In the problem description, the list is given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the 12th note is H, which is index 11.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    # Compute distance between x and y\n\n    d1 = (note_map[y] - note_map[x]) % 12\n\n    # Compute distance between y and z\n\n    d2 = (note_map[z] - note_map[y]) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the same note is repeated? For example, if all three are C. Then, the distances would be 0, 0. So no match. So the code would output strange.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. So the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nC E G\n\nPermutation (C, E, G):\n\nd1 is 4-0=4. d2 is 7-4=3. So yes, major. So code outputs 'major'.\n\nAnother sample input: C# B F.\n\nLet's see. The code will generate permutations. One of them is B, C#, F.\n\nnote_map[B] is 10. C# is 1. So d1 is (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then, C# (1) to F (5): 5-1=4. So d1=3, d2=4. So minor. So code outputs 'minor'.\n\nThird sample input: A B H.\n\nNotes are A, B, H.\n\nLet's see all permutations.\n\nLet's take A, B, H:\n\ndistance between A (9) and B (10) is 1. Then between B (10) and H (11): 1. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B.\n\ndistance between A (9) and H (11): 2. Then between H (11) and B (10): (10 - 11) mod 12 = ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. Distance between B (10) and A (9): (9-10) mod 12 = 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A. Distance between B and H: 11-10=1. Then H to A: 9 - 11 = -2 mod 12 = 10. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B. Distance H (11) to A (9): (9 - 11) mod 12 = 10. Then A to B is 1. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A. Distance H to B: 10 - 11 mod 12 is ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11. Then B to A is 9 -10 mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the criteria. So output is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same note is present multiple times?\n\nFor example, input is C C C. All permutations would have x, y, z as C, C, C. The distances between them are 0. So no match. Output 'strange'.\n\nAnother example: C, E, G#.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's say C, E, G#. The distance between C and E is 4. Then E to G# is 8 - 4 = 4? Wait, note_map for G# is 8? Let's see:\n\nnotes_order is:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nSo E is 4, G# is 8. So distance between E and G# is 8-4=4. So d1 is 4, d2 is 4. Not matching major (needs 3). So not major. Then check for minor: d1 is 4, not 3. So no.\n\nOther permutations: E, C, G#. Distance between E and C is (note_map[C] - note_map[E]) mod 12 = (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. So d1 is 8. Not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: C, G#, E. d1 between C and G# is 8-0=8. Not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nSo output strange.\n\nAnother example: C, E, B.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's see:\n\nC, E, B. d1 is 4, then E to B is 10-4=6. No.\n\nAnother permutation: E, B, C. d1 between E and B is 10-4=6. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, C, E. d1 between B and C is (0 - 10) mod 12 = 2. Then C to E is 4. So d1 is 2, d2 is 4. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: C, B, E. d1 between C and B is 10 -0 =10? Wait, no. Wait, note_map[B] is 10. note_map[C] is 0. So distance from C to B is (10 -0) mod 12 = 10. Then from B to E: E is 4. (4 -10) mod 12 = ( -6 ) mod 12 = 6. So 10 and 6. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C, B. d1 between E and C is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Then C to B is 10-0=10 mod 12? No, (B's position is 10, C is 0. So distance is (10 -0) mod 12? No. Wait, the distance between C and B is (B's position - C's position) mod 12. So 10 - 0 =10. Which is 10. So d1 is 8, d2 is 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, E, C. d1 between B and E: 4 -10 = -6 mod 12 = 6. Then E to C: (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. So 6 and 8. Not matching.\n\nNo match. So output strange.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about a minor triad?\n\nTake the example given: C# B F. Let's see.\n\nThe code would generate permutations. One of them is B, C#, F.\n\nnote_map[B] is 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\ndistance between B and C#: (1 -10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then between C# and F: 5 -1 =4. So 3 and 4. So minor.\n\nSo code outputs 'minor'.\n\nAnother example: C, E, G is major.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut need to import permutations from itertools.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (note_map[y] - note_map[x]) % 12\n    d2 = (note_map[z] - note_map[y]) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the exit() function may not be the best. However, for code submission, using sys.exit() would be better, but in practice, the code can use return or break. However, in the code, the code uses exit() which in Python is in the sys module. But in practice, when you call exit(), it's better to import sys and call sys.exit().\n\nBut in the code above, the code uses exit() which may not work. Because in Python, exit() is part of sys module. So in code, perhaps the code should use sys.exit().\n\nBut in the code as written, perhaps the code would raise an error. For example, in the code, the 'exit()' calls would not be available unless the code is in the interactive shell. So, in a script, it's better to use sys.exit().\n\nSo, the code should import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (note_map[y] - note_map[x]) % 12\n    d2 = (note_map[z] - note_map[y]) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nBut for code submission, perhaps the code can use break and flags.\n\nBut the code as written is correct.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nC E G\n\nOutput is major.\n\nAnother sample input: C# B F → minor.\n\nThird sample input: A B H → strange.\n\nSo the code would output the correct results.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, B.\n\nWait, let's check if any permutation is major or minor.\n\nFor example, C, E, B.\n\nCheck permutations:\n\nC, E, B: d1 is 4, d2 is (B's position - E's position) → 10 -4=6 → 6. Not 3. So no.\n\nE, B, C: d1 between E and B is 10-4=6. Then between B and C: 0-10 = -10 mod 12 is 2. Not 3 or 4.\n\nB, C, E: d1 is (C - B) → 0 -10 = -10 mod 12 → 2. Then C to E is 4. So 2 and 4 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: C, B, E. d1 between C and B is (10 -0) mod 12 = 10. Then B to E is 4-10 = -6 mod 12 = 6. No.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C, B. d1 is (C - E) → 0-4 = -4 mod 12 = 8. Then C to B is 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, E, C. d1 between B and E is 4-10 = -6 mod 12 = 6. Then E to C is 8. No.\n\nSo output strange.\n\nAnother test case: C, D#, G → check if major or minor.\n\nC is 0, D# is 3, G is 7.\n\nCheck permutations:\n\nC, D#, G → d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So 3 and 4. So minor. So code would output minor.\n\nWait, because the first distance is 3 (from C to D# is 3 semitones?), let's see:\n\nC is 0, D# is 3. So distance is 3-0=3. Then D# to G is 7-3=4. So yes, 3 and 4 → minor.\n\nSo code would output 'minor'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, G# → check for major?\n\nC to E is 4. E to G# is 8-4=4. So d1=4, d2=4. Not major. So no. So output strange.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Positions**: First, we map each note to its position in the cyclic sequence of 12 musical notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between any two notes.\n2. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three input notes, we check if the distances between consecutive notes in the permutation match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Using modular arithmetic, we compute the distance between two notes as the difference in their positions modulo 12. This accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (note_map[y] - note_map[x]) % 12\n    d2 = (note_map[z] - note_map[y]) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_map` converts each note to its corresponding index in this sequence.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three space-separated notes which are read and stored in a list.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes. For each permutation, we calculate the semitone distances between consecutive notes.\n4. **Distance Criteria**: For a major triad, the distances between the first and second note should be 4 semitones, and between the second and third note should be 3 semitones. For a minor triad, these distances should be 3 and 4 semitones respectively. If any permutation meets these criteria, the corresponding result is printed immediately.\n5. **Default Case**: If no valid permutation is found, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
