Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Hmm. Oh right, the triangle inequality must hold. So for any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe there's a way to simplify that.\n\nWait, the problem states that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z. Wait, no. Because x can be up to B, and y starts from B. So x is between A and B, y is between B and C, and z between C and D. But since x ≤ B ≤ y, then x ≤ y. And since y ≤ C ≤ z, then y ≤ z. So overall, x ≤ y ≤ z. So the triangle inequalities would require that x + y > z. Because in a triangle with sides in order a ≤ b ≤ c, the necessary and sufficient condition is a + b > c.\n\nSo the main condition here is x + y > z. Because if that holds, then the other inequalities (x + z > y and y + z > x) are automatically satisfied since z is larger than or equal to y and x.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D, and x + y > z.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently given the constraints? The numbers can be up to 5e5, so O(N^3) is impossible. Need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the ranges. For each possible x and y, we can find the number of z's that are between max(C, ... ) and D, but also satisfy z < x + y. Wait, since z has to be ≥ C, and also z < x + y. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nBut since x can be up to B and y up to C, and B and C can be up to 5e5, iterating over all x and y would be O(B * C), which for B and C being 5e5 each would be 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. So this approach isn't feasible.\n\nHmm. Need to find a way to compute this more efficiently. Let's think about the constraints again. Since x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C, perhaps we can find for each possible y, the range of x's that can pair with it, and then compute the number of z's accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can precompute for each possible z, the number of (x, y) pairs such that x + y > z, x ≤ B, y ≥ B, y ≤ C, etc. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since z must be ≥ C, and x ≤ B, y ≤ C. Let's think: for a given z, what's the minimum x + y that needs to be greater than z. So for each z in [C, D], we need to count the number of (x, y) pairs where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nBut again, how to compute this for all z?\n\nBut maybe we can find for each z, the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > z, and then sum over all z in [C, D].\n\nBut even that approach might be manageable. Let's see. The total number of z's is up to D - C + 1, which could be up to 5e5. For each z, we need to compute the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy x + y > z.\n\nSo how to compute that efficiently?\n\nThe (x, y) pairs are x in [A, B], y in [B, C]. Let me note that x can be from A to B, and y from B to C. So for each z, we need the number of pairs (x, y) where x + y > z.\n\nLet me think about the total number of possible (x, y) pairs. It's (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). But then subtract those pairs where x + y ≤ z. So for each z, the count is total_pairs - count_pairs_with_sum_leq_z.\n\nBut how to compute count_pairs_with_sum_leq_z?\n\nAlternatively, for a given z, find the number of pairs (x, y) such that x + y > z. Let me think of x and y as variables with ranges:\n\nx ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C]\n\nSo for a fixed z, the sum x + y > z. Let me think about for each x, what is the minimum y that satisfies y > z - x. Since y must be ≥ B and ≤ C.\n\nBut since x can be up to B, and y starts at B, maybe we can find for each x, the lower bound on y.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed x, the minimal y that satisfies y > z - x. But since y must be ≥ B and ≤ C, the valid y's for this x are those in the range [max(B, z - x + 1), C]. The number of such y's is max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nBut again, for each x, this calculation would take O(1) time, but if we have to do this for all x in [A, B], and for each z, that would be O(B) per z. Which for 5e5 z's would be O(B*D) which is 5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5e11 operations. Not feasible.\n\nSo this approach is not efficient enough. Need a better way.\n\nLet me think again. The problem requires that x ≤ B, y ≥ B, and y ≤ C. So for the pair (x, y), x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let me denote the lower and upper bounds for x and y.\n\nLet me consider that for x and y, the sum x + y can range from (A + B) to (B + C). So for a given z, if z is larger than (B + C), then there are no possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy x + y > z. Because the maximum sum is B + C. So for z > B + C, the count is zero. So for those z's, we can ignore them.\n\nSimilarly, if z is less than or equal to A + B, then all possible pairs (x, y) will have x + y ≥ A + B ≥ z + 1? No, wait. If z is less than A + B, then all pairs (x, y) would have x + y ≥ A + B (since x ≥ A and y ≥ B), so x + y ≥ A + B > z. So for these z, all pairs are valid. So the count for those z is the total number of pairs.\n\nSo for each z, the count of (x, y) pairs that satisfy x + y > z depends on the value of z relative to the possible sum ranges.\n\nSo the idea is to find for each z, the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > z.\n\nLet me denote the total number of (x, y) pairs as T = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). Then, the count for a given z is T minus the number of pairs where x + y ≤ z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each z, compute the number of pairs (x, y) where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], and x + y ≤ z. Let's call this value S(z). Then the answer for that z is T - S(z).\n\nBut how to compute S(z) efficiently?\n\nLet me think of S(z) as the number of pairs (x, y) such that x + y ≤ z, x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C].\n\nWe can model this as a double summation. For each x in [A, B], the maximum y that satisfies x + y ≤ z is y_max = min(z - x, C). Also, since y must be ≥ B, the lower bound is B. So for a given x, the number of valid y's is max(0, min(z - x, C) - B + 1) if min(z - x, C) ≥ B. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo S(z) is the sum over x from A to B of max(0, min(z - x, C) - B + 1) if min(z - x, C) >= B.\n\nBut again, calculating this for each z would be O(B) per z. Which is not feasible for large B and D.\n\nAlternative approach: find for each possible z, the sum over x of the number of y's for that x.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a mathematical formula for this sum.\n\nLet me think about for a given z, what is the range of x where z - x ≥ B. Because for x such that z - x ≥ B, then y can be from B to min(z - x, C). Otherwise, there are no valid y's.\n\nSo for x ≤ z - B.\n\nBut x must be in [A, B]. So the x's that contribute to S(z) are those x in [A, x_max], where x_max = min(B, z - B). Because if x > z - B, then z - x < B, so y must be ≥ B, but then x + y ≥ x + B > z - B + B = z. So no solution.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nFor x + y ≤ z and y ≥ B. Then, since y ≥ B, x + B ≤ x + y ≤ z → x ≤ z - B. So x must be ≤ z - B.\n\nTherefore, for x to contribute, x must be ≤ z - B. Also, since x ≥ A, the x's that contribute are in [A, x_max], where x_max = min(B, z - B).\n\nBut z can be as small as C. So when z is small, like less than A + B, then x_max = z - B could be less than A, leading to no solutions. But earlier analysis said that for z ≤ A + B, all pairs (x, y) would have x + y ≥ A + B > z. Therefore, S(z) would be zero. Which would imply that T - S(z) = T, which is correct.\n\nSo, for z < A + B, S(z) = 0. For z >= A + B, we can compute S(z) as sum_{x = A}^{x_max} [number of y's for this x], where x_max = min(B, z - B).\n\nNow, for each x in [A, x_max], the y's are from B to min(z - x, C). Let me denote y_upper = min(z - x, C). So for each x, the count is max(0, y_upper - B + 1) if y_upper >= B.\n\nBut since x <= z - B, then z - x >= B. So y_upper = min(z - x, C). So y_upper is either z - x (if z - x <= C) or C (if z - x >= C).\n\nSo for x in [A, x_max], the number of y's is:\n\nif z - x <= C → y_upper = z - x → count is (z - x - B + 1) = z - x - B + 1 = z - B - x + 1.\n\nElse, count is C - B + 1.\n\nSo the sum S(z) is sum_{x = A}^{x_max} [min(z - x, C) - B + 1] if min(...) >= B, else 0.\n\nBut since x_max is such that x <= z - B, so z - x >= B. So for each x in [A, x_max], min(z -x, C) is either z - x or C.\n\nSo let's split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: z - x <= C → x >= z - C.\n\nCase 2: z - x > C → x < z - C.\n\nSo for x in [A, x_max], we can split into two intervals:\n\nx_low = max(A, z - C + 1) ?\n\nWait, let me think. For x such that z - x <= C → x >= z - C. Because rearranging:\n\nz - x <= C → x >= z - C.\n\nSo for x >= z - C, the term is z - x - B + 1. For x < z - C, the term is C - B + 1.\n\nSo the sum can be split into two parts:\n\nsum_{x in [A, x_max] and x < z - C} (C - B + 1) + sum_{x in [A, x_max] and x >= z - C} (z - x - B + 1).\n\nBut how to compute these two sums efficiently.\n\nLet me define:\n\nthreshold_x = z - C.\n\nSo for x in [A, x_max], if x < threshold_x → contributes (C - B + 1).\n\nOtherwise, contributes (z - x - B + 1).\n\nBut threshold_x may be outside the x range. For example, if z - C is less than A, then all x in [A, x_max] are >= threshold_x. Or if threshold_x is larger than x_max, then all x are < threshold_x.\n\nSo first, find the lower and upper bounds for x.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nlow_x = A\n\nhigh_x = x_max = min(B, z - B)\n\nthreshold_x = z - C\n\nSo the first part of the sum is for x in [low_x, high_x] where x < threshold_x. Let me find the lower and upper limits for this part.\n\nLet x_start = low_x\n\nx_end = min(high_x, threshold_x - 1)\n\nIf x_start > x_end, then this part is zero.\n\nThe number of terms here is (x_end - x_start + 1) if x_end >= x_start, else 0. Each term contributes (C - B + 1). So the sum for this part is count1 * (C - B + 1).\n\nThe second part is x in [max(low_x, threshold_x), high_x]. Let me call this x_start2 = max(low_x, threshold_x), x_end2 = high_x. If x_start2 > x_end2, then this part is zero.\n\nFor each x in this interval, the contribution is (z - x - B + 1) = (z - B + 1 - x). Let's denote this as (K - x), where K = z - B + 1.\n\nSo the sum over x in [a, b] of (K - x) = sum_{x=a}^b K - sum_{x=a}^b x = K*(b - a + 1) - (sum from a to b of x).\n\nSum from a to b of x is (b*(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)*a)/2) = (b + a) * (b - a + 1) / 2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ncount1 = max(0, x_end - x_start + 1) → x_end is min(high_x, threshold_x - 1)\n\nsum_part1 = count1 * (C - B + 1)\n\nsum_part2 = ?\n\nFor the second part, the interval is a = max(low_x, threshold_x), b = high_x.\n\nif a > b → sum_part2 = 0.\n\nElse:\n\nsum_part2 = (K * (b - a + 1)) - ( (a + b) * (b - a + 1) ) // 2 )\n\nwhere K = z - B + 1.\n\nSo combining these two parts gives S(z) = sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\nThis seems manageable. Now, the key is to compute for each z, the value of S(z) using this formula, and then the number of valid (x, y, z) is the sum over all z in [C, D] of (T - S(z)).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nThe problem is that for each z in [C, D], we need to compute S(z) as described above. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, for each z in [C, D], compute x_max = min(B, z - B). If z - B < A, then x_max < A → x_max is less than A, so no x's → S(z) = 0. So in this case, the contribution is T - 0 = T.\n\nBut when z is such that x_max >= A, then proceed with the steps.\n\nBut how many z's are there? Up to D - C + 1. Which is up to 5e5.\n\nFor each z, the steps are O(1), so overall O(D - C + 1) steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute T = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1).\n\nThen, for each z in [C, D], compute the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy x + y > z, which is total_pairs - S(z).\n\nSum all these numbers across all z.\n\nBut how to compute S(z) for each z?\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nFor each z in [C, D]:\n\n    if z < A + B:\n        S(z) = 0\n    else:\n        x_max = min(B, z - B)\n        if x_max < A:\n            S(z) = 0\n        else:\n            threshold_x = z - C\n            low_x = A\n            high_x = x_max\n\n            # compute part1\n            x_end_part1 = min(high_x, threshold_x - 1)\n            x_start_part1 = low_x\n            if x_start_part1 > x_end_part1:\n                count1 = 0\n            else:\n                count1 = x_end_part1 - x_start_part1 + 1\n            sum_part1 = count1 * (C - B + 1)\n\n            # compute part2\n            a = max(low_x, threshold_x)\n            b = high_x\n            if a > b:\n                sum_part2 = 0\n            else:\n                K = z - B + 1\n                n_terms = b - a + 1\n                sum_x = (a + b) * n_terms // 2\n                sum_part2 = K * n_terms - sum_x\n\n            S_z = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\n    then, add (T - S_z) to the answer.\n\nBut wait, for z >= A + B, but even if x_max is less than A, then S(z) is zero. So that case is already handled.\n\nBut when z >= A + B, but x_max is less than A, meaning that z - B < A → z < A + B. But this contradicts the initial condition that z >= A + B. Therefore, for z >= A + B, x_max = min(B, z - B) >= min(B, (A + B) - B) = min(B, A) = A (since A <= B). So x_max >= A. Therefore, for z >= A + B, the x_max >= A. Thus, the check for x_max < A can be skipped in that case.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose z >= A + B. Then z - B >= A → x_max = min(B, z - B) >= A. Because z - B >= A → min(B, ...) is at least A if A <= B. Since A <= B, and z - B >= A implies that z - B >= A. So x_max is at least A. Therefore, in the case where z >= A + B, we can proceed with the calculation.\n\nSo in code, for each z in [C, D], we can:\n\nif z < A + B → contribution is T.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute x_max = min(B, z - B)\n\nthen compute threshold_x = z - C.\n\nproceed with the steps.\n\nBut what about when z is less than A + B? For example, if z is 5, and A + B is 6. Then, all pairs (x, y) have x + y >= A + B = 6 > 5. So for such z, S(z) is zero. So the contribution is T.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nInitialize answer = 0\n\nfor z in C to D:\n\n    if z < A + B:\n\n        ans += T\n\n    else:\n\n        x_max = min(B, z - B)\n\n        threshold_x = z - C\n\n        low_x = A\n\n        high_x = x_max\n\n        # compute part1 and part2\n\n        # part1: x in [low_x, high_x] where x < threshold_x\n\n        x_end_part1 = min(high_x, threshold_x - 1)\n\n        x_start_part1 = low_x\n\n        if x_start_part1 > x_end_part1:\n\n            count1 = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            count1 = x_end_part1 - x_start_part1 + 1\n\n        sum_part1 = count1 * (C - B + 1)\n\n        # part2: x in [max(low_x, threshold_x), high_x]\n\n        a = max(low_x, threshold_x)\n\n        b = high_x\n\n        if a > b:\n\n            sum_part2 = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            K = z - B + 1\n\n            n_terms = b - a + 1\n\n            sum_x = (a + b) * n_terms // 2\n\n            sum_part2 = K * n_terms - sum_x\n\n        S_z = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\n        ans += (T - S_z)\n\nSo this seems manageable.\n\nBut what about when C - B + 1 is zero? Well, since B <= C, C - B + 1 is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, considering the constraints for z. For example, when z is larger than B + C. Then, for x_max = min(B, z - B) = B. Then threshold_x = z - C. For z > B + C, z - C > B → threshold_x > B. So for part1, x_end_part1 is min(high_x (which is B), threshold_x - 1). Since threshold_x is larger than B, threshold_x -1 is larger than B. So x_end_part1 = B. x_start_part1 is A. So count1 is B - A + 1. sum_part1 is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). Then, part2: a = max(A, threshold_x) = threshold_x, which is larger than B. So a > b (since b is B). sum_part2 is zero. So S_z = sum_part1 + 0 = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) = T. Then, T - S_z is zero. Which is correct, because when z > B + C, x + y can't exceed B + C, so x + y > z is impossible. Hence, the contribution for this z is zero.\n\nSo the code handles that case correctly.\n\nAnother example: in the first sample input, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nSo T = (2-1+1) * (3-2+1) = 2 * 2 =4.\n\nFor z in [3,4].\n\nLet's process each z:\n\nz=3:\n\nCheck if z >= A + B = 1 + 2 = 3 → yes.\n\nx_max = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) = 1.\n\nthreshold_x = 3 - 3 = 0.\n\nlow_x = 1, high_x = 1.\n\npart1: x_end_part1 = min(1, 0-1= -1) → -1. So x_start_part1 is 1 > -1 → count1 is 0.\n\npart2: a = max(1, 0) = 1, b=1. So compute K = 3 - 2 +1 = 2. n_terms = 1. sum_x = (1 + 1)*1//2 = 1. sum_part2 = 2*1 -1 = 1. So S_z = 0 +1=1. So contribution is 4 - 1 =3.\n\nz=3 contributes 3.\n\nz=4:\n\nz >= 3. x_max = min(2, 4 -2=2) → 2.\n\nthreshold_x = 4 -3 = 1.\n\nlow_x =1, high_x=2.\n\npart1: x_end_part1 = min(2, 1-1=0) → 0. x_start_part1 is 1. So 1>0 → count1=0.\n\npart2: a = max(1, 1) =1, b=2. K = 4 -2 +1=3.\n\nn_terms =2. sum_x = (1+2)*2/2 = 3. sum_part2 =3*2 -3=3. So S_z=0+3=3. contribution is 4-3=1.\n\nSo total for z=3 and 4 is 3+1=4. Which matches the first sample's output of 4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is 1 2 2 5. So A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5. So T = (2-1+1)*(2-2+1) = 2*1=2.\n\nFor z in [2,5].\n\nLet me check for each z:\n\nz ranges from 2 to 5.\n\nFirst, A + B = 1 + 2 =3. So for z <3 (i.e., z=2), contribution is T=2.\n\nFor z=2: add 2.\n\nFor z=3,4,5:\n\nz=3:\n\nx_max = min(2, 3-2=1) →1.\n\nthreshold_x =3 - 2 =1.\n\nlow_x=1, high_x=1.\n\npart1: x_end_part1 is min(1, 1-1=0) →0. So count1=0.\n\npart2: a = max(1, 1) =1, b=1. K=3-2+1=2. sum_x=1. sum_part2 = 2*1 -1 =1. S_z=1. contribution is 2-1=1.\n\nz=3 adds 1.\n\nz=4:\n\nx_max = min(2, 4-2=2) →2.\n\nthreshold_x =4 -2=2.\n\nlow_x=1, high_x=2.\n\npart1: x_end_part1 = min(2, 2-1=1) →1. x_start_part1=1. count1 =1-1+1=1. sum_part1 =1*(2-2+1) =1*1=1.\n\npart2: a = max(1, 2) =2, b=2. K=4-2+1=3. sum_x=2. sum_part2 =3*1 -2 =1. So S_z=1+1=2. contribution is 2-2=0.\n\nz=4 adds 0.\n\nz=5:\n\nx_max = min(2, 5-2=3) →2.\n\nthreshold_x =5-2=3.\n\nlow_x=1, high_x=2.\n\npart1: x_end_part1 = min(2, 3-1=2) →2. So x_start_part1=1. count1=2-1+1=2. sum_part1 = 2*(2-2+1) = 2*1=2.\n\npart2: a = max(1, 3) =3, which is larger than high_x=2. sum_part2=0. S_z=2. contribution 2-2=0.\n\nSo for z=5, adds 0.\n\nTotal contributions: z=2 (2) + z=3 (1) + z=4 (0) + z=5 (0) → total 3. Which matches the second sample's output of 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut what about when C is less than B? Wait, the problem says that A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So B ≤ C. So C - B +1 is ≥1.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute T = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1).\n\nans = 0\n\nfor z in range(C, D+1):\n\n    if z < (A + B):\n\n        ans += T\n\n    else:\n\n        x_max = min(B, z - B)\n\n        threshold_x = z - C\n\n        low_x = A\n\n        high_x = x_max\n\n        # compute part1\n\n        x_end_part1 = min(high_x, threshold_x - 1)\n\n        x_start_part1 = low_x\n\n        if x_start_part1 > x_end_part1:\n\n            count1 = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            count1 = x_end_part1 - x_start_part1 + 1\n\n        sum_part1 = count1 * (C - B + 1)\n\n        # part2\n\n        a = max(low_x, threshold_x)\n\n        b = high_x\n\n        if a > b:\n\n            sum_part2 = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            K = z - B + 1\n\n            n_terms = b - a + 1\n\n            sum_x = (a + b) * n_terms // 2\n\n            sum_part2 = K * n_terms - sum_x\n\n        S_z = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\n        ans += (T - S_z)\n\nreturn ans.\n\nBut for large D and C, looping from C to D is O(D - C + 1). For D up to 5e5, this is acceptable.\n\nBut what about when D is 5e5 and C is 1? Then D - C + 1 is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nNow, test the third sample input: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nA=B=C=D=500000.\n\nT = (500000 - 500000 +1) * (500000 - 500000 +1) → 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nz ranges from 500000 to 500000 → only one z.\n\nCheck z >= A + B → 500000 + 500000 = 1e6. But z is 500000 < 1e6 → so add T (1). But wait, this is wrong. Wait, according to the sample, the answer is 1. But according to this code, for z=500000, since z < A + B (which is 1e6), we add T (1). So ans is 1. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nBut why? Because for x and y, they are 500000, and z is 500000. So x + y = 1e6 > z (5e5). So the condition holds. So the count is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: when z is exactly A + B. For example, A=1, B=2, z=3. Which was handled correctly.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, for very large ranges (like D up to 5e5), looping from C to D is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input. The input is four integers per test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as multiple lines? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. Wait, the example shows that the input is given as multiple lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the problem statement:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nSo the code should read one line of input, split into four integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nWhich suggests that there are multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as four integers. Wait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nLooking back, the problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D.\n\nSo the input is one line, with four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines. This suggests that perhaps the original problem may have multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects one test case per input.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases, each given in a line. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D ≤ 5e5) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\nSo the input is one line. However, the sample input shows three lines. Which suggests that perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem's original statement may have multiple test cases. However, the user's note says that the problem is \"very easy\", and the code should read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is four integers. So perhaps the code should read a single line of input, and output a single line.\n\nBut the sample input and output shows multiple lines. This is confusing. However, looking back, the user says that the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nOutput:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nBut this may be a formatting mistake. Perhaps the actual input is multiple lines, each representing a test case. But the problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input formatting. However, the problem's note says that the code should read from stdin and print to stdout. So the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each line is a separate test case. However, the original problem may have multiple test cases. But the problem statement doesn't mention that.\n\nThis is a critical point. How to handle this?\n\nWell, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is four integers on the first line. So the code should read one line, process it, and output one line.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the sample input is for three test cases, and the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem statement does not mention multiple test cases. However, in competitive programming problems, sometimes the input may consist of multiple test cases. So perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo it's unclear. However, the sample input shows multiple lines, and the sample output shows multiple lines. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the corresponding result for each.\n\nBut the problem's original statement may not mention this. However, given the sample input and output, this seems to be the case.\n\nSo the code should read all lines from input, split each into four integers, and for each, compute the answer.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute answer and print\n\nBut in the sample input, each line is a test case. So the code should process each line.\n\nBut the problem statement's input says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement, and the actual input has multiple test",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key insight is that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the constraints $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the critical condition simplifies to $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: The sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ are constrained such that $A \\leq x \\leq B$, $B \\leq y \\leq C$, and $C \\leq z \\leq D$.\n2. **Total Valid Pairs**: Calculate the total number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs which is $(B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1)$.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Values of $z$**: For each possible value of $z$ from $C$ to $D$, compute the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs such that $x + y > z$.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Use mathematical insights to efficiently determine the valid pairs without iterating over all possible combinations, leveraging range calculations and summation formulas.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n        ans = 0\n        for z in range(C, D + 1):\n            if z < (A + B):\n                ans += total_pairs\n            else:\n                x_max = min(B, z - B)\n                threshold_x = z - C\n                low_x = A\n                high_x = x_max\n                # Compute part1\n                x_end_part1 = min(high_x, threshold_x - 1)\n                x_start_part1 = low_x\n                if x_start_part1 > x_end_part1:\n                    count1 = 0\n                else:\n                    count1 = x_end_part1 - x_start_part1 + 1\n                sum_part1 = count1 * (C - B + 1)\n                # Compute part2\n                a = max(low_x, threshold_x)\n                b = high_x\n                if a > b:\n                    sum_part2 = 0\n                else:\n                    K = z - B + 1\n                    n_terms = b - a + 1\n                    sum_x = (a + b) * n_terms // 2\n                    sum_part2 = K * n_terms - sum_x\n                S_z = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n                ans += (total_pairs - S_z)\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each line representing a test case with four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Total Valid Pairs Calculation**: The total number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs is calculated once for each test case.\n3. **Iterating Over $z$**: For each $z$ in the range $[C, D]$, we check if it's possible to form valid triangles by ensuring $x + y > z$.\n4. **Efficient Range Calculations**: Using mathematical insights, we split the calculation into two parts to efficiently determine the number of valid pairs for each $z$ without iterating through all possible values of $x$ and $y$.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle large input sizes efficiently, adhering to the constraints and optimizing the computation using range-based arithmetic and summation formulas.",
