Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The goal is to minimize the absolute difference between the angle formed and 'a'. And if there are multiple solutions, any of them is acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to calculate the possible angles that can be formed in a regular polygon. Let's think about the geometry here.\n\nIn a regular n-gon, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But that's the angle between two adjacent sides. However, the problem here is about selecting three vertices such that the angle at v2 is formed by two lines from v2 to v1 and v3. So, this is different from the interior angle of the polygon.\n\nLet me think: For a regular polygon, the central angles (angles from the center to two adjacent vertices) are 360/n degrees. But when you pick three vertices, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps away v1 and v3 are from v2 along the perimeter.\n\nFor example, in a regular pentagon (n=5), if I choose v2 as a vertex, and v1 and v3 as adjacent vertices, then the angle at v2 would be the interior angle of the polygon. But if I pick v1 and v3 further away, the angle would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a formula for the angle formed by three vertices. Let me think. Suppose we have a regular polygon with n sides. Let's consider three vertices v1, v2, v3, where v2 is the vertex of the angle. Let's assume that between v2 and v1 there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are m steps counter-clockwise. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of edges between them along the perimeter.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3. For example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the angle is the interior angle. If they are further apart, the angle changes.\n\nAlternatively, think of the regular polygon inscribed in a circle. Then, the angle at v2 would be an inscribed angle. Wait, but the angle formed by three points on a circle depends on the arc between them. For instance, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that subtended at the circumference. But I'm not sure exactly how that applies here.\n\nLet me look for a formula. Suppose in a regular n-gon, we select three vertices v1, v2, v3. Let's say that between v2 and v1 there are k edges along one side, and between v2 and v3 there are m edges along the other side. But since the polygon is regular, the positions are symmetric. So, perhaps the angle at v2 depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3. For example, if there are k steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter (excluding v2), then the angle can be calculated based on that.\n\nWait, maybe for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 when choosing two other vertices v1 and v3 depends on the number of sides between them. Let me think of an example. Take a square (n=4). The interior angle is 90 degrees. If I take three vertices where v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the angle is 90. If I take v1 and v3 as opposite vertices (like in a square, if v2 is one corner, then v1 is next, and v3 is the one opposite?), wait no. In a square, each vertex has two adjacent vertices. To get a different angle, perhaps you can take v1 as adjacent to v2, and v3 as two steps away. Wait, but in a square, the vertices are arranged as 1,2,3,4. Suppose v2 is 2. Then, v1 could be 1, and v3 could be 3 (adjacent, angle is 90). Or if v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, then the angle at 2 would be... Hmm, what's that angle?\n\nIn that case, the triangle is formed by points 1, 2, 4. Let me calculate the angle at 2. Since it's a square, all sides are equal. The coordinates might help. Let's imagine the square with coordinates:\n\nAssume the square is centered at the origin, but perhaps it's easier to assign coordinates. Let's say the square has vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1). Let's take v2 as (1,0) (vertex 2). Then v1 is (0,0) (vertex 1), and v3 is (0,1) (vertex 4). The angle at v2 is between the vectors from v2 to v1 (which is (-1, 0)) and from v2 to v3 (which is (-1, 1)). The angle between these two vectors can be calculated using the dot product.\n\nThe dot product is (-1)(-1) + (0)(1) = 1. The magnitude of the first vector is 1, the second is sqrt(1+1) = sqrt(2). The cosine of the angle is 1/(sqrt(2)*1) = 1/sqrt(2), so the angle is 45 degrees. Which matches the example given in the problem statement where for n=4, the possible angles are 45 or 90 degrees.\n\nSo, in this case, the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3. For example, when v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, the angle is 90 degrees. When they are separated by one vertex (so that the arc between them is two edges), the angle is 45 degrees. Wait, how does that generalize?\n\nAnother example: in a regular pentagon (n=5). Let's say v2 is a vertex. If I take v1 as the next vertex, and v3 as the one two steps away (so there's one vertex between v2 and v3). Then, the angle at v2 would be... Well, perhaps the formula is that the angle depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 along the perimeter. Let's think in terms of the number of edges between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. For example, in the square example, when v1 is adjacent to v2 and v3 is two steps away (so that there's one vertex between v2 and v3), the angle was 45 degrees. Wait, but in that case, the arc between v1 and v3 (passing through v2) is 3 steps? No, perhaps I need to find the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2.\n\nAlternatively, think of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Let me think. For the square example, when v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2 is the arc from 1 to 4 passing through 3, which is two edges. The central angle for that arc is 2 * 90 degrees (since each edge is 90 degrees for a square). Wait, no. The central angle for each edge is 360/n degrees. For n=4, each edge corresponds to 90 degrees. So the arc from 1 to 4 (passing through 3) is two edges, so central angle is 2*90=180 degrees. The inscribed angle subtended by that arc would be half of that, which is 90 degrees. But earlier calculation said the angle at v2 was 45 degrees. Hmm, that contradicts. So maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the arc that's opposite to it. Let me think again. The angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. The angle between those two chords depends on the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Let me recall that in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. But in this case, the angle at v2 is not an inscribed angle because the vertex is on the circumference. Wait, but the angle between two chords meeting at a point on the circumference is indeed an inscribed angle. So the angle at v2 would be equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nSo, for example, in the square case, if v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4. The arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is the arc from 1 to 4 through 3, which is 2 edges. Each edge corresponds to 90 degrees, so the arc is 2*90=180 degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of that, which is 90 degrees. But earlier calculation using coordinates said it was 45 degrees. That's a contradiction. So clearly, my understanding is wrong here.\n\nWait, let's recalculate that example. The points are 1(0,0), 2(1,0), 3(1,1), 4(0,1). The angle at 2 (1,0) between points 1(0,0) and 4(0,1). The vectors from 2 to 1 is (-1, 0) and from 2 to 4 is (-1, 1). The angle between these two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:\n\ncos(theta) = ( (-1)(-1) + 0*1 ) / ( |v1| * |v2| )\n\nWhich is 1/(1 * sqrt(2)) ) = 1/√2. So theta is 45 degrees. But according to the previous logic, the angle should be half the arc between v1 and v3 (which is 180 degrees) giving 90 degrees. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps the arc that the inscribed angle subtends is the arc that's opposite to the angle. So if the angle is at v2, then the arc that it subtends is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. But in this case, that arc is 180 degrees. However, the inscribed angle would be half of that, which is 90 degrees. But according to the coordinate calculation, it's 45 degrees. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I got the direction wrong. Maybe the angle at v2 is actually half of the arc that is opposite to it. Let me think again. For example, in a circle, if you have three points A, B, C on the circumference, then the angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. So in our case, the angle at v2 (point B) between points v1 (A) and v3 (C) would be half of the arc AC that does not contain B.\n\nIn the square example, the arc AC (v1 to v3) that does not contain B (v2) is the arc from v1 (1) to v3 (4) passing through 3, which is 2 edges (each 90 degrees) totaling 180 degrees. So the angle should be 90 degrees. But according to the coordinate calculation, it's 45 degrees. So why the discrepancy?\n\nHmm, perhaps my assumption that the angle is an inscribed angle is incorrect. Let me think again. In the example, the points are on a square, which is a regular polygon inscribed in a circle. The angle at v2 is between two chords (from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3). The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 180 degrees. But the angle at v2 is 45 degrees. How can that be?\n\nWait, maybe the angle is half of the arc that is opposite. Wait, if the arc AC (not containing B) is 180 degrees, then the angle ABC would be half of that, which is 90 degrees. But in reality, it's 45. So that's not matching. What's going on here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at B is half of the arc AC that does contain B. Let me check. If that arc is 180 degrees (the other way around), then half is 90 degrees. Still not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is half of the arc that is intercepted by the angle. Wait, maybe I need to think of the angle as being formed by two chords, and the intercepted arc is the arc between the two points that is opposite to the angle. Let me check another example.\n\nTake an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle. Each central angle is 120 degrees. The angle at each vertex of the triangle is 60 degrees. According to the formula, the angle would be half of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc would be the arc opposite to the angle. For example, angle at vertex A of triangle ABC would intercept arc BC. The central angle for arc BC is 120 degrees. So the inscribed angle is 60 degrees, which matches. So that seems correct.\n\nIn the square example, the angle at point B (vertex 2) between points A (vertex 1) and C (vertex 4). The intercepted arc would be AC, which is 180 degrees. So the angle should be 90 degrees. But according to coordinates, it's 45 degrees. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the intercepted arc is not AC, but the other arc. Because in the square case, the arc AC that doesn't pass through B is 180 degrees. But the arc AC that passes through B is also 180 degrees. Wait, that's impossible. Wait, in a square, the total circumference is 360 degrees. The arc from A to C passing through B would be two edges, each 90 degrees, so 180 degrees. The arc from A to C not passing through B is the other two edges, which is also 180 degrees. So both arcs are 180 degrees. Then, according to the formula, the angle would be half of that, which is 90 degrees. But in reality, the angle is 45 degrees. So this suggests that my understanding is wrong.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to re-calculate the angle using coordinates again. Points:\n\nv1 is (0,0), v2 is (1,0), v3 is (0,1).\n\nVectors from v2 to v1: (-1, 0)\nFrom v2 to v3: (-1, 1)\n\nThe angle between these two vectors can be found using the formula:\n\ntan(theta) = |(v1 × v2)| / (v1 · v2)\n\nWait, cross product in 2D can be considered as the magnitude. So the cross product is (-1)(1) - (0)(-1) = -1 - 0 = -1. The magnitude is 1. The dot product is (-1)(-1) + (0)(1) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo tan(theta) = 1 / 1 = 1 → theta is 45 degrees. So that's correct. So why does the formula say it should be 90 degrees?\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps the angle I'm calculating is not the inscribed angle. Because in this case, the points are not arranged in the way that the angle is an inscribed angle. Wait, in this case, the angle is formed by two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. But the intercepted arc is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2, which is 180 degrees. But according to the formula, the angle should be half of that, which is 90 degrees. But actual calculation shows 45 degrees. So clearly, my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWhat's the correct formula here?\n\nMaybe I need to think about the central angle and the inscribed angle. Let me think again. For a regular polygon, each central angle between adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. The inscribed angle subtended by an arc of k steps (k edges) is (k * 360/n) / 2 = k * 180/n degrees. Wait, but that would be if the arc is k steps. So for example, in the square case, if the arc between v1 and v3 is two steps (k=2), then the inscribed angle would be 2 * 180 / 4 = 90 degrees. But the actual angle is 45 degrees. So again, discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think about the central angle. The central angle for an arc of k steps is k * (360/n) degrees. The inscribed angle subtended by that arc is half of the central angle. So the inscribed angle would be k * 180/n degrees. But in the square example, with k=2, that gives 2 * 180 /4 = 90 degrees. But the actual angle is 45 degrees. So that's not matching. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps the arc that the inscribed angle is subtending is not the same as the arc between v1 and v3. Because in this example, the angle at v2 is not an inscribed angle subtended by the arc between v1 and v3. Instead, maybe it's subtended by some other arc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is formed by two chords, and the intercepted arc is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. But in the square example, that arc is 180 degrees. So the inscribed angle would be 90 degrees, but actual is 45. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is half the difference between the arcs. Wait, maybe I need to think of the angle formed by two chords as being related to the arcs between the points. For example, in a circle, if you have two chords AB and AC, then the angle BAC is equal to half the measure of the arc BC that does not contain A. But in the square example, the arc BC (assuming A is v2) would be from v1 to v3, which is 180 degrees. Then angle BAC would be 90 degrees. But according to the coordinate calculation, it's 45 degrees. So that's not adding up.\n\nThis suggests that my entire approach is wrong. Maybe I need to find another way to compute the angle.\n\nLet me think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Let's assign coordinates to the vertices. Let’s say the regular n-gon is centered at the origin, and vertex 1 is at (1, 0). The coordinates of vertex i can be given by (cos(θ_i), sin(θ_i)), where θ_i is the angle from the positive x-axis to the vertex. Since the polygon is regular, θ_i = 2π*(i-1)/n radians.\n\nNow, suppose we have three vertices v1, v2, v3. Let's assume that v2 is the middle vertex, and v1 and v3 are located k steps away from v2 in either direction. For example, if we take v2 as vertex i, then v1 is vertex i - k, and v3 is vertex i + m, where k and m are positive integers. However, since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 depends only on the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to assume that between v2 and v1 there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are m steps counter-clockwise. However, since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 will depend on the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter. For example, if between v1 and v3 (passing through v2) there are k steps, then the angle depends on k.\n\nAlternatively, for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 formed by vertices v1 and v3 can be determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the perimeter. Let me denote that number as d. For example, in the square case, when v1 is adjacent to v2 and v3 is two steps away, then the number of edges between v1 and v3 (passing through v2) is 2 steps (from v1 to v2 to v3), but the number of edges between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is n - 2 steps. Wait, no. For the square, n=4. Between v1 and v3, there are two possible paths: one with 2 steps (v1-v2-v3) and one with 2 steps (v1-v4-v3). So the minimal distance is 2 steps. But how does that relate to the angle?\n\nAlternatively, for the angle at v2, the number of vertices between v1 and v3 along the perimeter (not passing through v2) determines the angle. Let me think: suppose there are k vertices between v1 and v3 along the perimeter not passing through v2. Then the arc between v1 and v3 is (k+1) * (360/n) degrees. Because each step between adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. So the arc length is (k+1) * (360/n) degrees. Then, the angle at v2 would be half of that arc? But earlier example shows that this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is ( (d) * 180 ) / n degrees, where d is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter not passing through v2. For example, in the square example where d is 2 steps (arc length 2*90=180 degrees), the angle at v2 would be (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees, which contradicts the coordinate calculation of 45 degrees. So that formula is also wrong.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for a mathematical formula or derivation for the angle formed by three vertices in a regular polygon.\n\nAfter some research (or thinking), I recall that in a regular polygon, the angle formed at a vertex by connecting to two other vertices depends on the number of sides between them. For example, if you have a regular n-gon and choose three vertices such that there are k steps between v1 and v2, and m steps between v2 and v3, then the angle at v2 can be computed based on k and m. However, since the polygon is regular, the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the regular polygon can be inscribed in a circle. The angle at v2 is formed by two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The angle between these two chords can be calculated using the central angles of the arcs between v2 and v1, and between v2 and v3. But I'm not sure how to combine these.\n\nLet me think of the central angles. Suppose the central angle between v2 and v1 is α, and between v2 and v3 is β. Then, the angle between the two chords at v2 would be (α + β)/2? Or something else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is equal to half the sum of the central angles between v2 and v1 and between v2 and v3. Or maybe half the difference?\n\nWait, in the square example, the central angle between v2 and v1 is 90 degrees (since they are adjacent). Similarly, between v2 and v3 (if v3 is two steps away from v2), then the central angle is 180 degrees. So the sum is 270 degrees. Half of that is 135 degrees, which doesn't match the coordinate calculation of 45 degrees. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the difference between the two central angles. For example, 180 - 90 = 90 degrees. Half is 45 degrees. Which matches the example. Oh! That seems promising.\n\nSo in that case, the angle at v2 would be (central_angle_v2v3 - central_angle_v2v1)/2 ?\n\nWait, but in this case, the central angle between v2 and v3 is larger than the one between v2 and v1. So subtracting gives a positive value. But what if the other way around?\n\nLet me think again. In the square example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 (central angle 90 degrees), and v3 is two steps away (central angle 180 degrees), then the angle at v2 is (180 - 90)/2 = 45 degrees. Which matches the coordinate calculation. Another example: in the square, if v1 and v3 are both adjacent to v2 (central angles of 90 degrees), then the angle at v2 would be (90 - 90)/2 = 0 degrees, which is not correct. Wait, that's not right. Because in reality, the angle is 90 degrees. So this formula must be wrong.\n\nHmm. So what's the correct formula?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is equal to half the difference between the central angles of the arcs between v1 and v3. Let me think. For example, in the square case where v1 and v3 are two steps apart (arc between them is 180 degrees), and the angle at v2 is 45 degrees. Which is half of 90 degrees. Where does 90 come from?\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. That is, the arc that does not include v2. For example, in the square example, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 is 180 degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of the arc that is opposite to it. But that would be 90 degrees, which contradicts the coordinate calculation. So again, no.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern with small examples.\n\nLet me consider the square (n=4) again.\n\nCase 1: v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2. So the angle is the internal angle of the square, which is 90 degrees.\n\nCase 2: v1 is adjacent to v2, and v3 is two steps away from v2 (so that the arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is 180 degrees). The angle at v2 is 45 degrees.\n\nSo for the square, possible angles are 45 and 90 degrees. How do these values relate to n and the number of steps between v1 and v3?\n\nIn case 1, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not passing through v2 is 0 (they are adjacent to v2, so the arc between them passing through v2 is 2 steps (v1-v2-v3), and the arc not passing through v2 is 2 steps (v1-v4-v3). So the arc length is 2 * 90 = 180 degrees. So the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. How?\n\nWait, in case 1, the arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is 180 degrees. According to the earlier idea, the angle at v2 would be half of that, which is 90 degrees. Which matches. In case 2, the arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is 2 steps (v1 to v3 via v4), which is 2 * 90 = 180 degrees. But the angle at v2 is 45 degrees. Which contradicts.\n\nWait, but in case 1, the arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is 2 steps (same as case 2). So why is the angle different?\n\nThis suggests that the formula is not based solely on the arc between v1 and v3. There must be something else.\n\nLet me think again. Perhaps the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. For example, if there are k steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter, then the angle at v2 is (k-1) * 180 / n degrees. Or some similar formula.\n\nIn the square example, when there are 2 steps between v1 and v3 (along the perimeter), then the angle is 45 degrees. For n=4, (2-1)*180/4 = 45 degrees. Which matches. In case 1, where v1 and v3 are adjacent, the number of steps between them is 1. So (1-1)*... = 0, which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in case 1, the steps between v1 and v3 is 1 (directly adjacent), but the angle is 90 degrees. So that formula doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter is k, then the angle at v2 is (k * 180) / n. For example, in case 2, k=2 steps between v1 and v3. For n=4, 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. No, that doesn't match. In case 2, the angle is 45 degrees. So this is not working.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the regular polygon as a circle with n points. Let's assume that the angle at v2 is formed by two other points v1 and v3. Let's imagine that between v1 and v2 there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are m steps clockwise. But since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 depends on k and m. However, since the polygon is convex and the points are distinct, k and m must be at least 1. Also, since the points are distinct, the total steps between v1 and v3 would be k + m, but that may not be directly useful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the angle at v2 in terms of the number of vertices between v1 and v3. Let's say there are d vertices between v1 and v3 along the perimeter. For example, in the square case where v1 is 1, v2 is 2, v3 is 4, there is one vertex (3) between v1 and v3 along the perimeter that passes through v2. Wait, no. The path from v1 to v3 passing through v2 is 1-2-3-4? No, for v1=1, v2=2, v3=4, the path from v1 to v3 passing through v2 is 1-2-4? No, that's not a direct path. Wait, the steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter that includes v2 would be 1-2-3-4 (but that's three steps). Or maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think of the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the perimeter. For example, in the square case:\n\nIf v1 is 1, v3 is 3, then there are two edges between them (1-2-3). Or alternatively, the other way around (1-4-3), which is also two edges. So the minimal number of edges between them is 2.\n\nIn the example where v2 is 2, and v1 is 1, v3 is 4, the number of edges between v1 and v3 is 2 (either way). So d=2.\n\nIn this case, the angle at v2 is 45 degrees. For n=4, what's the formula?\n\nMaybe the angle is ( (d-1) * 180 ) / n. For d=2, that would be (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. Which matches. In the case where d=1 (adjacent vertices), (0 * 180)/4 = 0, which doesn't match the 90 degrees. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, but in the case where v1 and v3 are adjacent, like v1=1, v2=2, v3=3, the number of edges between v1 and v3 is 1 (directly connected). So d=1. But the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. Using the formula (d-1)*180/n would give 0, which is wrong.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the formula is ( (d) * 180 ) / n, where d is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not include v2. Let's see.\n\nIn the square example, when v1 is 1, v2 is 2, v3 is 4. The arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is 2 edges (1-4-3). So d=2. (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees. But the actual angle is 45 degrees. No.\n\nAlternatively, ( (n - d) * 180 ) / n ? For d=2, n-d=2, 2*180/4 = 90. Still no.\n\nThis is getting nowhere. Maybe I should find a general formula for the angle at v2 in terms of the positions of v1 and v3.\n\nLet me try to derive the formula using coordinates.\n\nAssume the regular n-gon is inscribed in a unit circle. Let the vertices be numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. Let's assume that the vertex v2 is at angle 0 degrees (for simplicity), so its coordinates are (1, 0). Let's say that v1 is k steps clockwise from v2. So the angle for v1 is -k * (2π/n) radians (since clockwise is negative in standard math). Similarly, v3 is m steps counter-clockwise from v2, which would be m * (2π/n) radians. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 will determine the angle.\n\nBut for the angle at v2, we need to find the angle between the vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\nLet me assume that v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps counter-clockwise from v2. Since the polygon is regular, the positions of v1 and v3 can be represented as points on the unit circle. The vectors from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 are the vectors from (1, 0) to (cos(-k*2π/n), sin(-k*2π/n)) and to (cos(m*2π/n), sin(m*2π/n)) respectively.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the actual positions are on the unit circle, and the vectors from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 are the vectors from the point (1, 0) to other points on the circle.\n\nBut to calculate the angle between these two vectors, we can use the dot product formula.\n\nLet me denote the angle between the two vectors as theta. The formula for the angle between two vectors u and v is:\n\ntheta = arccos( (u · v) / (|u| |v|) )\n\nSince all points are on the unit circle, the distance from v2 to v1 is 2*sin(π*k/n), and similarly for v2 to v3. But perhaps it's easier to compute the angle using the positions on the circle.\n\nLet me think about the angle between the two vectors. Let me consider the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nLet me define the angle of v1 relative to v2 as alpha, and the angle of v3 relative to v2 as beta. Since v2 is at (1, 0), the vector from v2 to v1 is (cos(alpha) - 1, sin(alpha) - 0), but this might not be helpful. Alternatively, since the polygon is regular and centered at the origin, the position of v1 is (cos(theta1), sin(theta1)), and v2 is (1, 0). The vector from v2 to v1 is (cos(theta1) - 1, sin(theta1) - 0). Similarly for v3.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Perhaps it's better to consider the central angles between the points.\n\nThe central angle between v2 and v1 is k * (2π/n) radians, where k is the number of steps from v2 to v1 clockwise. Similarly, the central angle between v2 and v3 is m * (2π/n) radians, where m is the number of steps from v2 to v3 counter-clockwise.\n\nThe angle between the two vectors from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 can be calculated as the difference between these two central angles. For example, if v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps counter-clockwise from v2, then the angle between the vectors is (m + k",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and leveraging these properties to efficiently compute the closest possible angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Regular Polygon Angles**: In a regular n-gon, the central angle between adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360}{n} $ degrees. The angle formed at any vertex by connecting it to two other vertices depends on the number of steps between those vertices.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For a given vertex `v2`, if there are `k` steps between `v1` and `v3` along the perimeter (not passing through `v2`), the angle at `v2` can be calculated using the formula derived from the geometry of regular polygons.\n3. **Optimal Angle Selection**: We need to determine the optimal number of steps `k` such that the angle formed is closest to the given angle `a`.

So the angle at v2 is (k * 180) / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 not passing through v2. And k can range from 1 to n-2.\n    \n    # So for each possible k in 1 to n-2, the angle is (k * 180) / n.\n    \n    # Now, we need to find the k that makes this angle closest to a.\n    \n    # Once we find the best k, we can select any triplet of vertices that forms this angle.\n    \n    # For example, if the best k is 1, then choose v1 as v2+1, v3 as v2-1 (or similar).\n    \n    # So now, the steps are:\n    # 1. For each possible k (from 1 to n-2), calculate the angle (k * 180) / n.\n    # 2. Find the k that minimizes |angle - a|.\n    # 3. Choose any triplet of vertices that corresponds to this k.\n    \n    # Now, implement this.\n    \n    # Compute the best k\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    \n    for k in range(1, n-1):\n        angle = k * 180.0 / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k or any, since any is acceptable\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    \n    # Now, construct the triplet.\n    # For best_k, we can choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 2 + best_k.\n    # Wait, need to ensure that v1 and v3 are distinct and not equal to v2.\n    \n    # Let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 1 + best_k + 1? No, need to think.\n    \n    # For example, if best_k is 1, then the number of steps between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is 1. So v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2.\n    # So, if v2 is 1, then v1 could be 2, v3 could be n (since 1 to 2 to n is one step between v1 and v3 not passing through v2? No, need to think.\n    \n    # Alternatively, for a chosen v2, say 1, v1 is 2, and v3 is 1 + best_k + 1? No.\n    \n    # Let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k. But need to make sure that v3 is within the polygon.\n    \n    # Let's take an example: n=4, best_k=1. Then, v2 is 1, v1 is 2, v3 should be 2 + 1 = 3. So the triplet is 2, 1, 3. Which is one of the valid outputs in the sample.\n    \n    # For n=4, best_k=2, v2=1, v1=2, v3=2+2=4. Triplet is 2 1 4, which is valid.\n    \n    # So the general approach is: choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 2 + best_k. But since the polygon is cyclic, if 2 + best_k exceeds n, we can wrap around.\n    \n    # However, since best_k ranges from 1 to n-2, 2 + best_k can be up to 2 + n-2 = n, which is valid.\n    \n    # So for v3, it's 2 + best_k.\n    \n    # So the triplet is v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_k.\n    \n    # However, for cases where best_k is larger than n-2, but according to the loop, best_k is in 1 to n-2.\n    \n    # So the code would be:\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n    \n    # But for example, n=4, best_k=2, v3=4. Which is correct.\n    \n    # However, when best_k is 1, v3=3, which is correct.\n    \n    # However, if best_k is such that v3 exceeds n, we need to adjust. But since best_k ranges from 1 to n-2, 2 + best_k ranges from 3 to n.\n    \n    # So the triplet is v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_k.\n    \n    # Print the triplet.\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
