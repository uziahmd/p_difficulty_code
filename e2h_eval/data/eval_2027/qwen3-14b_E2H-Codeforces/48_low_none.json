He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, which could be Roman numerals. So first, I need to parse the input correctly. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nFirst, the input gives me two parts: a and b (or R), then the number c in base a. My job is to convert c from base a to base b, handling Roman numerals when needed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nLet me break down each part.\n\nFor step 1: Converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have letters like A, B, etc., if a is greater than 10. For example, if a is 16, then 'A' represents 10, 'B' 11, up to 'Z' for 35? Wait, but the problem says that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So the letters are uppercase? Well, the input c may have letters, but I need to process them correctly. Also, the input c may have leading zeros, but that's okay because when converting to decimal, leading zeros don't affect the value.\n\nSo for converting c to decimal, I need to process each character. For example, if the input is 'A', then in base 12, it's 10. So I need to handle characters from 0-9 and then A-Z (for bases up to 36?), but according to the problem statement, the input c is such that when converted to decimal, it's up to 1e15, which is manageable as Python integers.\n\nSo, for the conversion from base a to decimal:\n\nLoop through each character in the string c. For each character, determine its value. For digits, it's straightforward. For letters, convert to their corresponding value (like 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, etc). Then compute the decimal value as sum of digit * a^position, but more efficiently, perhaps by processing each digit and multiplying by a each time.\n\nWait, the standard way is to process each digit left to right, and for each digit, current_value = current_value * a + digit_value. That's efficient and works for any base.\n\nYes. So for example, if c is \"1A\" in base 16: initial value is 0. First digit is 1: 0*16 + 1 = 1. Next digit is A (10): 1*16 + 10 = 26. Which is correct.\n\nSo I need a helper function to convert the input string c (base a) into a decimal integer. But how to handle letters?\n\nFor each character in c:\n\n- If it's a digit, then its value is int(char)\n- Else, it's a letter (uppercase?), and its value is ord(char) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input c may contain letters? For example, in the sample input, one of the test cases is '12 13\\nA', which is converting 'A' (base 12) to base 13. So 'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal. Then converting to base 13 would be 'A' again, since 10 in base 13 is 'A'.\n\nSo the code for converting c to decimal needs to handle letters. So, for each character in the string, we need to get its value. Let's write a helper function for that.\n\nNow, step 2: converting the decimal number to base b, or Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nSo, first, check if b is 'R'. If yes, then convert the decimal to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string.\n\nLet's think about converting to base b. The standard approach is to repeatedly divide the number by b and collect the remainders. But we need to handle the case where the number is zero. However, the problem states that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. Also, in other cases, the number is not greater than 1e15, but when converting to base b, the output must omit leading zeros. So for example, if the decimal is zero, but according to the input constraints, when Roman is involved, the number isn't zero. But for other cases, the input c can be zero? Let's check the problem statement.\n\nThe input says: the number c may have leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which could be a Roman numeral system. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal integer and then converting that decimal integer to the target base `b` or Roman numerals if specified.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: Convert the given number `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves processing each character of the input string, converting it to its corresponding decimal value, and accumulating the result.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a Roman numeral system (`R`) or another numerical base:\n   - If `b` is `R`, convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a standard conversion method.\n   - Otherwise, convert the decimal number to the target base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders, which are then converted to the appropriate characters (digits or letters for bases greater than 10).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, r) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += r\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        a_part = parts[0]\n        if a_part == 'R':\n            a = int(parts[1])\n            b_part = parts[2]\n        else:\n            a = int(a_part)\n            b_part = parts[1]\n        c = parts[2]\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n        \n        if b_part == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            b = int(b_part)\n            result = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, b)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input string `c`, converting it to its corresponding decimal value based on the given base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Target Base**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal number to a specified base `b`, handling bases greater than 10 by using letters (A-Z) for values 10 and above.\n3. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating through these pairs to construct the Roman numeral string.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including leading zeros and special cases for Roman numerals.
