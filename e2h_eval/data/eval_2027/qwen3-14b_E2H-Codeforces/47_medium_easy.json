    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let me think. So, the LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of x and y. Because for fixed product, higher GCD means lower LCM. But how do I find k that makes (a +k) and (b +k) have the highest possible GCD?\n\nWait, since a and b are given, let's think about the difference between them. Let me denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, the difference between x and y is (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So, the difference between x and y is fixed as (b -a) if a < b. Wait, but if a and b are swapped, it's the same. So, without loss of generality, let's assume that a ≤ b. Because if a is larger than b, we can swap them. Because the problem is symmetric in a and b. So, first step: swap a and b if necessary so that a ≤ b.\n\nThen, the difference between x and y is (b - a). Let me call this d. So, d = b - a. So, x and y differ by d. Now, since the GCD of x and y must divide their difference. Because GCD(x, y) divides x and y, so it divides x - y. So, GCD(x, y) divides d. Therefore, the maximum possible GCD of x and y is a divisor of d.\n\nSo, the idea is to find a value of k such that x = a +k and y = b +k have GCD as large as possible. Because then their LCM will be minimized.\n\nBut how do I find such k?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that x and y are such that their GCD is some g. Then, since x and y differ by d, which is fixed, then g must divide d. So, for each possible divisor g of d, I can try to find the minimal k such that x and y are multiples of g. Then, among all those possibilities, pick the one that gives the maximum possible g. Once we have that, the LCM would be minimized.\n\nWait, but d can be zero. Oh right, if a and b are equal, then d is zero. Then x and y are equal. So, their LCM is x (since they are same). So in that case, the minimal k is 0, since adding zero gives the same numbers. So, for a = b, the answer is 0.\n\nSo, first, handle the case where a == b. Then, return 0.\n\nOtherwise, for the case where a != b. Let's proceed.\n\nSo, let's suppose that a < b. Then, d = b - a. So, we can compute all the divisors of d, and for each divisor g, find the minimal k such that both (a +k) and (b +k) are divisible by g. Then, for each such g, compute the corresponding LCM, and find the minimal one.\n\nBut how to find k for a given g?\n\nSince x = a +k must be divisible by g. Similarly, y = b +k must be divisible by g. Since y = x + d, and since d is divisible by g (because g divides d), then if x is divisible by g, then y = x +d is also divisible by g. Therefore, for a given g (divisor of d), the condition reduces to x being divisible by g. So, x = a +k ≡ 0 mod g → k ≡ -a mod g. So the minimal non-negative k is (g - (a % g)) % g. Wait, because if a mod g is r, then k needs to be congruent to (-r) mod g. So, the minimal non-negative k is (g - r) if r != 0, else 0. So, for example, if a mod g is 0, then k can be 0. Otherwise, it's (g - (a mod g)).\n\nOnce we have this k, then x = a +k is a multiple of g, and y = x +d is also a multiple of g. Therefore, the GCD of x and y is at least g. However, it could be higher. But since g is a divisor of d, and x and y are multiples of g, their GCD is at least g. But perhaps there's a higher value. But since we're trying to find the maximum possible GCD, we can consider all divisors of d, and for each, find the minimal k that makes x and y multiples of that divisor. Then, the maximum possible GCD would be the largest divisor of d for which such a k exists.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a higher GCD than the divisors of d? No, because earlier reasoning says that GCD(x, y) divides d. Therefore, the maximum possible GCD is a divisor of d. So, we can iterate through all the divisors of d, and for each, compute the minimal k that makes x and y multiples of that divisor. Then, for each such divisor, the LCM of x and y is (x * y) / (g) → since x and y are multiples of g. But since x and y are multiples of g, x = g * m, y = g * n. Then, their LCM is g * LCM(m, n). But since m and n are (x/g) and (y/g), and since y -x =d =g * (n -m). Wait, not sure. But since x and y are multiples of g, their GCD is at least g. However, the actual GCD could be higher. However, for our purpose, when we choose the maximum possible divisor g of d, then the LCM would be minimized. Because for example, if we have two numbers with GCD g, then their LCM is (x*y)/g. But since x and y differ by d, which is fixed, perhaps for the same g, the LCM is minimized when x and y are as small as possible.\n\nBut perhaps the way to proceed is to find all divisors of d, and for each, compute the minimal k that makes x and y multiples of that divisor, then compute the LCM for that scenario, and pick the k that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBut since for each divisor g of d, the minimal k is (g - (a mod g)) % g. Then, once we have that k, x = a +k, y = b +k. Then, the LCM of x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). However, since x and y are multiples of g, their gcd is at least g. But perhaps higher. However, since x and y are multiples of g, and their difference is d, which is a multiple of g, then their gcd is equal to g multiplied by the gcd of (x/g, y/g) = gcd(x/g, (y -x)/g) = gcd(x/g, d/g). But since d/g is an integer. So, the actual GCD is g * h, where h is a divisor of d/g. But since h can vary, perhaps for the same g, different k's could lead to higher GCDs. However, since we are trying to find the maximum possible GCD, perhaps considering all divisors of d is sufficient, but maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal choice is to take the maximum possible divisor of d, and then compute the minimal k for that divisor. Because if you take a larger g, then the LCM would be smaller.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose d is 4, and possible divisors are 1,2,4. For each, compute the minimal k.\n\nFor example, let's say a is 6, b is 10. Then d = 4. The divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor g=4: compute k. a=6, so 6 mod 4 is 2. So k = (4 - 2) = 2. Then x=6+2=8, y=10+2=12. Their GCD is 4. LCM is 24. Which is the example given.\n\nIf we take g=2: then k is (2 - (6 mod 2)) mod 2. 6 mod 2 is 0, so k=0. Then x=6, y=10. GCD is 2, LCM is 30. Which is higher than 24.\n\nIf we take g=1: k is 0. x=6, y=10. LCM is 30 again. So the best is g=4, which gives LCM 24.\n\nSo, the idea is that taking the maximum possible divisor of d (which is d itself) gives the best possible LCM. But wait, what if d is not the maximum possible?\n\nSo, in general, the maximum possible GCD of x and y is d, but only if there exists a k such that x and y are multiples of d. Let's see.\n\nIn the example above, d is 4. The maximum divisor is 4. So, yes.\n\nBut what if a=5 and b=9. Then d=4. Let's see. For g=4: k must be (4 - (5 mod 4)) = 4-1=3. So x=5+3=8, y=9+3=12. GCD(8,12)=4. LCM is 24. But if we take g=2, then k is (2 - (5 mod 2)) mod 2. 5 mod 2 is 1. So k= (2-1)=1. Then x=6, y=10. GCD is 2. LCM is 30. So again, higher.\n\nBut what if a=3 and b=7. d=4. For g=4: k = (4 - (3 mod 4)) mod 4. 3 mod4 is 3. So 4-3=1. k=1. x=4, y=8. GCD is 4, LCM is 8. Which is better than any other option.\n\nSo, seems like taking the maximum divisor of d (i.e., d itself) gives the best possible scenario. But why?\n\nBecause when you take the maximum possible divisor, then the GCD of x and y is as large as possible, which leads to the minimal LCM.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a case where a higher GCD is possible for a smaller divisor? No, because the GCD must divide d. So the maximum possible GCD is d. But for that to happen, x and y must be multiples of d. Which requires that (a +k) mod d = 0. Since x = a +k, and y = x +d. So, if x is a multiple of d, then y is x +d, which is also a multiple of d. So the GCD of x and y is at least d. But since x and y are multiples of d, their GCD is d multiplied by the GCD of (x/d and y/d). But since y = x +d, then y/d = x/d + 1. So, x/d and x/d +1 are consecutive integers, so their GCD is 1. Hence, the overall GCD of x and y is d * 1 =d. So in this case, the LCM is (x * y)/d. Since x = a +k, which is a multiple of d. Let's see, for example, when x is the first multiple of d that is >= a. So, if a is 6 and d is 4, then the first multiple of 4 >=6 is 8. Which is the example. So, the LCM is (8*12)/4 = 24.\n\nBut if we take another divisor of d, say, g =d/2. Then, the GCD of x and y could be higher than g?\n\nNo, because the maximum possible GCD is d, which is larger than g. So, if we can get a GCD of d, that's better than getting a GCD of g. So, the optimal strategy is to find the maximum possible divisor of d, which is d itself, and compute the minimal k for that.\n\nWait, but what if d is zero? Well, that's handled earlier.\n\nBut what if d is not zero, but there's no k that makes x and y multiples of d? Well, that's not possible. Because for x = a +k to be a multiple of d, we can choose k = (d - (a mod d)) mod d. Which is non-negative. For example, if a mod d is 0, then k=0. So, in that case, x is a, and y is a +d =b. So, their GCD is GCD(a, b). But since d =b -a, then GCD(a, b) = GCD(a, a +d) = GCD(a, d). But since d is b -a, and a and b are given. However, regardless, the k is computed as (d - (a mod d)) mod d. Which would be the minimal k to make x a multiple of d.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nIf a == b, then return 0.\n\nElse, compute d = abs(a -b). Let's assume a < b, so d = b -a.\n\nFind all the divisors of d. Then, for each divisor g of d, compute the minimal k that makes (a +k) divisible by g. Then, for each such k, compute the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k). Then, choose the k with the minimal LCM, and if there are multiple, the smallest k.\n\nBut how do we find the divisors of d?\n\nBut wait, the maximum possible GCD is d, and choosing that gives the minimal LCM. So perhaps we can just consider the maximum divisor of d, which is d itself. Then compute the minimal k for that.\n\nBut why? Because for that case, the LCM is (x * y)/d. Since x is the first multiple of d >= a. But perhaps there's a case where a smaller divisor gives a better LCM?\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nSuppose a=5, b= 9. d=4. Divisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=4: k is (4 - (5 mod 4)) = 4 -1 =3. x=5+3=8, y=9+3=12. LCM(8,12) =24.\n\nFor g=2: k is (2 - (5 mod 2)) mod 2. 5 mod 2 is 1. So 2-1=1. k=1. x=6, y=10. LCM(6,10)=30. Which is worse than 24.\n\nAnother example: let's take a=2, b= 6. d=4. For g=4: k is (4 - (2 mod 4)) mod 4 → 4-2=2. So k=2. x=4, y=8. LCM is 8. Which is good. If we take g=2, then k is (2 - (2 mod 2)) mod 2 → 0. x=2, y=6. LCM is 6. Which is better than 8. Wait, that's a problem. So here, the maximum divisor is 4, but taking g=2 gives a better LCM. So this contradicts the previous assumption. What's happening here?\n\nWait, this example shows that taking a smaller divisor can give a better LCM. So my previous reasoning was wrong. So what's the issue here?\n\nIn this case, a=2, b=6. d=4. So for g=4, the k is 2. x=4, y=8. LCM is 8. For g=2, k=0. x=2, y=6. LCM is 6. Which is smaller. So in this case, taking the maximum divisor of d (which is 4) gives a worse result than taking a smaller divisor (2). So the approach of choosing the maximum divisor of d is not correct.\n\nAh, so the mistake was assuming that the maximum possible GCD (d) would lead to the minimal LCM. But in reality, even though the GCD is higher, the product x*y may be larger. For example, when g=2, x and y are 2 and 6. Their product is 12, divided by GCD(2,6)=2, so LCM is 6. When g=4, x and y are 4 and 8. Product is 32, divided by GCD(4,8)=4, LCM is 8. So even though the GCD is higher, the product is much higher, leading to a larger LCM.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach of considering all divisors of d and selecting the best one is necessary. So the problem is to find, for all divisors of d, the minimal k that makes (a +k) and (b +k) multiples of that divisor. Then, compute the LCM for that scenario, and choose the one with the minimal LCM, and if there are ties, the minimal k.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors of d?\n\nFirst, compute d = |a -b|. If a == b, return 0.\n\nElse, generate all the divisors of d. For each divisor g, compute the minimal k that makes (a +k) divisible by g. Then, compute x = a +k, y = b +k. Compute their LCM. Then, select the k that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple k's have the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nBut how to generate all divisors of d?\n\nWell, for d up to 1e9, generating all divisors is feasible. Because the number of divisors is O(d^(1/3)), which for 1e9 is manageable.\n\nSo steps for the code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf a == b, output 0.\n\nElse, compute d = abs(a -b).\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d, compute the minimal k such that (a +k) mod g == 0.\n\nBut since a +k = x, and x must be divisible by g. So, k = (g - (a % g)) % g. Because:\n\nIf a mod g is 0, then k can be 0. Else, k is (g - (a mod g)).\n\nOnce we have that k, compute x = a +k, y = b +k. Then compute LCM(x, y).\n\nWe need to find the k with the minimal LCM. If multiple, the smallest k.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to generating all the divisors of d, and for each, compute the corresponding k and LCM, then find the best one.\n\nBut wait, what about the divisors of d? Are there any other possibilities? For example, could there be a k where the GCD of x and y is not a divisor of d? No, because earlier reasoning says that the GCD must divide d. Therefore, considering all the divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nBut in the example where a=2 and b=6 (d=4), the divisors are 1,2,4. For each:\n\ng=1: k = (1 - (2%1))%1 → 0. x=2, y=6. LCM is 6.\n\ng=2: k=0. x=2, y=6. LCM is 6.\n\ng=4: k=2. x=4, y=8. LCM is 8.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 6, achieved for both g=1 and g=2. But in this case, the minimal k is 0.\n\nSo, the code would generate all the divisors of d, compute for each the k and LCM, and then select the minimal LCM, then the minimal k.\n\nSo, the code needs to generate all the divisors of d, and for each, compute the k and LCM.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors of d?\n\nLet me think. To generate all the divisors of d, we can factorize d into primes, then generate all combinations. But for d up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nSo, the code can do:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut then, for each of these divisors, we process them.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, for each, compute the k and then the LCM.\n\nNow, for each candidate k, we need to compute the LCM of x and y. But since x = a +k, y = b +k. Let me compute LCM(x, y) as (x * y) // gcd(x, y).\n\nBut since x and y are multiples of g (the divisor of d), and since their difference is d, which is a multiple of g, then their GCD is at least g. However, it can be higher. For example, in the case where a=2, b=6, d=4, and g=2. Then x=2 and y=6. Their GCD is 2, which is equal to g. But if a=4, b=8, d=4. Then for g=2, x=4 +k, which is 4 +k. Let's say k is (g - (a%g)) mod g. a=4, g=2. a%g=0. So k=0. x=4, y=8. GCD(4,8) is 4, which is higher than g=2. But since g is a divisor of d=4, and in this case, 4 is a divisor of d. So, perhaps in this case, when we process the divisor 2, the actual GCD is 4. Which is a higher divisor. So, perhaps processing all the divisors of d is sufficient, but in this case, the code would also process the divisor 4, and find that the LCM is (8*12)/4 = 24. But when processing g=2, the code would compute the LCM as (4*8)/gcd(4,8) = 32/4=8. Which is better than the LCM when processing g=4 (which is 24). So, in this case, the code would find that for g=2, the LCM is 8, which is better than for g=4. So, the code would correctly choose the minimal LCM.\n\nBut how does the code know that when processing g=2, the actual GCD is higher than g? It doesn't. It just computes the LCM based on x and y. So, the code is correct because even if the GCD is higher than g, the code still calculates the correct LCM.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\ncompute k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\nthen x = a +k, y = b +k\n\ncompute the LCM of x and y.\n\nCompare all these LCMs, and choose the k with the minimal LCM, and if tie, the smallest k.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate all the divisors of d, and then for each, compute the k and LCM.\n\nBut what about the case where d is zero? Well, handled earlier.\n\nNow, let's test the example where a=2, b=6. d=4. The divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=1:\n\nk = (1 - (2%1))%1 → 0. x=2, y=6. LCM is 6.\n\ng=2:\n\nk is (2 - (2%2))%2 → 0. x=2, y=6. LCM is 6.\n\ng=4:\n\nk is (4 - (2%4))%4 → 4-2=2. x=4, y=8. LCM is 8.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 6. Between the two options (g=1 and g=2), the minimal k is 0. So the answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: input 6 and 10. d=4. Divisors are 1,2,4.\n\ng=1: k= (1 - (6%1))%1 → 0. x=6, y=10. LCM is 30.\n\ng=2: k= (2 - (6%2))%2 → 0. x=6, y=10. LCM 30.\n\ng=4: k= (4 - (6%4)) → 4-2=2. x=8, y=12. LCM 24. So the minimal is 24, so k=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example from the input: ['21 31'].\n\na=21, b=31. d=10. Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=1: k=0. x=21, y=31. LCM is 21*31 / 1 = 651.\n\ng=2: k is (2 - (21%2)) mod 2. 21 mod 2 is 1. So 2-1=1. k=1. x=22, y=32. GCD is 2. LCM is 22*32 / 2 = 352.\n\ng=5: a=21 mod 5 is 1. So k=5-1=4. x=25, y=35. GCD(25,35)=5. LCM is (25*35)/5 = 175.\n\ng=10: a=21 mod 10 is 1. So k=10-1=9. x=30, y=40. GCD is 10. LCM is (30 *40)/10 = 120. So the minimal LCM is 120. So k=9. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is ['5 10']. So a=5, b=10. d=5. Divisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nFor g=1: k=0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10.\n\nFor g=5: a=5 mod5 is 0. So k=0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10. So same LCM. So the minimal k is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, this approach works.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the following steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf a == b: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b).\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g in the divisors:\n\ncompute k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\nBut wait, since a and b can be in any order. Let me think: when a and b are not equal, we compute d as absolute difference. Then, for the k_candidate, it's based on a. But since in the case where a >b, we would have swapped them. Wait, no. Because in the code, after computing d = abs(a -b), but for the k_candidate, it's based on a. Let me check.\n\nSuppose a=10, b=6. Then d=4. So, the code would compute k_candidate as (g - (a%g))%g. But a is 10. However, in this case, the x is a +k, which is 10 +k, and y is 6 +k. So x - y =4. So the same logic applies. So the code is correct regardless of whether a is larger or smaller than b.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute the minimal between a and b. Let me think. For example, if a is larger than b, then when we compute k_candidate based on a, but perhaps the minimal k is better if we compute based on b. But no, since the code is designed for x = a +k and y = b +k. The difference between x and y is d = |a -b|. So, regardless of which is larger, the code should work.\n\nBut perhaps to avoid confusion, it's better to compute d = abs(a -b), and then compute for the original a and b. But the code seems okay.\n\nSo, the code proceeds as follows.\n\nOnce all the divisors are generated, for each, compute the k_candidate as (g - (a % g)) % g. Then compute x = a +k_candidate, y = b +k_candidate. Then compute the LCM of x and y.\n\nOnce all candidates are processed, select the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple candidates have the same minimal LCM, select the smallest k.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all divisors of d.\n\nBut how to generate them efficiently?\n\nThe code can generate all divisors of d by checking up to sqrt(d), as I mentioned before.\n\nOnce that is done, collect all the divisors, and for each, compute the candidate k and LCM.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut what about the case where d is zero? Well, that's handled by the first check.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nFirst, read a and b:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a == b:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    d = abs(a - b)\n\n    # generate all divisors of d\n\n    def get_divisors(n):\n\n        divisors = set()\n\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n\n            if n % i == 0:\n\n                divisors.add(i)\n\n                divisors.add(n//i)\n\n        return divisors\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = float('inf')\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        # compute k_candidate\n\n        remainder = a % g\n\n        if remainder == 0:\n\n            k_candidate = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            k_candidate = g - remainder\n\n        # compute x and y\n\n        x = a + k_candidate\n\n        y = b + k_candidate\n\n        # compute LCM of x and y\n\n        # LCM(x, y) = x * y // GCD(x, y)\n\n        import math\n\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n        current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n\n        # compare with min_lcm\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_k = k_candidate\n\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n            if k_candidate < best_k:\n\n                best_k = k_candidate\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but in the case where multiple divisors give the same LCM, the code picks the smallest k_candidate. But what about when different divisors produce the same LCM but different k_candidates?\n\nYes, the code handles that.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the same LCM can be achieved with multiple k_candidates, but the code may not have considered all possibilities?\n\nNo, because the code considers all divisors of d, and for each, computes the minimal k_candidate for that divisor. So, for example, in the case where a=2, b=6, d=4, the code processes g=1 and g=2. Both give LCM 6, and the minimal k_candidate is 0.\n\nBut what if there's another k not generated by any divisor of d that gives a better LCM? According to earlier reasoning, that's impossible, because the GCD of x and y must divide d. Therefore, the optimal LCM must be achieved by one of the divisors of d.\n\nBut why? Because for any k, the GCD(x, y) divides d. So, for that GCD, which is a divisor of d, the code would have considered that divisor. However, the code for that divisor would generate a k_candidate that makes x and y multiples of that divisor. However, in that case, the LCM would be (x*y)/gcd(x,y). But for that same k, the code may not have considered it, but the code considers all possible divisors of d. So, the code would find the minimal LCM.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where for a certain divisor g, the code computes a k_candidate that gives a certain LCM, but there exists another k (not generated by any divisor of d) that gives a better LCM. But according to the earlier reasoning, that's impossible. Because for that k, the GCD of x and y must divide d. Therefore, there exists a divisor of d, say g', which is the GCD(x, y). So, the code would have considered g' as a divisor of d. And for that divisor, the code would generate a k_candidate that makes x and y multiples of g'. Which would give a LCM of (x * y)/g', which is the same as the LCM for the original k. However, the code may generate a different k_candidate for that divisor, which could be smaller than the original k. Thus, the code would find the minimal k.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test the case where a=2, b=6. The code would generate for g=1 and g=2. For both, the k_candidate is 0. So the code would select the minimal k_candidate (0). Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=10. d=5. Divisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=1: k_candidate is 0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10.\n\nFor g=5: a mod 5 is 0. So k_candidate is 0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10. So best_k is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=4, b=8. d=4. Divisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: k_candidate is 0. x=4, y=8. LCM is 8.\n\nFor g=2: k_candidate is 0. x=4, y=8. LCM is 8.\n\nFor g=4: k_candidate is 0. x=4, y=8. LCM is 8. So all three divisors give same LCM, and the best k is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut what about if there's a k that is not generated by any divisor of d? For example, a=3, b=7. d=4. Let's say k=1. Then x=4, y=8. Which is covered by g=4. So the code would generate that.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=7. d=4. So the code will generate for g=4, k_candidate is (4 - (3%4)) mod 4 → 4-3=1. So k_candidate is 1. x=4, y=8. LCM is 8. Which is the best possible.\n\nAnother example: a=7, b=3. d=4. The same as before.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the same LCM is achieved by multiple divisors, but with different k_candidates? For example, if there are two divisors, say g1 and g2, which generate different k_candidates but same LCM. The code would select the smallest k_candidate.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to import math for gcd. Also, note that in Python, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since x and y are positive, it's fine.\n\nNow, the code for the function get_divisors may generate duplicates, but since we use a set, it's okay.\n\nBut in the code, for each g in the divisors, we process it. However, the code may process the same divisor multiple times if the set is not properly handled. But the code uses a set, so each divisor is processed once.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10 → Output 2.\n\nd=4. Divisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: k_candidate is (1 - (6%1))%1 → 0. x=6, y=10. LCM is 30.\n\nFor g=2: (2 - 6%2) → 6%2 is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized.
