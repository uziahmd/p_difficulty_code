Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent each block? Since there are n roads, each block is determined by the arrangement of these lines. But directly representing all possible blocks isn't feasible because the number can be exponential in n. However, since we only need to find the shortest path between two specific blocks (home and university), perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of considering each block, think of each region as being defined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, the block lies on one side of the line or the other. So, for each road, the home point will be on one side, and the university on some other side. The key is that moving between adjacent blocks requires crossing exactly one road. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university positions, but with the steps being transitions through adjacent regions.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe using BFS. Each state in the BFS represents the current \"position\" in terms of which side of each road you're on. However, since n can be up to 300, storing a state as a binary vector of length n (for each road, whether you are on the positive or negative side) would be impossible due to memory and time constraints. Because 2^300 is way too big.\n\nHmm, that's not going to work. So there must be another approach. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: the movement between blocks is allowed if they share a common border. Which means that two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road. Because crossing a single road would take you from one block to another. So, the adjacency between blocks depends on the roads that separate them.\n\nBut how can we model this? Well, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node represents a region (block), and edges connect regions that are adjacent. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home's region and the university's region.\n\nBut how do we represent the regions? Again, the problem is that there are too many regions. However, the key observation here is that the minimal steps required to get from home to university is equal to the minimal number of roads that separate them. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nEach step allows crossing one road. So, if the home and university are in regions that are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps would be k? No, that's not necessarily correct. Because maybe the regions are connected via a path that crosses roads in a way that accumulates steps. But perhaps the minimal steps correspond to the minimal number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nWait, but how do we determine the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university? Because each road that separates them contributes to the steps. But maybe it's similar to the problem of finding the minimal number of hyperplanes (roads) that separate two points in a space. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of each road as a hyperplane. The home and university are in different regions. Each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of roads that you have to cross to get from the home's position to the university's position.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the problem as a graph where each node is a set of signs (for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side). However, again, with 300 roads, this is impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe the parity of the number of roads crossed? No, that doesn't seem directly applicable.\n\nAlternative idea: the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university. But how to compute that?\n\nLet me think about the home and university positions. For each road, we can check whether the home and university are on the same side of the road or not. If they are on opposite sides, then that road is a separator between them. The minimal steps required would be the minimal number of such separators that you need to cross. But how does that relate to the actual steps?\n\nWait, suppose that there are k roads that separate the home and university. Then, the minimal steps required is k. Because each step allows crossing one road, and if the two points are separated by k roads, you need to cross each of them once. But is that correct?\n\nNo. Because imagine that the home and university are separated by two roads. However, those roads might be arranged such that crossing one road leads to a region that's",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves crossing a road from one block to another adjacent block.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. The home and university positions are in different regions, and the goal is to find the shortest path between these regions by crossing roads.\n2. **Graph Representation**: We can model the problem as a graph where each node represents a region (block) defined by the signs of the equations of the roads. However, directly representing all regions is infeasible due to their exponential number.\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Instead of explicitly representing regions, we use BFS to explore the minimum number of steps required. Each state in the BFS is defined by the current position and the number of steps taken. For each road, we check if moving across it would lead us closer to the university.\n4. **Efficient Check for Road Crossing**: For each road, we determine if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. If they are, crossing that road reduces the distance between them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Precompute for home and university which side of each road they are on\n    home_signs = []\n    univ_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        home_signs.append(1 if val_home > 0 else -1)\n        univ_signs.append(1 if val_univ > 0 else -1)\n\n    # Now, the problem is to find the minimal steps to go from home_signs to univ_signs\n    # Each step flips the sign of exactly one road\n    # So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads where home and univ differ in sign\n    # Wait, no.

Each such road must be crossed once to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of roads.",
