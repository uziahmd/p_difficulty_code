He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that fits the assignments.\n\nThe output needs to be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, with exactly n-1 P's and S's each. And if there are multiple possibilities, any valid one is acceptable.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the correct string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input is all the prefixes and suffixes, but we don't know which is which, we need to find a way to assign them so that there exists a string s that matches the assignments.\n\nBut how can I find such an assignment?\n\nLet me think: For each possible candidate string s (which is of length n), check if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, for that s, assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly. However, since n can be up to 100, and the number of possible s's could be huge (since each character is lowercase letters), enumerating all possible s's isn't feasible directly. Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be determined by looking for the longest possible prefix and suffix. Because, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be a prefix of s, and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be a suffix of s. Also, the actual string s must be such that the combination of the longest prefix and suffix (of length n-1) would overlap correctly. For example, the longest prefix of length n-1 and the longest suffix of length n-1 must agree on the first n-2 characters. Because the entire string s has length n, so the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So their overlapping part (the first n-2 characters of the prefix and the last n-2 characters of the suffix) must match.\n\nWait, but how do I find which of the given strings are the longest prefix and suffix? Well, the input has exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for length n-1, there are two strings. One of them must be the prefix, and the other the suffix. So perhaps we can try all possible combinations of choosing one as prefix and the other as suffix, and see if they can form a possible s.\n\nOnce we have that, then we can build the entire s. For example, suppose the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S. Then, the string s must be P + last character of S. But since P is length n-1 and S is length n-1, then the first n-1 characters of s are P, and the last n-1 are S. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of P must equal the last n-2 characters of S. So the first character of S must be the same as the last character of P. So combining them, the full string s would be P[0] ... P[n-2] and S[1] ... S[n-1]. So the full s would be P concatenated with S[-1], but only if P[0...n-2] == S[1...n-1].\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Find all possible candidates for the longest prefix (length n-1) and suffix (length n-1). There are two options for each, so trying all 2 possibilities for which is prefix and which is suffix.\n\nFor each such pair (prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate):\n\nCheck if the first n-2 characters of prefix_candidate match the last n-2 characters of suffix_candidate. If yes, then the possible s is prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1].\n\nOnce we have such a candidate s, we can check if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, for that s, assign P/S accordingly.\n\nOnce we find such an s, we can generate the answer by checking each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how do I check if all the given strings are prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nBut wait, the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes of s. So for the correct s, each of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their identities (prefix or suffix) are not provided. Our task is to assign 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) to each input string such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that fits the assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix Candidates**: The longest improper prefix and suffix of `s` are of length `n-1`. We consider all possible pairs of these candidates to form potential valid strings `s`.\n2. **Check Validity of Candidate Strings**: For each candidate pair (longest prefix and longest suffix), check if they can be combined to form a valid string `s` by ensuring overlapping parts match.\n3. **Validate All Input Strings**: Once a valid candidate string `s` is found, verify that all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n4. **Generate Result**: Assign 'P' or 'S' based on whether each input string is a prefix or suffix of the valid candidate string `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find all strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all possible pairs for the two candidates of length n-1\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Check if the first n-2 characters of prefix_candidate match the last n-2 of suffix_candidate\n            if prefix_candidate[:-1] == suffix_candidate[1:]:\n                # Build the possible s\n                s_candidate = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n                # Now check if all the input strings are either prefix or suffix of s_candidate\n                valid = True\n                assignments = []\n                for st in strings:\n                    is_prefix = s_candidate.startswith(st)\n                    is_suffix = s_candidate.endswith(st)\n                    if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    # If both are true, we can choose either, but we need to decide which\n                    # However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose arbitrarily\n                    # But how to decide between P and S here?\n                    # Since the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution, we can proceed\n                    # For the purpose of assignment, we need to know whether it is a prefix or suffix\n                    # But how to determine that?
