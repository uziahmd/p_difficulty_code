He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the given prefixes and suffixes. And our job is to assign P or S to each input string such that there exists some s that matches.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find the correct assignments. Let's think about the possible approach.\n\nLet me think: For a string s of length n, all its prefixes of length 1 to n-1 and all suffixes of length 1 to n-1 are given. But we don't know which is which. However, the original string s must have exactly one prefix of each length from 1 to n-1, and similarly for suffixes. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input has exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. Because for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there's exactly one prefix and one suffix. So for each l, there are two strings of length l in the input. But the problem says that the input is given in arbitrary order, and we have to assign which is prefix and which is suffix.\n\nBut how can we find the correct assignment?\n\nThe key idea here is that the original string s must have a unique prefix of each length (since each prefix is uniquely determined by the string). Similarly for suffixes. Therefore, for each possible candidate s, we can check if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it. However, since we don't know s, perhaps we can find s based on the given data.\n\nWait, but how? Well, the original string s must have as its prefixes all the strings that are supposed to be prefixes, and similarly for suffixes. But since the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes, but we don't know which is which, maybe we can find s by considering that the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap in some way.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: the original string s must be such that for each of the given strings, it's either a prefix or a suffix of s. Moreover, there must be exactly one prefix of each length from 1 to n-1, and same for suffixes.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, perhaps the correct s can be determined by taking the longest possible candidate. For example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must both be present in the input. But since we don't know which is which, maybe we can try all possibilities for the longest ones.\n\nWait, the original string s has a prefix of length n-1, which is s[0..n-2], and a suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1]. These two strings must be present in the input. However, in the input, there are two strings of length n-1. So one of them is the prefix, and the other is the suffix. But for the original string, these two strings must overlap. For example, if the prefix of length n-1 is P, and the suffix of length n-1 is S, then the original string s must be P + last character, and also S's first character is the first character of s, etc. Wait, perhaps combining them.\n\nLet me think: suppose the original s is of length n. Let's say that the prefix of length n-1 is P, and the suffix of length n-1 is S. Then, P must be s without its last character. S must be s without its first character. Therefore, the original string s can be formed by combining P and the first character of S? No. Wait, for example, if s is \"ababa\", then the prefix of length 4 is \"abab\" and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". The original string is \"ababa\". So the prefix of length n-1 (n=5) is \"abab\", and the suffix is \"baba\". The original string is the prefix plus the last character (the 'a'), which is the same as the first character of the suffix (the 'b'?) Wait no. The suffix of length 4 is the last four characters of s. So for s = ababa, the suffix of length 4 is 'baba', which is s[1:5]. So the original string is the prefix of length 4 (s[0:4] = 'abab') plus the fifth character (a). Also, the suffix of length 4 is s[1:5] = 'baba'. So the original string is the suffix of length",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct string `s` based on the given input and then classifying each input string as either a prefix or a suffix.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Original String**: The original string `s` can be determined by considering the longest possible prefixes and suffixes. For a string of length `n`, the longest prefix and suffix (each of length `n-1`) must overlap in a way that allows us to reconstruct `s`.\n2. **Check Overlap**: For each pair of strings of length `n-1` from the input, check if they can form a valid string `s` such that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n3. **Validate Candidates**: Once a potential candidate for `s` is found, validate it against all given strings to ensure they are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Generate all possible candidates for the original string s\n    # We need to consider all pairs of strings of length n-1\n    candidates = []\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    for i in range(len(strings)):\n        if len(strings[i]) == len_n_minus_1:\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(strings)):\n                if len(strings[j]) == len_n_minus_1:\n                    # Try combining them to get possible s\n                    # Case 1: strings[i] is prefix, strings[j] is suffix\n                    # s should be prefix + last_char, and suffix starts with first_char of s[1]\n                    # So the first character of suffix should be s[1], which is the second character of the prefix\n                    if strings[i][-1] == strings[j][0]:\n                        s_candidate = strings[i] + strings[j][len_n_minus_1 - 1]\n                        candidates.append(s_candidate)\n                    # Case 2: strings[j] is prefix, strings[i] is suffix\n                    if strings[j][-1] == strings[i][0]:\n                        s_candidate = strings[j] + strings[i][len_n_minus_1 - 1]\n                        candidates.append(s_candidate)\n    \n    # Now find the candidate that is consistent with all the given strings\n    for candidate in candidates:\n        # Check if all given strings are either prefix or suffix of candidate\n        # Collect all prefixes and suffixes of candidate\n        prefixes = set()\n        suffixes = set()\n        for l in range(1, n):\n            prefixes.add(candidate[:l])\n            suffixes.add(candidate[-l:])\n        \n        # Now check if all input strings are in prefixes or suffixes\n        valid = True\n        for s in strings:\n            if s not in prefixes and s not in suffixes:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            # Now assign P and S\n            result = []\n            for s_str in strings:\n                if s_str in prefixes:\n                    # Need to check if it's a prefix of the candidate\n                    # But how to know which one is prefix or suffix?
