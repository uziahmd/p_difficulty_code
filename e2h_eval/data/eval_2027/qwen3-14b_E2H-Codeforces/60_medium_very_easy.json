Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the task is about Morse code representations and counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed from substrings of a string S after each modification. The key points are:\n\nEach English letter is represented by a Morse code string of length 1-4, made of 0s and 1s. But four specific strings are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". All other strings of lengths 1-4 are valid and correspond to a unique letter.\n\nThe problem is, after each append operation to S (which starts empty), we need to compute the number of non-empty sequences of letters that can be formed by some substring of S. Each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting a substring of S into Morse code letters, where each part is a valid code.\n\nFor example, if S is \"111\", then possible substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", \"1\", \"11\", \"1\", etc. But each of these substrings must be split into valid Morse codes. For instance, \"11\" could be a single letter (valid) or two letters (each \"1\"), but since the total length is 2, splitting into two parts would require each part to be length 1. So for each substring, we need to count all possible ways to split it into valid Morse codes, and then sum all these possibilities across all substrings.\n\nBut how do we model this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Because for each position in the string S, we can track how many ways there are to split the current string up to that position into valid Morse code letters. But since the problem requires considering all substrings, perhaps we need to track for each possible ending position, the number of valid splits for all possible substrings ending at that position.\n\nWait, the problem says that each sequence of letters is represented by a substring of S. So for example, if the substring is \"111\", then possible splits are:\n\n- one letter: \"111\" (if it's valid)\n- two letters: \"1\" and \"11\" (both valid)\n- three letters: \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"\n\nEach of these contributes to the count. So for each substring, the number of ways to split it into valid Morse codes is added to the total.\n\nSo the total answer is the sum over all possible substrings of S of the number of valid splits for that substring.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's denote that for each position i in the string S, we can track for all possible lengths (1-4) ending at i, whether they form a valid code. Then, for each i, we can calculate the number of ways to split the string up to i into valid codes, considering all possible splits.\n\nWait, but the problem is not about splitting the entire string into valid codes. It's about all possible substrings. For example, each substring of S can be considered as a separate string, and for each such substring, we need to count the number of ways to split it into valid codes. Then, sum all those counts.\n\nBut considering that for each step, S grows by one character. So after m steps, the length of S is m. For each step, we need to process the new character and update our data structure.\n\nBut for each new character added to S, the new substrings that end at this position are the ones starting at positions 1 to current length. So for example, when S is length k, the new substrings are the ones that end at k, with varying starting positions.\n\nBut calculating for each substring is O(n^2) in the worst case, which for m=3000 would be 3000^2 = 9 million operations. That's manageable, but maybe we can find a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about dynamic programming for each position. Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to split the first i characters of S into valid Morse code letters. Then, the total number of valid splits for all substrings would be the sum over all possible substrings of the number of splits for that substring.\n\nBut how does that relate to the dp array?\n\nWait, the dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the entire first i characters into valid codes. However, the problem requires considering all possible substrings of S. So for example, for each j from 1 to i, the substring S[j..i] can be split into valid codes in some number of ways. Summing all those for all j and i would give the total.\n\nBut how can we track this?\n\nAnother approach: For each position i in the string S, we can track for each possible ending of a substring (like, the last part of the substring being of length 1, 2, 3, or 4) and compute how many ways there are to split the substring ending at i.\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that when adding a new character to S, we can look back up to 4 positions and see if the substring ending at the current position is a valid Morse code. Then, for each valid code, we can add to the total count the number of ways to split the remaining part.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each position i, let's compute f[i], which is the number of valid splits for the substring S[1..i]. Then, the recurrence is:\n\nf[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (if the substring S[i-k+1..i] is valid, then f[i -k] )\n\nBut we need to handle the base case where i-k is zero. For example, if i-k is zero, then it's the empty string, and the number of ways is 1 (since the empty string is the prefix before the current substring). So, for each i, f[i] is the sum of f[i -k] for each k in 1-4 where the substring of length k ending at i is valid.\n\nThis is similar to the classic word break problem. However, in this case, the problem isn't to count the number of splits for the entire string, but for all possible substrings. Wait, no. Because the total answer is the sum over all possible substrings of the number of splits for that substring.\n\nBut how can we compute that sum?\n\nLet me think again. For example, suppose the string is of length n. For each substring S[a..b], we need to compute the number of ways to split it into valid Morse codes. The total answer is the sum of all these numbers for all possible a and b.\n\nNow, if I have a dynamic programming approach that tracks for each position i, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i, for all possible lengths.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid splits for the substring ending at position i. Wait, no, that's not precise. Maybe for each position i, and for each possible length l (1-4), if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of ways to split that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the part before it plus 1 (if it's a single code). Or maybe it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i in the string, we can track the number of valid splits for all substrings that end at i. Let me think. For example, for each i, we can compute the number of ways to split the substring S[j..i] for all j ≤ i.\n\nBut that seems too broad. Let's think recursively. Suppose I have a new character added to the string. For each possible position where a valid Morse code ends at this new character, I can add the number of ways to split the previous part.\n\nFor example, when processing the i-th character, for each possible length l (1-4), check if the substring ending at i with length l is valid. If it is, then the number of ways to split the substring ending at i is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i-l, plus 1 (if the entire substring is just the current code). Wait, no. Because the number of ways to split the substring S[j..i] is equal to the sum of the number of ways to split S[j..k] multiplied by the number of ways to split S[k+1..i], for all possible k. But that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the substring S[...i], the number of ways to split it is equal to the sum for each possible l (length of the last code) that is valid, of the number of ways to split the substring up to i - l.\n\nSo, for example, if the current position is i, and the last code is of length l, then the number of ways is the number of ways to split the first i - l characters, and then adding this code. So, if we define dp[i] as the number of ways to split the first i characters into valid codes, then dp[i] = sum (dp[i - l] for l in 1-4 if the substring of length l ending at i is valid). And dp[0] = 1 (empty string has one way to split).\n\nThis is the same as the classic DP approach. But how does this help with the problem?\n\nBecause the problem is not about the entire string, but all substrings. So, for each position i, the number of ways to split the substring S[1..i] is dp[i]. However, the answer requires considering all substrings. For example, the substring S[2..i], S[3..i], ..., S[i..i].\n\nBut how can we compute the sum over all substrings?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that for each i, we can compute the total number of valid splits for all substrings that end at i. Then, the total answer after each step is the sum of all these values up to the current step.\n\nSo, let's define for each i, the value g[i] as the sum of the number of valid splits for all substrings ending at i. Then, the total answer is the sum of g[1] + g[2] + ... + g[n], where n is the current length of S.\n\nHow can we compute g[i]?\n\nWell, for each i, the substrings ending at i are of length 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., up to i. For each possible length l (from 1 to 4, since longer than 4 can't be a valid code), we can check if the substring of length l ending at i is valid. Then, for each such l, the number of ways to split that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the part before it (i.e., the substring up to i-l) plus 1? Or perhaps it's the dp[i-l]?\n\nWait, the number of ways to split the substring S[i-l+1..i] is equal to dp[i] - dp[i-l], no. No, that's not right.\n\nLet me clarify. Let's say that the substring S[a..b] can be split into valid codes in x ways. How can we compute x using our dp array?\n\nIf we have a dp array where dp[k] is the number of ways to split the first k characters of S into valid codes. Then, the number of ways to split the substring S[a..b] is equal to dp[b] - dp[a-1], but only if we consider that the entire substring is part of the split. But that's not correct. Because dp[b] counts the number of splits for the entire first b characters, which includes splits that may not include the entire substring. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, for the substring S[a..b], the number of ways to split it into valid codes can be computed using a similar DP approach. Let's call this value h[b][a], but that would be O(n^2) space, which for n=3000 is 9 million entries. But with m=3000 steps, maybe that's manageable?\n\nBut for each step, we need to compute all possible substrings. That's probably not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as follows. Each time a new character is added to S, we can compute for all possible substrings ending at the new position. For each of these substrings, we can compute the number of ways to split them into valid codes. Then, we add these numbers to the total.\n\nSo, for example, when the string is length i, the new substrings are those that end at i. Their starting positions are from 1 to i. For each such substring, we need to compute the number of ways to split it into valid codes.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of another DP. Let's define for each position i, and for each possible length l (up to 4), the number of ways to split the substring ending at i with length l. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of a new DP array, say, ways[i], which represents the number of valid splits for the substring ending at i (i.e., the substring S[...i], but any starting point). But that's not clear.\n\nWait, here's a better idea. Let's define for each position i, the number of valid splits for all substrings that end at i. Let's call this value total_i. Then, the overall answer after each step is the sum of total_1 + total_2 + ... + total_i.\n\nNow, how can we compute total_i?\n\nFor the substring ending at i, the possible substrings are of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's take each possible length l (from 1 to min(4, i)), check if the substring of length l ending at i is valid. If it is, then the number of ways for that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the part before it (the substring ending at i-l) plus 1? Or maybe it's the number of ways to split the part before plus the current code.\n\nWait, for example, if the substring S[1..i] is being considered, and the last code is of length l. Then the number of ways is dp[i - l], where dp[i - l] is the number of ways to split the first i - l characters. Then, adding the current code gives us one way. But for the substring S[1..i], the total is the sum over all possible l where the code is valid.\n\nBut that's exactly the dp[i] from before. However, that's for the entire substring S[1..i]. But we need to consider all possible substrings ending at i.\n\nSo, for example, the substring S[j..i] can be split into valid codes. How can we compute this?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each position i, and for each possible l (1-4), if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of ways to split S[j..i] (where j = i - l + 1) is equal to the number of ways to split S[j..i - l] (if any) plus 1 (if the entire substring is just the current code). But that's not correct. Because the number of ways to split S[j..i] is equal to the sum of the ways to split S[j..k] multiplied by the ways to split S[k+1..i], for all k. But this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible l (1-4), if the substring S[i-l+1..i] is valid, then the number of ways to split the substring S[i-l+1..i] is equal to the number of ways to split the substring S[i-l+1..i - l] (if any) plus 1. Wait, no. Because if the substring is of length l, then if l is 1, then it's one way. If l is 2, then the number of ways is 1 (the entire substring as one code) plus the number of ways to split the first part if it's split into multiple codes. Wait, no. For example, if the substring is of length 2, and the first character is a valid code (length 1) and the second is also a valid code (length 1), then there are two ways: split into two codes, or one code (if the entire 2-length is valid). So the number of ways depends on the possibilities of splitting the substring into valid codes.\n\nSo, for the substring S[j..i], the number of ways is the same as the dp[i - j + 1] in a modified DP where the initial state is 0. But how can we track that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. For each position i, we can compute the number of valid splits for all substrings ending at i. Let's call this value g[i]. To compute g[i], we can look back up to 4 positions. For each possible l (1-4), if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of ways for that substring is 1 (if l is 1, and it's valid) plus the sum of the ways for the substrings that end at i - l. Wait, no. Because for example, if the substring of length l is valid, then the number of ways for the substring ending at i is equal to the number of ways to split the substring up to i - l, and then add this code. But that's only if we consider that the entire substring S[j..i] is split into the previous part and the current code. However, there might be other splits.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to model this with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me define dp[i] as the total number of valid splits for all substrings ending at position i. Then, for each i, dp[i] can be calculated based on previous values.\n\nWhen we add a new character to the string (say, the i-th character), for each possible l (1-4), we check if the substring of length l ending at i is valid. If it is, then the number of ways for that particular substring (of length l) is equal to 1 (if the entire substring is taken as one code) plus the sum of dp[i - l] (the ways to split the substrings ending at i - l, and then adding this code). Wait, no. Because if the substring is of length l, then the number of ways to split it is equal to the number of ways to split the part before (if any) multiplied by the ways to split the current code. For example, if the substring is split into a code of length l, then the number of ways is 1 (the entire code) plus the sum of the ways to split the substrings that end at i - l and then add this code. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each valid code of length l ending at i, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i (of length l) is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i - l, plus 1 (the case where the entire substring is just this code). Wait, no. Because the number of ways to split the substring ending at i (length l) is the same as the number of ways to split the substring up to i - l (if any), and then adding this code. So for example, if the substring of length l is valid, then the number of ways for that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring up to i - l (call it x) plus 1 (the case where the entire substring is one code). Wait, no. Because the x is the number of ways to split the substring ending at i - l. But the current code is of length l. So the total ways for the substring ending at i (of length l) is x + 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the substring S[j..i], where j = i - l + 1. The number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the first part (S[j..k]) and then the rest (S[k+1..i]) for all possible k. But this is recursive and hard to model.\n\nBut here's another idea. Let's define for each position i, the value f[i] as the number of ways to split the entire string up to i into valid codes. Then, the total number of ways for all substrings is the sum over all possible j and i of the number of ways to split S[j..i].\n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet's think of the following. For each i, the number of ways to split S[j..i] for all j ≤ i is equal to the sum of f[i] - f[j-1] for all j. But this is not correct. Because f[i] is the number of ways to split the entire first i characters. However, the number of ways to split S[j..i] is not directly related to f[i].\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the number of ways to split all substrings that end at i is the sum for each possible l (1-4) of the number of ways to split the substring of length l ending at i. Let's call this value total_i. So, the total answer after each step is the sum of total_1 + total_2 + ... + total_i.\n\nTo compute total_i, we can look back up to 4 positions. For each l in 1-4:\n\n- Check if the substring ending at i of length l is valid.\n- If yes, then the number of ways for that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i - l (if any) plus 1. Wait, no. For example, if the substring is of length l, then the number of ways to split it is 1 (the entire code) plus the sum of the ways to split the previous parts. But how?\n\nActually, for the substring of length l ending at i, the number of ways to split it is equal to the number of ways to split the string up to i - l (i.e., f[i - l]) multiplied by 1 (adding this code as the last part). Plus 1 if the entire substring is a valid code. Wait, no. Because the f[i - l] represents the number of ways to split the first i - l characters. If we add the current code (length l), then the number of ways to split the substring S[1..i] is f[i - l] * 1. But we are interested in the number of ways to split the substring S[i - l + 1..i], which is a different thing.\n\nThis seems to be getting stuck. Let me think of a small example.\n\nTake the first sample input: after three '1's, S is \"111\".\n\nThe substrings and their splits:\n\nFor each substring:\n\n- \"1\": 1 way (itself)\n- \"11\": 2 ways (split into two '1's, or one '11' if valid)\n- \"111\": 3 ways (split into three '1's, one '1' and '11', two '1's and '1', or one '111' if valid)\n\nBut according to the note, the answer after three steps is 7. Let's see:\n\nThe total number of valid splits for all substrings:\n\nSubstrings:\n\nLength 1:\n\n\"1\" → 1\n\n\"1\" → 1\n\n\"1\" → 1 → total 3.\n\nLength 2:\n\n\"11\" → 2 ways (as above)\n\n\"11\" → 2 ways (the two '1's and the '11').\n\nLength 3:\n\n\"111\" → 3 ways (as above)\n\nTotal sum is 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10? But according to the sample output, after three steps, the answer is 7. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the sample output for the first input is [1, 3, 7]. Let me recheck the note. The note says that after three steps, the answer is 7. Let me recount.\n\nThe note says that the valid splits are:\n\n\"T\" (1), \"M\" (11), \"O\" (111), \"TT\" (11), \"TM\" (111), \"MT\" (111), \"TTT\" (111). That's 7 total.\n\nAh, because each of these represents a sequence of letters. So for the substring \"11\", the splits are:\n\n- one letter (11) → M\n\n- two letters (1 and 1) → T and T → TT.\n\nSo two ways. Similarly, for the substring \"111\", there are three ways:\n\n- one letter (111) → O\n\n- two letters (1 and 11) → T and M → TM\n\n- two letters (11 and 1) → M and T → MT\n\n- three letters (1, 1, 1) → TTT\n\nWait, that's four ways, but the note says three. What's going on here?\n\nWait the note lists seven entries. Let me recount the note's explanation:\n\nThey list:\n\n\"T\" (1), \"M\" (11), \"O\" (111), \"TT\" (11), \"TM\" (111), \"MT\" (111), \"TTT\" (111). That's 7 entries. So for the substring \"11\", there are two ways (split into one or two letters). For the substring \"111\", there are three ways (split into one, two (two different ways?), or three letters). Wait, why three?\n\nAh, because for the substring \"111\", the possible splits are:\n\n- one code: 111 → O.\n\n- two codes: 1 and 11 → T and M → TM.\n\n- two codes: 11 and 1 → M and T → MT.\n\n- three codes: 1, 1, 1 → TTT.\n\nThat's four ways. But the note says three. What's the discrepancy here?\n\nAh, looking back at the note's explanation: the note says that \"TTT\" translates into \"111\". So that's three letters. But why is there no mention of the two-code splits? Oh, wait, the note says that the sequences are:\n\n- T (1)\n\n- M (11)\n\n- O (111)\n\n- TT (11) → which is two letters, but the code for TT is \"11\".\n\n- TM (111) → T and M → code is \"1\"+\"11\" = \"111\".\n\n- MT (111) → M and T → \"11\"+\"1\" = \"111\".\n\n- TTT (111) → three letters, code is \"111\".\n\nSo, the total number of sequences is 7. But according to the splits for the substring \"111\", there are four ways (one, two (two different ways?), three). However, the note counts three of them. Why?\n\nAh! Because the sequences are distinct based on the order of letters. But the problem says that the sequences are non-empty sequences of English letters. So for the substring \"111\", the splits are:\n\n- one code (O) → counts as 1.\n\n- two codes (T and M) → counts as 1 sequence (TM).\n\n- two codes (M and T) → counts as 1 sequence (MT).\n\n- three codes (T, T, T) → counts as 1 sequence (TTT).\n\nSo total of 4 ways. But according to the note, there are three entries for \"111\" (O, TM, MT, TTT?), but the note lists three entries: O, TM, MT, TTT? Wait the note lists:\n\n- O (111)\n\n- TM (111)\n\n- MT (111)\n\n- TTT (111)\n\nSo four entries. But the note says seven entries. Let me recount:\n\nThe note lists:\n\n1. T\n\n2. M\n\n3. O\n\n4. TT\n\n5. TM\n\n6. MT\n\n7. TTT\n\nYes, seven entries. So for the substring \"11\", there are two ways (split into one code (M) and two codes (TT)). For the substring \"111\", there are four ways (O, TM, MT, TTT). But according to the sample output, after three steps, the answer is 7. Which suggests that the total number of sequences is 7. How does that add up?\n\nLet's compute the sum:\n\nSubstrings:\n\nLength 1:\n\nThere are three substrings (\"1\", \"1\", \"1\") each contributing 1 way → 3.\n\nLength 2:\n\nTwo substrings (\"11\", \"11\") each contributing 2 ways → 2*2=4.\n\nLength 3:\n\nOne substring (\"111\") contributing 4 ways → 4.\n\nTotal sum: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11? But the sample output is 7. There's a contradiction here. What's wrong?\n\nAh! Oh wait, no. The problem says that each sequence of letters corresponds to a substring of S in Morse code. But the way the sequences are counted is that for each substring of S, we count the number of ways to split it into valid codes. Each split corresponds to a sequence of letters. But the same sequence can be formed from different substrings. However, the problem says to count all such sequences. For example, the sequence \"TT\" comes from the substring \"11\" (split into two T's), but also from the substring \"11\" again. So each occurrence is counted separately.\n\nWait, the problem says to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S. So, for example, the sequence \"T\" appears three times (each single '1'), but each is counted as one sequence. However, the problem says to count the number of such sequences, not the number of occurrences. Or is it the number of occurrences?\n\nNo, the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe task is to find and report, after each modification, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nSo, for example, if the same sequence can be formed by multiple substrings, it's still counted once. Or is it counted multiple times?\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample, after three '1's, the answer is 7. According to the note, there are seven distinct sequences. So the answer counts distinct sequences, not the number of ways to split the substrings.\n\nWait, that changes everything! Oh my god, this is a critical misunderstanding.\n\nIf the problem requires counting the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any substring of S, then the approach is completely different. But the sample explanation suggests that it's counting the number of distinct sequences. For example, the note says that \"TT\" is counted once even though it appears in two substrings (the first two '1's and the last two '1's). But in the sample explanation, it's listed once. Hence, the answer is the number of distinct sequences, not the number of ways to split substrings.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial understanding. This is a big mistake. So what's the correct interpretation?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nEach such sequence is a sequence of letters, where the concatenation of their Morse codes is a substring of S. So, for example, if two different substrings of S can be split into the same sequence of letters, it should be counted once. But the sample shows that the answer after three steps is 7, which matches the note's explanation of seven distinct sequences.\n\nSo the problem is not to count the number of ways to split substrings, but the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by any substring.\n\nThis changes the approach entirely. Now, the problem becomes: for all substrings of S, generate all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting the substring into valid Morse codes, and count the number of distinct sequences.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nThis seems very challenging. For example, for each substring, we need to generate all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting it into valid codes, and then collect all these sequences into a set, and count the size of the set.\n\nBut for m=3000, this approach would be too slow. For example, a string of length 3000 has about 4.5 million substrings, and each could have many splits. Generating all sequences for each substring is computationally infeasible.\n\nBut the sample indicates that the answer is the number of distinct sequences. So how to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Each valid sequence of letters corresponds to a unique string of Morse codes (since each letter has a unique code). So the sequence of letters corresponds to a unique concatenation of Morse codes. Therefore, the number of distinct sequences is equal to the number of distinct Morse code strings that can be formed by concatenating valid codes, and which are substrings of S.\n\nWait, this is a crucial insight. Because each sequence of letters corresponds to exactly one Morse code string (the concatenation of their individual codes). And since each valid code is unique, the sequence of letters is uniquely determined by the Morse code string. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct Morse code strings that are substrings of S, and can be split into valid codes.\n\nWait, no. Because the Morse code string is formed by concatenating the codes of the letters. So for example, the sequence \"TT\" corresponds to the Morse code \"11\" (since each T is \"1\"). The sequence \"M\" is also \"11\". So the same Morse code string can represent different sequences of letters, but in this case, the same Morse code string is generated from different sequences. But no, since each letter has a unique code. So if the Morse code string is \"11\", it can be split into either one letter (M) or two letters (T and T). Thus, the same Morse code string can represent multiple sequences of letters. So the problem is not to count the number of distinct Morse code strings, but the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any Morse code substring into valid codes.\n\nBut this seems impossible to track efficiently. However, the sample suggests that the answer is the number of distinct sequences. But how?\n\nLet me re-examine the first sample. After three '1's, the S is \"111\".\n\nThe possible Morse code substrings are:\n\nAll substrings of \"111\":\n\n\"1\" → can be split into T (sequence T).\n\n\"1\" → T.\n\n\"1\" → T.\n\n\"11\" → can be split into M (sequence M) or TT (sequence TT).\n\n\"11\" → same as above.\n\n\"111\" → can be split into O (sequence O), TM (sequence TM), MT (sequence MT), TTT (sequence TTT).\n\nSo the distinct sequences are T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT → 7, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any possible way of splitting any substring of S into valid Morse codes.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nThe key observation is that each sequence corresponds to a unique way of splitting a Morse code string into valid codes. But different Morse code strings can lead to the same sequence. However, the problem wants the count of distinct sequences.\n\nThis seems very challenging. How can we track all possible sequences that can be formed?\n\nAlternative approach: Think of the sequences as strings of letters, and each such string corresponds to a unique Morse code string (the concatenation of their individual codes). So, for example, the sequence \"TT\" corresponds to the Morse code \"11\", which is the same as the sequence \"M\".\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of distinct Morse code strings that are substrings of S and can be split into valid codes. Wait, no. Because the same Morse code string can be split into different sequences. For example, \"11\" can be split into \"M\" or \"TT\", which are two different sequences. Therefore, the number of distinct sequences is larger than the number of distinct Morse code strings.\n\nThis suggests that the problem is not about the Morse code strings, but about the sequences of letters. This makes it very difficult to track.\n\nBut given that the sample uses the same Morse code string to represent multiple sequences, and the answer counts them as separate, it's clear that the problem requires counting all possible sequences generated by splitting any Morse code substring into valid codes.\n\nThis seems computationally heavy. However, given the constraints (m=3000), perhaps we can find a way to model this with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's define a set of sequences that can be formed up to each step. But for each new character added to S, we can process all possible new substrings ending at this position and generate new sequences.\n\nBut how to represent the sequences? Since the sequences are made of letters, and there are 26 letters, but the number of possible sequences is exponential. This is not feasible for m=3000.\n\nAlternative idea: Each valid sequence corresponds to a certain way of splitting a Morse code string. But since the Morse code string is a substring of S, and each such Morse code string can be split into valid codes in various ways, generating all possible sequences is equivalent to generating all possible ways to split all possible substrings into valid codes.\n\nBut again, this is not tractable for large m.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is not asking for distinct sequences, but for the number of ways to split all substrings into valid codes.
