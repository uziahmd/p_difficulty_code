Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me think about the properties of regular polygons. In a regular n-gon, each interior angle is (n-2)*180/(n) degrees. Wait, but that's for the internal angles of the polygon itself. However, here we're talking about angles formed by selecting three vertices. So maybe I need to find the measure of the angle formed when choosing three vertices.\n\nLet me recall that in a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. But when you pick three points, the angle at the middle point depends on how many steps apart the other points are.\n\nFor example, in a regular polygon, if we have three vertices v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the vertex where the angle is measured, then the angle depends on the number of sides between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, maybe the angle depends on how many edges are skipped between the points.\n\nLet me think of a square. For example, if you take vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at vertex 2 is 90 degrees. But if you take vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at vertex 2 would be 45 degrees. Because the lines from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4 form a 45-degree angle. Wait, how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the angle formed by three vertices in a regular polygon. Let me try to derive it.\n\nIn a regular polygon, all vertices lie on a circle. So, the angle at v2 (the vertex of the angle) is an inscribed angle. Let me consider the arc between v1 and v3. The measure of the angle at v2 would depend on the arc that's opposite to it. \n\nWait, in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that subtended at the circumference. So, if the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is k steps (each step is one edge of the polygon), then the central angle would be k*(360/n) degrees. The inscribed angle at v2 would be half of that, but only if v2 is on the circumference. Wait, but in this case, the angle is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. So the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. \n\nSo, let's say that between v1 and v3, there are k steps. Then the arc length is k*(360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of that arc. But wait, no. Because if the arc is between v1 and v3, then the angle at v2 is actually half of that arc. Wait, but the arc that's opposite to the angle. So for example, if the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is k*(360/n) degrees, then the angle at v2 is half of that. \n\nBut how do we determine k? Let's think. Suppose the polygon has n vertices. Let's fix v2 as the middle vertex. Then, the number of steps between v1 and v2 is m, and between v2 and v3 is p. But since the polygon is regular, the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 would determine the arc. However, since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 is determined by how many vertices are between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon in one direction.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3. Let me think of the case where v1 is adjacent to v2, and v3 is adjacent to v2. Then the angle is the internal angle of the polygon. But for a regular polygon, the internal angle is (n-2)*180/n. For example, in a square (n=4), the internal angle is 90 degrees. But when you take v1, v2, v3 as consecutive vertices, the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. However, if you take v1 as adjacent to v2, and v3 as two steps away (like in the square, v1=1, v2=2, v3=4), then the angle at v2 is 45 degrees. So how does that fit into the formula?\n\nLet me think again. For the square, the arc between v1 and v3 (when v2 is 2, and v1 is 1, v3 is 4). The arc from 1 to 4 not passing through 2 would be 3 steps (since the polygon is 4 vertices). Wait, the arc from 1 to 4 passing through 3 is 3 steps. But the arc that doesn't pass through v2 (which is 2) would be the other way. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIn a regular polygon, any three points v1, v2, v3 will form an angle at v2. The measure of that angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. However, since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the direction that doesn't include v2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the angle is (k * 180)/n, where k is the number of sides between v1 and v3. Wait, but how to find k?\n\nLet me think of the square again. Suppose v2 is fixed. Let's say v1 is one step clockwise from v2, and v3 is one step counter-clockwise from v2. Then, the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. But if v3 is two steps away (in the same direction as v1?), then maybe the angle changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is equal to ( (k-1) * 180 ) / n, where k is the number of vertices between v1 and v3. Wait, not sure. Let me think of examples.\n\nTake the square (n=4). If I select three vertices 1, 2, 3. Then the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. The number of steps between 1 and 3 is 2 steps (since 1 to 2 to 3). But the arc between them (the one not containing v2?) No, because v2 is between them. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, when considering the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2, the number of steps would be (n - (steps between v1 and v3 via v2)). For example, in the square, if v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 3, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 would be the other way around the circle, which is 1 to 4 to 3. That's two steps. So the arc length is 2*(360/4) = 180 degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of that, which is 90 degrees. Which matches the actual angle.\n\nAnother example: in the square, if we take v1=1, v2=2, v3=4. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 is 1 to 4 (one step). So the arc length is 360/4 = 90 degrees. The angle at v2 is 90/2 = 45 degrees. Which is correct. So the formula seems to be:\n\nangle = (arc length) / 2, where arc length is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nSo the arc length is (k * 360 / n), where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc. Then the angle at v2 is (k * 360 / n) / 2 = (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nBut how do we find k?\n\nWell, given that v1 and v3 are two vertices, the arc between them that does not contain v2 must be such that when you go from v1 to v3 along that arc, you don't pass through v2. So, given that v2 is between v1 and v3 along the other arc. \n\nBut how to compute k for a general case. Let's think that in a regular polygon, for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the direction that doesn't include v2. \n\nAlternatively, for any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, the number of steps between v1 and v3 (along the arc that does not contain v2) is equal to (n - m), where m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2. But how to compute that?\n\nWait, suppose that between v1 and v3, there are m steps along the arc that includes v2. Then the arc that does not include v2 has (n - m) steps. But how to find m?\n\nWell, m is the minimal number of steps between v1 and v3. Wait, no. Because in a polygon, between any two vertices, there are two arcs. The minimal number of steps is the shorter arc, but depending on where v2 is located, the arc that does not contain v2 can be longer or shorter.\n\nBut perhaps for the angle calculation, the arc that does not contain v2 is the one that determines the angle. So, given that v2 is the vertex of the angle, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the one that's used in the formula.\n\nSo, how to compute k? Let's imagine that the polygon is numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Let's fix v2 as some vertex. Then, for any v1 and v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be determined. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is (n - d), where d is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does contain v2. But how to find d?\n\nBut for the angle to be formed with v2 as the vertex, v1 and v3 must be on different sides of v2. For example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 in one direction, and v3 is adjacent in the other direction, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is the longer arc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key idea is that for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the direction that does not pass through v2. Let me think of this as follows: when you pick v1 and v3 such that they are both on the same side of v2 (i.e., if you move clockwise from v2, you reach v1 and then later reach v3), then the arc that does not contain v2 would be the other way around. But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a simpler approach. For any three vertices v1, v2, v3, where v2 is the middle vertex, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the direction that skips v2. Let me think that if between v1 and v3 (in one direction) there are k steps, then the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. But how to compute k?\n\nAlternatively, considering that for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3. For example, in a regular polygon with n sides, if between v1 and v3 there are m edges in one direction, then the angle at v2 is (m-1)*180/(n) ?\n\nWait, let's take the square example again. For the case where v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 3. The number of edges between v1 and v3 (in the direction that goes through v2) is 2 (edges 1-2 and 2-3). Then m is 2. The formula (m-1)*180/n would be (2-1)*180/4 = 45 degrees. But that's not the correct angle. The actual angle is 90 degrees. So that formula is wrong.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's think about the central angles. For the square, the central angle between adjacent vertices is 90 degrees. For the angle at v2, which is 90 degrees when v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2. How is that related to the central angles?\n\nIn this case, the angle at v2 is formed by two radii from the center to v1 and v3. Wait, no. The angle at v2 is not a central angle. It's an inscribed angle. But maybe I can relate it to the central angle.\n\nLet me imagine that the polygon is inscribed in a unit circle. Let me consider three points A, B, C on the circle, where B is the vertex of the angle. The angle ABC is what we need to calculate. The arc AC that does not contain B is the arc that is opposite to the angle. The measure of angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B.\n\nSo, if the arc AC (not containing B) is θ degrees, then angle ABC is θ/2 degrees.\n\nSo, how to compute θ? Well, θ is equal to (number of steps between A and C along that arc) multiplied by (360 / n). Because each step between adjacent vertices corresponds to 360/n degrees.\n\nNow, the number of steps between A and C along the arc that does not contain B depends on the positions of A and C relative to B.\n\nLet me think of B as fixed. Then, if A is k steps clockwise from B, and C is l steps counter-clockwise from B, then the arc AC that does not contain B would be (k + l) steps. Because from A, you go clockwise k steps to reach B, then counter-clockwise l steps to reach C. So the arc from A to C that doesn't include B would be the other way around, which is (n - (k + l)) steps? Or wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf A is k steps clockwise from B, and C is l steps counter-clockwise from B, then the arc from A to C that passes through B is (k + l) steps. The arc that doesn't pass through B would be (n - (k + l)) steps. Therefore, the measure θ would be (n - (k + l)) * (360 / n) degrees. Then angle ABC is θ / 2 = (n - (k + l)) * 180 / n degrees.\n\nBut since k and l are the steps from B to A and B to C, respectively, perhaps we can model this as follows: For any three points, if between B and A there are k steps in one direction, and between B and C there are l steps in the other direction, then the angle is (n - (k + l)) * 180 / n degrees.\n\nBut how do we choose k and l? Well, since the polygon is regular and convex, the positions of A and C relative to B can be such that they are on opposite sides. For example, in the square case, if B is 2, A is 1 (1 step clockwise from B?), or maybe the other way around. Let me clarify the direction.\n\nLet me assume that the polygon is numbered clockwise. For example, in a square, vertices are 1, 2, 3, 4 arranged clockwise. So, moving clockwise from vertex 2, the next vertex is 3, then 4, then 1, then 2 again. So, if A is 1, then it's one step counter-clockwise from B (vertex 2). Similarly, if C is 3, it's one step clockwise from B.\n\nIn this case, k (steps from B to A in the counter-clockwise direction) is 1, and l (steps from B to C in the clockwise direction) is 1. Then, k + l = 2. The arc that does not contain B is n - (k + l) = 4 - 2 = 2 steps. So θ = 2 * 360 /4 = 180 degrees. The angle ABC is 180/2 = 90 degrees, which matches the example. \n\nAnother example: B is 2, A is 1, and C is 4. Then, k (steps counter-clockwise from B to A) is 1, l (steps clockwise from B to C) is 2 steps (B to 3 to 4). So k + l = 3. n - (k + l) = 4 -3 = 1. θ is 1 * 360 /4 = 90 degrees. Angle ABC is 90/2 = 45 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the angle is (n - (k + l)) * 180 /n degrees. But since k and l are the steps in opposite directions from B to A and B to C, respectively, the sum k + l can vary. However, in order for A and C to be distinct from B and from each other, k and l must be at least 1. Also, since the polygon is regular, we can assume that for any choice of A and C, they are on opposite sides of B.\n\nBut how can we model this? For any possible angle, we can choose different values of k and l, but since the problem requires us to find the closest angle to a given a, perhaps we can find the optimal k and l.\n\nBut since the problem allows any three distinct vertices, perhaps the optimal angle depends on choosing the value of (n - (k + l)) * 180 /n as close as possible to a. But since k and l are positive integers (since A and C are distinct from B and from each other), the sum k + l can be from 2 (when k=1, l=1) up to n-2 (when k + l = n-2, which would make the arc AC that doesn't contain B to be 1 step, leading to angle 180/n degrees).\n\nWait, let's think about possible values of (k + l). Since k and l are positive integers, their sum can be from 2 (minimum) to n-2 (maximum). Because if k + l = n-1, then n - (k + l) = 1, which gives angle 180/n. If k + l = n-2, then n - (k + l) = 2, which gives angle 360/n degrees. Wait, but this seems conflicting with previous examples. Let me check for the square case again.\n\nn=4, and when k + l = 3 (as in the case of A=1, C=4, B=2), then n - (k + l) = 1. So the angle is 1 * 180 /4 = 45 degrees, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the angle is ( (n - (k + l)) * 180 ) / n degrees. Now, since k and l are positive integers, the sum s = k + l can range from 2 to n-2. Because, for example, if s is 2, then the angle is (n - 2) * 180 /n. If s is n-2, then the angle is (n - (n-2)) * 180 /n = 2 * 180 /n.\n\nBut for a given n, the possible angles that can be formed are determined by varying s from 2 to n-2. For each possible s, the angle is ( (n - s) * 180 ) / n. So, the problem reduces to finding the value of s (between 2 and n-2) such that the angle (n - s) * 180 /n is as close as possible to a.\n\nOnce we find the optimal s, then we can choose any k and l such that k + l = s. Then, we can construct the three points accordingly.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. For the given n and a, find the s that minimizes the absolute difference between a and ( (n - s) * 180 /n ). \n\nBut wait, since s can be from 2 to n-2, and for each s, the angle is ( (n - s) * 180 ) /n. Let me denote this angle as angle(s) = ( (n - s) * 180 ) /n.\n\nBut note that for s ranging from 2 to n-2, (n - s) ranges from n-2 down to 2. So angle(s) ranges from (n-2)*180/n down to 2*180/n. For example, in a square (n=4), angle(s) for s=2 is (4-2)*180/4 = 90 degrees, for s=3 it's (4-3)*180/4=45 degrees. Which matches our earlier examples.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find s in [2, n-2] that makes angle(s) as close as possible to a. Once s is found, then we need to pick any k and l such that k + l = s. Then, construct the three vertices accordingly.\n\nBut how to find s? Let's think about the function angle(s) = ( (n - s) * 180 ) /n. Let me rearrange this as angle(s) = ( (n - s)/n ) * 180 = 180 - (s * 180)/n. \n\nBut since s can vary, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the value of (n - s) * 180 /n. Let me denote this as angle. We want angle ≈ a. So, solving for s:\n\n(n - s) * 180 /n = a → s = n - (a * n)/180.\n\nBut since s must be an integer between 2 and n-2, we need to find the integer s closest to this value.\n\nWait, but the formula gives s = n - (a * n)/180. Let's rearrange:\n\ns = n ( 1 - a/180 )\n\nBut since s must be an integer, perhaps we can compute the optimal s as the integer closest to this value. However, we need to make sure that s is within [2, n-2].\n\nBut let's think of an example. Take the sample input where n=4 and a=67. Then:\n\ns = 4*(1 - 67/180) = 4*(113/180) ≈ 4 * 0.6277... ≈ 2.51. So the closest integer is 3. Which gives angle(s) = (4-3)*180/4 = 45 degrees, which is the correct answer for that case. Similarly, for a=68, the optimal s would be 4*(1 - 68/180) = 4*(112/180) ≈ 2.488..., so closest integer is 2. Then angle(s) is (4-2)*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is the correct answer for the third sample input.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the ideal s as s_ideal = n * (1 - a/180), then find the integer s in [2, n-2] that is closest to s_ideal. Once we find that s, we can compute the angle and proceed.\n\nBut wait, why is this the case? Because angle(s) = (n - s) * 180 /n. Let me set this equal to a. Then:\n\n(n - s) * 180 /n = a → n - s = (a * n)/180 → s = n - (a * n)/180.\n\nYes. So the ideal s is s_ideal = n * (1 - a/180). However, since s must be an integer between 2 and n-2, we need to find the closest integer to s_ideal in that interval.\n\nOnce we find s, then we can choose any k and l such that k + l = s. For example, k=1 and l = s-1, etc. Then, construct the three points.\n\nOnce we have k and l, how to choose the vertices? Let's say we choose v2 as vertex 1 (for example). Then, v1 is k steps counter-clockwise from v2. But since the numbering is clockwise, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of positions.\n\nLet me think of the polygon as being numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Suppose we choose v2 as vertex 2. Then, to choose v1 and v3 such that there are k steps from v2 to v1 in one direction and l steps in the other. For example, if k=1 and l= s - k = s-1.\n\nBut to make it simple, perhaps we can always choose v2 as vertex 1. Then, v1 is vertex 1 + k steps in one direction, and v3 is vertex 1 + l steps in the other direction. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, for a given s, we can choose v2 as vertex 1, then v1 is vertex 2 (k=1 step clockwise from v2?), and v3 is vertex (1 + l) steps counter-clockwise from v2. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nBut regardless of the choice of k and l, once we have s, the actual selection of the vertices can be done in a way that's easy to code. For example, for a given s, we can choose k=1, l = s-1. Then, the vertices would be:\n\nv2 is vertex 1. v1 is vertex 2 (since moving clockwise one step from v2). v3 is vertex 1 - l steps (but since it's a polygon, we need to wrap around). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nIf v2 is vertex 1. Then, to have k steps counter-clockwise from v2 (so that v1 is k steps counter-clockwise from v2), and l steps clockwise from v2 (so that v3 is l steps clockwise from v2). Then, the total steps from v1 to v3 through v2 is k + l steps. But the arc that does not contain v2 is (n - (k + l)) steps, which is s = k + l.\n\nWait, no. Earlier, we said that s = k + l. So for example, if k=1 and l= s-1, then s = 1 + (s-1) = s. So that works.\n\nSo, given that, for any s, we can choose k=1, l = s-1. Then, the vertices would be:\n\nv2 is vertex 1.\n\nv1 is vertex (1 - k) mod n? Or perhaps in terms of the polygon's numbering.\n\nWait, the polygon is numbered clockwise. So, moving counter-clockwise from v2 (vertex 1) by k steps would take us to vertex (1 - k) mod n. But since the numbers are from 1 to n, we need to adjust for that. For example, if k=1, then moving counter-clockwise from 1 would be vertex n. So for v1, it would be vertex n (if k=1). And for l steps clockwise from v2 (vertex 1), it would be vertex (1 + l). But if 1 + l exceeds n, then we wrap around. However, since l is s-1 and s is at most n-2, then l is at most (n-2)-1 = n-3. So 1 + l is at most 1 + n-3 = n-2 < n. So no wrapping needed. \n\nSo, for example, if v2 is 1, then v1 is n (since k=1, moving counter-clockwise one step from 1), and v3 is 1 + l = 1 + (s-1) = s. So the three vertices are v1 = n, v2 = 1, v3 = s. But we need to ensure that all three are distinct. Since s ranges from 2 to n-2, then v3 is between 2 and n-2. So v2 is 1, v3 is between 2 and n-2, and v1 is n. All are distinct. So that's valid.\n\nThus, for any s, the three vertices can be chosen as n, 1, s. But wait, let's check with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: n=3, a=15. For n=3, possible s ranges from 2 to 1. Wait, that can't be. Wait, for n=3, the s is supposed to be between 2 and n-2 = 1. Which is impossible. So this suggests that there is no possible s in that range. What does that mean?\n\nAh! For n=3, the polygon is a triangle. The possible s is from 2 to n-2 = 1. Which is invalid. So this indicates that there are no possible s in that range. But according to the sample input, when n=3 and a=15, the only possible angle is 60 degrees. How does that fit into the formula?\n\nWait, for a triangle (n=3), the angle formed by any three vertices. Let's take vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at vertex 2 is the internal angle of the triangle, which is 60 degrees. According to the formula, how would that be calculated?\n\nIn this case, the three vertices are 1, 2, 3. So v2 is 2, v1 is 1 (k steps counter-clockwise from v2?), and v3 is 3 (l steps clockwise from v2). So k is 1 (moving counter-clockwise from 2 to 1), l is 1 (moving clockwise from 2 to 3). So s = k + l = 2. For n=3, s ranges from 2 to n-2 = 1. Which is invalid. So this suggests that the formula is not applicable for n=3. But in reality, for n=3, the only possible s is 2, which is exactly the lower bound of the range. However, the upper bound is n-2=1, which is less than the lower bound. So this implies that for n=3, the possible s is only 2. But according to the previous logic, the range is [2, n-2], which for n=3 is [2, 1], which is invalid. Hence, the formula must be adjusted for cases where n is small.\n\nThis suggests that the range of s should be from 2 to n-2, but when n=3, this is invalid. However, for n=3, the only possible angle is 60 degrees. So how to handle that case.\n\nLet me re-examine the formula. The formula for the angle is (n - s) * 180 /n. For n=3 and s=2, this gives (3-2)*180/3 = 60 degrees, which is correct. But for n=3, the s can only be 2. So the range for s is [2, n-2] when n >= 4, but for n=3, the range is just [2]. So perhaps the general approach is:\n\nFor n=3, the only possible angle is 60 degrees. So regardless of a, the answer is any triplet of vertices (since all triplets give the same angle).\n\nBut for n >=4, the possible s is in [2, n-2].\n\nSo the first step is to handle the case when n=3 separately.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nIf n == 3:\n\n   The only possible angle is 60 degrees. So output any triplet, like 1 2 3.\n\nElse:\n\n   Compute s_ideal = n * (1 - a / 180)\n\n   Find the integer s in [2, n-2] that is closest to s_ideal. If there are multiple s with same minimal difference, choose any.\n\nOnce s is determined, then choose k=1, l = s - 1. Then, the three vertices are:\n\nv2 = 1 (arbitrary choice)\n\nv1 = n (counter-clockwise 1 step from v2)\n\nv3 = 1 + l = 1 + s - 1 = s.\n\nThus, the triplet is (n, 1, s). However, need to check if these are distinct. For example, when s=2, n >=4, then v3 is 2. So the triplet is (n, 1, 2). All distinct.\n\nBut what if s is 1? Well, no, since s ranges from 2 to n-2, which for n >=4, s is at least 2.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input 2: 4 67. So n=4, a=67.\n\ns_ideal = 4*(1 - 67/180) = 4*(113/180) ≈ 2.511. So closest integer is 3. So s=3.\n\nThen, v1 = 4, v2=1, v3=3. So the triplet is 4 1 3. Which is one of the possible outputs. However, the sample output for this case is \"2 1 3\". But that's also valid. Because the triplet could be different, but the angle is same.\n\nSo the code can output any triplet that satisfies the conditions. So the approach of choosing v2 as 1, v1 as n, and v3 as s is acceptable.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the ideal s is not in the [2, n-2] range. For example, if a is very small, like a=1, then s_ideal = n*(1 - 1/180) = n*(179/180). For n=4, this is 4*179/180 ≈ 3.977. So the closest integer is 4. But for n=4, the maximum s is n-2=2. So the code must clamp the s to the allowed range.\n\nThus, the steps for finding s are:\n\nCompute s_ideal = n * (1 - a / 180).\n\nFind the s in [2, n-2] that is closest to s_ideal. If multiple s have the same difference, choose the one with the smallest or largest value (doesn't matter, as long as it's valid).\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nWe can compute the candidate s as floor(s_ideal) and ceil(s_ideal), and check which one is closer. Also, need to clamp to the [2, n-2] interval.\n\nFor example, if s_ideal is 0.5, then the closest s is 2. If s_ideal is larger than n-2, then s = n-2. If smaller than 2, then s=2.\n\nOnce we have the optimal s, then proceed.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nif n == 3:\n\n   output 1 2 3 (or any permutation, but the sample shows 1 2 3)\n\nelse:\n\n   compute s_ideal = n * (1 - a / 180.0)\n\n   s_candidates = [floor(s_ideal), ceil(s_ideal)]\n\n   but also check if s_ideal is integer, then add that.\n\n   then, for all candidates, check which is in [2, n-2], and find the one with minimal absolute difference to s_ideal.\n\n   Also, need to check the boundaries. For example, if s_ideal is less than 2, then best is 2. If greater than n-2, best is n-2.\n\nOnce the optimal s is found, then:\n\nv2 is 1, v1 is n, v3 is s.\n\nBut need to make sure that v1, v2, v3 are distinct. For example, when s=2 and n=4, then v3=2, v2=1, v1=4. All distinct.\n\nThus, the triplet is n, 1, s.\n\nBut wait, the output format requires three distinct vertices.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves calculating the optimal angle using geometric properties of regular polygons and selecting appropriate vertices based on this calculation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed by three vertices can be derived from the number of steps between the vertices along the polygon's perimeter. This angle can be computed using the formula involving the number of steps between the vertices.\n2. **Ideal Steps Calculation**: For a given angle `a`, we calculate the ideal number of steps `s` that would produce an angle closest to `a`. This involves solving for `s` using the derived formula.\n3. **Clamping Values**: Since `s` must be within valid bounds (from 2 to n-2), we adjust the calculated `s` to ensure it falls within these bounds.\n4. **Vertex Selection**: Once the optimal `s` is determined, we select vertices based on this value to form the required angle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n    \n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n    \n    # Compute s_ideal\n    s_ideal = n * (1 - a / 180.0)\n    \n    # Determine the optimal s in [2, n-2]\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_s = 2\n    \n    # Check floor and ceil of s_ideal\n    candidates = set()\n    candidates.add(math.floor(s_ideal))\n    candidates.add(math.ceil(s_ideal))\n    candidates.add(int(s_ideal))\n    \n    # Also check boundaries\n    for s in candidates:\n        if 2 <= s <= n - 2:\n            diff = abs(s - s_ideal)\n            if diff < min_diff:\n                min_diff = diff\n                best_s = s\n            elif diff == min_diff:\n                # Choose the smaller one to have more options\n                if s < best_s:\n                    best_s = s\n        else:\n            # Clamp to the nearest boundary\n            if s < 2:\n                s_clamped = 2\n            else:\n                s_clamped = n - 2\n            diff = abs(s_clamped - s_ideal)\n            if diff < min_diff:\n                min_diff = diff\n                best_s = s_clamped\n            elif diff == min_diff:\n                if s_clamped < best_s:\n                    best_s = s_clamped\n    \n    # Now best_s is determined\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = n\n    v3 = best_s\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Special Case for Triangle**: If `n` is 3, the only possible angle is 60 degrees, so any valid triplet (like 1 2 3) is printed.\n3. **Ideal Steps Calculation**: The ideal number of steps `s_ideal` is calculated based on the given angle `a`.\n4. **Optimal Steps Determination**: The optimal `s` is found by checking values around `s_ideal` and clamping it within valid bounds.\n5. **Vertex Selection**: Using the calculated `s`, the vertices are selected such that the angle formed is closest to `a`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the closest possible angle using geometric properties and handle edge cases appropriately.",
