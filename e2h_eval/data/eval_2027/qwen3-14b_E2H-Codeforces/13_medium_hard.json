For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the definitions of major and minor triads.\n\nFor a major triad: there exists an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. The total from X to Z would then be 7 semitones.\n\nFor a minor triad: there exists an ordering X, Y, Z where the distance between X and Y is 3 semitones, and between Y and Z is 4 semitones. So total from X to Z is 7 as well, but the order of the intervals is different.\n\nThe key here is that the order of the notes matters when checking the intervals. But since the triad is unordered, we need to check all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Convert the three notes into their corresponding numerical positions (like C is 0, C# is 1, ..., H is 11). Because the notes are cyclic, the distance between two notes can be calculated by considering their positions modulo 12.\n\nWait, how do I calculate the distance between two notes? The problem says that the distance is measured along the musical scale from the lower to the upper note. For example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me think: the order of the notes is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So each consecutive note is +1 semitone. So, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if Y is after X in the list, then it's Y - X. If Y is before X, then it's (Y + 12 - X) semitones? Wait no. Wait, the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper note. So if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones? Or wait, maybe the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that the distance is always positive. Wait, for example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's see: E is position 4 (assuming C is 0). C is position 0. So if we go from E to C, the distance would be (0 + 12 - 4) = 8 semitones. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). Or equivalently, (Y - X) % 12. Wait, no. Because if Y is lower than X, then (Y - X) would be negative. But (Y - X) mod 12 gives the correct value. For example, if X is C (0), Y is E (4): 4-0 = 4, mod 12 is 4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), then (0-4) is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower note to the upper one. So, if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So, the distance can be computed as (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y - X + 12). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) % 12, but only when the distance is measured as the minimal steps in the cyclic order. Wait, but in the problem's example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Which is indeed (0 - 4) mod 12 is 8. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. However, in the problem's definition, the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. So, if X is lower than Y, it's Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then it's (Y + 12 - X). So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. So, the distance is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). So, in code, for two notes X and Y (as numbers 0-11), the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X else (Y - X + 12). Alternatively, (Y - X) % 12. But wait, (Y - X) mod 12 gives the same as the distance. Because for example, when Y is 0 and X is 4, (0-4) mod 12 is 8, which is the correct distance. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to the upper. So, for example, the distance between X and Y is the minimal number of semitones you have to move upwards from X to reach Y. So that's exactly (Y - X) mod 12. Because if Y is higher than X, then that's the difference. If not, then adding 12.\n\nSo, the first step is to map the note names to their numerical positions. Let's create a dictionary for that. The notes are given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is the 12th note. Wait, let's count:\n\nC is 0\n\nC# is 1\n\nD is 2\n\nD# is 3\n\nE is 4\n\nF is 5\n\nF# is 6\n\nG is 7\n\nG# is 8\n\nA is 9\n\nB is 10\n\nH is 11. \n\nYes. So the list is [C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H]. So the index is 0-11.\n\nSo, I need to create a mapping from note names to their indices. For example, 'C' maps to 0, 'C#' to 1, 'D' to 2, etc. So, perhaps create a list or a dictionary. Let's make a list called note_order, where note_order[0] is 'C', note_order[1] is 'C#', and so on. Then, for a given note name, we can find its index in that list.\n\nBut how to handle the note names. For example, the input could be 'B' or 'H'? Wait, according to the problem statement, the notes are given as per the list, including H. So the input will have notes in the notation given, like 'H' is present. So the note_order list should have the notes in the order given. Let's create that list.\n\nOnce I have the three notes converted into their numerical values, I need to check all permutations of the three notes to see if any of them satisfy the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the three notes (X, Y, Z), check if the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. If any permutation satisfies that, then it's a major chord. Similarly, check if any permutation has distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4. If so, then minor.\n\nBut how many permutations are there? For three elements, there are 3! = 6 permutations. However, since the order of the three notes in the permutation is important for checking the distances. For example, for the major case, the order X, Y, Z must have X to Y as 4, Y to Z as 3. So for each permutation, check if that's true.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for a given set of three notes, we can check all possible orderings where the first two notes are X and Y, and the third is Z. But since the triad is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible pair of X and Y, check if the distance between X and Y is 4 (for major) or 3 (for minor). Then, check if the third note Z is such that the distance between Y and Z is 3 (for major) or 4 (for minor). But how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, for each of the three possible orderings of the three notes, check if they meet the criteria. Let's think of all permutations of the three notes. For example, for notes a, b, c, the permutations are (a, b, c), (a, c, b), (b, a, c), (b, c, a), (c, a, b), (c, b, a). For each of these, check if the first two notes have a certain distance and the next two have another.\n\nBut for a major triad, the condition is that the first to second is 4, second to third is 3. For minor, first to second is 3, second to third is 4.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check both possibilities. For example, for a permutation (X, Y, Z), check if X-Y is 4 and Y-Z is 3 (major). Also check if X-Y is 3 and Y-Z is 4 (minor). But since the triad is unordered, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nBut for code purposes, generating all permutations and checking for each of them is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the three input notes.\n\n- Convert each note to its numerical index (using a dictionary or list).\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three notes (since the order matters for checking the distances).\n\n- For each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor conditions.\n\n- If any permutation meets the major condition, output \"major\". Similarly for minor. If none, output \"strange\".\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Well, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, permutations(notes, 3) would generate all possible orderings of the three elements.\n\nBut since the three notes are given as a list, say, [a, b, c], then permutations would generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nSo, for each permutation in permutations(notes_list):\n\n   check for major: distance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3.\n\n   check for minor: distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then the answer is major. Similarly for minor.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So, there can't be a case where both major and minor are possible. So once we find any permutation that satisfies major, we can return 'major' immediately, and similarly for minor.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, create a mapping from note names to their numerical values.\n\nLet's create a list called note_order, which is ordered as per the problem description.\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is as written, and after H comes C again.\n\nSo the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo, for example, 'H' is index 11, and 'C' is index 0.\n\nSo, the code can create a dictionary that maps each note name to its index.\n\nnote_map = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nWait, but what about the note 'B'? In the problem statement, the list is up to H. So the note_order list would be as follows:\n\n['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'].\n\nYes. So the index for B is 10, H is 11.\n\nSo, with that mapping, for any note in the input, we can get its index.\n\nOnce we have the three indices, say, a, b, c, then generate all permutations of (a, b, c) and check for each permutation.\n\nSo, for example, for the input ['C', 'E', 'G'], the indices are 0, 4, 7.\n\nCheck permutations:\n\n(0,4,7): distance between 0 and 4 is 4 (correct for major). Then between 4 and 7 is 3 (7-4=3). So yes, this is a major chord. So the answer is major.\n\nAnother example, input ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nThe notes are C#, B, F.\n\nConvert to indices:\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nPermutations:\n\nCheck all permutations. For example, one permutation is (B, C#, F) → indices 10, 1, 5.\n\nCheck distance between 10 and 1: (1 - 10) mod 12 is (1 -10) = -9 mod 12 is 3. So that's 3 semitones. Then between 1 and 5 is 5-1=4. So yes, that's a minor chord. So this permutation satisfies the minor condition.\n\nSo, the code needs to check all permutations.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the input line. The input is three space-separated notes. For example, in the sample input, the first case is 'C E G'.\n\nSo, in Python, the input can be read as input().split(). For example, for the sample input, the first case is ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nThen, convert each note into its index using the note_map.\n\nOnce we have the three indices, generate all permutations of them.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck if distance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3 → major.\n\nCheck if distance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, return 'major'.\n\nSimilarly for minor.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nImplement a helper function to compute the distance between two notes (a and b):\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper note. So, for example, between E and C, the distance is 8. Which is (0 - 4) mod 12 = 8. So yes, the helper function returns the correct distance.\n\nSo, for a permutation (x, y, z):\n\nd1 = distance(x, y)\n\nd2 = distance(y, z)\n\nif d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 → major.\n\nif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check these two conditions.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nWe can generate all permutations of the three notes (as their indices), then check for each permutation.\n\nOnce any permutation satisfies the major condition, we can immediately return 'major' as the answer. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the input notes as a list.\n\nConvert each note to its index.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nLoop through each permutation:\n\n   check for major and minor conditions.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then output 'major'.\n\nIf any permutation meets minor, then output 'minor'.\n\nElse, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate permutations. Using itertools.permutations.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, for example, for the first sample input, notes is ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nThen, convert each note to its index. Let's create a list called indices = [note_map[note] for note in notes]\n\nThen, for each perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n   if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n       print('major')\n\n       exit\n\n   elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print('minor')\n\n       exit\n\nOnce all permutations are checked, if none found, print 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once any permutation satisfies either major or minor, we can return accordingly.\n\nBut how to check all permutations, and check if any of them meets the condition.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nCheck for major and minor in all permutations.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_map = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_map[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but this would check all permutations. However, once a permutation is found that satisfies major, we can immediately return. However, the code above checks all permutations and sets flags. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no case where both flags are set. So, even if multiple permutations satisfy the condition, the code will correctly output the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, what if there are permutations that satisfy both major and minor? According to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous, so that's impossible. So, the code can safely check all permutations and set the flags, then decide based on the flags.\n\nBut let's think about the code. For example, suppose a permutation meets major, and another permutation meets minor. But according to the problem statement, this is impossible. So the code can safely check all permutations and then output based on the flags.\n\nBut why not check for major and minor in the permutations and break early?\n\nWell, for code efficiency, perhaps, but since there are only 6 permutations, it's negligible.\n\nBut in code, perhaps the code can check each permutation, and once a major is found, return immediately. Similarly for minor. However, in Python, for code structure, perhaps the code can loop through all permutations, check for major and minor, and once any of them is found, return the answer.\n\nBut how to do that. Let's think.\n\nIn code:\n\nfor perm in permutations(...):\n\n   check if major:\n\n      if yes, print 'major' and exit.\n\n   check if minor:\n\n      if yes, print 'minor' and exit.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_map = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_map[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nThis would be more efficient, as it stops checking once a condition is found.\n\nBut what about the order in which permutations are checked? For example, suppose there are two permutations, one that meets major and another that meets minor. But according to the problem statement, this can't happen. So the code can safely check for major and minor in each permutation, and return as soon as any is found.\n\nBut how to test this. Let's take the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output: ['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nLet's take the first case: C E G.\n\nThe permutations would include (C, E, G) → indices 0,4,7. d1 is (4-0) mod 12 =4, d2 is (7-4)=3. So 4 and 3 → major. So the code would print 'major' and exit.\n\nSecond case: C# B F → indices 1, 10, 5. Let's look at permutations. One permutation is B, C#, F → indices 10, 1, 5. d1 is (1 -10) mod 12 = (1-10) = -9 mod 12 is 3. d2 is (5-1) mod 12 is 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So the code would print 'minor'.\n\nThird case: A B H → indices 9, 10, 11. Let's check permutations. For example, (9,10,11): d1 is 1, d2 is 1. Not. Another permutation: (9,11,10): d1 is (11-9) = 2 mod 12 is 2. d2 is (10 - 11) mod 12 is ( -1 ) mod 12 is 11. No. Another permutation: (10,9,11). d1 is (9-10) mod 12 = ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11. No. Another permutation: (10, 11, 9). d1 is 1, d2 is (9-11) mod 12 = ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. No. Similarly others. None of the permutations will meet the criteria. So output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, what about some edge cases?\n\nCase where the same note is repeated? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes, but it's possible that two are same? But according to the problem statement, a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, the code may have to process cases where two or three notes are same. For example, if all three are same note. Then, the distance between any two is 0. So no condition is met. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: for example, notes C, E, G#. Let's see. For major, the required is X-Y is 4, Y-Z is 3. Let's see:\n\nC (0), E (4), G# (8). The distance between C and E is 4. Between E and G# is 8-4=4. So no. So that's not major. What about other permutations? For example, E, G#, C. X is E (4), Y is G# (8). Distance is (8-4) =4. Then Z is C (0). Distance between Y and Z is (0 -8) mod 12 = 4. So 4 and 4. Not matching. So no. So this would be strange.\n\nAnother case: for minor, let's say notes are C, E#, G. Wait, but the note names are as per the problem's list. Let's think of a valid example. Suppose the notes are C, D, F. Let's check permutations. Let's see:\n\nC (0), D (2), F (5). Check for minor: X-Y is 3, Y-Z is 4. Let's see. For permutation (C, D, F): distance between C and D is 2. Not. Another permutation: D, C, F. X is D (2), Y is C (0). distance is (0-2) mod 12 = 10. No. Another permutation: C, F, D. X is C (0), Y is F (5). distance is 5. No. How about permutation (D, F, C)? X is D (2), Y is F (5): distance is 3. Then Y to Z is C (0). distance is (0 -5) mod 12 = 7. No. So no. So this would be strange.\n\nAnother example: minor triad. Let's take B, C#, F. Which is the second sample input. The code should detect that.\n\nNow, code-wise, the note_map is correct. Let's check the note 'B' is mapped to 10, 'H' to 11.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the note names? For example, the input may have 'H' instead of 'B'? Well, according to the problem statement, the notes are given in the specified notation. So the code's note_map is correct.\n\nBut what about the note names? For example, the note 'B' is present in the note_order list, and 'H' is the last. So the code's note_map is correct.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations, which includes all possible orderings. So, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code reads the input as input().split(), which splits by whitespace. For example, the input is given as a single line with three notes separated by spaces.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']? Wait, no. Wait the sample input is given as a list of three examples, but the actual input is a single line with three notes. The sample input shows that the input is a list of three examples, but the actual problem says that the input is a single line with three notes.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe input is described as:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo, for example, the sample input is:\n\nC E G\n\nWhich would be read as input().split() → ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is written as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], but that's probably just a way to show three separate test cases. The actual input is one line with three notes. So the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about the note 'H'? For example, if the input is 'H C E', which is H (11), C (0), E (4). Let's check permutations.\n\nOne permutation is H, C, E. X=11, Y=0. distance between X and Y is (0 -11) mod 12 → ( -11 ) mod 12 → 1. Then Y to Z (0 to 4) is 4. So 1 and 4. Not. Another permutation: H, E, C. X=11, Y=4. distance is (4 -11) mod 12 → ( -7 ) mod 12 → 5. Then Y to Z is 0-4 mod 12 → 8. No.\n\nAnother permutation: C, H, E. X=0, Y=11. distance is (11 -0) =11. Then Y to E (4) is (4 - 11) mod 12 = ( -7 ) mod 12 = 5. No.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, H. X=0, Y=4. distance is 4. Y to Z (H is 11). distance is 11 -4 =7. So 4 and 7. Not 3. So no. So this is strange.\n\nAnother example: C, E, G → major.\n\nAnother example: C, E flat? No, the notes are as per the given list. So the code's note_map is correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting for the sample input:\n\nSample Input: C E G → code outputs 'major'.\n\nSample Input: C# B F → code outputs 'minor'.\n\nSample Input: A B H → code outputs 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nNeed to import itertools.permutations.\n\nBut also, note that in Python, the code must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_map = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\nindices = [note_map[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in the code, the input is read via sys.stdin.read().split(). For example, if the input is given as a single line with three notes, then this would split into three elements. For example, if the input is 'C E G', then notes becomes ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about leading or trailing spaces? The split() method would handle that.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, test case for minor:\n\nInput: C# B F → notes are ['C#', 'B', 'F'] → indices 1, 10, 5.\n\nLooking at permutations:\n\nOne of the permutations is (10, 1, 5) → B, C#, F.\n\nd1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 = (5 - 1) mod 12 = 4 → 3 and 4 → minor. So code returns 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: input 'A B H' → indices 9, 10, 11.\n\nAll permutations would be checked, but none would meet the conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: input 'C E G#'. Let's see:\n\nC (0), E (4), G# (8). Let's check permutations.\n\nCheck (0,4,8): d1 is 4, d2 is 4. Not. (0,8,4): d1 is 8-0=8 mod 12 is 8. d2 is 4-8 = -4 mod 12 is 8. No. (4, 0, 8): d1 is (0-4) mod 12 is 8. No. (4, 8, 0): d1 is 4, d2 is (0-8) mod 12 = 4. So 4 and 4. No. (8, 0,4): d1 is 0-8 mod 12 is 4. d2 is 4-0=4. So 4 and 4. No. (8,4,0): d1 is 4-8 mod 12 → ( -4 ) mod 12 is 8. d2 is 0-4 mod 12 is 8. No. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: input 'C# E G' → indices 1, 4, 7. Check permutations:\n\nCheck (1,4,7): d1 is 3, d2 is 3 → no. (1,7,4): d1 is 6, d2 is (4-7) mod 12 = 9. No. (4, 1, 7): d1 is (1-4) mod 12 → 9. No. (4,7,1): d1 is 3, d2 is (1-7) mod 12 → 6. No. (7,1,4): d1 is 1-7 mod 12 → 6. No. (7,4,1): d1 is 4-7 mod 12 → 9. No. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: input 'C E G' → major.\n\nAnother test case: input 'B D# F#' → let's see. B is 10, D# is 3, F# is 6. Check permutations. Let's check permutation (10, 3, 6). d1 is (3 - 10) mod 12 = ( -7 ) mod 12 = 5. No. Another permutation: (3, 6, 10). d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So code returns 'minor'.\n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in semitones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to a numerical index based on their position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three given notes. For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Use modular arithmetic to compute the distance between two notes in semitones, considering the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Triad Classification**: Check each permutation against the criteria for major and minor triads. If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, print the corresponding result immediately. If none meet the criteria, classify the chord as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_map = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\nindices = [note_map[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_map` dictionary converts each note name into an index from 0 to 11, representing their positions in the musical scale.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual note names.\n3. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes to check each possible sequence.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n5. **Classification Check**: Each permutation is checked against the criteria for major and minor triads. If a valid major or minor triad is found, the result is printed immediately. If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to determine the correct classification of the chord.",
