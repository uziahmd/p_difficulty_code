For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The input is three notes, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. But when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. For example, between C and E, there are 4 semitones. Let me think: C to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, D to D# is 3, D# to E is 4? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that between consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone. So the sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then, each consecutive pair is one semitone apart. So the distance from C to E would be 4 semitones. Because C to C# (1), C# to D (2), D to D# (3), D# to E (4). Oh right. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of steps you take moving forward from X to Y in the list. But since the list is cyclic, if Y is before X in the list, then you wrap around.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes? Let's think of each note as being assigned an index. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, ..., H is 11. Then, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4 semitones. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 -4 + 12) mod 12 = 8 semitones. Because when you go from E to C, you can go forward by 8 steps (E to F (5), F to F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11), C (0) — that's 8 steps). So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y comes after X, otherwise (Y_index - X_index + 12). Or more simply, (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? No, because mod 12 would give a value between 0 and 11. But for example, when X is E (4) and Y is C (0), the distance is 8 semitones. Which is (0 -4 + 12) = 8. So the distance is (Y_index - X_index + 12) % 12. But since the distance is always positive, that's the way to calculate it.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then it's the difference. If X is higher than Y, then it's (12 - (X - Y))? Or maybe the formula is (Y - X) mod 12, but if the result is negative, add 12. But in any case, for the purpose of checking major and minor chords, we need to find the distances between the notes in the order X, Y, Z.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its index. Let's create a list of the notes in order. The order is given as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe notes are listed as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is correct. So the indexes are:\n\nC: 0\n\nC#: 1\n\nD: 2\n\nD#: 3\n\nE:4 \n\nF:5 \n\nF#:6 \n\nG:7 \n\nG#:8 \n\nA:9 \n\nB:10 \n\nH:11 \n\nSo for example, H is index 11, and the next note is C again (index 0).\n\nNow, given three notes, the problem says that the chord is unordered. So for all possible permutations of the three notes, we need to check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nFor a major triad, there must be an ordering X, Y, Z where the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. For minor, the distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4.\n\nBut how to compute that. For each permutation of the three notes, check if the distances between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3. If any permutation satisfies this, then it's a major chord. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut since the chord is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes.\n\nSo for example, given three notes A, B, C, we need to check all 6 possible permutations of them.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for the major chord, the total distance between X and Z would be 4 +3 =7 semitones. But since the order is X, Y, Z, the distance between X and Z is 7. However, there's another possibility: perhaps the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3, but in the circular arrangement. But how to compute that.\n\nBut for the problem, the key is to check for any permutation of the three notes, whether the first two are 4 apart, and the next two are 3 apart.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- For each of the three notes, generate all possible permutations (all 6 permutations).\n\n- For each permutation (X, Y, Z), compute the distance between X and Y, then between Y and Z.\n\n- Check if for any permutation, the first distance is 4 and the second is 3 (for major), or first is 3 and second is 4 (for minor).\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, then 'strange'.\n\nSo first, I need to create a mapping from note names to their indexes.\n\nLet me create a list called note_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are ordered as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's the order. So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo given a note, like 'C#', its index is 1. 'H' is 11.\n\nSo first, I need to create a dictionary that maps each note to its index.\n\nOnce that's done, for each of the three input notes, get their indexes.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the three indexes. For each permutation (x, y, z), compute the distance between x and y (distance_xy), and between y and z (distance_yz).\n\nHow to compute distance between two notes:\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if a is 4 (E) and b is 0 (C), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between a and b is (b -a) mod 12. But wait, the distance is defined as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. So if a is lower than b, then the distance is (b -a). If a is higher than b, then the distance is (12 - (a -b)). Which is equivalent to (b -a) mod 12. So yes, the distance between a and b is (b -a) mod 12. But since in the problem, the distance is measured from the lower to the upper, which is the same as the number of steps you take moving forward from a to reach b. So for example, if a is E (4), and b is C (0), then moving forward from E to C would require 8 steps. So the distance is 8. Which is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8.\n\nSo the function to compute the distance between two notes is (b - a) % 12.\n\nWait, but if a is 0 (C), and b is 4 (E), then (4-0) mod 12 is 4, which is correct. So yes, this formula works.\n\nSo for a permutation (x, y, z), the distance between x and y is (y - x) mod 12. Then, between y and z, (z - y) mod 12.\n\nBut for the major triad, the distance between x and y should be 4, and between y and z should be 3. So for the permutation (x, y, z), check if distance_xy ==4 and distance_yz ==3. If yes, then it's a major.\n\nSimilarly for minor: check if distance_xy is 3 and distance_yz is 4.\n\nSo the steps for the code are:\n\nRead the input: three notes, e.g., input is a list of three strings.\n\nCreate a mapping from note names to their indexes.\n\nFor each of the three notes, get their indexes.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the three indexes (since the order matters for checking the distances).\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   compute distance_xy = (y - x) mod 12\n\n   compute distance_yz = (z - y) mod 12\n\n   check if distance_xy is 4 and distance_yz is 3 → if yes, then it's a major.\n\n   check if distance_xy is 3 and distance_yz is 4 → if yes, then it's a minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies minor, then output 'minor'.\n\nElse, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so no need to check for overlaps.\n\nSo, the code needs to generate all permutations of the three notes, check for each permutation whether it meets the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut how to generate permutations?\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, given a list of three elements, permutations will generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nSo, for example, for the input ['C', 'E', 'G'], the permutations would include (C, E, G), (C, G, E), (E, C, G), etc. For each of these, check the distances.\n\nLet's take the example of 'C E G' → indexes 0, 4, 7.\n\nFor permutation (0,4,7):\n\ndistance_xy = (4-0) mod 12 = 4 → correct. distance_yz = 7-4=3 → correct. So major.\n\nThus, the code would detect that.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' → the notes are C#, B, F. Let's get their indexes:\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is 5. So permutations would include (B, C#, F) → indexes 10, 1, 5.\n\ndistance_xy between B (10) and C# (1): (1 -10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 → 3. Because 1-10 = -9. Adding 12 gives 3. So distance_xy is 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5-1=4. So yes, that's 3 and 4 → minor.\n\nSo the code would detect that.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, create the note_order list, and a dictionary to map note names to indexes.\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input uses the notation as given. For example, the note 'B' is present, and 'H' is the last. So the note_order list should be as follows:\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo, the mapping can be done with a dictionary:\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes)}\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is given in the notation as above. So for example, the note 'B' is in the list. So the code can create this dictionary.\n\nOnce that is done, the input is three notes. For example, input could be read as a list of three strings, split from the input line.\n\nBut the input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes. So for example, in the sample input, the first input is 'C E G'.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can read the input line, split into three parts, and process them.\n\nOnce we have the three notes, we can get their indexes.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the three indexes. For each permutation, check the conditions.\n\nNow, for example, the code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nindexes = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indexes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but what about permutations where the same note is considered multiple times? Well, since the input is three distinct notes, but the problem says that the input is a chord, which is a set of three notes. But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So, the code can assume that the three notes are distinct. But even if they are not, the code would still work, but the problem probably ensures that the input is valid.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. But in the problem statement, it's said that a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, the input is three notes. So the code can assume that the three notes are distinct. But the code doesn't need to check that.\n\nBut for the code, even if there are duplicates, the code will check permutations. However, in that case, the code may not find any major or minor, but the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, the problem says that the input is given by the teacher, so it's guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n\nBut the code doesn't need to handle that. The code just needs to process the three notes.\n\nBut for example, if two notes are same, then the code would generate permutations where x, y, z are same. For example, if the input is C C C, then the code would check permutations. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, but the code would output strange, since the distances would be zero. But the problem says that the input is a chord, which is a set of three notes. But perhaps the problem allows for repeated notes? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes, but the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. But the code can process any three notes.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a chord. So the input is three distinct notes. But the code doesn't need to check that.\n\nSo the code above would work.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, the sample input is given as a list of three examples. But the actual input is a single line with three notes. For example, in the sample input, the first input line is 'C E G', which outputs 'major'.\n\nLet me test the code for the first example.\n\nFor input_notes = ['C', 'E', 'G']\n\nindexes are [0,4,7].\n\nPermutations include (0,4,7) → d1 is (4-0) mod 12 =4, d2 is 7-4=3 → major. So found_major is True.\n\nThus, the code would output 'major'.\n\nSecond example: input_notes = ['C#', 'B', 'F'] → indexes are 1, 10, 5.\n\nCheck permutations. One of the permutations is (10, 1, 5). Let's compute:\n\nd1 = (1 -10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 → 3. d2 is (5-1) mod 12 →4. So this is minor. So found_minor is True.\n\nThird example: input_notes = ['A', 'B', 'H'] → indexes are 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck all permutations. Let's take one permutation (9, 10, 11). d1 is 1, d2 is 1. Not matching. Another permutation (9, 11, 10). d1 is (11-9) = 2 mod 12 → 2. d2 is (10-11) mod 12 → ( -1 ) mod 12 → 11. Not matching. Another permutation (10, 9, 11): d1 is (9-10) mod 12 → 11. d2 is (11-9) = 2. Not matching. Another permutation (10, 11, 9): d1 is (11-10)=1, d2 is (9-11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 → 10. No. Another permutation (11, 9, 10): d1 is (9-11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 → 10. d2 is (10-9) mod 12 →1. No. Another permutation (11, 10, 9): d1 is (10-11) mod 12 → 11, d2 is (9-10) mod 12 → 11. So no. So none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about other permutations for the minor case? For example, in the second example, the permutation (B, C#, F) is checked, but there are other permutations. However, once any permutation meets the condition, the code marks found_minor as True.\n\nNow, the code checks all permutations, and if any permutation meets the major condition, then found_major is True. Similarly for minor. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about for a minor chord, there are multiple permutations that could satisfy the condition. For example, if the triad is minor, then there may be multiple permutations that satisfy the condition, but the code would catch it.\n\nNow, the code is correct.\n\nBut need to make sure that the note_to_index is properly built. Let me check the note_order.\n\nThe note_order is as per the problem statement. Let's make sure that the list is correct.\n\nProblem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nYes. So the list is:\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nYes. So the indexes for B is 10, H is 11.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the minor example. Let's take the input 'B C# F' → which is the same as 'C# B F'.\n\nThe code would process the indexes as 1 (C#), 10 (B), 5 (F). The permutation (10, 1, 5) gives d1 = (1-10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is (5-1) =4 → 4. So minor.\n\nAnother possible permutation is (B, F, C#). Let's see:\n\nx is 10 (B), y is 5 (F), z is 1 (C#).\n\ndistance between x and y: (5 -10) mod 12 = (-5) mod 12 = 7. Then between y and z: (1 -5) mod 12 = -4 mod 12 = 8. So no.\n\nBut another permutation (C#, B, F) → x=1, y=10, z=5. d1 = 10-1 =9 mod 12 →9. Not 3 or 4.\n\nSo only certain permutations would trigger the condition.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code reads the input as a single line, splits into three parts.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of three examples. But the problem says that the input is a single line with three notes. So for example, the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut this is probably not the actual input. The actual input is a single line with three notes. For example, the first example's input is \"C E G\", which outputs \"major\".\n\nSo the code is written to read a single line of input, split into three notes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. Also, the code must not have any print statements other than the output. So the code will be:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nindexes = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indexes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So there's no case where both found_major and found_minor are True. So the code can safely check for major first, then minor.\n\nBut the code checks for all permutations. For example, if a chord is both major and minor (though the problem says it's impossible), the code would output 'major' because it checks for that first. But according to the problem statement, such cases don't exist.\n\nBut the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible edge case: what if the three notes are arranged in a way that two different permutations satisfy different conditions? But according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. So the code will not have to handle that.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in the musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of musical notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Use modular arithmetic to compute the distances between notes in the cyclic musical scale. A major triad requires a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note. A minor triad requires the reverse: 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones.\n4. **Determine Result**: Check all permutations for the major and minor triad conditions and print the result accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the order of notes and create a mapping from note to index\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes)}\n\n# Read input notes\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\n# Convert notes to their respective indices\nindexes = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\n# Check all permutations of the three notes\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indexes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\n# Output the result based on findings\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Mapping Notes**: The notes are mapped to indices from 0 to 11 based on their order in the musical scale. This allows for straightforward distance calculations using modular arithmetic.\n- **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the three input notes, we ensure that all possible orderings are considered for both major and minor triad checks.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. This ensures that distances wrap around correctly when moving from higher to lower notes.\n- **Result Determination**: After checking all permutations, the result is determined based on whether any permutation met the criteria for a major or minor triad.
