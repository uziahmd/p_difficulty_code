Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent each block? Since there are n roads, each block is determined by the arrangement of these lines. But directly representing all possible blocks isn't feasible because the number can be exponential in n. However, since we only need to find the shortest path between two specific blocks (the home and university), maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Each block can be represented by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, a point lies on one side or the other of the line. So for each road, we can determine whether the home point is on the positive or negative side. Similarly for the university. Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration.\n\nBut how do we model the transitions between these configurations? Because moving from one block to another requires crossing exactly one road. Each step changes the sign of exactly one road's equation. So the problem becomes similar to a graph where each node is a sign configuration, and edges exist between configurations that differ in exactly one sign. Then, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of sign changes needed to go from the home's configuration to the university's configuration.\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Because when you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. However, the adjacency between blocks is determined by sharing a common border. Which means that two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because crossing that road would take you from one block to another. So the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign flips needed to go from the home's sign configuration to the university's, where each step flips exactly one sign.\n\nBut then, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the two configurations, right? Wait, no. Because the Hamming distance is the number of positions where the two configurations differ. But if the home and university are in different configurations, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance divided by something? Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the home's configuration is a vector of signs (for each road, + or -) and the university's is another. Then, each step can change one sign. So the minimal steps required is the number of differing signs between the two configurations. Because each differing sign would require crossing that road once. But wait, that's only if the path is possible by flipping each differing sign one by one. However, perhaps there's a way to reach the target configuration with fewer steps if some roads are arranged in a way that allows overlapping transitions. But no, because each step can only flip one sign. So the minimal number of steps is exactly the Hamming distance between the two configurations.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Suppose the home and university configurations differ in k roads. Then, the minimal steps would be k. Because you can cross each of those roads once. But maybe there's a scenario where you have to cross some roads multiple times? No, because once you cross a road, you flip its sign. So, if you have two configurations that differ in k roads, you need to cross those roads once each. So the minimal steps is exactly the Hamming distance between the two configurations.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n1. For each road, compute the sign of the home point (whether it's positive or negative with respect to the road's equation).\n2. Do the same for the university point.\n3. Count how many roads have different signs between home and university. That count is the answer.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Let me think with an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0, and 1x +0y +0 = 0 → x=0.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\n- For first road (y=0): 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 > 0 → sign is positive.\n- For second road (x=0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1>0 → positive.\n\nSo home's configuration is [+, +].\n\nUniversity is (-1,-1):\n\nFor first road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign is negative.\nFor second road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → negative.\n\nSo university's configuration is [-, -]. The Hamming distance is 2. Hence the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is given as:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nLet's compute the signs.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1 (x=0): 1>0 → +.\nRoad 2 (y=0): 1>0 → +.\nRoad 3: 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\n\nSo home's config is [+, +, -].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: -1 <0 → -.\nRoad 2: -1 <0 → -.\nRoad 3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -.\n\nSo university's config is [-, -, -]. The Hamming distance is 2 (the first two roads differ). So the answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. So the problem reduces to computing the number of roads where the sign of the home and the sign of the university differ.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because the steps are moving across roads, each step crosses one road. So each differing sign requires crossing that road once. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing signs.\n\nBut why is that possible? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, if the home and university differ in k roads, then you can cross each of those roads once, thereby changing each sign, leading to the target configuration. And since each step can cross one road, the minimal steps is k.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where you have to cross some roads more than once? For example, suppose you have two roads, and home and university differ in both. Then, you can cross each once. So two steps. But what if you have a scenario where crossing one road twice would somehow get you there? Well, that would require that crossing a road twice brings you back to the original configuration. But since each crossing flips the sign, crossing it twice would flip it back. So that's not helpful. Therefore, the minimal steps is indeed the Hamming distance between the two configurations.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nFor each road, compute the sign of home and the sign of university. Count the number of roads where the signs differ. That's the answer.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the home and university are in the same block? Then, the answer is zero. But according to the problem statement, the home and university are in different blocks? No, the problem says that the home and university are located in some block, but it's possible that they are in the same block. However, the problem says that the input is such that neither is on a road, but they could be in the same block. So in that case, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each road, compute the value of a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. The sign of this value determines the home's position relative to the road. Similarly for the university's coordinates.\n\n- For each road, check if the signs of home and university are different. If yes, increment the count.\n\n- The answer is that count.\n\nBut wait, why does this work? Because each differing sign implies that the home and university are on opposite sides of that road. Therefore, to get from home's block to university's block, you must cross that road. However, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them. Because each such road must be crossed once. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads once each? Because the arrangement of roads allows that. For example, if you have two roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both, then you can cross one road, then the other. Each crossing takes you to a new block, and after two steps you reach the target. \n\nSo the problem is reduced to this simple calculation. So the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead home coordinates, university coordinates, then read n roads. For each road, compute the sign for home and university. Compare the signs. If they differ, add 1 to the answer.\n\nBut wait, how to compute the sign? For each road, the equation is a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. For a point (x, y), the value is s = a_i x + b_i y + c_i. The sign of s tells us which side of the line the point is on. \n\nBut since the roads are infinite lines, the sign determines which side of the line the point is on. So for each road, the home point will have a sign (positive or negative) and the university point will have a sign. If the two signs are different, then the two points are on opposite sides of that line. Therefore, the minimal steps must include crossing that line once.\n\nThus, the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1 (home), x2, y2 (university). Read n roads. For each road, compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i, val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. Check if val1 * val2 < 0. If yes, increment the answer.\n\nBecause if val1 and val2 have opposite signs, their product is negative. So the count is the number of roads where the product is negative.\n\nYes! So the code is straightforward. \n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0 1 0 (so equation is 0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0) and 1 0 0 (x=0).\n\nFor first road:\n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1. Total is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: 1 0 0 (x=0), 0 1 0 (y=0), 1 1 -3 (x + y -3 =0).\n\nFor first road (x=0):\n\nval1 = 1*1 + 0*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1. product negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond road (y=0): same as first, product negative → count +=1.\n\nThird road: val1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 = -5. Both are negative. Their product is positive. So no count. So total is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where home and university are on same side of all roads. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case where they are on opposite sides of one road. Answer is 1.\n\nWhat about when a road is vertical or horizontal? Doesn't matter, the calculation is the same.\n\nBut what about when a_i x + b_i y + c_i is zero? But the problem says that neither home nor university is on any road. So val1 and val2 can't be zero. So we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of n roads:\n\n    a, b, c = coefficients\n\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's all? That seems too easy. But according to the problem statement, that's the case. But why is this the case?\n\nBecause each road that separates the home and university blocks must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is the number of such roads. Because each such road is crossed once, and the order of crossings doesn't matter. \n\nBut why can't there be a situation where two roads are crossed, but the minimal steps is less than the number of differing roads? For example, suppose there are two roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both. Then, the answer is 2. But perhaps there's a way to cross one road, then cross another, but that's two steps. Which matches the count. \n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the problem is really just about counting the number of roads that separate the home and university points. \n\nThis seems surprisingly simple. But the problem's example and explanation align with this approach. \n\nSo the Python code is straightforward. Now, let's code it.\n\nRead the input. The input is read from stdin. The first line is x1 y1, second x2 y2, third n, then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nSo, in Python, read the first two lines, then read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut note that in the input examples, the first input is given as a string like ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', ...], but in reality, the input is read from standard input. So in code, we need to read from stdin.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each line:\n\ncompute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nAt the end, print count.\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nLet me test another case. Suppose home and university are separated by 3 roads. Then answer is 3.\n\nAnother case: home and university are in same block. Then answer is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work. Let's code it.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly. For example, in Python, reading the first line as x1, y1. Then second line as x2, y2. Then third line as n. Then n lines.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have multiple lines. So in code:\n\nimport sys.\n\nBut the code can be written as:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. Split into parts.\n\nBut in practice, the code can be written as:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That's the code. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 can't be zero. So the code is safe.\n\nSo this code should pass all test cases. Let's check the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nval1 for first road: 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1. val2: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 = -1. product -1 → count is 2. Output is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nFirst road: val1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. So total is 2. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code works for the samples.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is to count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves crossing a road, which means moving from one block to an adjacent block.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each road is defined by a linear equation. The home and university are located in different blocks, and we need to find the minimum number of road crossings required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Each block can be represented by the relative position of points with respect to each road. If a point lies on one side of a road, it will have a positive value for the road's equation, and if it lies on the other side, it will have a negative value. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads where the home and university points lie on opposite sides.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at the home and university coordinates.\n   - Check if these values have opposite signs (indicating that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road).\n   - Count the number of such roads, as each such road must be crossed once to move from the home block to the university block.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Sign Check**: For each road, we calculate the value of the linear equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n- **Counting Crossings**: Each road that separates the home and university points contributes one step to the minimum number of steps required. The total count of such roads gives the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
