Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step requires that the two blocks share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to model the problem. The key here is to represent each block as a node in a graph, and edges exist between nodes if their corresponding blocks are adjacent (i.e., share a common border). Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between the home block and the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Since there are infinite regions created by the lines, it's impossible to enumerate all blocks directly. However, we can model the problem using BFS where each state represents the current position in terms of which side of each line we are on. Wait, but with n lines, each line divides the plane into two regions. So, for each line, the block is on one side or the other. So, the position can be represented by a vector of signs (for each line, whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the line). But since the lines are infinite, and the regions are determined by these signs, two points are in the same block if they have the same sign for all lines. \n\nWait, but that's not exactly true. Because even if two points are on the same side of all lines, they could be in different regions if the arrangement of lines creates multiple regions. Wait, no. Actually, the arrangement of lines divides the plane into regions, and each region can be uniquely determined by the set of inequalities (for each line, which side of the line the region is on). So, if two points are in the same region, then for every line, they are on the same side. Conversely, if two points are on the same side of every line, they are in the same region. \n\nSo, the key idea here is that each region can be uniquely identified by the sign of each line's equation evaluated at the point. For example, for a line ax + by + c = 0, a point (x,y) will be on one side if ax + by + c > 0, and the other if it's < 0. \n\nThus, the problem becomes: find the minimum number of steps between the home's sign configuration and the university's sign configuration, where each step corresponds to changing the sign of exactly one line (since moving across a line changes the sign of that line's equation). Wait, no. Because moving from one block to another adjacent block requires crossing exactly one line. Because two regions are adjacent if their boundaries share a common line segment. So, when you cross a line, you change the sign of exactly one line. Therefore, two regions are adjacent if their sign configurations differ in exactly one line's sign. \n\nWait, but that might not be entirely accurate. Suppose there are two lines, and the regions are such that two regions are separated by a single line. But when two regions are separated by a line, their sign configurations differ in exactly one line. So, the adjacency in the graph corresponds to differing in exactly one line's sign. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a binary string (or a tuple of bits) representing the sign for each line. Each node is connected to others that differ in exactly one bit. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between the home's configuration and the university's configuration. \n\nBut how do we compute the initial and target configurations? For each line, we compute the sign of (a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i) for the home point and the university point. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For the home point and university point, compute their sign vectors. Each sign vector is a list of +1 or -1 for each line, indicating which side of the line the point is on. \n\n2. Then, the problem becomes finding the minimum number of steps to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step allows flipping exactly one bit (changing the sign of one line). \n\nWait, but that's only true if the regions are adjacent. However, two regions may differ in exactly one line's sign, but they might not be adjacent. Wait, no. Because if two regions differ in exactly one line's sign, that means that they are separated by that line. Therefore, they share a common boundary (the line), hence their common border is a line (infinite length). So, moving between them is allowed in one step. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each step can flip one bit, the minimal steps required is the number of differing bits between the two vectors. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Suppose the home and university are in regions that differ in exactly k lines. Then, the minimal steps would be k? Because each step can flip one line. But that would be the case if you can flip each differing line one by one. However, this is only possible if each intermediate step is valid. For example, suppose you have two differing lines. Let's say the home's sign vector is (s1, s2, ...) and the target is (t1, t2, ...). Suppose s1 != t1 and s2 != t2. Then, flipping s1 to match t1 would take you to a new configuration, which differs from the target in s2. Then, flipping s2 would reach the target. So, the minimal steps would be 2. Which is the Hamming distance. \n\nSo, the minimal steps is exactly the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. \n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each step allows changing one line's sign. So, the minimal steps is the number of positions where the two sign vectors differ. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the movement is allowed between two blocks if they share a common border. So, each step corresponds to moving across a line, changing the sign of exactly one line. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of differing lines between the home and university's sign vectors. \n\nBut that seems too simple. Let me check the examples given.\n\nIn the first example input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x +1y +0=0 (which is y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first line (y=0): 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0 → sign is +1.\n\nFor second line (x=0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → sign +1. \n\nSo home's sign vector is [1,1].\n\nUniversity is (-1,-1):\n\nFirst line: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → sign -1.\n\nSecond line: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → sign -1. \n\nSo the university's sign vector is [-1, -1]. \n\nThe Hamming distance is 2, so the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: the second input is home (1,1), university (-1,-1), and three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nLet's compute the sign vectors.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → 1>0 → +1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → 1>0 → +1.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 = 1 + 1 -3 = -1 → -1. \n\nSo home's vector is [1,1,-1].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → -1 <0 → -1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → -1 <0 → -1.\n\nRoad 3: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 → -1. \n\nSo the university's vector is [-1,-1,-1]. \n\nComparing with home's vector: first two elements differ, third is same. So Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the number of differing signs between the home and university's sign vectors. \n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross a line, thus flipping one sign. So, if you have k differing signs, you can flip each one step by step. Each flip takes you to a new region, and each step is allowed. So the minimal steps is indeed the Hamming distance between the two vectors. \n\nSo the solution is to compute for each line, the sign of home and university. Count how many lines have different signs between home and university. That count is the answer. \n\nWait, but what about if there are overlapping lines? No, the problem says that no two roads are the same. So each line is unique. \n\nBut what about if the home and university are in the same region? Then the answer is 0. \n\nSo the approach is straightforward. For each line, compute the value of (a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i) for home and university. For each line, check if the signs are different. Sum up the total number of differing signs. \n\nBut wait, how to compute the sign? For each line, for home point, compute a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i. Similarly for the university. Then, check if the product of these two values is negative. If it is, then the signs differ. \n\nBut since the home and university are not on any line, their values for each line are non-zero. \n\nSo, for each line, compute (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If their product is negative, that means the home and university are on opposite sides of that line. Thus, that line contributes 1 to the answer. \n\nSo the answer is the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nThis is a very simple solution. Let me see if that holds for the examples. \n\nFirst example: two lines. For each line:\n\nLine 1: y=0. Home (1,1) gives 1*1 + 0*...? Wait, original line is a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. For the first line, it's 0x +1y +0 =0. So for home (1,1): 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. For university (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is 1*-1 = -1 <0. So contributes 1. \n\nSecond line is x=0. For home, 1*1 +0*... = 1. For university, 1*(-1) + 0*... = -1. Product is -1. So contributes 1. Total is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond example: three lines. \n\nThird line is x + y -3 =0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So same sign. So no contribution. \n\nSo the two lines (x=0 and y=0) contribute 1 each. So total is 2. Correct. \n\nSo this approach works. \n\nSo the problem is reduced to counting the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nThat's a very simple solution. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each time you cross a line, you flip the sign. So the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university. \n\nBut how can that be? Because imagine that the home and university are separated by two lines. Then, you can cross one line, then another. But each line contributes to the count. \n\nYes. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of lines that separate the two points. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), then university (x2, y2). Then read n lines. For each line, compute for home and university the value of a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i. Then, check if the product is negative. If yes, increment the count. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of n lines:\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but that's it? That's the code? \n\nBut why does this work? Because each line that separates the two points contributes to the count, and the minimal steps is exactly that count. \n\nBut why? Because each such line must be crossed once. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses each of those lines once, and that there's no shorter path?\n\nBecause the minimal steps is the number of lines separating the two points. \n\nBut how can that be? For example, imagine that two points are separated by two lines. But perhaps there's a way to cross them in one step? No, because each line is a separate road. To cross from one region to another, you have to cross exactly one line. So, if two points are separated by k lines, then you have to cross each of those lines once. So, the minimal steps is k. \n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where two lines are crossed in a single step? Well, because each step crosses exactly one line. So, each step can only change one line's sign. So, if two points differ in k lines, then you need at least k steps. \n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed the number of lines that separate the home and university. \n\nThis seems too easy. But according to the sample inputs, it works. \n\nLet me think of another test case. \n\nTest case: home (0, 0), university (0, 1). There's one line: y=0.5. \n\nSo, the line is 0x +1y -0.5 =0. \n\nFor home (0,0): 0 + 0 -0.5 = -0.5. \n\nFor university (0,1): 0 +1 -0.5 = 0.5. \n\nProduct is negative. So count is 1. Answer is 1. Which is correct. \n\nAnother test case: home and university are separated by two lines. Let's say two lines, x=0 and y=0. Home is (1,1), university (-1,-1). The lines are x=0 and y=0. \n\nEach line contributes. So the answer is 2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother test case: home (1, 0), university (-1, 0). There's two lines: x=0 and x=1. \n\nWait, for line x=0: home is (1,0) → 1*1 + 0*0 +0 =1 (assuming line is x=0 → a=1, b=0, c=0). \n\nUniversity is (-1,0) → -1. So product is -1 → contributes 1. \n\nFor line x=1: a=1, b=0, c=-1. \n\nhome: 1*1 +0*0 -1 =0 → but the problem states that home and university are not on any line. So this case is invalid. \n\nSo let's adjust. Let's say the line is x=0.5. Then, home (1,0) gives 1*1 - 0.5 = 0.5. University (-1,0) gives -1 -0.5 = -1.5. So product is negative. So count is 1. \n\nBut the two points are separated by the line x=0.5. So answer is 1. \n\nSo the code seems to work. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nBut why didn't the problem mention anything about this approach? Because perhaps the problem is designed to trick people into thinking it's a BFS problem, but the actual solution is much simpler. \n\nSo the code is as simple as reading the input and counting the number of lines where the product of the evaluations is negative. \n\nSo the Python code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, let me check the sample input again.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSo for the first line, a=0, b=1, c=0. \n\nval1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. \n\nval2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. \n\nproduct is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: a=1, b=0, c=0. \n\nval1 is 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) + 0 +0 = -1. product is -1 → count becomes 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nSo for the third line: a=1, b=1, c=-3.\n\nval1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1.\n\nval2 = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So no count. \n\nSo the count is 2 (from first two lines). \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThus, the code works for the samples. \n\nSo this is the solution. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because the minimal steps is the number of lines separating the two points. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nWe need to read from stdin. Let's make sure that the code handles multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the input description. For example, the first sample input is given as a string, but in reality, the code needs to read from standard input. \n\nBut the code should read the first line as x1, y1, then second as x2, y2, then n, then n lines. \n\nSo the code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nCompute for each line the val1 and val2. \n\nCount the number of lines where val1 * val2 < 0.\n\nPrint that count.\n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but in Python, split() handles that. \n\nThe code:\n\nRead the first line as x1, y1. Then the second line as x2, y2. Then n. Then n lines.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first input is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut that's probably for two separate test cases. However, the problem says that the input is given as per the input description. So, the code should read from standard input, which for each test case, is given as per the input. \n\nBut the code is correct. \n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as per the input description. So, the code should read the input correctly. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what about when the input is given as multiple lines? For example, the first line is x1 y1, then x2 y2, then n, then n lines. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nThis is a very simple solution, but it's correct. \n\nSo, this is the code.\n",
