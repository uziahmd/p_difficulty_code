    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find these n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or some other count?) that satisfy this. Wait, the example shows for m=1, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Wait why? Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors, but the count remains the same until the next multiple of 5. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nFor example, 5! has 1 zero. 6! is 720, which also ends with one zero. Similarly, 7! is 5040, same. 8! is 40320, same. 9! is 362880. Then 10! has two zeros. So between 5 and 9 inclusive, there are 5 numbers where the trailing zero count is exactly 1. So for m=1, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key here is that for certain m values, there may be multiple n's that produce exactly m zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nThe approach I need to take is:\n\n1. Find all n's where the number of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that would result in exactly m zeros. Let's think about how the trailing zero count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, it adds at least one zero. If it's a multiple of 25, then it adds two, etc.\n\nSo for a given m, there might be a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I can find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there are either 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, the example shows 5 numbers. But why?\n\nWait, let's think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. For numbers between 5k and 5k+4, the f(n) would be the same as for 5k. Unless there's another multiple of 5 in that range. For example, when n is 25, which is 5^2. Then f(25) = 6 (since 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So for numbers from 25 to 29, the count would be 6. But when you reach 30, which is 5*6, then f(30) is 7 (since 30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). So between 25 and 29, the count is 6. So that's 5 numbers (25,26,27,28,29) that give 6 zeros. So again, 5 numbers. But wait, what if m is 6? Then the answer would be 5 numbers. But what if m is 5?\n\nWait, for example, let's compute f(24). Let's see:\n\nf(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. Then 25 gives 6. So there's a jump from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there is no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Hence, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo that suggests that for some m values, there are no n's. So the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists n's, and how many.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nBut how to find the n's that have exactly m zeros?\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the lower and upper bounds for n such that f(n) = m. For example, if we can find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and the smallest n where f(n) = m+1. Then the numbers between the first and the second minus one would be the candidates. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's say that the minimal n where f(n) = m is x. Then, the next number where f(n) increases is when n reaches a multiple of 5. So, for example, if x is the first n with f(n)=m, then the next number where f(n) increases is when n is the next multiple of 5. So the numbers x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4 would all have the same count of m. Unless x is a multiple of 25, 125, etc., which would cause the count to increase by more than 1. Wait, but in that case, the count would jump by more than 1. So for example, if x is 25, then f(25) = 6. The previous number is 24, which has 4. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there is no solution.\n\nTherefore, the key idea is: for a given m, there exists some n's if and only if there exists an n such that f(n) = m. But how to find that?\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Find the minimal n where f(n) = m+1. Let's call this high.\n\nThen, the numbers between low and high-1 would be the ones that have exactly m trailing zeros. However, the count of such numbers depends on how much the function f increases between low and high.\n\nWait, for example, if low is the first n with f(n)=m, and high is the first n with f(n)=m+1. Then, the numbers from low to high-1 would have f(n) equal to m. But how many numbers are there?\n\nIf high - low is 5, then there are 5 numbers. But if high - low is less than 5, then maybe there are fewer numbers. For example, if high is low + 1, then there is only one number (low) that has m zeros.\n\nWait, but how can that happen? Let's think of an example. Suppose m is 5. Let's find for m=5. Let's see:\n\nLooking for n where f(n)=5.\n\nLet's compute f(24) = 4, f(25)=6. So there is no n where f(n) is 5. Therefore, the answer is zero.\n\nSo in this case, there's no solution. So the problem is, for a given m, find if there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If yes, then the numbers are from low to high-1. Then, the count is high - low.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where f(n) = m? Well, this seems like a problem that can be solved with binary search. Because f(n) is a non-decreasing function. So for example, for a given m, we can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where f(n) = m. But how to know if such n exists?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to find the lower and upper bounds for n where f(n) = m. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the minimal n where f(n) = m+1. Then the numbers between those two points would be the candidates.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n where f(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then check if there's a next n where f(n) is m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower bound and upper bound of n where f(n) = m. For example, the lower bound is the first n where f(n) = m, and the upper bound is the first n where f(n) > m. Then the numbers between lower and upper-1 would be the possible n's. But how to find the lower and upper?\n\nSo, for example, the upper bound is the first n where f(n) = m+1. Then, the numbers from lower to upper-1 would all have f(n) = m. But how to find lower and upper?\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Use binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this value 'lo'.\n\n- Check if f(lo) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions (return 0).\n\n- Then, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this value 'hi'.\n\n- The count of numbers is hi - lo.\n\nBut wait, because for example, in the case where m=1:\n\nlo is 5, since f(5) = 1. hi is the first n where f(n) >= 2. Which is 10, since f(10) = 2. Then hi - lo is 5, which is correct (5,6,7,8,9).\n\nAnother example: m=6. Let's compute:\n\nFind lo where f(lo) = 6. Let's see, for 25, f(25) = 6. So lo is 25. hi is the first n where f(n) >=7. Which would be 25+5=30? Let's check f(25)=6, f(26)=6, ..., f(29)=6, f(30)=7. So hi is 30. So hi - lo is 5, which gives 25,26,27,28,29. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's find lo. We need to find the minimal n where f(n) >=5. Let's see:\n\nf(24)=4, f(25)=6. So lo is 25. But f(lo) is 6, which is not equal to m=5. So there's no solution, hence output 0.\n\nSo this approach seems valid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor a given m, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this lo.\n\n2. Check if f(lo) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Call this hi.\n\n4. The numbers from lo to hi-1 are all the n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. The count is hi - lo.\n\nSo the problem reduces to implementing this logic.\n\nNow, how to implement the function f(n), which counts the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThat's straightforward: count = 0, while n>0: divide by 5, add to count, n = n//5.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement binary search for finding the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nBut what is the range for binary search?\n\nWell, for m, the minimal possible n is 0 (but since n must be positive, perhaps 1?), but the maximum possible n can be 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the number of trailing zeros is at least m. Because 5*m /5 = m, and higher divisions contribute more. So for example, for m=1, 5*1=5, which is the minimal n. For m=5, 5*5=25, which gives 6 trailing zeros. But in that case, the binary search would find lo as 25, but since f(lo) is 6, which is greater than m=5, so no solution.\n\nSo the binary search can be done between low=0 and high=5*m. But perhaps even higher, but 5*m is sufficient for the upper bound.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable for binary search.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nImplement a helper function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, perform binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this lo.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(lo) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, perform another binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Call this hi.\n\nThe answer is the numbers from lo to hi-1, inclusive. The count is hi - lo.\n\nBut how to perform the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target?\n\nLet me think. For example, for target, we need to find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nThe binary search can be done as follows:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*target (or something higher, but for the purposes of the problem, perhaps 5*target is enough). But for m up to 1e5, 5*1e5 is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but what if the target is very large? For example, for m=1e5, the actual n may be larger than 5*m. Wait, no. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because count_zeros(5m) = 5m//5 + 5m//25 + ... which is m + m//5 + m//25 + ... which is definitely larger than m. So 5*m is an upper bound for the minimal n that gives count_zeros(n) >= m. So using 5*m as the upper bound is safe.\n\nBut perhaps even 5*m is not needed. For example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5. For m=2, it's 10. For m=5, it's 25. So 5*m is the upper bound.\n\nBut for cases where m is not achievable, like m=5, the binary search will find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, which is 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6, which is greater than m=5. Hence, there is no solution.\n\nSo the code for binary search:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nBut wait, the initial high can be set to 5*target, but for some cases, maybe even higher. But for the purposes of the problem, perhaps 5*target is sufficient. Let's think. For example, for target=1, 5*1=5. Which is correct. For target=6, 5*6=30. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6 is 25, which is less than 30. So yes, 5*target is safe.\n\nOnce we have lo and hi, then the numbers are lo to hi-1. So the count is hi - lo.\n\nBut in the example for m=1, lo is 5, hi is 10. So hi - lo is 5. Which is correct. The numbers 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo this approach seems solid.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, handle the edge cases. For example, when m is 0. But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So the input m is >=1.\n\nBut the sample input includes m=5, which outputs 0. Let's check that.\n\nFor m=5:\n\nfind_min_n(5) returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 = 4. count_zeros(25) = 6. So the minimal n is 25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. find_min_n(6) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) returns 30. So hi is 30. So the numbers are 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute lo = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(lo) != m: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute hi = find_min_n(m+1).\n\n   the numbers are from lo to hi-1, inclusive.\n\n   the count is hi - lo.\n\n   output the count and the numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if hi is 0? No, since m is >=1, and hi is find_min_n(m+1), which would be >= some value.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead m.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5*target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nThen:\n\nlo = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lo) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    hi = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = hi - lo\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lo, hi))))\n\nWait, but range(lo, hi) is lo, lo+1, ..., hi-1. Which is exactly the numbers we need.\n\nBut for example, when lo=5 and hi=10, range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper limit. So yes.\n\nBut what about when hi is 0? Well, for m=1, hi is 10, which is correct.\n\nBut for m=6, hi is 30. So the range is 25 to 29.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nlo is find_min_n(1). Let's see:\n\nbinary search for target 1.\n\nInitially low=0, high=5*1=5.\n\nLoop:\n\nlow=0, high=5.\n\nmid=(0+5)//2=2. count_zeros(2) is 0 <1. So low becomes 3.\n\nNow low=3, high=5. mid=4. count_zeros(4)=0 <1. low becomes 5. Now low=high=5. exit loop. return 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nhi is find_min_n(2). Let's compute:\n\ntarget is 2. high=5*2=10.\n\nbinary search for minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nlow starts at 0, high=10.\n\nmid=5: count_zeros(5)=1 <2. So low=6.\n\nmid= (6+10)/2=8. count_zeros(8) is 1 <2. low=9.\n\nmid= (9+10)/2=9.5 => 9. count_zeros(9) is 1 <2. low=10. Now low=high=10. return 10.\n\nso hi is 10. So the numbers are from 5 to 9. which is 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. Let's see.\n\nlo = find_min_n(5). Let's see:\n\ntarget=5. high=25.\n\nbinary search for minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25)=6. So the minimal n is 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple numbers, but the hi - lo is 0? No, because if count_zeros(lo) is m, then hi is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So lo must be less than hi. Because count_zeros(lo) is m, and count_zeros(hi) is >=m+1. So hi is at least lo +1. So hi - lo is at least 1. So the code will output the correct numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that there are multiple numbers but the count is more than 5? For example, let's think of m=24.\n\nWhat is the count_zeros(99)?\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5 + 99//25 + 99//125 = 19 + 3 + 0 = 22.\n\ncount_zeros(100) = 20 +4 + 0 =24. Oh wait, 100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0. Total 24.\n\nSo for m=24, lo is 100. Then find hi for m+1=25.\n\nfind_min_n(25) would be the first n where count_zeros(n) >=25.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(100)=24. count_zeros(101)=24. ... count_zeros(104)=24. count_zeros(105)= 105//5=21 + 105//25=4 + 105//125=0 → 25. So hi would be 105. So the numbers are 100,101,102,103,104. So 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: m=2. What is the answer?\n\nThe numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Because 10! has 2 zeros. 11! also has 2, until 15! which has 3. So the code should return 5 numbers. Let's check.\n\nlo is find_min_n(2). Let's see:\n\nbinary search for target=2. high=10.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. So the minimal n is 10. Then hi is find_min_n(3). Let's compute that.\n\ncount_zeros(14) is 2 (14//5=2, 14//25=0). count_zeros(15) is 3. So hi is 15. So the numbers are 10-14 (5 numbers). Correct.\n\nSo the code works here.\n\nNow, what about when m is 0? According to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So the code doesn't need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, what about when m is 25?\n\nLet me think. Let's compute for n=100: count_zeros(100) is 24. n=105: count_zeros(105)=25. So lo is 105. Then hi is find_min_n(26). Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(109) = 109//5=21 + 109//25=4 + 109//125=0 → 25. count_zeros(110) = 22 + 4 + 0 =26. So hi is 110. So the numbers are 105-109, which is 5 numbers. So output 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo now, the code can be written.\n\nBut what about when the hi is not found? Well, the code uses 5*target as the upper bound. But for m+1, the code will find it.\n\nBut for very large m, say m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. But for count_zeros(5e5) is 5e5//5 + 5e5//25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + 8e2 + ... which is way larger than m. So the code will find the correct lo and hi.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut first, note that the input is given as a list, but the problem says that the input is an integer m. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read m from stdin. But in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which seems to be a list of test cases. Wait, the example shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. The original problem probably has multiple test cases, but the actual code needs to process a single m. Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer m. However, the sample input shows two cases. Maybe the sample input is for multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the code should read one integer m.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nThis suggests that the input is a list of test cases. For example, in the first case, m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. In the second case, m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's confusing. However, the user's instruction says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should read a single integer m. But the sample input shows two lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for two different test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of inputs, but the code should process one input per run.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. So the code should read m from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's given as ['1', '5'], which may be a mistake. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So the code should read m from stdin.\n\nBut in the example, the first input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, output is 0. So the code should process each m individually.\n\nSo the code should read m as an integer from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the input is given as a list. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement's example, the input is written as:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut perhaps this is a formatting mistake. For example, the actual input is two test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single integer m. This is conflicting. However, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m...\n\nSo the code should process a single m. Therefore, the sample input may be a mistake. However, the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the code should read a single integer m.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first input is 1, and the output is the first line. The second input is 5, and the output is 0. So the code should read a single integer m, process it, and output the answer.\n\nThus, the code should read m from stdin. So in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlo = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lo) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    hi = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = hi - lo\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lo, hi))))\n\nWait, but for the first sample input, when m=1, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\". However, the code would print 5 followed by the numbers. But in the sample, the first line is 5, then the second line is the numbers. However, the code as written would print the k and then the numbers in the same line. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe code does:\n\nprint(k) → which prints the number of values, followed by a newline.\n\nThen print(' '.join(...)), which prints the numbers separated by spaces, followed by a newline.\n\nWhich is correct. For example, in the first sample input, the output would be:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is the same as the sample output, except that the sample output shows '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' which is the same as two lines. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for m=5 is 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the numbers are more than one line? Well, the code outputs the numbers in a single line, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is written as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is two lines. So the code's output is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the first print(k) would print the number followed by a newline. Then the second print would print the numbers, also followed by a newline. So for the first sample, the output would be two lines. Which is correct.\n\nBut the problem's sample shows the output as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'], which is two outputs for two test cases. However, according to the problem statement, the code should process a single m. So the code is correct.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So when the user runs the code, they input a single integer m.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement. However, the code is written for a single m.\n\nNow, let's test the code for m=5.\n\nm=5:\n\nlo = find_min_n(5). Let's compute:\n\ntarget=5. high=5*5=25.\n\nbinary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5.\n\ncount_zeros(24)=4+0=4 <5. count_zeros(25)=6 >=5. So the binary search would find 25 as the minimal n. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code would output 5 numbers: 25-29.\n\nAnother test case: m=24. The code would find lo=100 (count_zeros(100)=24), hi= find_min_n(25). For 25, the first n where count_zeros(n)>=25 is 105 (count_zeros(105) is 25). So the numbers are 100-104 (5 numbers). So output is 5 followed by 100 101 102 103 104.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases.\n\nCase where m=0. But according to problem statement, m starts from 1.\n\nAnother case: m=25. Let's compute lo.\n\nBut let's think of when m=25. What is the first n with count_zeros(n) =25?\n\nWell, for n=105, count_zeros(105) is 25. So lo=105. Then hi is find_min_n(26). For 26, the first n is 110. So the numbers are 105-109 (5 numbers).\n\nBut what about when m is such that there's only one n?\n\nIs there such a case?\n\nFor example, m=24. Wait, no. Because for n=100, count_zeros is 24. Then 101, 102, 103, 104 also have 24. So 5 numbers. So when is there only one number?\n\nOnly when the next number increases the count by more than 1. For example, when m is 5, but that case is not possible. Let's think of m=4. For example, count_zeros(20) is 4 + 0 =4? Wait:\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 20//5 + 20//25 = 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(21) is same. Up to 24. Then 25 gives 6. So for m=4, the lo is 20, hi is 25. So the numbers are 20-24 (5 numbers). So again 5 numbers.\n\nSo is there any case where the count is 1?\n\nNo. Because for any m, the numbers that have exactly m trailing zeros are 5 consecutive numbers. Or zero.\n\nWait, but why? Because the count_zeros increases by 1 when you hit a multiple of 5, but when you hit a multiple of 25, it increases by 2. So for example, if there's a jump of 2, then between the previous count and the next, there's a gap. For example, between 24 (count 4) and 25 (count 6). So for m=5, there's no solution. But for m=4, there are 5 numbers (20-24). For m=6, there are 5 numbers (25-29). So the code works.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python. But for m=1e5, the code may take some time. But binary search is O(log(5*m)) steps. For each step, count_zeros is O(log n). So for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, and count_zeros is O(log 5e5) steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should be efficient enough.\n\nAnother possible optimization: precompute the upper bound. But for now, the code is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, when m is 1e5, 5*m is 5e5. So for the binary search, that's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n   ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The approach involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and using binary search to efficiently find the range of valid $ n $ values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: We use binary search to find the smallest number $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $. We then check if this count is exactly $ m $. If not, there are no valid $ n $ values. If it is, we find the smallest number where the count of trailing zeros exceeds $ m $ to determine the upper bound of valid $ n $ values.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**: The valid $ n $ values lie between the lower bound (found using binary search for $ m $) and the upper bound (found using binary search for $ m+1 $).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lo = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(lo) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        hi = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = hi - lo\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(lo, hi))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing the quotients until $ n $ becomes zero.\n\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least `target`. The upper bound for the binary search is set to $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, which is a safe upper limit based on the properties of trailing zeros in factorials.\n\n3. **main()**: This function reads the input value $ m $, determines the lower bound $ lo $ where the count of trailing zeros is exactly $ m $, and checks if such a value exists. If it does, it finds the upper bound $ hi $ where the count exceeds $ m $, then prints the count of valid $ n $ values and the values themselves in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
