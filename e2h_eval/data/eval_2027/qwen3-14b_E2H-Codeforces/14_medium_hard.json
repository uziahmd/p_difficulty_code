    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where this count equals m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Let's think about how the count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. Wait, no. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, adding 1 to n would add one more 5. But if it's a multiple of 25, then adding 1 would add two 5s. Wait, no. The count for n=24 is floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 = 4. For n=25, it's 5 + 1 = 6. So when you go from 24 to 25, the count jumps by 2. So between certain numbers, the count can jump by more than 1. That means that for some m values, there are no n's that produce exactly that m. For example, if m is 5, then there's a jump from 24 (count 4) to 25 (count 6). So m=5 would have no solutions. Wait, but in the sample input, m=1 gives 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Let me check that.\n\nWait for m=1: the count for 5! is 1 (since 5/5=1). For 6! it's still 1 (since 6/5=1.2, floor is 1). Similarly for 7,8,9. Then for 10, it's 2 (floor(10/5) + floor(10/25) = 2 + 0 = 2). So the numbers 5-9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero. So the answer for m=1 is 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's such that their trailing zero count is exactly m. Now, how to find these n's?\n\nThe approach I think is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n such that the trailing zero count is >=m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. But wait, perhaps there are ranges where the count is exactly m. But how to find them?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe more? Wait, in the sample, m=1 has 5 numbers. Let's think of another example. Suppose m=6. Let's see:\n\nFor n=25, the count is 6 (as 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). Then for n=26, 27, 28, 29, the count is still 6. Then for 30, it's 30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7. So for m=6, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29. So 5 numbers again. So why is that?\n\nBecause when you have a number that is a multiple of 5, adding 1 to it may increase the count by 1. But when you hit a multiple of higher powers of 5, like 25, 50, etc., the count increases by more than 1. So for m values that are in between, there may be no n's. For example, m=5: the count for 24 is 4, for 25 it's 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. So the answer for m=5 would be zero.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe other numbers? Let me think. Let's take m=2. Let's see:\n\nn=10: count is 2. Then n=11, 12, 13, 14: count is 2. Then n=15: count is 3 (15/5=3, 15/25=0). So for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14: 5 numbers again. So seems like when there's a solution, there are 5 numbers. But wait, what about m=0? Well, the problem says m starts at 1. So perhaps for any valid m, the number of solutions is 0 or 5? Or maybe sometimes 1?\n\nWait, let's think of m=3. Let's see:\n\nn=15: count is 3 (15/5=3, 15/25=0). Then 15, 16, 17, 18, 19: count is 3. Then n=20, count is 4 (20/5=4, 20/25=0). So m=3 has 5 numbers again. So why does this happen?\n\nBecause when you reach a number that's a multiple of 5, the count increases. But for numbers that are not multiples of higher powers of 5, the count increases by 1. So for example, when you have a number that's a multiple of 5 but not of 25, the count increases by 1. So for m values that are achieved by such numbers, there's a range of 5 numbers.\n\nBut when the count jumps by more than 1, like from 24 (count 4) to 25 (count 6), then m=5 is not achievable. So the problem becomes, for a given m, find if there exists n such that the count is exactly m. If yes, then the numbers are 5 consecutive numbers. But how?\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where the count is exactly m. Then check if there are 5 numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower and upper bounds of n that would give exactly m trailing zeros. How?\n\nThe key is to find the first n where the count is m, and then check if the next numbers (up to 4 steps) also have the same count.\n\nBut how do I find the n's?\n\nAnother approach is to use binary search to find the smallest n where the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the range of n's that give exactly m.\n\nWait, but how to find the range?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that for a given m, the count of trailing zeros for n is exactly m. Let's say that the minimal n for which the count is m is x. Then, the next numbers x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4 will also have the same count, until the next multiple of 5. But wait, that's not necessarily true. Because if x is not a multiple of 5, then adding 1 to x won't change the count. But if x is a multiple of 5, then adding 1 would not change the count? Wait, no. For example, x=5. The count for 5 is 1. For x=6, the count is still 1. So the count remains same. So for numbers that are not multiples of 5, the count doesn't change. So, the count increases only when you cross a multiple of 5. So, if the count for x is m, then the count for x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4 will be same as m, unless x+1 is a multiple of 5, etc. Wait, but that's not possible. Because if x is a multiple of 5, then x+1 is not, so the count for x+1 is same as x. But for example, x=25, the count is 6. For x+1=26, the count is same as 25's count. Because 26/5 is 5.2, floor is 5. 26/25 is 1.04, floor 1. So total is 6. Same as 25. So the count for x=25 is 6. For x=25,26,27,28,29, the count is 6. Then for 30, the count is 7. So there are 5 numbers (25-29) that have count 6.\n\nSo, for any m, if there exists at least one n with count m, then there are exactly 5 numbers. Unless the m is achieved by a number that is a multiple of a higher power of 5. Wait, but even if x is a multiple of 25, like x=25, the count is 6. Then x+1 is 26, which is not a multiple of 5. So the count remains same. So for x=25, the next four numbers (25,26,27,28,29) all have count 6. So regardless of whether x is a multiple of 5 or not, once you find the minimal x where count is m, then the next four numbers will have the same count. So the total is 5 numbers. But wait, what if the x is such that the count increases by more than 1?\n\nFor example, let's take m=6. The minimal x is 25. The count for x=25 is 6. Then 25,26,27,28,29 all have count 6. So 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's a jump. For example, m=5. Then the count for 24 is 4, 25 is 6. So there's no n with count 5. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where the count is exactly m. Then check if there's such an n. If yes, then the numbers are n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4. But how to find that minimal n?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower and upper bounds of n where the count is exactly m. How?\n\nThe way to approach this is to use binary search to find the minimal n where the count is >=m. Then check if the count for that n is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, check if the count for n+4 is also m. But how?\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n where count is exactly m. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the lower bound and upper bound for n where the count is m.\n\nBut here's the thing: the count function is non-decreasing. For example, as n increases, the count of trailing zeros can stay the same or increase. So, for a given m, the set of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros is a contiguous range. Because once the count increases beyond m, there's no way to get back to m again.\n\nSo, for example, if there exists an n where count is m, then there's a range of numbers from a to b (inclusive) where count is exactly m. The question is, what is the length of that range?\n\nBut earlier examples show that the length is 5. But why?\n\nBecause when the count increases by 1, the range is 5 numbers. But when the count increases by more than 1, then there's a gap. So for example, if the count jumps from 4 to 6, then m=5 is not present.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the minimal n where count(n) = m, and the maximal n where count(n) = m. Then the numbers between them are the solutions.\n\nBut how to find that minimal and maximal n?\n\nLet me think. For example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5, and the maximal is 9. So the numbers are 5-9. So the count for 9 is 1. How can I find the minimal and maximal n for a given m?\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, the minimal n is the first n where count(n) = m. The maximal n is the last n where count(n) = m. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the minimal n where count(n) >= m is found via binary search. Let's call this low. Then check if count(low) is m. If not, then there's no solution. If yes, then find the first n where count(n) is m+1, and subtract 1 to get the upper bound. Then the numbers from low to upper_bound are the ones with count m. But how?\n\nLet me explain. Suppose we have m=1. The first n where count is >=1 is 5. Then the first n where count is >=2 is 10. So the upper bound is 10-1=9. So the numbers are 5 to 9. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for m=6, the first n where count >=6 is 25. The first n where count >=7 is 30. So the upper bound is 29. So 25-29 is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\nFind the lower bound (the smallest n where count(n) >= m). Then check if count(lower) is m. If not, then no solution. Else, find the upper bound as the smallest n where count(n) >= m+1, subtract 1. Then the numbers between lower and upper are the solutions.\n\nSo the number of solutions is upper - lower + 1. But according to previous examples, this should be 5. But why?\n\nWell, because when count(n) increases by 1, the upper bound is the next n where count increases. So the difference between the two bounds would be 5?\n\nLet me test with m=6. lower is 25, upper is 29. 29-25 +1 =5. Correct.\n\nFor m=1, 9-5+1=5. Correct.\n\nFor m=2, lower is 10, upper is 14. 14-10+1=5. Correct.\n\nBut what if m is such that the count increases by more than 1? For example, m=5. The lower bound for m=5 would be the first n where count(n)>=5. Let's compute that.\n\nLet me compute count(24) is 4+0=4. count(25)=6. So the first n where count(n)>=5 is 25. But count(25) is 6, which is not equal to m=5. Therefore, there's no solution. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. For a given m, find the lower bound (smallest n where count(n) >= m).\n\n2. Check if count(lower) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the upper bound (smallest n where count(n) >= m+1), then subtract 1. The upper bound is upper_bound -1.\n\n4. The numbers from lower to upper_bound -1 are the solutions. The count of numbers is upper_bound - lower.\n\nBut wait, upper_bound is the first n where count(n) >= m+1. So the upper_bound -1 is the largest n with count(n) = m.\n\nSo the number of solutions is (upper_bound -1) - lower +1 = upper_bound - lower.\n\nSo for example, when lower is 5 and upper_bound is 10, then upper_bound - lower is 5, which is correct (numbers 5-9: 5 numbers).\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to implementing the count function, and implementing binary search to find lower and upper bounds.\n\nNow, the count function: for a given n, compute the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThe count function can be implemented as follows:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the binary search part. How to find the lower bound for a given m.\n\nThe lower bound is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search can be done between 0 and 5*m (since 5*m! will have at least m zeros). Wait, but for example, for m=1, 5*1=5, which is the correct n. For m=6, 5*6=30, which is higher than 25. So the upper limit for binary search can be 5*m. But perhaps a better upper limit is 5*m. Because for any n, the number of trailing zeros is at least n/5. So for m, the minimal n is <= 5*m. So binary search can be done between 0 and 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps for larger m, 5*m is acceptable. For example, m=1e5, 5*1e5 is 500,000, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code for finding the lower bound is:\n\ndef find_lower(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5*m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nSimilarly, for upper bound, we need to find the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then upper_bound is that value. So the upper_bound is found by find_lower(m+1).\n\nOnce we have lower and upper_bound, then if count_zeros(lower) != m, then there's no solution. Else, the numbers are from lower to upper_bound-1 inclusive.\n\nSo the number of solutions is upper_bound - lower.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nFor m=1, lower is 5, upper_bound is find_lower(2) = 10. So upper_bound - lower = 5. So numbers 5,6,7,8,9. Correct.\n\nFor m=6, lower is 25, upper_bound is find_lower(7) = 30. 30-25=5. Numbers 25-29. Correct.\n\nIf m is 5, lower is find_lower(5) =25. count_zeros(25)=6 !=5. So no solution.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor the given m:\n\n1. Compute lower = find_lower(m).\n\n2. Check if count_zeros(lower) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n3. Else compute upper = find_lower(m+1).\n\n4. The numbers are from lower to upper-1. The count is upper - lower.\n\nBut then, what if upper - lower is 5? Well, that's the case for all m that have solutions. But how do we know that?\n\nBecause for example, if m is such that there are multiple numbers. But according to the previous examples, it's always 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros function increases by exactly 1 when you cross a multiple of 5, but not higher. So the upper_bound is the first n where the count is m+1. So the difference between upper and lower is the number of numbers that have count m.\n\nBut how can that be 5? Well, because for the lower, which is the first n with count >= m, and count is exactly m. Then upper is the first n with count >=m+1. So the numbers between lower and upper-1 are all the numbers with count m.\n\nBut the count for upper-1 is m. Because upper is the first n where count >= m+1. So upper-1's count is m.\n\nSo the number of numbers is upper - lower.\n\nBut how much is that?\n\nIn the case of m=1, upper is 10. lower is 5. upper - lower is 5. So 5 numbers. For m=6, upper is 30, lower is 25. 5 numbers again.\n\nBut why is upper - lower 5?\n\nBecause the count_zeros function increases by 1 when you reach a multiple of 5. So for example, between lower and upper-1, there are exactly 5 numbers. Because the next step after lower is when the count increases by 1.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, upper - lower could be less than 5?\n\nWait, let's think of m=0. But the problem says m starts from 1. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother example: suppose m=2. lower is 10, upper is 15. Because count_zeros(10) is 2, count_zeros(14) is 2, count_zeros(15) is 3. So upper is 15. upper - lower is 5. So numbers 10-14: 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: let's take m=7. The lower is 28?\n\nWait, let's compute count_zeros(28):\n\n28//5 = 5, 28//25=1. Total 6. So that's not 7. So what's the first n with count >=7?\n\nLet's compute for n=25: count is 6. n=25: 6. n=30: count is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → 7. So the first n where count is >=7 is 30. So lower is 30. count_zeros(30) is 7. So upper is find_lower(8). Let's compute for m+1=8.\n\nWhat is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=8?\n\nn=30: count is 7. n=31: same as 30. n=35: 35//5=7, 35//25=1. total 8. So the first n is 35. So upper is 35. So upper - lower is 35-30=5. So numbers 30-34. Let's check count_zeros(30) is 7. count_zeros(34) is 34//5=6, 34//25=1. 6+1=7. Yes. So 5 numbers again.\n\nSo yes, the upper - lower is always 5 when there are solutions. So the number of solutions is 5. But wait, what if m is such that the count increases by 1, but the upper - lower is 5?\n\nYes, that's the case. So the code can be structured as follows:\n\nOnce we find that lower is a valid n (count_zeros(lower) == m), then the numbers are lower, lower+1, ..., lower+4. So the list is [lower, lower+1, lower+2, lower+3, lower+4]. But how to confirm that upper - lower is 5? Because upper is find_lower(m+1). So for example, when m=7, upper is 35. lower is 30. 35-30=5. So the numbers are from 30 to 34, which is 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as:\n\nCompute lower = find_lower(m). Check if count_zeros(lower) == m. If not, output 0. Else, compute upper = find_lower(m+1). Then the numbers are from lower to upper -1. Which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers, which are lower, lower+1, ..., upper-1.\n\nBut how to handle the case where upper - lower is not 5? For example, if m is something that leads to a different scenario.\n\nBut according to our previous analysis, it's always 5. So perhaps the code can assume that. However, perhaps in some edge cases, there's a different scenario.\n\nWait, what if m is 0? Well, the problem states that m starts from 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: m=100000. Let's think about how the code would handle it. But since the binary search is O(log(5*m)), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead m from input. For each m, process as follows:\n\nIf m is 0, but the input says m is >=1. So no need.\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the find_lower function using binary search.\n\nThen:\n\nlower = find_lower(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper = find_lower(m+1)\n\n    numbers = [lower + i for i in range(upper - lower)]\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but upper - lower is the number of elements. For example, if upper is 10 and lower is 5, upper - lower is 5, which is the number of elements (5,6,7,8,9). So the code would generate numbers from lower to upper-1. So the list is [lower, lower+1, ..., upper-1], which is (upper - lower) elements.\n\nBut how to generate that list? Well, for example, the list can be generated as [lower + i for i in range(upper - lower)].\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test for the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nlower = find_lower(1) → 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So yes.\n\nupper = find_lower(2) → 10. upper - lower = 5. So numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample input 2: m=5. Let's compute lower = find_lower(5). Let's see:\n\nfind_lower(5) is looking for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(24) is 4+0=4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the binary search would find 25 as the lower. Then count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=6. lower is 25, upper is 30. upper - lower =5. So numbers 25-29.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5? Let's see.\n\nBut the binary search is O(log (5*m)) steps, and each step is O(log n) for count_zeros. So for m up to 1e5, 5*m is 5e5, and log2(5e5) is around 19 steps. So it's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input. But note that the input is given as a list, perhaps from multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. The sample input shows ['1', '5'] which probably corresponds to two test cases. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: the only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5). But the sample input shows two lines, perhaps because the user provided two test cases. But the actual code needs to read from stdin, which for the problem is one line per test case? Or is it multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is a list of test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the original problem is for a single test case. But in the sample input, the first input is 1, which outputs 5 numbers, and the second input is 5, which outputs 0. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is presented as two test cases. But the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the code should read a single integer m from stdin. But the sample input shows two lines, perhaps indicating that the code should read multiple test cases. But the original problem's input description says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is showing two separate test cases. For example, the first test case is m=1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second test case is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut the code needs to read one line of input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one m per run. But the sample shows two test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is not in the standard format, but the actual code should read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m. So the sample input is perhaps for two separate test cases. But the code should read one m from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows ['1', '5'] which may be a list of test cases. But the code is supposed to process one m. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake. Or perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one m.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines, perhaps for two test cases. But the problem says that the input is only one line. So perhaps the sample is written in a way that the first input is 1, and the output is the first line, and then the second input is 5 and output is 0. So the code is supposed to process one m at a time.\n\nTherefore, the code should read one integer m from stdin.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So in the code, read m as input().strip().\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is '1', and the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. The second input is '5' and output is '0'.\n\nSo the code should process one m per run. So the code reads m from stdin, processes it, and outputs the answer.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead m as int(input()).\n\nBut then, how to handle the sample input? Well, perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one test case.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement count_zeros(n) as a helper function.\n\nImplement find_lower(m) as a binary search function.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nThen, for the given m:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlower = find_lower(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper = find_lower(m+1)\n    k = upper - lower\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, [lower + i for i in range(k)])))\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, the code would output 5 and the numbers 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if upper - lower is 5?\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test for m=5.\n\nlower = find_lower(5) → returns 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. lower is 25, count_zeros(25) is 6. upper is find_lower(7) → which is 30. upper - lower is 5. So output is 5 numbers.\n\nNow, what about m=0? Well, the problem says m starts from 1.\n\nNow, edge case when m=0 is not considered.\n\nAnother edge case: m=2. Let's see.\n\nBut code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nBut the code should handle it.\n\nNow, what about when m is such that there are multiple numbers. For example, m=2.\n\nBut the code will generate 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the upper is 5*m+1? Well, the binary search for find_lower(m) uses high=5*m. But is that sufficient?\n\nFor example, let's take m=1. 5*m=5, which is the correct lower.\n\nBut for m=25, the lower is 100?\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(100) = 24 + 4 = 28? Wait, no. Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(100) = 100//5 = 20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0. So total 24. So for m=24, the lower is 100?\n\nBut 100//5 is 20, 20+4=24. So yes.\n\nBut for m=24, the lower is 100. Then upper is find_lower(25). Let's compute what is the first n with count >=25.\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. total 25. So the first n is 105. So upper is 105. So the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. Which is 5 numbers. So the code works.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what if m=25? Then lower is find_lower(25) → which is 105. count_zeros(105) is 25. Then upper is find_lower(26). Let's compute for m=26.\n\ncount_zeros(105) is 25. count_zeros(109) is same. count_zeros(110) is 110//5=22, 110//25=4, 110//125=0. total 26. So upper is 110. upper - lower is 5. So numbers 105-109. Correct.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin. So:\n\nRead m as int(input()).\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nBut the code handles m=0 as well, but according to the problem statement, it's not required.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for some m, the high in find_lower(m) is 5*m. But for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut what if the actual n is larger than 5*m? For example, let's say m=1e5. What's the actual n?\n\nWell, the number of trailing zeros for n is approximately n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... which is roughly n/4. So for m=1e5, n is roughly 4*1e5 = 4e5. But 5*m is 5e5, which is larger than 4e5. So the binary search is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut when m is 0, but according to the problem statement, m is >=1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut what if m is 0?\n\nBut the code will process it. However, the problem says that m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the valid range of `n` values using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Use binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `m`. This helps in determining the lower bound of valid `n` values.\n3. **Check Validity**: Once the lower bound is found, check if it indeed results in exactly `m` trailing zeros. If not, there are no valid `n` values.\n4. **Determine Upper Bound**: Find the upper bound by determining the smallest integer where the trailing zeros exceed `m`, then adjust to get the valid range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lower = find_lower(m)\n    if count_zeros(lower) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper = find_lower(m + 1)\n        k = upper - lower\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, [lower + i for i in range(k)])))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by increasing powers of 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_lower Function**: This uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `m`. The search space is between 0 and `5*m` which is a safe upper bound.\n3. **Main Function**: Reads the input value `m`, determines the lower bound using `find_lower`, checks if this bound is valid, and computes the upper bound. If valid, it prints the count of valid `n` values and the values themselves.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `n` using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `m` up to 100,000.",
