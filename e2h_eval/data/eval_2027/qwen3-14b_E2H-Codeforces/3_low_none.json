Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l.\n\nHmm. So the problem is about covering the entire interval [0, l] with the ranges of the lanterns. Each lantern covers a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). But since the street is from 0 to l, we need to make sure that even the ends are covered.\n\nFirst, I think the approach is to sort the lantern positions. Because if they are sorted, we can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum required d for those gaps. Also, we have to consider the beginning and the end of the street.\n\nWait, right. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position minus d must be covered. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nLet me think. Let's take the example given. In the second sample input, n=2, l=5, and the lanterns are at 2 and 5. The first lantern covers up to 2 + d. The second covers from 5 - d. To cover the entire street, the end of the first lantern's coverage must reach at least the start of the second's coverage. But in this case, the first lantern's coverage is [2-d, 2+d], and the second is [5-d, 5+d]. But since the street ends at 5, the second lantern's coverage needs to reach at least 5. Wait, but the second lantern is at 5. So its coverage is from 5-d to 5+d. But since the street ends at 5, the part that matters is up to 5. So the left end of the second lantern's coverage is 5-d. But the previous lantern's coverage ends at 2 + d. So the gap between 2+d and 5-d must be covered. Wait, but if the two lanterns are at 2 and 5, then the maximum gap between them is (5 - 2) = 3. So the maximum distance between two consecutive lanterns is 3. Then the required d for that gap is half of that, which is 1.5. But wait, in the sample input, the answer is 2.0. Oh, because the first lantern is at 2, and the second at 5. The first lantern's coverage must reach up to 5. But the first lantern's coverage is 2 +d. So to reach 5, 2 +d >=5 → d >=3. But the second lantern's coverage starts at 5 -d. So for the street to be covered, the first lantern's coverage must reach the second lantern's coverage. Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to model this is: after sorting the lantern positions, we need to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each such gap, the maximum distance between two consecutive lanterns is (current - previous). The minimal d required for that gap is (current - previous)/2. Because if you have two lanterns at positions a and b (a < b), then the middle point between them is (a + b)/2. The distance from each lantern to that middle point is (b - a)/2. So the minimal d for that gap is (b -a)/2. However, this is only if the gap is between two lanterns. But also, the first lantern's position may not be 0, so the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is (a1 - 0), and the required d for that is a1. Similarly, for the last lantern, the distance from the last lantern to l is (l - a_n). So the required d for that is (l - a_n). \n\nSo the overall minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- (a1 - 0) → but wait, no. Because the first lantern's coverage is from (a1 -d) to (a1 +d). So to cover the start of the street (0), we need that a1 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. But if the first lantern is at a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1, so d needs to be at least a1. Similarly, for the last lantern, the distance from the last lantern to l is l - a_n, so d must be at least that.\n\nBut then for the gaps between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns is (current - previous). For that, the required d is (current - previous)/2. Because if you have two lanterns at positions a and b",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the minimum radius `d` required for lanterns to cover an entire street, we must consider both the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street. Here's the structured solution:\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**:\n   - Sorting helps in sequentially analyzing the gaps between each pair of adjacent lanterns.\n\n2. **Check Edge Cases**:\n   - The first lantern might not be at the start (0), so we need to ensure it covers from 0.\n   - Similarly, the last lantern may not be at the end (`l`), so we need to ensure it covers up to `l`.\n\n3. **Compute Maximum Gap Between Consecutive Lanterns**:\n   - For each pair of adjacent lanterns, calculate the distance between them.\n   - The minimal `d` needed to cover this gap is half of that distance since the light must reach the midpoint between two lanterns.\n\n4. **Compute the Result**:\n   - The required radius `d` is the maximum among:\n     - Distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n     - Distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n     - Half the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    n, l = map(int, data[0].split())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_gap = 0.0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i - 1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    \n    d = 0.0\n    if n == 0:\n        d = l / 2.0\n    else:\n        d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n        d = max(d, max_gap / 2.0)\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation**\n\n- **Sorting**: Ensures that all lanterns are processed in order.\n- **Edge Coverage**: `a[0]` and `l - a[-1]` account for the coverage at the beginning and end of the street.\n- **Gap Coverage**: The largest gap between two consecutive lanterns requires the most `d` to cover the middle point.\n- **Precision**: The output is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the required precision constraint.\n\nThis approach ensures correctness and efficiency, handling all edge cases including when there is only one lantern or multiple lanterns at the same position.",
