    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Hmm. Oh right, the triangle inequality must hold. For a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe there's a way to simplify this.\n\nWait, the problem says x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z. Wait, no. Let me think again. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y starts from B and goes up to C, and z starts from C up to D. But when considering the triangle, the sides are x, y, z. But since x ≤ B ≤ y, then x ≤ y. And y ≤ C ≤ z, so y ≤ z. Therefore, the three sides are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z. So for the triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest. So x + y > z. Because z is the largest side.\n\nSo the main condition is x + y > z. Because if that holds, then the other inequalities (x + z > y, y + z > x) will automatically hold since z is the largest. So the key is to count all triples (x, y, z) where A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D, and x + y > z.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently given the constraints? Because the numbers can be up to 5e5, so O(N^3) is impossible. Need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me break it down. For each possible z, find the number of (x, y) pairs such that x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y > z. Then sum over all z in [C, D].\n\nBut even that approach may not be efficient enough. Let's think about the ranges. Let me first precompute the possible ranges for x and y. Since x is between A and B, and y between B and C. So for each z, we need to find the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > z.\n\nBut how can I calculate that quickly?\n\nAlternatively, for each z, the minimal value of x + y is A + B (since x ≥ A and y ≥ B). The maximum x + y is B + C (since x ≤ B and y ≤ C). So for a given z, if z is less than A + B, then all possible (x, y) pairs are valid. If z is larger than B + C, then there are none. Otherwise, for z in [A+B, B+C], we need to find the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > z.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\nTotal = sum_{z = C}^D [count_pairs(z)]\n\nWhere count_pairs(z) is the number of (x, y) pairs with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nNow, how to compute count_pairs(z)?\n\nLet me think of x and y as variables. For each z, we can find the number of pairs (x, y) where x + y > z. Let me think about the possible values of x and y.\n\nSince x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let me consider that for fixed x, what is the minimum y that satisfies y > z - x. Since y must be ≥ B, and also ≥ (z - x + 1) (since x + y > z => y > z - x).\n\nBut since y is in [B, C], for each x, the valid y's are those in [max(B, z - x + 1), C]. But since y can't exceed C, the number of valid y's for a given x is max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nBut calculating this for every x and every z would be O(B * (D - C + 1)), which could be up to 5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWe need a better approach. Let's think of the problem as for each z, find the number of pairs (x, y) where x ∈ [A,B], y ∈ [B,C], and x + y > z.\n\nLet me denote the range for x as X = [A, B], and for y as Y = [B, C]. The total number of pairs is (B -",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key insight is that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side. Given the constraints, we can efficiently compute the valid triangles by iterating through possible values of $z$ and counting valid $(x, y)$ pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints on Sides**: The sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ are constrained such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. This ensures $x \\leq y \\leq z$.\n2. **Triangle Inequality**: For a valid triangle, the sum of the two smaller sides ($x + y$) must be greater than the largest side ($z$).\n3. **Efficient Counting**: For each possible value of $z$ in the range $[C, D]$, determine the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs such that $x + y > z$.
