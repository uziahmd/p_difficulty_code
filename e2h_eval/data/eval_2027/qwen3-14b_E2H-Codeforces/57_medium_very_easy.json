His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores of all participants, but they are not linked to names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each participant has exactly one a and one b, right? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, there's a first tour score and a second tour score. But the input gives two lists: the first list is the first tour scores for all participants, and the second list is the second tour scores for all participants. But the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i corresponds to which b_j. So, for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but the pairing between a and b is unknown. However, the actual pairing is fixed (each participant has one a and one b), but since the teacher doesn't know which is which, we have to consider all possible pairings. But wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but they are in arbitrary order. So the actual participants have their first and second tour scores, but the lists are not matched. So, for example, participant 1 has a1 in first tour and some b in second tour. But the teacher has the a's and b's as separate lists, but doesn't know which a and b belong to which participant. So, when considering Vasya's possible positions, we can choose any pairing of a and b, as long as each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa. But since the problem says that Vasya is present, there exists at least one pairing where some a_i + b_j >= x. \n\nBut our task is to find the best and worst possible rank Vasya could have. For that, we need to consider all possible pairings of the a and b arrays, and for each possible pairing, compute Vasya's total (which is a_i + b_j for some i and j, but in the actual pairing, each participant has exactly one a and one b). However, since we can arrange the pairings to maximize or minimize Vasya's rank, we need to find the best and worst possible scenarios.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because for the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he is as high as possible) and arrange others' totals to be as low as possible. But actually, no. Wait, the best possible rank for Vasya is when his total is as high as possible, and others' totals are as low as possible. But since the pairing is arbitrary, we can choose the pairing that gives Vasya the highest possible total, and arrange other pairings such that as many people as possible have lower totals than him. Similarly, for the worst possible rank, we want to minimize his total (but it must be at least x) and arrange others to have higher totals.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet me think again. The problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the actual total could be any value >=x. However, the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya, considering all possible pairings of a and b, such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is at least x. But the problem says that it's guaranteed that such a pairing exists.\n\nSo, for the best possible position, we want to select a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible. Then, in that scenario, the number of people who have a higher total than him is minimized. For the worst possible position, we want to select a pairing where Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange others' totals to be as high as possible so that as many people as possible have higher totals than him.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the best case first.\n\nBest case scenario: We need to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible. Then, the best possible rank is 1 if there's no one with a higher total. But how to find the maximum possible total for Vasya? Well, since the pairing is arbitrary, the maximum possible total for Vasya would be the maximum a_i + b_j. But since each participant has exactly one a and one b, but we can choose the pairing. Wait, no. Wait, for the best case, we can assign to Vasya the maximum a_i and maximum b_j. Because if we pair the maximum a with the maximum b, then that's the maximum possible sum. However, this might not be possible because once we pair those two, other pairings have to be done. But for the purpose of determining the best possible rank for Vasya, we can assume that he has the maximum possible sum, and others are arranged in a way that as few as possible have higher sums than him.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you pair the a and b arrays, you have to have a bijection between them. So, for example, if you take the maximum a and maximum b for Vasya, then the rest of the pairings would be the other a's and b's. However, perhaps that's not the optimal way. But for the best possible rank, the way to maximize Vasya's sum is to pair the maximum a with maximum b, but perhaps that's not the only way. But regardless, the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have is the maximum of a_i + b_j, where each a_i and b_j can be used once. Wait, but how to find that? Oh, but if we are allowed to choose any pairing, then the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. Because in the pairing, we can pair the maximum a with maximum b, and others can be paired in any way. So for the best case scenario, we can take that maximum sum, and then count how many other participants have a sum that is greater than or equal to that. Wait, but no. Because when we pair a_i with b_j, the other participants' sums depend on the pairing. So, for the best possible scenario, we want to maximize Vasya's sum and minimize the number of people with higher sums. How can we do that?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and that others are arranged in a way that as few as possible have a higher sum. For example, if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then others can't have higher than that. So, the best possible rank is 1. Wait, but maybe there are multiple people with the same sum. For example, if another participant has a sum equal to Vasya's, then depending on the jury's choice, Vasya could be ranked first or last among them. But since the problem says that in case of ties, the jury can assign places as they like. Therefore, for the best possible case, we can assume that Vasya is placed first, even if others have the same sum. For the worst possible case, we can assume that he is placed last among those with the same sum.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, we can take the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, and then count how many people have a sum strictly greater than that. Then, the best rank is that count plus 1. But since the jury can arrange ties in favor of Vasya, the best possible rank is 1 if there's at least one possible pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum. But how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nTo find the best possible rank:\n\nWe can choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible. Then, in that scenario, the best rank is 1 (if there are no others with higher sum) or depends on how many others have higher sums.\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. Since we can pair the a's and b's in any way, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j, but under the condition that the rest of the pairs are possible. However, since we can choose any pairing, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is indeed the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. Because we can pair the max a with max b, and the rest can be paired in any way. So, the maximum possible sum is max_a + max_b.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the others to have as high as possible sums. But how to find that?\n\nSo, for the best rank:\n\nThe best possible scenario is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible. Let's say that sum is S. Then, the best possible rank is the number of participants whose sum is strictly greater than S plus 1. But how do we compute how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than S?\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the pairing is chosen such that Vasya's sum is S, and others are paired in a way that as many as possible have sum less than or equal to S. But since the pairing is arbitrary, perhaps we can arrange others' sums to be as small as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, the minimal possible number of people with sum > S is zero. Because if S is the maximum possible, then no one else can have a higher sum. Because in that case, the maximum sum of others would be the next possible sum.\n\nWait, but when you pair the max a with max b, the other pairs can be arranged in a way that others have lower sums. So, for example, if someone else's a_i is max_a, but paired with a smaller b_j, then their sum is smaller than max_a + max_b. So, in this case, the best possible rank for Vasya is 1.\n\nBut wait, what if there are other pairs that can have the same sum as S? For example, suppose there's another a_i and b_j that sum to the same S. Then, the jury can assign Vasya to be first. So, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But that's not always the case. For example, in the first sample input, all participants have a_i=1 and b_i=1, so their sum is 2. So, Vasya's sum is 2. Then, the best possible rank is 1 (if the jury assigns him first), and the worst possible is 5 (if he is last). So the output is 1 5.\n\nBut how to determine when the best possible rank is 1. Because if there's a way to make Vasya's sum the maximum, then best is 1. But how to check if that's possible.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j. But how to find that. For example, if we have a_i and b_j sorted. Let's say we sort a in descending order, and b in descending order. Then, the maximum possible sum is a[0] + b[0]. So, in that case, the best possible scenario is that Vasya's sum is that maximum. Then, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut how to find the best possible rank. Because in that scenario, the other participants could have sum less than or equal to that maximum. So, the number of people with sum strictly greater than that maximum is zero. Hence, best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But wait, what if there are multiple pairs that can give the same maximum sum. For example, if there are two different pairs (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) that sum to the same maximum. Then, in the best case, the jury can assign Vasya to be first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, in general, the best possible rank is 1. But that's not correct. Because what if Vasya's sum is not the maximum possible. Wait, but in the best scenario, we can choose the pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. So, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the note in the first sample. Because in the first sample, all participants have sum 2. So, the best possible rank is 1. Which matches the sample output. So the conclusion is that the best possible rank is always 1. But that can't be right. What if there's a situation where even the maximum possible sum for Vasya is not enough to be the best?\n\nNo, because the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum possible among all possible pairings. So, if there's a way to have his sum be the maximum, then the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1. But why does the second sample have output 1 for the best? Let's check the second sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n6 7\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nSo, the best possible scenario is when Vasya's sum is 6+8=14? Or perhaps 6+8=14. Then, others can't have more than that. So, best rank is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, according to this reasoning, the best possible rank is always 1. But why is the first sample's output 1 for best? Because yes. So, why does the problem even ask for the best possible rank? Because perhaps there are cases where even when you choose the maximum sum for Vasya, there's someone else with the same sum. But the jury can assign him first. So, the best possible rank is 1. So, in all cases, the best possible rank is 1?\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. Wait, what if there are n participants, and Vasya's maximum possible sum is the same as others. For example, suppose there are two participants, and both can have sum 10. Then, the best possible rank is 1 (since the jury can assign him first), and worst is 2.\n\nSo, according to this, the best possible rank is always 1. So why does the problem ask us to compute it? Because maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But in the best case scenario, we can choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya. However, perhaps there is no pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum. Wait, but how? For example, if the a and b arrays are such that the maximum possible sum is achieved by pairing a certain a_i and b_j, but in that case, the rest of the pairings are done in a way that someone else could have a higher sum. No, that's impossible. Because if we pair the max a with max b, then the sum is the maximum possible. Any other pairing would have a sum less than or equal to that. Because for example, if you pair the max a with a lower b, then the sum would be less than max a + max b. Similarly, if you pair the max b with a lower a. So, the maximum possible sum is indeed the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. And thus, in that scenario, there is no one else with a higher sum than that. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is always 1. Therefore, the first part of the output is always 1. But why in the sample input it's 1? Because that's correct. So, the first output is 1. Then, why does the problem even ask for it? Maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let's think of a case where the best possible rank is not 1. Suppose that the maximum sum for Vasya is 10, but there are other participants who can have sum 10. However, in the pairing, if you pair a_i with b_j to get 10, but there are multiple ways to do that. But since the jury can arrange the ranks, Vasya can be placed first. So, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, in all cases, the best possible rank is 1. Therefore, the answer for the best is always 1. That seems to be the case. But then why is the problem asking for it? Maybe the problem is not that straightforward. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. So, in the best case scenario, the teacher can choose any pairing where Vasya's total is >=x. But the best possible rank is when his total is as high as possible. So, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j, which is the sum of the maximum a and maximum b. But if that sum is less than x, then it's impossible. But the problem says that it is guaranteed that there exists at least one pairing where a_i + b_j >=x. So, the maximum sum is at least x.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1. Therefore, the first part of the output is always 1. But why in the sample input the output is 1 for the first case. Which matches.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to finding the worst possible rank. So, the main challenge is to compute the worst possible rank.\n\nNow, for the worst possible rank, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the others' pairings to have as many as possible sums higher than Vasya's.\n\nSo, how to model this?\n\nLet me think. For the worst possible case, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is the minimal possible (but >=x) and arrange the other pairings to maximize the number of participants with sum > Vasya's sum.\n\nBut how to find that minimal possible sum? Well, since Vasya's sum must be >=x, the minimal possible sum is x (but perhaps not achievable). However, the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where Vasya's sum is >=x. So, the minimal possible sum is the minimal value s such that s >=x and there exists a pairing where s is Vasya's sum.\n\nBut how to find that minimal possible s. However, for the worst case scenario, we need to choose the minimal possible s (so that others can have higher sums). But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst case scenario is when Vasya's sum is exactly x. But even if that's not possible, perhaps the minimal possible sum is the minimal possible value that is >=x.\n\nBut how to find that. However, perhaps the worst case scenario is determined by choosing the minimal possible sum for Vasya (>=x), and then count the number of participants that can have a sum higher than that. But how to compute that.\n\nBut how to model the pairing for the worst case. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nFor the worst case, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but >=x). Let's say that sum is s. Then, we want as many other participants as possible to have a sum higher than s. To maximize the number of people with higher sums, we need to pair the a and b arrays in a way that as many as possible have a_i + b_j > s.\n\nBut how to find this s. However, perhaps the worst possible scenario occurs when Vasya's sum is exactly x. But even if x is not achievable, we can choose the minimal possible sum that is >=x.\n\nBut how to find that minimal sum. However, perhaps the minimal possible sum is x, but in reality, the minimal possible sum is the minimal possible value that can be achieved by some pairing. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case scenario, we can choose Vasya's sum to be the minimal possible value that is >=x. Let's call this value s_min. Once we have s_min, we can compute how many other participants can have a sum higher than s_min. The worst rank would be that number plus 1.\n\nBut how to compute s_min. Well, since Vasya's sum can be any a_i + b_j (as long as there's a pairing where that is possible). But since the pairing must be a bijection between a and b, how do we find the minimal s such that there exists a pairing where at least one pair is s (and the rest are other pairs).\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps we can think of the worst case scenario as follows:\n\nWe need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and arrange other pairings so that as many as possible have higher sums than Vasya's.\n\nBut how to model this. Perhaps the way to maximize the number of people with higher sum than Vasya is to maximize the number of pairs (a_i + b_j) > s, where s is Vasya's sum.\n\nSo, for the worst case, we can think of the following steps:\n\nFind the minimal possible s (s >=x) such that there exists a pairing where one of the pairs is s, and the rest are arranged in a way that as many as possible pairs have sum > s.\n\nBut how to find this s. Alternatively, perhaps the worst case scenario is when Vasya's sum is the minimal possible s >=x, and then the number of other participants that can have sum >s is the maximum possible.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the worst case:\n\nWe need to find the minimal s >=x such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s. Then, for that s, find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s. Then, the worst possible rank is that number +1.\n\nBut how to find s and that number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by the following: for each possible s >=x, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s, given that there's a pairing where one of the pairs is s. Then, take the maximum over all s >=x of (number of participants with sum >s) +1.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive. However, perhaps there's a way to find the worst possible rank by considering that for the worst case, we want to maximize the number of people with sum >s, where s is Vasya's sum (>=x). To do that, we need to choose s as small as possible (so that more people can have higher sums than s). But how to find the minimal s >=x.\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible s >=x that can be achieved by some pairing.\n\nBut this seems tricky. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me think about the worst case scenario. For that, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but >=x), and arrange the rest of the pairs to maximize the number of people with sum > s.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nLet me think of the following. Suppose that we can choose any a_i and b_j for Vasya, such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, for the rest of the pairs, we want as many as possible to have sum > (a_i + b_j).\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of such pairs.\n\nBut since the rest of the pairs are a permutation of the remaining a's and b's, perhaps the way to maximize the number of pairs with sum >s is to pair the largest possible a's with the largest possible b's, except for the ones used for Vasya's pair.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to model the worst case scenario:\n\nWe can think that for the worst case, we want to choose Vasya's sum to be the minimal possible s >=x, and then for the rest of the pairs, we want to maximize the number of pairs with sum >s.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s >=x.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal s is x. However, it's possible that x is not achievable. For example, if the minimal possible sum is x+1.\n\nBut the problem states that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So, the minimal s is the minimal possible value that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (i,j) in the a and b arrays.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal s is x. However, if there is no pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j =x, then the minimal s is the minimal value greater than x that can be achieved by some pair.\n\nBut this seems complex. However, perhaps we can proceed as follows: for the worst case scenario, we can assume that Vasya's sum is exactly x. If that's possible, then we can proceed. Otherwise, we take the minimal s >=x that can be achieved.\n\nBut how to check if there's a pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j =x. However, since the problem says that there is at least one pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >=x, but we don't know if there's a pair with exactly x.\n\nBut for the worst case scenario, we can take the minimal possible s >=x. Let's say that s is the minimal possible value that is >=x. Then, the worst case rank is determined by the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed with sum >s, given that one of the pairs is s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAnother approach: to find the worst possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is s, which is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Then, the worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than s, plus 1.\n\nBut how to compute the number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than s. However, since the pairing is arbitrary, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed with sum >s, given that one of the pairs is s (Vasya's).\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, think of it this way: for the worst case scenario, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible (but >=x), and then arrange the remaining a's and b's to form as many pairs as possible with sum > (a_i + b_j).\n\nThe maximum number of such pairs would be the maximum number of pairs possible with sum >s, given that we have to use all the a's and b's except for the ones used in the chosen pair for Vasya.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the first sample input:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1], b = [1,1,1,1,1].\n\nThe minimal s >=x is 2. Now, for the rest of the pairs, we can have all other pairs sum to 2. So, the number of participants with sum >s is 0. Hence, the worst possible rank is 0 + 1 = 1. But the sample output says 5. Wait, that contradicts. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, no. Because the sample output for the first case is 1 5. So the worst possible rank is 5. Which suggests that the previous reasoning is incorrect.\n\nSo, in that case, the worst possible rank is 5. How is that possible? Because in that case, the sum of all participants is 2. So, everyone has sum 2. Hence, the jury can assign Vasya to be last. Hence, the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nSo, the previous reasoning was wrong. The problem is that in the worst case scenario, the number of people with sum strictly greater than s is zero. But since all have the same sum, the worst possible rank is n (the number of participants). Hence, the worst possible rank is the number of people with sum >s plus the number of people with sum equal to s (but Vasya is placed last among them).\n\nSo, the formula for the worst possible rank is: (number of people with sum >s) + (number of people with sum ==s) (but since Vasya is one of them, and placed last among them) => the worst possible rank is (number of people with sum >s) + 1 (since Vasya is placed after all those with sum >s and after all those with sum ==s, but since the jury can arrange the ties, he can be placed last among the equals).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is determined by:\n\nFor a given s (Vasya's sum), the worst possible rank is the number of participants that have a sum strictly greater than s, plus the number of participants (including Vasya) that have sum equal to s, but since the jury can arrange the ties to put Vasya last, the worst rank is (count_greater) + count_equal.\n\nBut how to compute count_greater and count_equal.\n\nBut how to find s and count_greater and count_equal.\n\nBut how to find s. For the worst case scenario, we need to choose s as small as possible (>=x), and then maximize the count_greater + count_equal.\n\nBut how.\n\nThis seems very complex. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me think of the worst possible scenario as follows: we want to maximize the number of people who have sum > s, where s is Vasya's sum (>=x). To do that, we should choose s as small as possible, so that more people can have sum >s.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s >=x. Once s is chosen, then the maximum number of people with sum >s is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the a and b arrays (excluding one pair that sums to s) with sum >s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s >=x. Well, the minimal s is the minimal value such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum s >=x. This s can be found by checking all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) and taking the minimal one that is >=x.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, checking all pairs would be O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For the worst case scenario, the minimal s is x. But if there is no pair with sum x, then it's the minimal possible sum that is >=x.\n\nBut how to find this s.\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case scenario, we can assume that Vasya's sum is exactly x. But if that's not possible, then we need to find the minimal s >=x that can be achieved. However, for the purposes of the problem, perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that s is x, and then adjust accordingly.\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >x, given that one of the pairs is x.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the worst case:\n\nWe need to select one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. Let's call this pair (a_i, b_j) as Vasya's. Then, for the rest of the pairs, we want to maximize the number of pairs with sum > (a_i + b_j).\n\nBut since the rest of the pairs are formed from the remaining a's and b's, the maximum number of pairs with sum > s (where s = a_i + b_j) is determined by how we pair the remaining elements.\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs with sum >s, we can sort the remaining a's in descending order and the remaining b's in ascending order, and pair the largest a with the smallest b, etc. Or wait, perhaps the opposite. Let me think.\n\nWait, to maximize the number of pairs with sum >s, we can use a greedy approach. Sort the remaining a's in descending order and the remaining b's in descending order. Then, pair the largest a with the largest b, next largest with next largest, etc. This way, the sums are as large as possible, maximizing the number of pairs exceeding s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a two-pointer approach. For example, sort the remaining a's and b's in descending order, then for each a_i, find the smallest b_j that when paired with a_i gives sum >s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nBut regardless, the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >s from the remaining a and b arrays is what we need to find. Let's call this number 'cnt'. Then, the worst possible rank would be cnt + 1 (if there are no other pairs equal to s) or cnt + (number of pairs equal to s) + 1 (depending on whether other pairs equal to s exist).\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the worst case scenario as follows:\n\nTo maximize the number of people with sum >s, we need to pair the remaining a's and b's in such a way that as many as possible of them have sum >s. The way to do this is to pair the largest a's with the largest b's. Because this maximizes the sum of each pair. So, for the remaining a's and b's, after removing one a_i and one b_j (for Vasya's pair), we can sort the remaining a's in descending order, sort the remaining b's in descending order, and then pair them in order. For each pair, check if the sum is >s. Count how many such pairs there are.\n\nBut how to find the best s for this.\n\nBut how to find the best s. Since s is the sum of a_i + b_j >=x. And we want to choose the s as small as possible (so that more pairs can be >s).\n\nBut again, how to find this s.\n\nPerhaps the approach is:\n\nFor the worst case scenario:\n\n- Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) that have sum >=x. For each such pair, compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining a's and b's with sum > (a_i + b_j). Then, the worst possible rank is (max_count) + 1. But since we want the worst possible rank, we need to choose the pair (a_i, b_j) that gives the maximum (max_count) + 1. However, this would be computationally expensive for large n.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, checking all possible pairs is impossible. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: To find the worst possible rank, we can think of the following:\n\nAssume that Vasya's sum is s. To maximize the number of people with sum >s, we want s to be as small as possible. So, we should choose s to be the minimal possible sum >=x. Once s is chosen, we need to find the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining a's and b's with sum >s.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s >=x.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s >=x. This is equivalent to finding the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. Once we find this minimal s, then the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining a's and b's with sum >s is what we need to compute.\n\nBut how to find this minimal s.\n\nBut for large n, this is challenging. However, perhaps we can use binary search. For example, find the minimal s >=x such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum s. But how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, since the minimal s is the minimal value >=x that can be formed by any pair of a_i and b_j, we can find this by taking the minimal between all pairs that are >=x. However, again, for large n, this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think: for the minimal s >=x, it's the minimal possible sum of any pair. But since we need it to be >=x, the minimal s is the minimal value between x and the minimal possible sum of a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nWait, but how to find this minimal s.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nSort the a array in ascending order, and the b array in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s would be the minimal of all such a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nYes! For example, we can sort a and b. For each a_i in a, we can perform a binary search in b for the smallest value that is >= (x - a_i). The sum would be a_i + b_j. We can collect all these possible sums and take the minimal one.\n\nBut this would give us the minimal possible s >=x, which is the minimal possible sum that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). This would be our s.\n\nOnce we have this s, then we need to find the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining a's and b's (after removing a_i and b_j) with sum >s.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, but the problem is that after selecting a particular pair (a_i, b_j) that gives sum s, we need to remove them from the a and b",
