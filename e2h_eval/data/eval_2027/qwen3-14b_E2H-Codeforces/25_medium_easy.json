При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap has to be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part must be a positive number of characters, but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where the entire message is overlapped) is not considered an error. Similarly, just appending without overlapping isn't considered an error either.\n\nThe task is to check if such a scenario is possible, and if so, output \"YES\" and a possible s. Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the merged string t must be formed by two copies of s overlapping. Let me think: the total length of t would be len(s) + len(s) - k, where k is the length of the overlapping part. Since k is between 1 and len(s)-1.\n\nSo, for example, if the original s is of length L, then the merged string t has length 2L - k, where 1 ≤ k < L. Therefore, the length of t must be between L+1 (when k= L-1) and 2L-1 (when k=1). But since L can vary, perhaps we can find possible values of L.\n\nBut how do we find possible L?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that the original s has length L. Then the merged t must have length equal to 2L - k, where 1 ≤ k < L. So, 2L - k = len(t). Let me rearrange this. Let me denote len(t) as T.\n\nSo, T = 2L -k. Since k is between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\nFor k=1: T = 2L -1 → L = (T +1)/2.\n\nFor k=L-1: T = 2L - (L-1) = L +1 → L = T -1.\n\nSo, possible L's are in the range from T - (L-1) ? Wait, maybe I should think of possible L values. For each possible L, we can check if there exists a k such that T = 2L -k, with 1 ≤k < L. Let's rearrange:\n\nk = 2L - T.\n\nBut since 1 ≤ k < L, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - T < L.\n\nLet me solve for L.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L - T ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ T +1 → L ≥ (T +1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L - T < L → 2L - T < L → L < T.\n\nSo combining both inequalities, L must satisfy (T+1)/2 ≤ L < T.\n\nBut L must be an integer. Also, since the original s has length L, and the merged string is t, which has length T. Also, note that T must be at least 2 (since for example, if s is length 1, then k must be 1, but that's not allowed since k must be less than L (which is 1), but then k can't be 1. So for s of length 1, it's impossible. So for the problem, the possible L's are those where (T+1)/2 ≤ L < T.\n\nBut also, since the original s is of length L, and the merged string is formed by overlapping two s's. So for each possible L in that range, we need to check whether the first L -k characters of the first s and the last L -k characters of the second s match. Wait, no. Wait, the overlapping part is k characters. So the first s ends with some k characters that are the same as the first k characters of the second s. So when they are merged, the overlapping part is k characters. So the total merged string is s concatenated with s, but overlapping the last k characters of the first s with the first k of the second s. So the merged string would be s[0 ... L -k -1] + s[L -k ... ] + s[k ... ] ?\n\nWait, perhaps more clearly: if two copies of s are merged with an overlap of k characters, then the merged string is s + s[k:]. Because the first s is of length L, and the second s starts from position k. So the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k, which matches.\n\nSo the merged string t must be equal to s + s[k:]. Therefore, for a given possible L, we can check for possible k values (from 1 to L-1) whether the first part of t (the first L -k characters) plus the rest of the s (from k onwards) equals the entire t.\n\nBut how do we find k? Well, for a given L, the k is determined by the length of t. Because T = 2L -k → k = 2L - T. Since T is fixed, once we choose L, k is determined.\n\nSo for each possible L in the range (T+1)/2 ≤ L < T, we can compute k = 2L - T. Then check whether k is between 1 and L-1. Because for example, when L is in that range, then k would be 2L - T. Let's check if that's between 1 and L-1.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose T is 11, like in the first sample input 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (wait, the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is length 19? Or maybe I need to check the example again. Let me look at the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (probably length 19?), and the output is YES with s being 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Then T is 19. Let's compute for L=11. Then k = 2*11 - 19 = 22 -19 =3. So k is 3. Which is between 1 and 10 (L-1=10). So yes. Then the merged string would be s + s[3:]. So the original s is 11 letters. s[3:] is 8 letters. So total length 11 + 8 = 19, which matches. Then the merged string should be s concatenated with s[3:], which is the first s, then the part starting from index 3. So the overlapping part is 3 letters. So the first s ends with the first 3 letters of the second s. So for the merged string to be correct, the last k letters of s must be equal to the first k letters of s. Because when you merge, the overlapping part is the same. So in this case, the last 3 letters of s (which is 'bra') must be equal to the first 3 letters of s (which is 'abr')? No, that would not be the case. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, the overlapping is when the end of the first s and the start of the second s overlap. So the last k characters of the first s must equal the first k characters of the second s. Since both are s, the last k of s must equal the first k of s. So, for example, in the first sample, the s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). The first 3 letters are 'abr', the last 3 letters are 'bra'. Which are not the same. But the sample says that the merged string is possible. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, what's the sample input?\n\nWait, the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is the merged string. The output is 'abrakadabra' as s. Let me check the length. The original s is 11 letters. The merged string is 11 + 11 -k = 22 -k. The input is 19 letters. So 22 -k =19 →k=3. So the overlapping is 3 characters. So the last 3 characters of s must match the first 3 characters of s. Let's check. The original s is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nLast 3 letters: 'bra' (positions 8-10, assuming 0-based). First 3 letters: 'abr'. These are not equal. So why does the sample say that it's possible?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. How is the merged string formed?\n\nWhen two s's are merged with an overlap of k characters, the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:]. So the merged string would be s + s[k:]. So for the merged string to be equal to t, t must be equal to s + s[k:].\n\nIn the first sample, the merged string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (let me count the letters). Let me check the length. The sample output says that the original s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). The merged string is 11 + (11 -3) = 19 letters. Let's check the actual string.\n\nOriginal s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). The merged string is s + s[3:] → s[3:] is 'akadabra' (starts from index 3, which is 'a' (index 3?), let me check:\n\ns = 'abrakadabra'\n\nIndices 0-10:\n\n0:a, 1:b, 2:r, 3:a, 4:k, 5:a, 6:d, 7:a, 8:b, 9:r, 10:a.\n\nSo s[3:] is from index 3 to end: 'akadabra' (length 8). So s + s[3:] is 'abrakadabra' + 'akadabra' → which would be 'abrakadabraakadabra'? Wait, but the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (probably the first part is 'abrakadabra' followed by 'brakadabra'? How does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let me check the example given in the problem statement. The problem says that for two messages 'abrakadabra' sent, the merged message could be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' or 'abrakadabrakadabra'. The first case is overlapping by one character, the second by four. Let me check the first case. If the overlap is 1 character, then the merged string would be s + s[1:]. So the original s is 11 letters. s[1:] is 'brakadabra' (10 letters). So merged string is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. But the first sample input is 19 letters. So maybe that's a different example.\n\nWait, the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is the merged string. Let's count the letters. Let me write it out:\n\nabrakadabrabrakadabra\n\nBreaking into parts. The first part is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), then 'abrakadabra' (another 11 letters), but overlapping by 3 letters. So the merged string would be 11 + 11 -3 = 19 letters. So the merged string is 'abrakadabra' (original) + 'brakadabra' (from s[3:])? Wait, no. s[3:] is 'akadabra' (length 8). So the merged string would be 'abrakadabra' + 'akadabra' → which is 11 + 8 = 19 letters. Let's see:\n\nOriginal s: a b r a k a d a b r a (11 letters)\n\ns[3:] is a k a d a b r a (8 letters). So merged string is a b r a k a d a b r a a k a d a b r a → but that seems longer than 19 letters. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the length. Let me count the letters of the merged string.\n\nOriginal s is 11 letters. s[3:] is 8 letters. Total is 19 letters. So the merged string would be:\n\nOriginal s is abrakadabra (11 letters). Then adding the part from index 3 onwards (akadabra, 8 letters). So the merged string is abrakadabraakadabra. But the sample input is abrakadabrabrakadabra. Which is different. So why is that?\n\nAh, perhaps I have a misunderstanding of how the overlapping works. Maybe the merged string is formed by overlapping the end of the first s with the beginning of the second s. So for example, if the first s ends with 'x' and the second s starts with 'x', then the merged string would be s1 + s2[1:]. So the merged string would be s1 concatenated with s2 without the first character. But in that case, the merged string would be s1 + s2[1:], which for two copies of s would be s + s[1:]. So the merged string would be s concatenated with s[1:]. But in this case, the length is len(s) + len(s) -1 = 2L -1.\n\nBut in the sample input, the merged string is abrakadabrabrakadabra. Let me count the letters. Let me write it as:\n\nabrakadabrabrakadabra\n\nBreaking it down: Let's split it into two parts. The first part is abrakadabra (11 letters), then the next part is brakadabra (10 letters). So total length is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. But according to the sample input, the first input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which may have a length of 19? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters. Let me count:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → wait, that's 21 letters. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here. Let me check the sample input and output again.\n\nThe first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', and the output is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). The length of the input string would be len('abrakadabrabrakadabra').\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nabrakadabrabrakadabra\n\nLet me split into parts:\n\nabrakadabra (11 letters) + brakadabra (10 letters) → total 21 letters. But according to the sample input, the output is YES. But according to our earlier calculation, for L=11, T would be 2*11 -k. So T=22 -k. For example, if k=3, T=19. But if the input is 21 letters, then 22 -k =21 →k=1. So for k=1, the merged string would be s + s[1:]. Which is 11 + 10 =21 letters. And for that to be valid, the last 1 character of s must equal the first 1 character of s. The last character of s is 'a', and the first is 'a', so yes. So the merged string would be s + s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → which is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (21 letters). Which matches the sample input. But according to the problem's example, the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. So in that case, T is 21. Then possible L values are (T+1)/2 = (21+1)/2 = 11. So L must be >= 11, and less than T=21. So L can be 11, 12,...20.\n\nBut in this case, for L=11, k= 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. Which is between 1 and 10 (since L-1=10). So yes. Then the check is whether the last k characters of s (which is 'a') equals the first k characters of s (which is 'a'). So yes. Therefore, the merged string is valid. Hence, the output is YES and s is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nSo the problem is to find for any possible L in the range (T+1)/2 <= L < T, check if for k=2L-T, the last k characters of s (which is the first L characters of t) equals the first k characters of s. But how do we find s?\n\nWait, because the merged string t is s concatenated with s[k:]. So the entire t is s + s[k:]. Therefore, the first L characters of t must be s. And the remaining part (from L onwards) must be s[k:]. So for the entire t to be valid, the first L characters are s, and the rest of the string (from position L onwards) must be equal to s[k:].\n\nBut since s is the first L characters of t, we can check if the rest of the string (t[L:]) equals s[k:].\n\nSo for a given L, compute k = 2L - T. Then check if k is between 1 and L-1. Then check if the first L characters of t (call this candidate s) has its last k characters equal to the first k characters of s. Also, check if the rest of the string (t[L:]) equals s[k:].\n\nWait, but since s is the first L characters of t, then s[k:] is the substring from index k to the end of s. And the t[L:] must be equal to s[k:].\n\nSo for example, if t is s + s[k:], then t[L:] is s[k:].\n\nSo for a given L, the steps are:\n\n- Check if (T+1)/2 <= L < T. Also, since L must be an integer, we can loop through all possible L values in that range.\n\nFor each L:\n\n- Compute k = 2L - T. Check if k is between 1 and L-1. If not, skip this L.\n\n- Then, take s_candidate = t[0:L].\n\n- Check if the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate. Because when you merge, the overlapping part must match.\n\n- Also, check that the rest of the string (t[L:]) equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf both conditions are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nBut why do we need both checks?\n\nBecause the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. So the entire t must be equal to that. So t must be equal to s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:].\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nt[0:L] == s_candidate (which it is, since s_candidate is t[0:L]).\n\nt[L:] == s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut also, the overlapping part requires that the end of the first s_candidate (the last k characters) is the same as the start of the second s_candidate (the first k characters). Which is ensured by the fact that the merged string is formed by overlapping. However, if the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], then the overlapping part is automatically satisfied because the first s_candidate ends with s_candidate[-k:] and the second s_candidate starts with s_candidate[0:k]. So for the merged string to be correct, the overlapping part must have those two parts equal. However, when we check that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:], that implies that the s_candidate[k:] is the part after the overlapping. But how does that ensure the overlapping part is correct?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose that the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. Then, the first s_candidate is of length L. The second part is s_candidate[k:], which is of length L -k. So the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = T. Which matches. Now, the overlapping part is that the last k characters of the first s_candidate must be the same as the first k characters of the second s_candidate. But the second s_candidate is the same as the first, so the first k characters of the second s_candidate is s_candidate[0:k]. Therefore, the condition that the last k characters of the first s_candidate equals s_candidate[0:k] must be true. However, in the merged string, the t is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:]. So the first part is s_candidate, and the second part is s_candidate[k:]. Therefore, the entire t is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:], which would imply that the overlapping is correct. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because the overlapping is done by merging the two s_candidate strings. So the merged string is formed by taking the first s_candidate, and then the second s_candidate starting from position k. Therefore, the merged string is s_candidate[0 ... L -k -1] + s_candidate[L -k ... ] + s_candidate[k ... ]? No. Wait, the merged string is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:]. So the entire string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. But this is the same as taking the first s_candidate and then appending the part of the second s_candidate starting at index k. Which would only be possible if the last k characters of the first s_candidate are the same as the first k characters of the second s_candidate. Otherwise, the merged string would not be correct.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Because when you merge two s_candidate strings with an overlap of k characters, the overlapping part must match. However, the way we're checking is by checking that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]. But t is the merged string, which is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. Therefore, the t[L:] is s_candidate[k:], which is exactly what we check. However, this doesn't directly check the overlapping part. So why is that sufficient?\n\nBecause the merged string is formed by overlapping the two s_candidate's. So the first s_candidate is of length L. The second s_candidate is of length L. The overlapping is k characters. Therefore, the merged string is of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k. Which is T. So the merged string is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:]. Which is exactly the t string. Therefore, if t is equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], then the overlapping is correct. Because the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s_candidate and the first k characters of the second s_candidate. But since the second s_candidate is the same as the first, the first k characters of the second s_candidate is s_candidate[0:k], and the last k of the first is s_candidate[-k:]. For the merged string to be correct, these two must be equal. However, when we check that t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], that implies that the overlapping is correct. Because the merged string is formed by overlapping. So perhaps checking that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:] is sufficient, because that ensures that the part after the first L characters is exactly the part of s_candidate starting at k. Which would only be possible if the overlapping is correct.\n\nBut how? Let me take an example. Suppose s_candidate is 'ababa', and k is 2. Then the merged string would be 'ababa' + 'aba' (s_candidate[k:] is 'aba'). The merged string would be 'ababaaba'. But the overlapping part is the last 2 characters of the first s_candidate ('ba') and the first 2 of the second s_candidate ('ab'), which are not equal. However, the merged string is 'ababaaba' which is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. But this would not be a valid merged string according to the problem's rules, because the overlapping part would not match. However, according to our check, t[L:] would be 'aba' which is s_candidate[k:], so the check would pass. But in reality, the overlapping part is invalid.\n\nWait, this suggests that my approach is incorrect. There's a flaw here. So what's wrong with the reasoning?\n\nAh! Because the merged string is formed by overlapping, but the way we're generating it (by taking s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]) does not require that the overlapping parts match. So in this example, even though the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], the overlapping part may not match. Therefore, the check that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:] is not sufficient. We also need to check that the overlapping part (last k of s_candidate and first k of s_candidate) match.\n\nSo, in addition to checking that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:], we also need to check that the last k characters of s_candidate is equal to the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nTherefore, the two conditions are necessary:\n\n1. The first L characters of t is s_candidate.\n\n2. The rest of the string (t[L:]) equals s_candidate[k:].\n\n3. The last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nBut wait, the third condition is redundant if the merged string is generated by overlapping. Because if the merged string is formed by overlapping, then the overlapping part must match. However, in the way we construct the merged string (s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]), the overlapping part is not checked. So the third condition is needed.\n\nSo, in our approach, for a given L and k, we need to check:\n\n- s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n- Check that the last k characters of s_candidate == first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n- Check that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:].\n\nOnly if both are true, then it's a valid scenario.\n\nBut why? Because when the two s_candidate's are merged with an overlap of k characters, the overlapping part must match. So the last k of s_candidate must equal the first k of s_candidate. Then, the merged string is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:], which is exactly t. So the two checks are needed.\n\nSo, in the previous example where s_candidate is 'ababa', k=2. The last k=2 characters are 'ba', first k=2 are 'ab' which are not equal. So even though t[L:] is s_candidate[k:], the overlapping part is invalid, hence the scenario is invalid.\n\nTherefore, in our code, we need to perform both checks.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the given string t, with length T.\n\nLoop over all possible L in the range ceil((T+1)/2) to T-1 inclusive. Because L must be >= (T+1)/2, and < T. Since L must be integer, the lower bound is (T+1)//2 (if T is even or odd).\n\nFor each L in that range:\n\nCompute k = 2*L - T.\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and L-1 (inclusive). Because if k is not in that range, then this L is invalid.\n\nIf k is valid, proceed.\n\nTake s_candidate = t[0:L].\n\nCheck if the last k characters of s_candidate == first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nAlso, check if the rest of the string (t[L:]) == s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf both conditions are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the L's work, return NO.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (assuming T is 21 letters). Let's check for L=11.\n\nk = 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. Which is between 1 and 10 (L-1=10).\n\ns_candidate is t[0:11], which is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck if last 1 character of s_candidate is 'a', and first 1 is 'a'. Yes.\n\nCheck if t[11:] is equal to s_candidate[1:].\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra'.\n\nt[11:] is the substring from index 11 onwards. Let's see:\n\nOriginal t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (assuming 21 letters). The first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra', then the next letters are 'brakadabra' (positions 11-21). So t[11:] is 'brakadabra', which is equal to s_candidate[1:] (which is 'brakadabra'). So both conditions are met. So this is a valid case. So output YES and s_candidate.\n\nAnother sample input is 'acacacaca' (output is 'acaca').\n\nLet me check. T is 9 letters.\n\nPossible L ranges from (9+1)/2 = 5 to 8 (since L < T=9).\n\nSo L can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nLet's check L=5:\n\nk = 2*5 -9 = 10-9=1. Valid (1<=1<=4).\n\ns_candidate is first 5 letters: 'acaca'.\n\nCheck last 1 char of s_candidate: 'a', first 1: 'a' → ok.\n\nCheck t[5:] is 'cacaca' (since original t is 'acacacaca', indexes 0-8. t[5:] is positions 5-8: 'caca'.\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'caca'.\n\nSo t[5:] is 'caca' which equals s_candidate[1:], so valid. So this is a valid case. Hence output YES and 'acaca'.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abcabc' → output is NO.\n\nLet's see. T is 6.\n\nPossible L ranges from (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil(3.5) is 4. So L can be 4,5.\n\nCheck L=4: k = 2*4 -6= 8-6=2. Check 1<=2 <=3 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 4 letters: 'abca'.\n\nCheck last 2 letters: 'ca' and first 2 letters: 'ab' → not equal. So invalid.\n\nCheck L=5: k=2*5 -6 = 10-6=4. Check 1<=4 <=4 (since L-1=4). So yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 letters: 'abcab'.\n\nCheck last 4 letters: 'bcab' vs first 4 letters: 'abca' → not equal. So invalid. So no valid L. Hence output NO.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' → output is 'ababab'.\n\nLet me check. T is 8.\n\nPossible L ranges from (8+1)/2 = 4.5 → 5 to 7.\n\nCheck L=5: k= 2*5 -8= 2. Check 1<=2 <=4 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 letters: 'ababa'.\n\nCheck last 2 letters of s_candidate: 'ba' and first 2 letters: 'ab' → not equal. So invalid.\n\nCheck L=6: k= 2*6 -8 =4. Check 1<=4 <=5 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'.\n\nCheck last 4 letters of s_candidate: 'baba' (positions 2-5: 'abab'? Wait, let's see:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). Last 4 letters are positions 2-5: 'abab' (assuming 0-based). First 4 letters are 'abab'. So they are equal. Then check t[L:] (t[6:] is 'ab').\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[4:] → 'ab'. So t[6:] is 'ab' which equals s_candidate[4:]. So valid. So this is a valid case. Hence output YES and 'ababab'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string t.\n\nCompute T = len(t).\n\nThen, for L in range from (T+1)//2 to T-1 inclusive:\n\nfor L in range( (T+1)//2, T ):\n\nWait, because (T+1)//2 is the ceiling of (T+1)/2. For example, if T is 21, (21+1)/2 is 11, which is correct. For T even: say T=6 → (6+1)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5 is 3.5, but in integer division, (6+1)//2 is 3 (since 7//2=3). Wait, no. Wait in Python, (T+1)//2 for T=6 is (6+1)//2 = 7//2 = 3. But (T+1)/2 is 3.5. So the lower bound is (T+1)//2, but since L must be >= (T+1)/2, which for even T is (T+1)/2 = (even+1)/2. For example, T=6 → (6+1)/2=3.5. So L must be >=3.5 → L starts at 4.\n\nBut (T+1)//2 for T=6 is 3. So the code needs to loop from L_start = (T+1 +1)//2? Or perhaps the correct way is to compute L_start as ceil( (T+1)/2 ). But in Python, how to calculate that.\n\nWait, (T+1)/2 can be written as (T+1) // 2 if T is odd, but for even T, (T+1)/2 is not integer. For example, T=6, (T+1)/2=3.5. So ceil( (T+1)/2 ) is 4. So for L to be in the range where L >= (T+1)/2, the minimal integer L is ceil( (T+1)/2 ). How to calculate that in Python.\n\nWell, (T + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nFor example, T=6: (6+1+1)//2 = 8//2=4 → yes.\n\nT=5: (5+1+1)//2 =7//2=3.5 → 3? Wait no, 7//2 is 3 in integer division. But (T+1)/2 for T=5 is 3. So ceil(3) is 3. So (T+1 +1)//2 is (5+1+1)//2=7//2=3, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for L_start is (T + 2) // 2 ?\n\nYes. Because:\n\nceil( (T+1)/2 ) = (T + 1 + 1) // 2 = (T+2)//2.\n\nYes. Because:\n\nFor even T:\n\nT = 2m → (T+1)/2 = (2m +1)/2 = m + 0.5 → ceil is m+1. (T+2)//2 = (2m +2)/2 = m+1 → correct.\n\nFor odd T:\n\nT = 2m +1 → (T+1)/2 = (2m+2)/2 = m+1 → ceil is m+1. (T+2)//2 = (2m+1 +2)/2 = (2m+3)/2 = m+1.5 → integer division gives m+1 → correct.\n\nSo the correct L_start is (T + 2) // 2.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor L in range( (T + 2) // 2, T ):\n\nWait, but T is the length of the string. For example, if T=6, then L ranges from 4 to 5 (since T-1 is 5). So the code would loop L in 4,5.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor L in range( (T + 2) // 2, T ):\n\nBut in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. So to include T-1, the upper bound should be T.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor L in range( (T + 2) // 2, T ):\n\nBut for example, if T=6, then T is 6, and range( (6+2)//2, 6 ) → (8//2)=4, so range(4,6) → 4,5.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce L is determined, compute k = 2 * L - T.\n\nThen check if 1 <=k <= L-1.\n\nIf not, skip.\n\nElse:\n\ns_candidate = t[0:L]\n\nCheck if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]\n\nand t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]\n\nIf both are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nOnce any such L is found, output and exit.\n\nIf none found, output NO.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nWhat if T is 2? For example, t is 'aa'.\n\nThen T=2. Possible L is (2+2)//2= 2, but T is 2. So the range is from 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be a positive number of characters but less than the length of the message `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Overlap**: The merged string `t` is formed by two identical strings `s` overlapping by `k` characters, where `1 ≤ k < len(s)`. The length of `t` will then be `2 * len(s) - k`.\n2. **Determine Possible Lengths**: For a given length `T` of string `t`, we need to check possible lengths `L` of the original string `s`. The valid range for `L` is derived from the equation `T = 2L - k`, leading to `L` values in the range `(T + 2) // 2` to `T - 1`.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each possible `L`, compute `k` and check if the overlap conditions are satisfied. Specifically, the last `k` characters of the candidate string `s` (first `L` characters of `t`) must match its first `k` characters, and the remaining part of `t` after the first `L` characters must match the substring of `s` starting from index `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nT = len(t)\n\nfound = False\nresult = \"\"\n\nfor L in range((T + 2) // 2, T):\n    k = 2 * L - T\n    if k < 1 or k >= L:\n        continue\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n    # Check if last k chars of s_candidate == first k chars\n    if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n        # Check if the rest of t matches s_candidate[k:]\n        if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n            found = True\n            result = s_candidate\n            break\n\nif found:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input string `t` and determine its length `T`.\n2. **Range Calculation**: Calculate the range of possible lengths `L` for the original string `s` using `(T + 2) // 2` as the starting point up to `T - 1`.\n3. **Overlap Check**: For each possible length `L`, compute `k` and validate if it lies within the valid range. If valid, check if the overlap conditions are met by comparing substrings of the candidate string `s_candidate`.\n4. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by the candidate string. If no valid `s` is found, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths and overlaps, ensuring that we correctly identify if the given string could have resulted from an error in message transmission.",
