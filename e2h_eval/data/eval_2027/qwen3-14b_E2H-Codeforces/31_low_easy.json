Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x, including those not present in the original cards.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum 'current_sum'. The goal is to make the total sum zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be equal to -current_sum. Let's denote this required sum as 'target = -current_sum'.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of cards (each with values between -x and x) that sum up to 'target'. But how?\n\nLet me think. Each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative). So, to reach the target sum, what's the minimal number of cards needed?\n\nLet me think about the absolute value of the target. Let's say the target is S. So, the absolute value is |S|. Each card can contribute up to x towards this sum. So, the minimal number of cards would be the ceiling of |S| divided by x. But wait, because each card can contribute up to x. For example, if S is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because two cards can contribute 2+2=4, and then one more card contributes 1. So total 3 cards.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a case where you can get it with fewer cards? Like if S is 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, so ceiling is 2. Which is correct: 2 + 1 (but wait, the cards can have any integer between -x and x. So for example, 2 and 1. But the maximum per card is x. So yes, 2 cards: 2 and 1. But wait, the problem says that each card can be any integer from -x to x. So for example, if the target is 3 and x is 2, the minimal number is 2 cards: 2 and 1. But the maximum per card is 2. So that's allowed.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is ceil( |target| / x ). But wait, what if the target is exactly divisible by x? For example, target is 4, x is 2. Then 4/2 is 2 cards. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula would be: the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of (abs(target) / x). But wait, let's check some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input: the found cards are -1, 1, 2. Their sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So target is -2. The absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 = 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the example.\n\nIn the second sample input: the found cards are -2 and -2. Their sum is -4. Target is 4. x is 3. So 4 / 3 is 1.333..., so ceiling is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems to work. So the approach is:\n\n1. Calculate the sum of the given cards. Let's call it current_sum.\n2. Compute target = -current_sum.\n3. If target is zero, then no cards needed. So answer is 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( abs(target) / x )\n\nBut wait, how do we compute ceil here? Because in Python, we can do it with math.ceil, but we need to handle integer division.\n\nFor example, for a target of 5 and x of 2: 5/2 is 2.5, ceil is 3. For 4 and 2, 4/2 is 2, which is correct. For 3 and 2, 3/2 is 1.5, ceil is 2.\n\nSo, the formula is (abs(target) + x - 1) // x. Because that's how you compute the ceiling of division in integers. For example, (5 + 2 -1 ) // 2 = 6//2=3. (3 + 2-1) //2 =4//2=2. (4 + 2-1)//2=5//2=2. So yes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute current_sum = sum of the list.\n\ntarget = -current_sum.\n\nif target is 0: return 0.\n\nelse: compute (abs(target) +",
