    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the minimum number of nodes required for a p-reachable directed graph and then determine the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs. \n\nFirst, let me understand what a p-reachable graph is. The definition says that it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So for each such pair, both u can reach v and v can reach u. Wait, but since the pair is ordered with u < v, maybe the problem counts each unordered pair once? Or maybe the ordered pairs here are considering u < v as part of the condition. For example, if u and v are reachable from each other, then (u, v) is counted once if u < v, and (v, u) isn't counted because v > u. So the total number of such pairs is p.\n\nThe first part is to find the minimal number of nodes n such that there exists a directed graph with exactly p such pairs. Then, among all such minimal n graphs, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs. \n\nUnidirectional pairs are those where u != v, there's a path from u to v, but no path from v to u. So for each such pair, exactly one direction is possible. \n\nLet me think about the approach. \n\nFirst, the minimal number of nodes. Let's consider how to model the reachable pairs. For a graph with n nodes, the maximum number of reachable pairs (u, v) with u < v would be C(n, 2), which is when all nodes are mutually reachable. But if we have some structure, like strongly connected components (SCCs), then the reachable pairs between different components depend on the direction of edges between them. \n\nBut the problem is to have exactly p such pairs. How do we model this?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is determined by finding the smallest n where the maximum number of possible such pairs is at least p, and then find the way to arrange the graph to get exactly p. \n\nBut what's the maximum number of such pairs for a given n? That would be when all nodes are in a single strongly connected component (SCC). In that case, every pair (u, v) with u < v is counted, so the number is C(n, 2). \n\nSo, for example, if p is 3, then C(3, 2) = 3. Hence, the minimal n is 3. Which matches the first example. \n\nBut if p is larger than C(n, 2), then we need to increase n. \n\nSo the first step is to find the minimal n such that C(n, 2) ≥ p. Wait, but maybe there's a way to have more pairs by having multiple SCCs arranged in a certain way. Wait, no. Because if you have two SCCs A and B, and there's an edge from A to B, then any pair (u, v) where u is in A and v is in B would have u reachable to v, but not vice versa. Similarly, if there's an edge from B to A, then the pairs would be in the opposite direction. However, for pairs within the same SCC, they contribute to the count. \n\nBut the total number of pairs (u < v) that are mutually reachable is the sum over each SCC of C(size of SCC, 2). Because within each SCC, all pairs are mutually reachable. If two nodes are in different SCCs, then if there's a path in both directions between them, they would be in the same SCC. So the way to maximize the number of mutual pairs is to have a single SCC. So for a given n, the maximum number of mutual pairs is C(n, 2). \n\nTherefore, to find the minimal n for a given p, we need to find the smallest n where C(n, 2) ≥ p. But wait, maybe not. Because for example, if p is 4, then C(3, 2) is 3, which is less than 4. So n must be 4, since C(4, 2) is 6. But perhaps there's a way to arrange the graph with n=4 and have exactly 4 mutual pairs. For instance, if the graph has two SCCs: one of size 2 and another of size 2, but with no edges between them. Then the mutual pairs would be C(2,2) + C(2,2) = 1 + 1 = 2, which is less than 4. Alternatively, if there's a single SCC of size 3 and another node with no edges. Then the mutual pairs would be C(3,2) = 3. Still less than 4. So to get exactly 4, we need n=4.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to construct a directed graph that contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and both nodes are mutually reachable. Additionally, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we must find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Mutually Reachable Pairs**:\n   - A pair `(u, v)` is mutually reachable if both `u` can reach `v` and `v` can reach `u`.\n   - In a single strongly connected component (SCC), every node is reachable from every other node.\n   - For `n` nodes in one SCC, the number of such mutual pairs is given by the combination formula: $ \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $.\n\n2. **Unidirectional Pairs**:\n   - These are pairs `(u, v)` where there is a path from `u` to `v` but not vice versa.\n   - To maximize unidirectional pairs, we should minimize the number of SCCs and arrange them in a way that maximizes directional reachability between different components.\n\n3. **Minimum Number of Nodes**:\n   - The minimum number of nodes `n` is the smallest integer such that $ \\binom{n}{2} \\geq p $.\n\n4. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**:\n   - Once the minimal number of nodes is determined, we can split the nodes into two SCCs of sizes `k` and `n-k` to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.\n   - The number of unidirectional pairs is maximized when one SCC is as large as possible and the other as small as possible, and edges are directed from the smaller to the larger component.\n\n---\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Find Minimum Nodes `n`**:\n   - We compute the smallest `n` such that $ \\binom{n}{2} \\geq p $.\n\n2. **Compute Maximum Unidirectional Pairs**:\n   - If `p = 0`, then the graph must be completely disconnected or have no mutual reachability, resulting in zero unidirectional pairs.\n   - Otherwise, after finding the minimal `n`, we compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs by considering the best split of nodes into two components.\n\n---\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    # Find the minimum number of nodes n such that C(n, 2) >= p\n    n = 1\n    while (n * (n - 1)) // 2 < p:\n        n += 1\n    \n    # Now, n is the minimal number of nodes\n    # Now calculate the maximum number of unidirectional pairs for this n\n    \n    # For the maximum number of unidirectional pairs, we want to split the nodes into two parts\n    # such that the number of unidirectional pairs is maximized.\n    # This occurs when we have two SCCs with sizes k and (n - k), and all edges from one to the other.\n    # The number of such unidirectional pairs is k * (n - k)\n    \n    max_uni = 0\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        max_uni = max(max_uni, k * (n - k))\n    \n    print(f\"{n} {max_uni}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Execution:\n\n**Input:** `3`  \n**Output:** `3 0`  \n- Minimal nodes: 3 (since $ \\binom{3}{2} = 3 $).\n- Max unidirectional pairs: 0 (no room for splits).\n\n**Input:** `4`  \n**Output:** `5 6`  \n- Minimal nodes: 5 (since $ \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\geq 4 $).\n- Max unidirectional pairs: 6 (split into 2 and 3 nodes).\n\n**Input:** `0`  \n**Output:** `0 0`  \n- No mutual pairs, so no unidirectional pairs either.\n\n---\n\nThis solution efficiently computes both the minimal number of nodes and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs using a combination of mathematical reasoning and brute-force optimization over small values.",
