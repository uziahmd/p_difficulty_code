In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimal number of draws required.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible cases. The initial hand has three tiles. So, for each case, I need to check if there's already a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n   - For triplet: all three are same.\n   - For sequence: they are consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut how do we check for possible mentsu after adding some tiles?\n\nBut since the problem allows adding any number of tiles, but we need the minimum, perhaps we can consider all possibilities of forming a triplet or a sequence with the existing tiles plus some added ones.\n\nBut since the initial count is three tiles, adding 0, 1, or maybe 2 tiles could be needed. Let's think about the possible scenarios.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases where the answer is 0, 1, 2, etc.\n\nFor example, the third example input is ['3p', '9m', '2p']. The existing tiles are 3p, 2p, and 9m. So, the 2p and 3p are in same suit. To form a sequence, they need a 1p or 4p. So adding one tile gives a sequence. Hence answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, to form a triplet, you need another 1m (so 1 tile). Or for a sequence, you need 3m (so 1 tile). So the answer would be 1.\n\nBut what if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, to form a sequence, you need to add 3m (so 1 tile). But if you want a triplet, you need two more 1m's, or two more 2m's, or two more 4m's. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the answer depends on checking whether any possible triplet or sequence can be formed with the existing tiles plus some added tiles, and find the minimal number of additions required.\n\nBut how to approach this systematically?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check for possible ways to form a mentsu by adding 1 tile. If possible, return 1.\n\nElse, check for possible ways to form a mentsu by adding 2 tiles. If possible, return 2.\n\nElse, return 3? Well, but maybe there's a case where even adding 3 tiles is needed. But wait, for example, if the three tiles are all different suits and numbers, like 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a triplet, you need two more tiles of the same as one of them. For example, adding two more 1m's would make a triplet. So that would take 2 tiles. But perhaps there's a scenario where you need to add 2 tiles to form a sequence?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the three tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Then, to form a sequence, you need to add 2m and 4m. So that's two tiles. But maybe there's a way to form a triplet with adding two tiles (like adding two 1m's, making three 1m's, but that's only two tiles added. Wait, original three tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Adding two 1m's would give three 1m's, but that's a triplet. So the answer here would be 2. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, adding one 2m and one 4m would allow forming a sequence of 1m, 2m, 3m, but then you have 1m, 3m, 5m, 2m, 4m. Then, you can form a sequence of 1m, 2m, 3m, but that requires two added tiles. So in that case, the answer is 2.\n\nBut how can we check all possibilities?\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of tiles needed. So the approach is to check for all possible mentsu that can be formed with the current tiles plus some added tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases where adding 0, 1, 2, etc. tiles can form a mentsu.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, check if it's possible to form a mentsu by adding one tile. If yes, answer is 1.\n\nElse, check if it's possible to form a mentsu by adding two tiles. If yes, answer is 2.\n\nElse, answer is 3? Or maybe 2? Wait, what's the maximum possible?\n\nLet me think. For example, if the three tiles are all different, and not in a sequence. Like 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a triplet, you need two more tiles of the same type. For example, adding two 1m's. So total of two tiles. So answer is 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then adding 3m (one tile) gives a sequence of 1-2-3, or 2-3-4. So answer is 1.\n\nSo the maximum possible answer is 2? Because in any case, adding two tiles can form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nWait, but what about when the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, adding one tile of 1m gives a triplet (needs 3 of same). So adding one tile. But if you add 3m, then you have 1m, 1m, 2m, 3m. Then you can form a sequence of 1m, 2m, 3m. So that's adding one tile. So answer is 1.\n\nBut what if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, adding 3m gives a sequence of 1-2-3 (needs 3m) or 2-3-4 (needs 3m). So adding one tile.\n\nBut what about if the three tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Then, adding two tiles (2m and 4m) gives a sequence of 1-2-3-4-5, but you can choose any three consecutive. So that's adding two tiles.\n\nSo the answer is 2.\n\nSo the maximum possible answer is 2? Because adding two tiles can form a sequence or triplet.\n\nWait, but what if the three tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Then, to form a triplet, you need two more of any of those. For example, adding two 1m's. Then you have three 1m's. So answer is 2.\n\nBut if you add one tile, say, 1m, then you have two 1m's, which isn't enough for triplet. So no mentsu. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo in this case, answer is 2.\n\nSo the possible answers are 0, 1, or 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for 0, then 1, then 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCheck if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if there's a way to form a mentsu by adding 1 tile. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, return 2.\n\nWait, but why can't there be a case where adding 2 tiles is required? Because the answer is 2 in that case. So the code would return 2.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, the code needs to process the input. Let's think about the input. The input is three strings, like '1s 2s 3s' etc. Wait, the input is given as a list of three strings. Wait, the sample input shows that for example, the first input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] and the outputs are 0, 0, 1. Wait, but the actual input is three tiles. Oh, no, looking back, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit from 1-9 and the second is m, p, or s.\n\nWait, the input is three strings, each being a tile. So for example, the first example input is three tiles: '1s', '2s', '3s'. But in the sample input given, the first input is written as ['1s 2s 3s', ...], but that's probably a mistake. Wait, the problem says:\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as:\n\nInput\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nOutput\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. Because according to the problem statement, the input is three strings. So perhaps the actual input is three tiles, e.g., for the first case, the input is \"1s 2s 3s\" — but that's three tiles. Wait, no. Wait, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. So the input would be three strings, like:\n\nFor example, the first example input is three tiles: '1s', '2s', '3s' — which forms a sequence. So the output is 0.\n\nBut the sample input is written as ['1s 2s 3s', ...], which is a list of three strings, but each string is a concatenation of three tiles. That seems to be a mistake. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nAh, so the input is three strings, each representing a tile. So for example, the first input in the sample is three tiles: '1s', '2s', '3s' — but the sample input shows it as '1s 2s 3s' as a single string. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each element in the list is a single string. For example, the first input is [\"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\"], and the output is 0. But the sample input is written as ['1s 2s 3s', ...], which seems to be a mistake. However, looking at the sample input and output, the first input is three tiles, and the output is 0. So perhaps the input is three tiles, separated by spaces, but the problem's sample input is written as a list of three strings, each being a single tile. But the actual input is three tiles, given as a single line with three strings separated by spaces.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSo for example, the input is something like \"1s 2s 3s\" — three strings separated by spaces. So the sample input may have been written as a list of three examples. For example, the first example's input is three tiles, which is \"1s 2s 3s\" — the input line is three strings. The output is 0.\n\nSo the code should read a line with three strings, split by spaces.\n\nSo for the code, the input is read as three tiles. So for example, in Python, the code would read input().split() which gives a list of three elements.\n\nNow, the code needs to process each of these three tiles.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if the three tiles already form a mentsu. How to check that?\n\nCheck for triplet: all three are the same.\n\nCheck for sequence: they are in same suit, and their numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo for example, for the three tiles, we can check:\n\nif all three are same: triplet.\n\nelse, check if they are in same suit, and sorted numbers are consecutive.\n\nBut for the sequence, the order doesn't matter. So for example, tiles 3m, 1m, 2m can be sorted as 1,2,3.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, let's collect their suit and numbers.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, let's create a list of tuples (number, suit). For example, '1s' becomes (1, 's').\n\nThen, for checking triplet:\n\nall three tuples are same.\n\nFor checking sequence:\n\nall three have same suit, and the numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo for example, numbers sorted are x, x+1, x+2.\n\nSo, if the three tiles form a triplet or a sequence, then return 0.\n\nElse, proceed to check for adding tiles.\n\nNow, if the initial check returns false, then we need to check if adding one tile can form a mentsu.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nWe need to consider all possibilities of adding one tile, and see if any of them allows forming a triplet or sequence.\n\nBut since the number of possibilities is manageable, perhaps we can generate all possible options.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the possible cases where adding one tile can form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nCase 1: Adding a tile to form a triplet.\n\nFor example, if there are two of the same tile, adding one more will form a triplet.\n\nSo, for the current three tiles, count the occurrences of each tile.\n\nIf any tile occurs two times, then adding one more of that tile will form a triplet. So that would require adding 1 tile.\n\nOr, if there are two different tiles, but adding one of them can form a triplet. For example, if there are two tiles of A and one of B. Then adding another A would make three A's.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, check if there's any tile that occurs at least two times. If yes, then adding one tile would make a triplet.\n\nCase 2: Adding a tile to form a sequence.\n\nThis is more complex. For example, the existing tiles may have two tiles in the same suit, and adding a third to form a sequence.\n\nFor example, existing tiles are 1m, 2m. Adding 3m would form a sequence. Or adding 0m (invalid), or adding 1m (but that would be 1m, 1m, 2m, which can't form a sequence. So, in this case, the existing two tiles are 1m and 2m. To form a sequence, need to add 3m. Or if existing tiles are 2m and 3m, add 1m. Or existing tiles are 1m and 3m, add 2m.\n\nSo for the sequence case, the existing tiles must have two in same suit, and the numbers can be part of a sequence.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, check for each possible pair in the same suit, and see if adding a third tile can complete a sequence.\n\nBut since the existing three tiles may not be in same suit, but perhaps two of them are in same suit and can form a sequence with an added tile.\n\nSo, for example, the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3p. Then, the 1m and 2m can form a sequence if adding 3m. So adding 1 tile.\n\nSo, the approach for checking if adding one tile can form a sequence is:\n\nCheck for each suit, collect the numbers of the tiles in that suit.\n\nFor example, for the three tiles, group by suit.\n\nFor each suit, check if there are at least two tiles. For each such group, check if they can be part of a sequence with one more tile.\n\nFor example, in the group of two tiles in the same suit:\n\nLet's say the numbers are a and b. Sort them as x and y.\n\nIf x and y are consecutive, then adding y+1 or x-1 would form a sequence. Wait, no. For example, if x is 1 and y is 2, then adding 3 would form a sequence (1,2,3). Or adding 0 (invalid). So only 3 is possible.\n\nIf x and y are not consecutive, but differ by 2, then adding the middle number would form a sequence. For example, x=1, y=3 → add 2.\n\nIf x and y are same, then adding another same would form a triplet (but that's handled in the triplet case).\n\nIf x and y are more than two apart, then adding one tile can't form a sequence with these two.\n\nSo, for a group of two tiles in the same suit, check if they can be extended to a sequence with one tile.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIf there's a group of two tiles in the same suit, and their numbers are a and b (sorted), then:\n\nif b - a == 1: then adding b+1 would form a sequence (a, b, b+1). Or adding a-1 would form (a-1, a, b). But since a is the smaller, a-1 could be 0, which is invalid.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 1, b is 2 → adding 3.\n\nIf a is 2, b is 3 → adding 1 or 4.\n\nWait, but adding 1 would form 1,2,3. But the existing tiles are 2 and 3. So adding 1 would make a sequence. So yes.\n\nSo for two tiles in same suit, the possible ways to form a sequence with one added tile is:\n\nCheck if the two numbers can be part of a three-length sequence.\n\nSo, for two numbers x and y (sorted):\n\nIf x and y are consecutive (y = x+1), then adding x+2 or x-1 (if possible) would form a sequence. But x-1 is possible only if x-1 >=1.\n\nBut if x is 1, then x-1 is 0, invalid. So for two consecutive numbers, adding a third to make a sequence can be done in one way (if the two are 1 and 2, adding 3; if they are 2 and 3, adding 1 or 4; if they are 8 and 9, adding 7).\n\nBut in any case, if there are two numbers in same suit, then there's at least one possible tile to add to form a sequence.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, for the group of two numbers in same suit, check if there exists a third number such that the three form a sequence.\n\nSo, for example, for two numbers x and y (sorted):\n\nif y - x == 1 → then the third number can be x-1 (if x-1 >=1) or y+1 (<=9). So, if x is 1, then x-1 is invalid, but adding y+1 is possible.\n\nIf y -x == 2 → then the third number is x+1.\n\nIf y -x > 2 → no possible third number.\n\nSo for example, if x=1, y=3 → adding 2.\n\nSo, in this case, adding one tile would allow forming a sequence.\n\nSo, for any group of two tiles in same suit, if they can be extended to a sequence with one tile, then adding that tile would form a sequence.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, if any of the groups (by suit) has two tiles, and the numbers can be extended to a sequence with one tile, then adding that tile would allow forming a sequence.\n\nAdditionally, there's another possibility: the three tiles have one tile in a suit, and adding two tiles to form a sequence. But that's not possible with adding one tile.\n\nWait, no. For example, if there's only one tile in a suit, adding two more tiles would form a sequence. But that requires adding two tiles, which is handled in the next step.\n\nSo, for the case of adding one tile, we need to check:\n\nIs there a way to form a triplet by adding one tile (i.e., two of same tile already present), or a sequence by adding one tile (as discussed above).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCheck for triplet possibility with adding one tile: count the frequency of each tile. If any tile appears two times, then adding one more would make three. So return 1.\n\nCheck for sequence possibility with adding one tile: check if there's a suit where there are two tiles, and those two can be extended to a sequence with one tile.\n\nSo, for example, in the three tiles, group by suit. For each suit, collect the numbers. For each suit, check if the count is at least two. For each such suit, check if the numbers can be extended to a sequence with one tile.\n\nIf any of these conditions is true, then adding one tile is sufficient.\n\nIf either of these conditions is met (triplet or sequence), then the answer is 1.\n\nElse, check if adding two tiles can form a mentsu.\n\nBut what's the minimal steps for adding two tiles?\n\nIn that case, the answer would be 2.\n\nBecause for any case where the initial three tiles don't form a mentsu, and adding one tile is not sufficient, then adding two tiles would be sufficient.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet me think of possible scenarios where adding two tiles is needed.\n\nCase 1: All three tiles are in different suits. For example, 1m, 2p, 3s. To form a triplet, you need two more of any of them. For example, adding two 1m's would make a triplet. So that requires two tiles. So answer is 2.\n\nCase 2: Two tiles in same suit, but not consecutive, and the third in a different suit. For example, 1m, 3m, 2p. Then, adding 2m and 4m would allow forming a sequence (1m, 2m, 3m). But that's adding two tiles. Or adding two 1m's to form a triplet. So answer is 2.\n\nSo in all cases, adding two tiles is sufficient. Thus, if the answer is not 0 or 1, then it's 2.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nCheck if current three tiles form a mentsu → 0.\n\nElse, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu (triplet or sequence) → 1.\n\nElse, answer is 2.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check for possible adding one tile.\n\nIf possible, return 1.\n\nElse, return 2.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement these checks.\n\nLet me think about how to implement the check for the initial mentsu.\n\nFirst, for the three tiles, group them into their numbers and suits.\n\nFor example, for tiles = [tile1, tile2, tile3]\n\ntile1 is like '1s', so number is 1, suit is 's'.\n\nSo, create a list of tuples (number, suit).\n\nThen:\n\nCheck if all three are same → triplet.\n\nElse, check if all three have same suit, and sorted numbers are consecutive.\n\nFor example, numbers sorted are x, x+1, x+2.\n\nIf either condition is true, return 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for the check of adding one tile:\n\nFirst, check for triplet possibility:\n\ncount the frequency of each tile. For example, using a Counter.\n\nIf any tile has a count of 2, then adding one more would form a triplet. So return 1.\n\nBut what if there are two different tiles with count 2? Like, for example, if the three tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then, the count for 1m is 2, and 2m is 1. So adding one more 1m would form a triplet. So yes.\n\nBut if the three tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m], then adding 1m would form a triplet. So yes.\n\nSo, the code can check if any tile occurs at least twice. Because if so, adding one more would make three.\n\nBut what if the three tiles are all different. Like 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, no tile occurs more than once. So, this condition is not met. So, the triplet possibility is not possible with adding one tile.\n\nThen, check for sequence possibility.\n\nFor this, group the tiles by suit. For each suit, collect the numbers.\n\nFor example, for the three tiles, group into suits. For each suit, check if there are at least two numbers. For each such group, check if those numbers can be extended to a sequence with one more tile.\n\nSo, for example, in the group of two numbers, check if they can be part of a sequence with one added tile.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor each suit in the group:\n\nnumbers_in_suit = list of numbers in that suit.\n\nIf len(numbers_in_suit) >= 2:\n\nsort them.\n\nCheck if the two numbers can be extended to a sequence with one tile.\n\nSo, for two numbers a and b (sorted):\n\nif b - a == 1: then adding b+1 (if <=9) or a-1 (if >=1). So, if either is possible, then yes.\n\nif b - a == 2: then adding a+1.\n\nelse: no.\n\nBut in code, for the two numbers, check if there's a possible third number to form a sequence.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nsorted_nums = sorted(numbers_in_suit)\n\nif len(sorted_nums) >= 2:\n\na = sorted_nums[0]\n\nb = sorted_nums[1]\n\nif b - a == 1:\n\nthen adding b+1 (if <=9) or a-1 (if >=1). So, at least one of these is possible unless a is 1 and b is 2 (then adding 3 is possible) or a is 8, b is 9 (adding 7 is possible). So in any case, there is at least one possible tile to add.\n\nWait, if a=1 and b=2 → adding 3.\n\nif a=2, b=3 → adding 1 or 4.\n\nif a=8, b=9 → adding 7.\n\nSo, in all cases, there is at least one possible tile to add.\n\nBut if the group has two numbers, and they are consecutive, then adding one tile can form a sequence. So, for example, in the case where the group has two numbers, and they are consecutive, then adding one tile would form a sequence.\n\nBut what if the group has two numbers that are not consecutive, but differ by 2?\n\nLike a=1 and b=3 → adding 2.\n\nSo, that's possible.\n\nSo, for any group with two numbers in same suit, if the difference between the two is <= 2, then adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nWait, for example, a=1 and b=3: difference is 2. Adding 2.\n\nIf a=1 and b=4: difference is 3 → no way to form a sequence with one tile. So in that case, adding one tile can't form a sequence.\n\nSo, the code needs to check for the two numbers in the same suit:\n\nif they are consecutive (difference 1) or differ by 2 (so that adding the middle number can form a sequence).\n\nSo, for two numbers a and b (sorted):\n\nif (b - a) <= 2 → then possible to form a sequence with adding one tile.\n\nElse, no.\n\nSo, in code, for a group of two numbers:\n\nif the max - min is <= 2 → then possible.\n\nSo, in this case, adding one tile would allow forming a sequence.\n\nThus, for the sequence check:\n\nfor each suit, collect the numbers in that suit.\n\nfor each suit, if there are at least two numbers, check if the max and min differ by <= 2. If yes, then possible to add one tile.\n\nSo, for example, in the case of two numbers in same suit, and their difference is 2, then adding one tile (the middle) would form a sequence.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nfor each suit in the group:\n\nnumbers = list of numbers in that suit.\n\nif len(numbers) >= 2:\n\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\nif sorted_numbers[-1] - sorted_numbers[0] <= 2 → then possible to form a sequence with adding one tile.\n\nBut wait, what if there are three numbers in the same suit? For example, the three numbers are 1, 2, 4. Then, the max - min is 3. But perhaps two of them can be extended. But since the code is checking for adding one tile, in this case, the three numbers are already in the hand. So the code is for the case where the current three tiles don't form a mentsu. So, if there are three numbers in the same suit, but not in sequence, then the code would have already checked that in the initial check. So in this case, the initial check would have failed. But when considering adding one tile, for example, if the three numbers are 1, 2, 4. Then, the group for that suit has three numbers. So, for the code's purpose, when checking for adding one tile, perhaps the group is considered. For example, the group has three numbers. But the code is looking for a way to form a sequence with adding one tile. However, in this case, the existing three numbers are not a sequence, and adding one tile would not help. Because the existing three numbers are 1,2,4. Adding a 3 would allow forming 1,2,3 (sequence) or 2,3,4 (sequence). So, in this case, adding one tile (3) would form a sequence. Thus, the code should detect that.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn this case, the group has three numbers. So, sorted_numbers is [1,2,4]. The max - min is 3. But the code would check for any pair in the group. For example, 1 and 2 (difference 1) → adding 3. So, even though the group has three numbers, but the code checks for pairs. But the code is written to check for each suit, and for that suit, check if there are at least two numbers. So in this case, the code would check for the pair 1 and 2 (difference 1), and thus determine that adding one tile is possible.\n\nSo, the code's logic for checking for sequence possibility is:\n\nfor each suit in the group:\n\n   collect the numbers in that suit.\n\n   if the count is >= 2:\n\n      sorted_nums = sorted(numbers)\n\n      check if the max and min differ by <= 2. If yes → possible to add one tile.\n\nBut in the case of three numbers, like [1,2,4], the max - min is 3, but there is a pair (1 and 2) with difference 1. So the code would find that pair and return True.\n\nSo, the code's logic is correct.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCheck for any suit that has at least two numbers. For each such suit, check if the max and min of the numbers in that suit differ by at most 2. If yes, then adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nSo, if any of the suits meet this condition, then the answer is 1.\n\nThus, in code:\n\ndef is_possible_add_one(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet possibility\n\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    counts = Counter(tiles)\n\n    for tile, cnt in counts.items():\n\n        if cnt >= 2:\n\n            return True\n\n    # check sequence possibility\n\n    suits = {}\n\n    for tile in tiles:\n\n        num = int(tile[0])\n\n        suit = tile[1]\n\n        if suit not in suits:\n\n            suits[suit] = []\n\n        suits[suit].append(num)\n\n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n\n        if len(nums) >= 2:\n\n            sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n\n            min_num = sorted_nums[0]\n\n            max_num = sorted_nums[-1]\n\n            if max_num - min_num <= 2:\n\n                return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but this code is returning True if any of the conditions are met. So, for example, if there's a triplet possibility (counts >= 2) or a sequence possibility (some suit has two numbers with max - min <= 2), then return True.\n\nBut in this code, the function returns True if any of these conditions is met. Thus, if this function returns True, then the answer is 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu → if yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if is_possible_add_one → if yes, return 1.\n\nElse, return 2.\n\nNow, implement the check for initial mentsu.\n\nImplementing the initial check:\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    # group by suit\n\n    suits = {}\n\n    for tile in tiles:\n\n        suit = tile[1]\n\n        if suit not in suits:\n\n            suits[suit] = []\n\n        suits[suit].append(int(tile[0]))\n\n    # for each suit, check if all three are in same suit and form sequence\n\n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n\n        if len(nums) == 3:\n\n            sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n\n            if sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[0] == 2 and sorted_nums[1] - sorted_nums[0] == 1:\n\n                return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but the code for checking sequence is: if all three are in same suit, and sorted numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for example, [1,2,3], [2,3,4], etc.\n\nThus, the code for the initial check:\n\ntiles is a list of three strings. For each tile, extract the number and suit.\n\nCheck if all three are same → triplet.\n\nElse, check for each suit if all three are in that suit. If so, check if they form a sequence.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nIn code, for the initial check:\n\ntiles = [tile1, tile2, tile3]\n\nsuits = [tile1[1], tile2[1], tile3[1]]\n\nif all(suit == suits[0] for suit in suits):\n\n    numbers = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n    if sorted_numbers[2] - sorted_numbers[0] == 2 and sorted_numbers[1] - sorted_numbers[0] == 1:\n\n        return True\n\nBut this is redundant with the code in the previous function. So, the function has_mentsu can be implemented as:\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # Check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # Check sequence\n\n    # Check if all three are same suit\n\n    suit0 = tiles[0][1]\n\n    suit1 = tiles[1][1]\n\n    suit2 = tiles[2][1]\n\n    if suit0 == suit1 == suit2:\n\n        nums = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n\n        nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n\n        if nums_sorted[2] - nums_sorted[0] == 2 and nums_sorted[1] - nums_sorted[0] == 1:\n\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nYes, this is simpler.\n\nSo, the code for the initial check.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead the input as three tiles.\n\nCheck if has_mentsu → if yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if possible to add one tile (triplet or sequence) → if yes, output 1.\n\nElse, output 2.\n\nNow, testing this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: ['1s', '2s', '3s'] → has_mentsu returns True → output 0.\n\nSample Input 2: ['9m', '9m', '9m'] → triplet → output 0.\n\nSample Input 3: ['3p', '9m', '2p'] → initial check: not triplet. Suits are p, m, p → not all same. So no sequence. So initial check returns False. Then check for adding one tile.\n\nCheck triplet possibility: counts are 3p:1, 9m:1, 2p:1 → no counts >=2 → no. Then check sequence possibility.\n\nGroup by suit:\n\nFor p: numbers are 3, 2 → sorted [2,3]. max - min is 1 → yes. So return True. So answer is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: input is ['1m', '1m', '2m'] → initial check: not triplet (they are 1m, 1m, 2m). Not same suit? No,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand.
