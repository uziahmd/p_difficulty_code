Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of S after each modification. But there are some specific invalid Morse codes that we need to exclude.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. So, each time we add a 0 or 1 to S, we have to compute the total number of valid sequences. A valid sequence is a sequence of letters where each letter is represented by a Morse code string of length 1-4, and those Morse codes are not in the forbidden list. Also, each substring of S that represents a valid Morse code contributes to the count. But since sequences are considered as multiple letters, we need to consider all possible ways to split the substrings into valid Morse codes.\n\nWait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So, for example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\". Each of these substrings could be a Morse code for a letter. However, if a substring is a valid Morse code (i.e., not in the forbidden list), then it counts as one letter. But sequences are combinations of these letters. For example, if the substring is \"11\", which is valid, then it's one sequence (the single letter). But if there's a longer substring that can be split into multiple valid codes, like \"111\" could be split as \"1\" followed by \"11\" (two letters) or as \"11\" followed by \"1\" (another two letters), or as \"111\" as a single letter. Each of these splits would contribute to the count as separate sequences.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each possible substring of S, determine if it's a valid Morse code (i.e., not forbidden and length between 1-4), and then compute the number of ways to split that substring into valid codes. Then sum all these possibilities across all substrings.\n\nBut that sounds computationally expensive, especially since S can be up to 3000 characters long. For each step, m is up to 3000, and for each step, the length of S is up to 3000. So for each i-th step, the length of S is i. For each position, we need to look at all possible substrings ending at that position, and for each such substring, check if it's a valid code, and then accumulate the number of ways to split it.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a dynamic programming approach here. Let me think. Let's say dp[i] represents the number of valid sequences that can be formed from the first i characters of S. Then, when adding a new character (say, the i-th character), we can look back up to 4 positions (since Morse code has length up to 4) and see if any of the substrings ending at i form a valid code. For each such valid code, we can add dp[i - len] + 1 (the +1 is for the case where the current substring is taken as a single letter).\n\nWait, that might be the way to go. Because for each position i, the total number of sequences that end at i can be calculated based on previous dp values. But how does this relate to the total count?\n\nLet me think again. The total number of sequences is the sum over all possible splits of all possible substrings. But perhaps the dynamic programming approach can track the total number of sequences up to each position. Let's consider that.\n\nLet's define dp[i] as the total number of valid sequences that can be formed from the first i characters of S. When we add the i-th character (so S is now length i), we can look back at the last 1 to 4 characters (as long as they are within the string). For each possible length l (from 1 to 4), if the substring ending at i with length l is a valid Morse code, then we can add dp[i - l] to dp[i], because any sequence up to i - l can be extended by this new code. Also, if the current substring is valid, then it's a new sequence of length 1 (so +1). Wait, but dp[i] should account for all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting the first i characters. So the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{l=1 to 4} (if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then dp[i - l] + 1 ? )\n\nWait, no. Let's think: For each possible l (length of the last code in the sequence), if the last l characters form a valid code, then the number of sequences ending at i is equal to the number of sequences up to i - l (since we can append this code to each of those sequences) plus 1 (the case where the entire sequence is just this code). But that's not correct. Because the dp[i] is the total number of sequences that can be formed from the first i characters. So for example, when considering the last l characters as a valid code, the total sequences would be dp[i - l] (the number of sequences up to i - l) multiplied by 1 (adding this code) plus 1 (the new code itself). Wait, no. For example, if there are x sequences up to i - l, then adding the current code as a new element gives x sequences. Plus the current code itself as a new sequence. So for each valid l, we add dp[i - l] + 1? Or is it dp[i - l] + 1? No, maybe it's dp[i - l] + 1 if the current code is valid. Wait, no. Suppose that the current code is valid. Then, the number of sequences that can be formed by taking sequences up to i - l and adding this code as a new element is dp[i - l]. Also, the code itself is a new sequence (counted once). So for each valid l, we add dp[i - l] + 1? Or is the 1 already included in the dp[i - l]?\n\nNo, the dp[i] is the total number of sequences that can be formed from the first i characters. So for each l, if the last l characters form a valid code, then the number of sequences that can be formed by including this code is equal to (number of sequences up to i - l) + 1. Because the sequences up to i - l can be extended by this code, and the code itself is a new sequence. Wait, but the +1 is only if we take the code as a single element. So the total for each l is (dp[i - l] + 1) ?\n\nBut wait, for example, if i - l is 0 (i.e., the code starts at the beginning), then dp[0] is 0 (since there are no characters). So adding dp[0] + 1 would be 1, which is correct (the code itself).\n\nBut this seems like the standard approach for decoding problems. For example, the problem where you count the number of ways to decode a string into letters, where each letter is 1 or 2 digits. In that case, the recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] (if the current digit is valid as a single digit, and the previous two digits form a valid two-digit number). However, in our case, the problem is different because we need to count all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting the string into valid Morse codes. Each such split corresponds to a sequence of letters. So the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible splits of the string into valid Morse codes. So the DP approach here is similar to that problem.\n\nBut in our problem, the question is not to count the number of ways to split the entire string into valid codes, but rather the sum over all possible substrings (each of which can be split into valid codes) of the number of ways to split that substring. Because each substring contributes its own number of sequences. For example, if the entire string is \"111\", then the substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (positions 1): 1 way.\n- \"1\" (positions 2): 1 way.\n- \"1\" (positions 3): 1 way.\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2): 1 way (split as \"11\").\n- \"11\" (positions 2-3): 1 way.\n- \"111\" (positions 1-3): 3 ways (split as \"1\"+\"1\"+\"1\", \"1\"+\"11\", \"11\"+\"1\", \"111\").\n\nWait, but according to the note in the first sample, the answer for \"111\" is 7. Let me check that. The sample says that the answer is 7. Let me see:\n\nThe sample input after three steps is \"111\". The output is 7. According to the note, the sequences are:\n\n\"T\" (1), \"M\" (11), \"O\" (111), \"TT\" (1+1), \"TM\" (1+11), \"MT\" (11+1), \"TTT\" (1+1+1). That's 7 sequences. So the total number of sequences is the sum for all possible substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse codes.\n\nSo, for example, the substring \"111\" contributes 4 ways (the splits mentioned above). But the other substrings (each of length 1, 2) contribute 1 way each. So for the entire string \"111\", the total is:\n\nNumber of substrings:\n\nLength 1: 3 substrings, each contributes 1 way → 3.\n\nLength 2: 2 substrings, each contributes 1 way → 2.\n\nLength 3: 1 substring, contributes 4 ways → 4.\n\nTotal 3 + 2 + 4 = 9? But the sample says 7. Wait, that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample output for the first example is 7. So according to that, the total is 7. But according to my calculation, it's 3+2+4=9. So clearly, my understanding is incorrect.\n\nAh! Oh right! The problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each such sequence is a sequence of letters, where each letter is represented by a valid Morse code. And the sequences are formed by splitting a substring of S into valid Morse codes. So each such split corresponds to a sequence. However, the same sequence can be formed by different substrings. Wait no, the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nBut the way the problem is phrased, it's the count of all possible sequences that can be formed by any of the substrings. However, sequences that are formed by different substrings but are the same sequence would be counted once. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences... that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So for example, if two different substrings can be split into the same sequence of letters, then that sequence is counted once. Or is it counted multiple times?\n\nNo, that's not correct. The problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So for example, if two different substrings can be split into the same sequence of letters, that sequence is still counted once. But according to the sample explanation, \"TT\" is considered as a sequence. So the sample counts all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse codes. However, the same sequence can be formed in multiple ways (different substrings and/or different splits), but each unique sequence is counted once.\n\nWait that's not possible. Because the sample explanation shows that the answer is 7, which includes \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". Each of these is a unique sequence. So the count is the number of unique sequences. But that seems impossible, given that the same sequence can be formed from different substrings. For example, the substring \"1\" (position 1) and \"1\" (position 2) both correspond to T. So the sequence \"T\" is counted once, not twice. So the problem is asking for the count of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any of the substrings of S. However, that's not the case in the sample explanation. Because the sample explanation lists \"T\" once, even though there are three substrings that are \"1\".\n\nBut the sample's output after three steps is 7, which includes the three \"T\" sequences (but they are considered as one unique sequence). But that would not make sense. So perhaps my initial understanding is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not counting unique sequences but the total number of possible sequences (including duplicates). For example, if there are two different substrings that can be split into the same sequence, then that sequence is counted twice. But according to the sample explanation, in the first example, the answer is 7. Let's re-examine the sample explanation:\n\nThe sample says after appending \"111\", the sequences are:\n\n- T (from \"1\")\n- M (from \"11\")\n- O (from \"111\")\n- TT (from \"11\" split into two Ts)\n- TM (from \"111\" split into T and M)\n- MT (from \"111\" split into M and T)\n- TTT (from \"111\" split into three Ts)\n\nSo the total is 7 sequences. However, there are also other substrings, like the second \"1\" (which is T) and the third \"1\" (also T). But those are considered as individual sequences. But according to the sample explanation, they are not counted as separate entries. Wait, why?\n\nAh! Wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each such sequence is a sequence of letters, and the question is how many such sequences exist. So the same sequence can be formed by multiple substrings, but it's counted once. For example, if there are two substrings that both can be split into the sequence \"T\", then \"T\" is counted once. But according to the sample explanation, \"T\" is counted once. However, the sample output for the first case is 7, which includes \"T\" once. But according to the sample explanation, there are three substrings that are \"1\" (each of which is T), but they are all part of the same sequence. Hence, the problem is not about counting the number of ways to split the substrings, but the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any of the substrings.\n\nBut this seems very different from the initial thought. How can we compute that?\n\nThis changes everything. Now, the problem is to find the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any substring of S, where each letter in the sequence is represented by a valid Morse code (i.e., not in the forbidden list). \n\nBut how to compute this? Because the same sequence can be formed in multiple ways. For example, the sequence \"T\" can be formed by any occurrence of the substring \"1\" in S. But we need to count it once. So the problem becomes a matter of tracking all unique sequences generated by all possible substrings, and their possible splits into valid Morse codes.\n\nBut this seems computationally challenging. For example, if S is very long, the number of possible sequences could be enormous. However, the constraints on m are 3000, so perhaps we need an efficient way to track the unique sequences.\n\nBut how can we do that? For each substring, we need to generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting it into valid Morse codes. Then, collect all these sequences and count the unique ones. But for large S, this approach would be impossible due to the exponential number of sequences.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n1\n1\n1\n\nSample Output 1:\n1\n3\n7\n\nAfter each step:\n\nStep 1: S is \"1\". The only substring is \"1\", which is valid. So the sequence is \"T\" → count 1.\n\nStep 2: S is \"11\". Substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"11\". The first two substrings are valid, each contributing \"T\". The third substring \"11\" is valid (M). So the sequences are \"T\", \"M\", and \"TT\" (from splitting \"11\" into two Ts). But according to the output after step 2, the answer is 3. Which would be the count of \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\".\n\nSo the answer after step 2 is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the count is the number of distinct sequences. So the problem requires us to find the number of unique sequences that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse codes.\n\nBut how to track this efficiently?\n\nThis seems very challenging. Because for each new character added to S, we need to consider all new substrings that end at this character, and for each such substring, generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting it into valid Morse codes, and add them to a set of unique sequences. Then, the answer is the size of this set.\n\nBut with S up to 3000 characters, and for each step, the number of substrings is O(i), and for each substring, generating all possible sequences, this approach would be O(m^2 * k), where k is the average number of sequences per substring. For m=3000, this would be computationally infeasible.\n\nThus, there must be another way. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible substring, the set of sequences generated by splitting it into valid Morse codes can be represented as the union of all possible sequences generated by splitting that substring. However, the problem is to count the number of unique sequences across all substrings.\n\nBut how to model this with dynamic programming?\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider that each time we add a new character to S, we can process all new substrings that end at this position. For each such substring, we can generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting it. But to avoid duplicates, we need to track all sequences that have been generated before.\n\nBut even this approach would be too slow for m=3000. For example, for each new character, there are up to 4 new substrings (since the maximum length is 4). For each of these substrings, we can generate all possible sequences. However, the number of possible sequences depends on the number of ways to split the substring into valid codes.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find that the set of sequences is the same as the set of all possible sequences generated by the entire string up to each step. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about unique sequences but about the total number of sequences (including duplicates). But this contradicts the sample explanation. Let me recheck the first sample:\n\nAfter step 3, the answer is 7. According to the sample explanation, there are 7 sequences. If the count was the total number of sequences (including duplicates), then for the first step, it's 1 (correct). For the second step, the substrings are \"1\" (T), \"1\" (T), and \"11\" (M, TT). So the total sequences would be 1 (from first \"1\") + 1 (from second \"1\") + 1 (from \"11\" split as M) + 1 (from \"11\" split as TT) → total 4. But the sample output after step 2 is 3. So that suggests that the count is unique sequences.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to count the number of unique sequences that can be formed by any of the substrings of S, where each letter in the sequence is represented by a valid Morse code.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find an efficient way to track these sequences.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem using a trie or some kind of automaton that tracks the possible sequences. But even this may be challenging.\n\nAnother observation: Each sequence is determined by the sequence of Morse codes. Since each Morse code is a string of 1-4 bits (0s and 1s), and each valid Morse code corresponds to a unique letter. So the sequence of letters is uniquely determined by the sequence of Morse code strings. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of unique sequences of valid Morse code strings that are substrings of S.\n\nEach such sequence is formed by splitting a substring of S into valid Morse codes. For example, the substring \"111\" can be split into \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", or \"1\", \"11\", or \"11\", \"1\", or \"111\".\n\nSo, the problem is to find the number of unique sequences of valid Morse code strings that can be formed by splitting any substring of S.\n\nNow, the question is how to track all possible sequences of valid Morse code strings that can be formed from the substrings of S.\n\nLet's think about dynamic programming again. Let's define a set of all sequences that can be formed up to each position. For example, when processing the i-th character, we can look back at the possible valid Morse codes ending at i (length 1-4), and for each such code, combine it with the sequences formed by the previous positions.\n\nBut the problem is that the sequences are variable-length and can be combined in various ways. However, since the valid Morse codes are fixed, perhaps we can model this with a dynamic programming approach where dp[i] is the set of all sequences that can be formed from the first i characters of S. Then, for each i, we can compute dp[i] by considering the valid codes ending at i and combining them with dp[i - l].\n\nFor example, suppose we have a new character added, making the current string length i. For each l in 1..4 (if the substring of length l ending at i is valid), then we can take all sequences in dp[i - l] and append the new code to them. Additionally, the new code itself is a new sequence.\n\nSo, dp[i] = { s + new_code for s in dp[i - l] } ∪ { new_code }, for all l where the substring of length l is valid.\n\nThen, the total number of unique sequences is the size of the union of all dp[1], dp[2], ..., dp[i], for each step i.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that for each i, the dp[i] could be very large. For example, if the string is all valid codes, then for each i, the number of sequences grows exponentially. For m=3000, this approach would be impossible due to memory and time constraints.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize by noting that the sequences are built from the valid Morse codes, and that the number of valid Morse codes is limited. There are 26 letters, but some codes are invalid. Let me check the forbidden codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So the total number of valid Morse codes is 30 - 4 = 26, which matches the English alphabet. So each valid code corresponds to exactly one letter. Thus, each valid code is a unique string of length 1-4, and each corresponds to a unique letter. So the sequences of letters are determined by sequences of these codes.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of unique sequences of these codes that can be formed by splitting any substring of S.\n\nNow, the key is that the sequences are determined by their code strings. For example, the sequence \"T\" is represented by the code \"1\". The sequence \"TT\" is represented by the codes \"1\" and \"1\", etc.\n\nSo, for the dynamic programming approach, we can model the possible sequences as strings of codes (but since each code is unique, we can represent them as strings). But storing these sequences explicitly is impractical for large m.\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of tracking the actual sequences, track the set of all possible code sequences that end at each position. For example, for each position i, we can keep track of all possible sequences of codes that end at i. Then, the total number of unique sequences is the size of the union of all these sets for all positions up to i.\n\nBut again, with m=3000, this approach may not be feasible unless we find a way to represent these sequences efficiently.\n\nAnother observation: Each time a new character is added, the new substrings that end at this character are of lengths 1 to 4. For each such substring, if it's valid, we can generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting it into valid codes. These sequences are the sequences generated by splitting the substring into valid codes. For example, if the substring is \"11\", then the sequences are [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"11\"].\n\nBut to avoid counting duplicates, we need to collect all sequences generated by all substrings of S up to the current step. However, this approach would require for each new character, checking all possible new substrings and generating their sequences, and adding them to a global set.\n\nBut for m=3000, and for each step, checking up to 4 new substrings, and for each such substring, generating all possible sequences of codes that can be formed by splitting it, this might be manageable if the number of sequences per substring is small.\n\nLet me think about how to generate the sequences for a given substring. For example, the substring is a string of length l (up to 4). We can use dynamic programming for this substring to find all possible code sequences that split it into valid codes.\n\nFor example, for the substring \"111\", we can compute the possible splits:\n\n- Split into [1, 1, 1]\n- Split into [1, 11]\n- Split into [11, 1]\n- Split into [111]\n\nEach of these corresponds to a sequence of codes. So for this substring, there are four sequences.\n\nBut how to compute this for a substring of length up to 4? For a substring of length l, the number of possible splits is O(2^l), but since l is small (up to 4), this is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Maintain a global set of all unique sequences generated so far.\n- For each step, when we add a new character to S, we look at all new substrings that end at this position (i.e., the substrings of length 1, 2, 3, 4 ending at this position, provided they are within the string length).\n- For each such substring, check if it's a valid Morse code (i.e., not in the forbidden list and length between 1 and 4).\n- For each valid substring, generate all possible sequences of codes that can be formed by splitting it into valid codes.\n- Add these sequences to the global set.\n- After processing all new substrings, the answer for this step is the size of the global set.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences for a given substring?\n\nWe can use dynamic programming for each substring. For example, for a substring s of length l, we can compute all possible sequences of codes that split s into valid codes. This can be done recursively or iteratively.\n\nLet's think of the function generate_sequences(s) which returns a set of sequences (represented as tuples of code strings) that can be formed by splitting s into valid codes.\n\nFor example, generate_sequences(\"11\") would return { (\"1\", \"1\"), (\"11\") }.\n\nTo compute this, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define for a substring s, dp_sub[i] as the set of sequences that can be formed from the first i characters of s. Then, for each i, we can look back up to 4 positions (if the substring from j to i is valid, then for each sequence in dp_sub[j], we can append the code s[j:i]).\n\nThe base case is dp_sub[0] = empty sequence. Then, for each i from 1 to len(s):\n\ndp_sub[i] = union of { seq + (code) for seq in dp_sub[i - l] }, where code is the substring s[i-l:i] and is valid, for l in 1 to 4.\n\nBut since the length of s is up to 4, this is manageable.\n\nOnce we compute dp_sub[len(s)], the set of sequences for the entire s is dp_sub[len(s)]. However, we also need to consider all possible substrings of s? No, because the generate_sequences function is for the entire substring s, and the sequences generated by splitting s into valid codes. Each of these sequences is a unique sequence of codes that can be formed from this particular substring. However, the same sequence can be generated from other substrings as well, which is why we need to collect them in a global set.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize a global set 'all_sequences' as empty.\n\nFor each step from 1 to m:\n\n   Append the new character to S.\n\n   For l in 1 to 4:\n\n      if the current length of S is >= l:\n\n         substring = last l characters of S\n\n         if substring is valid (not in forbidden list and length between 1-4):\n\n             generate all sequences that can be formed by splitting this substring into valid codes.\n\n             add these sequences to 'all_sequences'.\n\n   After processing all l, output the size of 'all_sequences'.\n\nBut this approach would miss sequences that are formed by splitting substrings that are not the entire substring. For example, consider the substring \"111\" (length 3). It can be split into \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\", which is a sequence of three codes. But also, the substring \"11\" (the first two characters) can be split into \"1\" + \"1\", which is a sequence. However, the current approach for each step would generate sequences for all possible substrings that end at the current position. But the way the code is written, for each new character, we check all substrings ending at that position (of length 1-4), and generate all sequences for those substrings. However, this way, all possible substrings are processed as they are added. For example, when the third character is added, the substrings of length 1, 2, 3 are considered. For each of these substrings, their sequences are generated and added to the global set. So this approach would capture all possible substrings of S up to the current step.\n\nYes! Because every substring of S is processed exactly once when the last character of the substring is added. For example, the substring s[0..k] is processed when the (k+1)th character is added. So by checking for each new character all possible substrings ending at that position, we cover all substrings of S.\n\nTherefore, this approach should work. Now, the next challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nNow, the main steps are:\n\n1. Preprocess the forbidden codes. The forbidden codes are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So for any substring, we need to check if it is in this set.\n\n2. For each new character added to S, check for substrings ending at this position of lengths 1-4. For each such substring, if it is valid, generate all possible sequences of codes that can be formed by splitting it into valid codes, and add them to the global set.\n\n3. For each such substring, generate the sequences using dynamic programming as described earlier.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's think of the function generate_sequences(s). For example, given the string s, which is a substring of S (like \"111\"), we need to generate all possible sequences of valid codes that can be formed by splitting s into valid codes.\n\nLet's implement this function using dynamic programming. For example:\n\ndef generate_sequences(s):\n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    n = len(s)\n    dp = [set() for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0].add(())  # empty sequence\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i - l >= 0:\n                substr = s[i-l:i]\n                if substr not in forbidden and len(substr) >= 1 and len(substr) <=4:\n                    for seq in dp[i - l]:\n                        new_seq = seq + (substr,)\n                        dp[i].add(new_seq)\n    return dp[n]\n\nWait, but for the given s, the substrings that are valid are checked. However, in this code, for each position i in the s (which is of length n), we look back l steps (1-4), and if the substring is valid, then we take all sequences from dp[i-l] and append the current code.\n\nBut for example, for the substring \"111\", the code will generate sequences:\n\nAt i=1 (first character):\n\nCheck l=1. substr is \"1\", which is valid. So dp[1] = { ( \"1\", ) }.\n\nAt i=2:\n\nCheck l=1: substr is \"1\", valid. Take dp[1] sequences and append \"1\" → ( \"1\", \"1\" ). Also check l=2: substr is \"11\", which is valid. Take dp[0] → add (\"11\", ). So dp[2] is { (\"1\", \"1\"), (\"11\", ) }.\n\nAt i=3:\n\nCheck l=1: substr is \"1\", valid. Take dp[2] sequences and append \"1\" → (\"1\", \"1\", \"1\"), (\"11\", \"1\"). Check l=2: substr is \"11\" (positions 2-3). Take dp[1] sequences → (\"1\", \"11\"). Check l=3: substr is \"111\", valid. Take dp[0] → (\"111\", ). So dp[3] contains all these sequences. So the total sequences are:\n\n(\"1\", \"1\", \"1\"), (\"11\", \"1\"), (\"1\", \"11\"), (\"111\").\n\nWhich is four sequences, as expected.\n\nSo this function would generate all possible sequences for the given s.\n\nOnce we have this function, for each substring that is valid, we can generate all sequences and add them to the global set. But since the same sequence can be generated from multiple substrings, we need to collect them in a global set.\n\nHowever, for m=3000, and for each step, up to 4 substrings, each of length up to 4, and each generating up to say 2^4=16 sequences (but probably less), this approach may be feasible.\n\nBut there's a problem: the sequences are stored as tuples of strings (each element is a code string). For example, the sequence \"T\" is represented as (\"1\", ), \"TT\" is (\"1\", \"1\"), etc. Adding these to a global set would allow us to count unique sequences.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead m, then read m lines of 0/1.\n\nInitialize S as an empty string.\n\nInitialize a global set, say all_sequences = set()\n\nFor each step:\n\n   append the new character to S.\n\n   for l in 1 to 4:\n\n      if len(S) >= l:\n\n         substr = S[-l:]\n\n         if substr is not in forbidden and len(substr) is between 1 and 4 (but l is between 1-4, so len is l):\n\n             generate all sequences for substr using the generate_sequences function.\n\n             add each sequence (as a tuple) to all_sequences.\n\n   output the length of all_sequences modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the forbidden codes are four specific strings. So for substr, we need to check if substr is in forbidden. So the forbidden set is {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}.\n\nBut in the code, the substr is a string of 0s and 1s. So for example, if the current substring is \"111\", which is not forbidden, then it's valid. So the check is whether substr is in forbidden.\n\nBut for the code to be valid, it must have length between 1 and 4, which is ensured by l being between 1 and 4. So the code is valid if substr is not in forbidden.\n\nSo the code for checking validity is:\n\nif substr not in forbidden.\n\nBut then, for example, the substr \"0000\" is not in forbidden, but it's length 4. So it's valid. So that's allowed.\n\nSo, the code for the generate_sequences function needs to be called only for substrings that are not in forbidden. Because otherwise, the code cannot be used as a valid Morse code for a single letter.\n\nNow, the generate_sequences function generates all possible sequences of valid codes that split the substring into valid codes. For example, if the substring is \"111\", which is valid, then generate_sequences will generate all possible splits into valid codes. But during the generate_sequences function, when checking substrings of the current s (the substring of S), we need to ensure that each code in the split is valid. However, the generate_sequences function uses the same forbidden set to check for validity of each code.\n\nWait, no. The generate_sequences function is called only for substrings that are themselves valid (i.e., not in forbidden). But when splitting into smaller codes, those smaller codes may be invalid. For example, consider the substring \"111\", which is valid. Suppose we split it into \"1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of unique sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code. Each modification to `S` appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1'), and after each modification, we must determine how many unique sequences of letters can be formed from any substring of `S`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Forbidden Morse Codes**: Identify the four invalid Morse code strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming for Substrings**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible substrings ending at that character (lengths 1 to 4). If a substring is valid (not in the forbidden list), generate all possible sequences of valid Morse codes that can be formed by splitting this substring.\n3. **Set for Unique Sequences**: Use a set to keep track of all unique sequences of Morse codes generated from valid substrings.

This ensures that each sequence is counted only once, even if it can be formed from multiple substrings.\n6. **Output**: After processing each operation, the number of unique sequences is printed modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that all valid sequences are considered while avoiding duplicates using a set.",
