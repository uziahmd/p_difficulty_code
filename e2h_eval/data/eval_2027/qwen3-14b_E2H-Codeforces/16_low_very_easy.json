Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the blocks are structured. Each road divides the plane into regions. The key here is that moving between blocks requires sharing a common border, which implies that two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road. So, the problem is essentially modeling the blocks as nodes in a graph, where edges exist between blocks that share a common border. Then, the task is to find the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do we model the blocks? Since there are n roads, the number of blocks can be very large. However, considering that each road is a line, the arrangement of blocks can be thought of in terms of their positions relative to each road. \n\nWait, but how do we represent each block uniquely? Well, for each line (road), a point can be on one side or the other. So, for each road, we can determine whether the home point is on one side or the other. Similarly for the university. But since there are multiple roads, each block can be represented by a set of signs (positive or negative) for each road's equation evaluated at the point. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So, for each road, the home point will satisfy a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i > 0 or < 0. So, each block can be uniquely determined by the sign of each road's equation evaluated at that point. However, since there are n roads, there are 2^n possible combinations of signs. But that's way too big for n=300. So, that approach is not feasible directly.\n\nBut maybe we don't need to model all possible blocks. Instead, think about the problem as a graph where each node is a region (block), and edges exist between regions that are adjacent (i.e., separated by exactly one road). Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home region and the university region. \n\nHowever, with n up to 300, the number of regions could be huge. So, we need a smarter way to model this. \n\nAlternative approach: Think of the problem as a BFS problem, where each state is determined by the current position's relation to the roads. But how?\n\nWait, the key insight here is that two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if two regions are separated by exactly one road, then they are adjacent. If they differ in more than one road's sign, then there's no direct adjacency. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration. Each step corresponds to flipping the sign of exactly one road. \n\nWait, that's an interesting idea. Let me think again. Suppose that each region can be represented by a binary vector of length n, where each bit indicates whether the point is on one side or the other of the road. Then, two regions are adjacent if their vectors differ in exactly one bit. Because crossing that road would flip that bit. \n\nBut how does that work? Let's take two regions that differ in exactly one road. For example, suppose region A has sign + for road 1 and region B has sign - for road 1. All other roads are same. Then, these two regions are separated by road 1, so they are adjacent. Therefore, you can move between them in one step. \n\nConversely, if two regions differ in two roads, then they are not adjacent. Because to get from one to the other, you need to cross two roads. But that would require moving through regions that differ by one road each. \n\nTherefore, the problem becomes similar to finding the Hamming distance between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector. But wait, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the two vectors. Because each step can flip exactly one bit. \n\nWait, that seems too easy. Let me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are 0x +1y +0 = 0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x +0y +0 = 0 (x=0).\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nCheck each road:\n\nRoad 1: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 >0 → sign is +.\n\nRoad 2: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1>0 → sign is +.\n\nSo the home's sign vector is [+, +].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: 0*(-1",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common border between blocks, which corresponds to crossing a single road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that each block can be represented by a binary vector indicating the side of each road on which the block lies. Moving from one block to an adjacent block involves crossing exactly one road, which flips the corresponding bit in the binary vector.\n2. **Sign Determination**: For both the home and university positions, determine the sign (positive or negative) of each road equation evaluated at these points. This gives us two binary vectors representing their respective blocks.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is the Hamming distance between these two binary vectors. The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    \n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Determine the sign vector for home and university\n    def get_signs(x, y, roads):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n        return signs\n    \n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1, roads)\n    uni_signs = get_signs(x2, y2, roads)\n    \n    # Calculate Hamming distance\n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, uni_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n    \n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into home coordinates, university coordinates, and the list of roads.\n2. **Sign Calculation**: For both the home and university positions, we calculate the sign of each road equation. This determines which side of each road the point lies on.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university positions is computed. This distance directly gives the minimum number of steps needed, as each differing bit represents crossing a road to move to an adjacent block.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution using simple arithmetic and comparison operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
