Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the blocks are structured. Each road divides the plane into regions. The key here is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, but only if they share a common boundary segment. So, two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road. But how do I model this?\n\nThe main idea is to model the blocks as nodes in a graph, where edges exist between blocks that are adjacent. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block. However, since there can be an infinite number of blocks, we can't model them all directly. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model the problem using the roads and the positions of home and university. Since the home and university are not on any road, they are in some block. Each time you cross a road, you move to a neighboring block. The number of steps required is the minimal number of roads you have to cross to get from the home block to the university block. \n\nBut how do we determine which roads separate the home and university? Let me think. For each road, the home and university can be on the same side or opposite sides. If they are on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road would be part of the path. However, since each step can cross one road, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Wait, no. Because maybe there's a way to cross roads in a way that some roads are crossed multiple times, but the minimal steps would be determined by the minimal number of crossings required. \n\nAlternatively, think of each block as being represented by the set of signs (positive or negative) of the equations for each road. For example, for each road, the home is either on the positive side or negative side of that road. Similarly for the university. The problem then becomes finding the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration. Each crossing of a road flips the sign for that road. \n\nBut how does that relate to the steps? Because each step corresponds to moving across a road, which changes the sign for that road. So the minimal steps would be the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. Wait, no. Because if two roads are crossed, maybe they are in different order. But perhaps the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. \n\nWait, suppose that for each road, if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, then that road must be crossed an odd number of times. But since each step crosses exactly one road, the minimal steps would be the number of roads where home and university are on opposite sides. Because each such road needs to be crossed once. However, this might not be correct. For example, imagine two roads that cross each other. Suppose the home is in a block that is on the positive side of both roads, and the university is on the negative side of both. Then, you can cross one road, then the other, so two steps. Which is exactly the number of roads that separate them. But if the home and university are on opposite sides of one road, but same for another, then you need to cross that one road once. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them. \n\nSo perhaps the answer is the number of roads where home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nBut wait, what if there are overlapping roads? Or roads that are arranged such that crossing one road can affect multiple separations. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, each road is unique and not overlapping. But how does that affect the problem? \n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose there are two roads, which cross each other. The home is in one of the four regions formed by the two roads. The university is in the opposite region. Then, the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. So the answer would be 2 steps. Which is indeed the case. Because you have to cross both roads once each. \n\nAnother example: if there are three roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of one road, but same for the others. Then the answer is 1. \n\nSo the minimal steps is the number of roads where home and university are on opposite sides of the road. \n\nIf this is true, then the solution is straightforward. For each road, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the answer. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each such road must be crossed once. And since each step crosses exactly",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves crossing a road, and the minimum number of steps is determined by the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move between these regions. The minimum number of steps required is the count of such roads that separate the home and university.\n\n2. **Check Road Separation**: For each road, we check if the home and university are on opposite sides. This can be determined using the sign of the result of plugging the coordinates of the home and university into the road equation.\n\n3. **Count Opposite Sides**: For each road, if the signs of the results for the home and university coordinates are different, increment the count. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    \n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into home coordinates, university coordinates, and the list of roads.\n- **Check Separation**: For each road, compute the value of the road equation at the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n- **Count Roads**: The count of such roads where the home and university are on opposite sides is printed as the result, which represents the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.",
