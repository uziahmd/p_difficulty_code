    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the problem. Let's denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since k is non-negative, x and y are at least a and b respectively, but since k can be zero, maybe even smaller than that if a and b are different. Wait, no. Because if a is 5 and b is 10, then for k=0, x is 5 and y is 10. But if a is 6 and b is 10, then adding k=2 gives 8 and 12. Their LCM is 24.\n\nBut how do I find the optimal k?\n\nFirst, note that the difference between x and y is fixed. Because x = a +k, y = b +k. So y - x = b - a. Let me call this difference d. So, if a and b are such that a > b, then d is negative. But perhaps it's easier to take absolute value. Wait, but the actual difference is (b -a). Let me think: suppose a < b. Then, when we add k, the numbers x and y are a +k and b +k. The difference between them is (b -a). So, for example, if a is 6 and b is 10, then the difference is 4. So x and y differ by 4. So, in this case, the two numbers are (x) and (x +4). So their LCM is LCM(x, x+4). Which depends on x.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x such that x and x +d (where d is the difference between b and a) have the minimal LCM. Then, the k is x -a (since x = a +k => k = x -a). But since x must be at least a (if k is non-negative), but wait, if a is larger than b, then d is negative. Let me rephrase:\n\nLet me compute d = b - a. Then, if we let x = a +k, then y = x +d. So, regardless of whether d is positive or negative, the two numbers are x and x +d. But since k must be non-negative, x must be >= a. Also, since y = x +d, if d is negative (i.e., a > b), then x +d could be less than x. But in any case, the LCM of x and x +d.\n\nWait, but the LCM of x and x +d is the same as the LCM of x and x +d. But since d is fixed, perhaps we can find x such that x and x +d have minimal LCM.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find x >= min(a, b) such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Then, k is x - a (but only if x >= a, and x +d >= b? Wait, no. Because if d is positive, then x +d = (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k. Which is correct. So, the value of x can be chosen such that x >= a (since k is non-negative) and x +d >= b? Well, if d is positive, then x +d = b +k. Since k is non-negative, then x +d = b +k >= b. But since x = a +k, then x can be anything >= a. So, for example, if a is 6 and b is 10, then d is 4, and x can be any number >=6. Then x +d is >= 10.\n\nBut what if d is negative? Let's say a is 10 and b is 6. Then d = -4. Then y = x +d = x -4. Since x = a +k = 10 +k. So y = 10 +k -4 = 6 +k. Which is correct. But in this case, since y = 6 +k, which is >=6 (since k >=0). So x is 10 +k, which is >=10. So for this case, x is >=10, and y is >=6. But since the LCM of x and y is the same as LCM(y, x), we can just treat d as the absolute difference. Wait, but the problem is that when d is negative, the difference between x and y is |d|, but the way they are ordered changes. However, the LCM is symmetric. So perhaps we can assume without loss of generality that d is non-negative. Because if d is negative, then swapping a and b would make d positive, and the problem is the same. Because LCM(a +k, b +k) is same as LCM(b +k, a +k). Therefore, perhaps we can first compute d = abs(b - a). Then, the problem reduces to finding x such that x and x +d (or x -d, depending on the sign) have minimal LCM. But perhaps the key is to take the absolute difference. Let me think.\n\nSo, let me first compute d = abs(b -a). Then, the problem becomes: find x such that x and x +d (or x -d, but since x must be >= a, but if d is the absolute difference, then perhaps I can take x as the smaller of the two numbers. For example, if a was larger than b, then d = a -b, and then the numbers are x = a +k and y = b +k = x -d. So the numbers are x and x -d. But x must be >= a, and x -d must be >=b. But since d is a -b, then x -d = (a +k) - (a -b) = b +k. Which is >=b since k >=0. So, in this case, x is >= a and x -d is >=b. But since x -d = y, and d is the absolute difference, the problem becomes to find x such that LCM(x, x -d) is minimized. But since LCM(x, x -d) is same as LCM(x -d, x), which is same as LCM(x, x -d). So, regardless of which one is larger, the LCM is same. So, perhaps the problem can be considered as: given a difference d, find x such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimal, where x is >= some value. Wait, but if d is the absolute difference, then in the case where a < b, then x is a +k, and the other number is x +d. So, the problem is to find x >= a, such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. And then k = x -a.\n\nAlternatively, if a > b, then d = a -b, and the numbers are x = a +k and y = x -d = b +k. So again, the LCM is LCM(x, x -d), which is same as LCM(x -d, x). But since x -d is (a +k) -d = a +k - (a -b) = b +k. Which is same as the original problem. So regardless of which is bigger, the problem is to find x such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized, where d is the absolute difference between a and b. Wait, no. Because in the case where a > b, then d = a -b. Then, the two numbers are x and x -d. Which is x and x -d. So, the LCM of x and x -d. Which is same as the LCM of x -d and x. So, perhaps, regardless of which is bigger, the problem is to find the minimal LCM of two numbers which differ by d. So, the problem reduces to: given d, find the minimal LCM of two numbers that differ by d. And then find the minimal k such that the numbers are x and x +d (or x -d, but the LCM is same).\n\nSo the main problem is to find x such that x and x +d have minimal LCM. Then, the k is x -a (assuming that a is the smaller one?), but wait, no. Because in the case where a is smaller than b, then x is a +k, and the other number is x +d (since d = b -a). So, the x is a +k, and the other is x +d = a +k + (b -a) = b +k. Which is correct. So, the problem is to find x such that x and x +d have minimal LCM. Then, the k is x -a. But x must be >= a (since k >=0). Also, x +d must be >=b. But since x >=a, and d = b -a, then x +d = a +k + (b -a) = b +k >=b, since k >=0.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding x >= a (assuming that a <=b, but if not, then perhaps x >=b?), but perhaps it's easier to take d as the absolute difference. Let me think again. Suppose that a and b are arbitrary. Let me compute d = abs(a -b). Let me assume that a <=b. Then, d = b -a. Then, the problem is to find x >=a such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Then, k = x -a. But if a was larger than b, then d = a -b, and the problem is to find x >=b such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Wait, no. Because if a >b, then the difference is d = a -b. Then, the numbers are x = a +k and y = b +k. So, x - y = a -b =d. So, x = y +d. So, the LCM of x and y is LCM(y +d, y) = LCM(y, y +d). So, in this case, the problem is to find y such that LCM(y, y +d) is minimized. But since y = b +k, and k >=0, then y >=b. So, the problem is to find y >=b such that LCM(y, y +d) is minimized. Then, k = y -b. But since x = y +d, which equals a +k. So, substituting y = b +k, x = b +k +d = a +k (since d =a -b). So, yes.\n\nSo regardless of which is larger, the problem is to find a number m (either x or y) such that LCM(m, m +d) is minimized, where m is >= the minimum of a and b, and d is the absolute difference between a and b. Then, the k is m - min(a, b).\n\nWait, but for example, in the first sample input, a=6, b=10. So d =4. The problem is to find m >=6 such that LCM(m, m +4) is minimized. Then, the k is m -6. For m=6, LCM(6, 10) is 30. For m=7, LCM(7, 11) is 77. For m=8, LCM(8, 12) is 24. For m=9, LCM(9,13)=117. For m=2, but m has to be >=6. So the minimal is m=8, which gives k=2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 5 and 10. Then d is 5. The problem is to find m >=5 such that LCM(m, m+5) is minimized. For m=5, LCM(5,10)=10. Which is the minimal possible. So k=0. Which matches the third sample.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given d, find the minimal m >= m_min (where m_min is min(a, b)), such that LCM(m, m +d) is minimized, and then compute k = m - m_min.\n\nSo now the problem becomes: how to find m >= m_min such that LCM(m, m +d) is as small as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe LCM of two numbers m and m +d is equal to (m*(m +d)) / gcd(m, m +d). Since m and m +d differ by d, their GCD is the same as GCD(m, d). Because GCD(m, m +d) = GCD(m, d). So, let me denote g = GCD(m, d). Then, the LCM is (m*(m +d))/g.\n\nSo to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of m and d, and also find m such that m*(m +d) is as small as possible.\n\nBut how to find such m?\n\nLet me think. Since the GCD of m and d is g, then m must be a multiple of g. Let me write m = g * x. Then, since d = g * k (since g divides d, because GCD(m, d) is g). Wait, no. Wait, d is fixed. Let me think. Let me denote that g = GCD(m, d). Then, since g divides d, d = g * k, for some integer k. Also, m = g * x, where x and k are coprime (since GCD(m, d) is g, so GCD(gx, gk) = g*GCD(x, k) = g → GCD(x, k) = 1).\n\nSo, substituting into the LCM formula: LCM(m, m +d) = LCM(gx, gx + gk) = g * LCM(x, x +k). Since LCM(gx, gx + gk) = g * LCM(x, x +k). Because LCM(a, b) = LCM(a/gcd, b/gcd) * gcd.\n\nBut since x and x +k are coprime? Because k = d/g, and since x and k are coprime (because GCD(x, k) = 1). Wait, x and k are coprime. Then, x and x +k have GCD equal to GCD(x, x +k) = GCD(x, k) = 1. So their LCM is x*(x +k). Thus, the LCM of m and m +d is g * x*(x +k) = g * x (x + (d/g)).\n\nBut since k = d/g, then x*(x + d/g) = x(x + (d/g)).\n\nSo the LCM is g * x * (x + (d/g)).\n\nBut since d is fixed, and g is a divisor of d, perhaps we can find for each possible divisor g of d, the minimal value of x(x + (d/g)), and then multiply by g.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nLet me think. For each possible divisor g of d, we can consider that m is a multiple of g. Then, x is m/g, and x must be such that GCD(x, k) = 1, where k = d/g. Because earlier, since GCD(x, k) = 1.\n\nBut since k = d/g, and since d is fixed, for each possible divisor g of d, we can find the minimal value of x(x + k), where x is a positive integer such that x >= m_min/g (since m = g*x >= m_min).\n\nWait, but m_min is the minimum of a and b. Let me denote m_min as the minimum of a and b. So m must be >= m_min. So x >= ceil(m_min / g). But since m = g * x, and x is integer.\n\nBut how do I choose x for each possible g?\n\nFor each possible divisor g of d, the minimal x(x +k) occurs when x is as small as possible. Because x and x +k are positive integers, and their product increases as x increases. Wait, but x can be chosen as small as possible, but subject to x >= m_min/g, and also ensuring that x and k are coprime.\n\nWait, but k = d/g. So, for each divisor g of d, we can compute k = d/g. Then, we need to find x such that x >= m_min/g, and GCD(x, k) = 1. Then, the minimal x(x +k) would be achieved when x is the smallest possible such that x >= m_min/g and GCD(x, k) = 1.\n\nBecause for x, the product x(x +k) increases as x increases. So the minimal x that satisfies the condition will give the minimal product.\n\nSo for each divisor g of d, the minimal possible value of the LCM for that g is g multiplied by the minimal x(x +k), where x is the minimal possible value (as explained above).\n\nTherefore, the approach would be:\n\n1. Compute d = abs(a - b).\n\n   If d is zero, then a = b. Then, the LCM of a +k and a +k is a +k. To minimize this, we choose k = 0. So output is 0.\n\n   Otherwise:\n\n2. Find all possible divisors of d.\n\n   For each divisor g of d, compute k = d/g.\n\n   Then, find the minimal x >= m_min/g such that GCD(x, k) = 1. Then compute the corresponding LCM value as g * x * (x +k).\n\n   Then, among all these possibilities, find the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple possibilities have the same LCM, choose the one with the smallest k (which would correspond to the smallest x, etc.)\n\nWait, but how do I find all the divisors of d? For d up to 1e9, but since the problem allows a and b up to 1e9, d can be up to 1e9. So factorizing d may be time-consuming if done naively, but for 1e9, trial division is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, since the optimal m is likely to be near m_min, perhaps we can find candidates for m.\n\nBut back to the approach. Let's proceed.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCase 1: a == b. Then, the LCM of a +k and a +k is a +k. To minimize this, set k =0. Output 0.\n\nCase 2: a != b. Let d = abs(a -b). Let m_min = min(a, b).\n\nWe need to find m >= m_min such that LCM(m, m +d) is minimized.\n\nAs discussed, for each possible divisor g of d, we can generate a candidate m = g * x, where x is the minimal possible value >= m_min/g, and GCD(x, k) = 1 (with k = d/g).\n\nBut why are we considering all the divisors of d?\n\nBecause for any m, the GCD(m, d) is a divisor of d. So, for each possible divisor g of d, we can generate a candidate m that is a multiple of g, and find the best x for that g.\n\nOnce we have all possible candidates from all divisors, we can compare them and choose the one with minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g of d:\n\n   - compute k_val = d / g.\n\n   - Now, find the minimal x >= x_min (x_min = ceil(m_min / g)) such that GCD(x, k_val) = 1.\n\n   - Then, the candidate m is g * x.\n\n   - The corresponding LCM is g * x * (x + k_val).\n\n   - Also, note that since k_val = d/g, and x is chosen such that GCD(x, k_val) = 1, then the LCM of x and x +k_val is x*(x +k_val) as they are coprime.\n\n- Then, collect all these candidates, and choose the one with the minimal LCM. In case of tie, choose the one with the smallest m (since k = m - m_min, so smaller m gives smaller k).\n\nBut also, there's another possibility. What if the optimal x is not found through this method?\n\nWait, for example, suppose that m is not a multiple of any divisor of d. But since GCD(m, d) is a divisor of d, that can't happen. So for every m, GCD(m, d) is a divisor of d, so the approach covers all possibilities.\n\nTherefore, generating all divisors of d and considering all possibilities for each divisor should cover all possible candidates.\n\nNow, the next question is how to generate all divisors of d.\n\nBut first, let's think about the example where a=6, b=10. Then d=4. The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each divisor g:\n\nCase g=1:\n\nk_val = 4/1 =4.\n\nWe need to find x >= m_min/g = 6/1=6. So x >=6. Find the minimal x >=6 such that GCD(x,4)=1. The first x is 7 (since 6 and 4 have GCD 2, 7 and 4 have GCD 1). Then the candidate m is 1 *7 =7. The LCM is 1 *7 * (7 +4) = 77.\n\nCase g=2:\n\nk_val =4/2=2.\n\nx_min is 6/2=3. So x >=3. Find the minimal x >=3 where GCD(x, 2)=1. The first x is 3. Then m=2 *3=6. The LCM is 2 *3*(3 +2) = 2*3*5=30.\n\nCase g=4:\n\nk_val =4/4=1.\n\nx_min is 6/4=1.5 → ceil(1.5) =2. So x >=2. Find the minimal x >=2 where GCD(x, 1)=1. Since GCD(x,1) is always 1, x=2. Then m=4*2=8. LCM is 4*2*(2+1) =4*2*3=24.\n\nSo among these candidates, the minimal LCM is 24, which corresponds to m=8. So k is 8 -6 =2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works for that case.\n\nAnother sample input: 5 and 10. d=5. m_min is 5. Divisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nCase g=1: k_val=5. x_min=5/1=5. Find x >=5 with GCD(x,5)=1. The first x is 5? GCD(5,5)=5, not 1. Next x is 6. GCD(6,5)=1. So m=6. LCM is 1*6*(6+5)=66. But if we take x=5, then GCD(5,5)=5. So in this case, the x is not coprime with k_val. So the candidate would be x=6.\n\nCase g=5: k_val=5/5=1. x_min is 5/5=1. x >=1. Find x with GCD(x,1)=1. x=1. m=5*1=5. LCM is 5*1*(1+1) =5*2=10. Which is better. So the minimal is 10. So k=5-5=0. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the approach works here.\n\nAnother example: input 21 and 31. a=21, b=31. d=10. m_min is 21.\n\nDivisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=1: k_val=10. x_min=21/1=21. Find x >=21 with GCD(x,10)=1. The first x is 21. GCD(21,10)=1. So m=21. LCM is 1*21*(21+10)=21*31=651.\n\ng=2: k_val=5. x_min=21/2=10.5 → ceil to 11. Find x >=11 with GCD(x,5)=1. The first x is 11. GCD(11,5)=1. So m=2*11=22. LCM is 2*11*(11+5) = 2*11*16 = 352.\n\ng=5: k_val=2. x_min=21/5=4.2 → ceil to 5. Find x >=5 with GCD(x,2)=1. First x is 5. GCD(5,2)=1. m=5*5=25. LCM is 5*5*(5+2)=5*5*7=175.\n\ng=10: k_val=1. x_min=21/10=2.1 → ceil to 3. Find x >=3 with GCD(x,1)=1. x=3. m=10*3=30. LCM is 10*3*(3+1) = 10*3*4=120.\n\nSo among these candidates, the minimal is 120. But wait, but the sample output for input 21 31 is 9. Let's check.\n\nWait, the sample input is 21 31. The output is 9. Let's compute for k=9.\n\na +k =21+9=30, b +k =31+9=40. LCM(30,40) is 120. Which matches the LCM from the candidate for g=10. So the minimal LCM is 120. But according to our calculation, the candidate for g=10 gives m=30. Which is a +k =21 +k =30 →k=9. Which is correct. So the code would select this candidate.\n\nBut why isn't there a better candidate? Let's see. Are there other divisors?\n\nYes, but the code considers all divisors. So the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each divisor g of d:\n\n   - Compute k_val = d/g.\n\n   - Compute x_min = ceil(m_min / g). Since m must be >= m_min, and m = g *x, x must be >= ceil(m_min/g).\n\n   - Find the smallest x >=x_min such that GCD(x, k_val) ==1.\n\n   - Compute the candidate m_candidate = g*x.\n\n   - Compute the LCM value as g * x * (x + k_val).\n\nThen, among all such candidates, choose the one with the smallest LCM. If multiple candidates have the same LCM, choose the one with the smallest m_candidate (which leads to the smallest k).\n\nBut how to find x for each g and k_val?\n\nFor each g and k_val, we need to find the minimal x >=x_min where GCD(x, k_val) =1.\n\nHow to find that x?\n\nWell, x starts from x_min. Check if GCD(x, k_val) is 1. If yes, take it. Else, increment x until we find such a number.\n\nBut since k_val can be up to d/g. For example, if d is 1e9, and g is 1, then k_val is 1e9. So x_min can be up to 1e9. But checking each x starting from x_min could be O(1) in practice, since the first x that is coprime with k_val is likely to be close to x_min.\n\nBut for worst cases, what if k_val is 2 and x_min is 2? Then the first x is 3. So it's O(1) steps.\n\nSo for practical purposes, this approach is feasible.\n\nNow, the steps to implement:\n\nFirst, compute d = abs(a -b). If d is zero, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute m_min = min(a, b).\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\n   compute k_val = d // g.\n\n   compute x_min = ceil(m_min / g). Since m = g*x >= m_min → x >= ceil(m_min /g).\n\n   Now find the minimal x >=x_min such that GCD(x, k_val) ==1.\n\n   Once found, compute m_candidate = g *x.\n\n   Compute LCM_candidate = (g *x) * (g*x +d) / GCD(g*x, g*x +d). But earlier analysis shows that this is equal to g *x * (x +k_val).\n\n   Because GCD(m_candidate, m_candidate +d) = GCD(gx, gx +d) = GCD(gx, d) = g * GCD(x, d/g) = g * GCD(x, k_val). But since x and k_val are coprime, this is g*1 =g. So LCM is (gx * (gx +d )) / g = gx * (gx +d)/g = x*(gx +d). But gx +d = gx + (g*k_val) = g(x +k_val). So LCM is x * g (x +k_val) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me recalculate:\n\nOriginal LCM is (m_candidate * (m_candidate +d )) / GCD(m_candidate, m_candidate +d )\n\nBut m_candidate +d = gx +d = gx + (g*k_val) = g(x +k_val).\n\nAnd GCD(gx, g(x +k_val)) = g * GCD(x, x +k_val) = g * GCD(x, k_val) = g*1 =g.\n\nSo LCM is [gx * g(x +k_val)] / g = gx * (x +k_val) = g x (x +k_val).\n\nWhich matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo the LCM_candidate is g * x * (x +k_val).\n\nOnce we have all these candidates, we need to select the one with the minimal LCM_candidate. If there's a tie, we select the one with the smallest m_candidate (since k is m_candidate - m_min, and we want the smallest k).\n\nOnce we have all the candidates, we can compare them and select the best one.\n\nSo, the next step is to generate all divisors of d.\n\nHow to generate all divisors of d?\n\nWell, for that, we can factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all possible products of exponents. But for d up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, for each number up to sqrt(d), check if it divides d. For example:\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(d)) +1):\n\n        if d %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(d//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut note that this returns all divisors of d, including 1 and d.\n\nOnce we have all divisors, we can process each as per the steps above.\n\nNow, for each divisor, generate the candidate.\n\nOnce all candidates are generated, select the best one.\n\nBut also, there's another possibility: what if the optimal m is not covered by any of the divisors? No, because for any m, the GCD(m, d) is a divisor of d, so the approach covers all possibilities.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_k(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0\n\n    d = abs(a - b)\n\n    m_min = min(a, b)\n\n    # generate all divisors of d\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) +1):\n\n        if d %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(d//i)\n\n    divisors = list(divisors)\n\n    # for each divisor g, compute candidate\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = float('inf')\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        k_val = d // g\n\n        x_min = (m_min + g -1) // g  # ceil(m_min/g)\n\n        # find minimal x >=x_min with gcd(x, k_val) ==1\n\n        x = x_min\n\n        while True:\n\n            if math.gcd(x, k_val) ==1:\n\n                break\n\n            x +=1\n\n        m_candidate = g *x\n\n        current_lcm = g * x * (x + k_val)\n\n        # compare with current min\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and m_candidate < best_m_candidate):\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_m_candidate = m_candidate\n\n            best_k = m_candidate - m_min\n\n    return best_k\n\nWait, but in the code, how do we track the best candidate? Also, for each candidate, we need to compare not only the LCM but also the k value in case of ties.\n\nBut in the code, for each candidate, we can compute the k_candidate = m_candidate - m_min. Then, among all candidates, select the one with the smallest LCM, and if there's a tie, the smallest k_candidate.\n\nSo during processing, for each candidate, we can compare:\n\nif current_lcm < current_min:\n\n   update min_lcm and best_k.\n\nelif current_lcm == current_min:\n\n   if current_k is smaller than best_k, update best_k.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitially, min_lcm = infinity, best_k = infinity.\n\nfor each candidate:\n\n   compute current_lcm and current_k.\n\n   if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n       min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n       best_k = current_k\n\n   elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n       if current_k < best_k:\n\n           best_k = current_k\n\nSo that's how we compare.\n\nBut in the code above, the code for generating the candidates may have multiple candidates, and we need to compare them all.\n\nNow, what about when d is zero? That's handled first.\n\nBut what about when d is zero? For example, a =b. Then, the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is a +k. So the minimal is when k is zero. Hence output 0.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 6 10 → d=4.\n\ndivisors of 4: 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=1:\n\nk_val=4.\n\nx_min = (6 +1 -1)//1 =6. Check x=6. GCD(6,4)=2. Not 1. Increment x to 7. GCD(7,4)=1. So m_candidate=7. current_lcm =1 *7 * (7+4) = 77. current_k=7-6=1.\n\ng=2:\n\nk_val=2.\n\nx_min = (6 +2 -1)//2 = (7)//2 =3. So x starts at 3. Check GCD(3,2)=1. So x=3. m_candidate=6. current_lcm=2*3*(3+2) = 2*3*5=30. current_k=6-6=0.\n\ng=4:\n\nk_val=1.\n\nx_min = (6 +4 -1)//4 = (9)//4=2. So x starts at 2. Check GCD(2,1)=1. So m_candidate=4*2=8. current_lcm=4*2*(2+1)=24. current_k=8-6=2.\n\nSo the best is 24, with k=2. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 21 31. d=10.\n\ndivisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n\ng=1: k_val=10. x_min=21. Check x=21. GCD(21,10)=1. So m_candidate=21. current_lcm=1*21*(21+10)=21*31=651. k=0.\n\ng=2: k_val=5. x_min=(21 +2-1)/2 = (22)/2=11. x=11. GCD(11,5)=1. m_candidate=22. LCM=2*11* (11+5) = 2*11*16= 352. k=22-21=1.\n\ng=5: k_val=2. x_min = (21 +5-1)/5 = 25/5=5. x starts at 5. GCD(5,2)=1. m_candidate=5*5=25. LCM=5*5*(5+2)=5*5*7",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized.
