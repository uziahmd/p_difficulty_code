For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to represent the notes and calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order of 12 elements. So, I should assign each note a numerical value based on their position. Like, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, and so on up to H (which is B in some notations, but according to the problem statement, H is the 12th note? Wait, the list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, that's 12 notes. Let me count:\n\nOriginal list: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes. So H is the 12th note. But since it's cyclic, after H comes C again. So for example, the distance between H and C is 1 semitone. But when calculating the distance between two notes, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (Y - X) mod 12? Or wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. So for example, C to E is 4 semitones. Let me check: C (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4). So yes, from C to E is 4 semitones. But if we have E to C, the distance is 8 semitones because you go E to F (1), F to F# (2), etc., up to C. But according to the problem statement, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. So the distance is calculated as (y - x) mod 12, but when you take the positive direction. Wait, no. Because if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y))? Or maybe the distance is (Y - X + 12) % 12? No, because for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Let's see: E is 4, C is 0. So (0 - 4) is -4. But the distance is measured as from X to Y, so if X is E and Y is C, then the distance would be (C - E + 12) mod 12? Wait, but the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So the distance between X and Y is computed as follows: if X is lower than Y, then Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then (Y + 12 - X). So for example, between E and C, since E is higher than C, the distance is (C + 12 - E) = 0 + 12 -4 = 8 semitones. So the way to compute the distance between two notes is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + 12). Or equivalently, (y -x) mod 12? Wait, no. Because (y -x) mod 12 would be (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, in the example given, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. Which is (E - C) mod 12 = 4 mod 12 =4. Correct. Between E and C, (C - E) mod 12 is (-4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So the formula (Y - X) mod 12 gives the correct distance. So that's the key.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its index.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for either a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to an index based on its position in the cyclic sequence of 12 notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Check Permutations**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if the distances between the first and second note (X to Y) and between the second and third note (Y to Z) meet the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Determine Result**: If any permutation matches the major or minor criteria, print the corresponding result. If none match, print \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    return distance(x, y) == 4 and distance(y, z) == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    return distance(x, y) == 3 and distance(y, z) == 4\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input.split()\n    indices = [note_to_index(n) for n in notes]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    \n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` function converts each note to its corresponding index in the list of musical notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `distance` function calculates the semitone distance between two notes using modulo arithmetic to ensure it wraps around the 12-note cycle correctly.\n3. **Triad Checks**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` check if the distances between the notes in a given permutation match the criteria for a major or minor triad, respectively.\n4. **Permutations Check**: By iterating through all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that all possible orderings are checked for both major and minor triads. If none match, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the type of chord, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
