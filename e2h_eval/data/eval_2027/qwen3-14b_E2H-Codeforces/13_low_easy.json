For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone? Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Wait, the problem says that the distance between consecutive notes is one semitone, and that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me check that.\n\nFor example, C to C# is 1 semitone. Then C to D is 2, and so on. So C to D# is 3 semitones? Wait, no. Let's think: the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, then between C and E, there are four steps. Let me count:\n\nC to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, D to D# is 3, D# to E is 4. Oh right, so the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. So the problem says that for a major triad, X to Y is 4 semitones, Y to Z is 3. Then X to Z would be 7 (since 4+3=7). But since the notes are cyclic, we need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is map each note to its position in the sequence. Let's create a list of the notes in order, and then for any two notes, compute the distance between them as the number of steps from the first to the second in the cyclic order.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. But between E and C, it's 8 semitones (since there are 12 notes total, so 12 - 4 = 8? Wait, no. Because if you go from E to C, the distance is calculated as going up, but since E is higher than C, maybe the distance is measured as the number of steps when moving forward (i.e., clockwise) in the cycle. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is taken from the lowest to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. Otherwise, if X is higher, then the distance is computed as (Y's position - X's position + 12) mod 12? Or maybe the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that when you move from X to Y in the upward direction. For example, if X is C (position 0) and Y is E (position 4), then the distance is 4. If X is E (position 4) and Y is C (position 0), then the distance is 8, because moving up from E to C would require going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance is (Y - X) mod 12, but if the result is negative, add 12? Wait, no. Because for X and Y, the distance is calculated as (Y - X) if Y is after X, otherwise (Y - X + 12). So for example, if X is E (position 4) and Y is C (position 0), then Y is before X. So the distance would be (0 - 4 + 12) = 8 semitones. So the formula is (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12. But wait, if Y is after X, then the distance is (Y_pos - X_pos). If Y is before X, then (Y_pos - X_pos) is negative, and adding 12 gives the correct distance. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is from the lower to the upper. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So the distance is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (Y - X +",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Positions**: First, map each note to its corresponding position in the cyclic sequence of 12 notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, calculate the distance between them in semitones. This is done by considering the positions of the notes in the cyclic sequence and computing the difference modulo 12.\n3. **Check Triads**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third note match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Determine Result**: Based on the checks, determine if the triad is major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_position(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 3 semitones and Y to Z is 4\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    positions = [note_to_position(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(positions):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_position` function converts each note to its index in the list of 12 notes, which helps in calculating distances.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distances between notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Triad Checks**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` check if the distances between the notes in a permutation match the criteria for major or minor triads.\n4. **Permutations**: By checking all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that we consider all possible orderings to determine the correct classification of the triad.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the given notes to determine their classification, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases as specified.",
