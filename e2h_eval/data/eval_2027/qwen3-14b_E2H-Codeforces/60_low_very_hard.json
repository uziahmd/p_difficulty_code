Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem is about Morse code representations and counting the number of valid sequences after each modification to the string S. \n\nSo, the main idea is that after each character is added to S, we need to find all possible substrings of S that correspond to valid Morse code letters. Then, count all non-empty sequences of these letters. But wait, the sequences are formed by concatenating these letters, right? Like, if there's a substring that's \"1\" (which is valid), and another \"1\" later, then \"T\" followed by \"T\" would be a sequence. Also, any combination of valid letters in the substrings.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because each valid substring can be part of multiple sequences. For example, if the string is \"11\", then the substrings are \"1\" (first char), \"1\" (second char), and \"11\". Each of these can be considered as individual letters. The sequences would be: [1], [1], [11], [1,1], [1,11], [11,1], [11,11]? Wait no, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So, each sequence is a sequence of letters, each of which is a valid Morse code string. And each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting the string into parts where each part is a valid Morse code letter. But the problem counts all possible such sequences, not just the ones that cover the entire string. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"some substring of S\". Oh, no, perhaps I misunderstood. Wait, the question says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe task is to find the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So, for example, if there's a substring that is a valid Morse code letter (say, \"1\"), then that's one sequence. If there's another valid substring (like \"11\") that is a different letter, then that's another. Also, sequences like \"T\" (from \"1\") followed by \"M\" (from \"11\") would be a sequence, but how does that relate to the substrings?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each sequence of letters corresponds to a way of breaking the string into parts where each part is a valid Morse code. But that's not exactly what the problem says. The problem says that each sequence of letters must be represented by some substring of S. So, each letter in the sequence is a substring of S. But the letters can be overlapping. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\" are all valid. The sequences could be single letters (each of those 6?), or combinations like two letters, etc. But how do we count all possible sequences?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each sequence is a set of letters, each of which is a valid Morse code, and each letter is a substring of S. But that doesn't make sense because the same letter can be present multiple times. For example, in the first sample input, S is \"111\". The possible sequences are:\n\n- All single letters: 3 (each of the three 1s)\n- All pairs: TT (using the first and second 1), TM (using first and third 1s as 1 and 11?), or maybe sequences of letters where each is a valid substring. But how do they form sequences?\n\nWait, looking at the note given. The first sample after appending three 1s gives S as \"111\". The valid sequences are:\n\n- T (1)\n- M (11)\n- O (111)\n- TT (1 followed by 1)\n- TM (1 followed by 11)\n- MT (11 followed by 1)\n- TTT (1,1,1)\n- TTM (1,1,11) but wait, how is that possible? Or maybe the sequences are formed by splitting the string into parts. But the problem says that the sequences are represented by some substring of S. So, for example, the sequence \"TT\" would be represented by the substring \"11\" (as the first two characters), but that's the same as the letter M. Wait, but the note says that \"TT\" translates into \"11\", which is the same as M. So that's a sequence of two letters (T and T) which together correspond to the same Morse code as M. But according",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing binary string `S`, where each character is either a dot (0) or a dash (1). The valid Morse code strings are those of lengths 1 to 4, except for four specific invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming with State Tracking**: We maintain a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string `S`.\n2. **Valid Morse Code Check**: For each position in the string, we check all possible substrings ending at that position to see if they form a valid Morse code letter.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, we use modulo $10^9 + 7$ to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Set of invalid Morse code strings\ninvalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n    return s not in invalid\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    operations = input[1:]\n    \n    S = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # dp[i] is the number of valid sequences after i steps\n    total = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        S.append(operations[i-1])\n        current = ''.join(S)\n        new_dp = 0\n        # Check all possible substrings ending at position i\n        for j in range(i, 0, -1):\n            substring = current[j-1:i]\n            if len(substring) > 4:\n                continue\n            if is_valid(substring):\n                if j == 1:\n                    new_dp += 1\n                else:\n                    new_dp += dp[j-1] + 1\n        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + new_dp) % MOD\n        print(dp[i] % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations `m` and the sequence of operations (either '0' or '1').\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string `S`.\n3. **Substring Validation**: For each new character added to `S`, we check all possible substrings ending at the current position. If a substring is valid (i.e., it is not in the set of invalid Morse codes), we update our count of valid sequences.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Each result is taken modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid sequences after each modification to the string `S`, leveraging dynamic programming to maintain and update counts incrementally.",
