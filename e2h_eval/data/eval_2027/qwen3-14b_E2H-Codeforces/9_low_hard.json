Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So, a standard knapsack approach with O(nm) time complexity is not going to work here because for n=1e5 and m=3e5, that's 3e10 operations which is way too slow.\n\nHmm. So the key here is that the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3. That must be the way to optimize. Let me think about how to handle this.\n\nLet me think about grouping the items by their weight. For each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Because for each weight, we want to take the most expensive items first.\n\nBut how do we combine these groups optimally?\n\nLet's consider that for each weight, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each weight group, we can compute the total cost and total weight, and find the maximum total cost that doesn't exceed the capacity m.\n\nBut even that seems complicated. Let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, for weight 1: let's say we have a list sorted in descending order. The prefix sum array for weight 1 will allow us to know the total cost if we take k items of weight 1. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose how many items of each weight to take, such that the total weight is <= m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to use dynamic programming but optimized for the small weights. Wait, but even that might not be feasible.\n\nWait, another idea. Since the weights are small (1, 2, 3), perhaps we can model the problem by considering all possible combinations of taking items of weight 1 and 2, then for each possible total weight, see how many items of weight 3 can be added.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is up to 3, maybe we can find for each possible remainder modulo 1, 2, or 3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n- For each weight group (1, 2, 3), sort the items in descending order of cost, then compute prefix sums. This allows us to quickly compute the cost for taking the top k items of that weight.\n\nThen, for the problem, we can iterate over the possible number of items taken from weight 3, and for each such choice, compute the remaining capacity and then find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I take x items of weight 3. Each contributes 3 * x weight. The remaining capacity is m - 3x. But x can't be more than the total number of items in the weight 3 group, and also 3x <= m. So x can range from 0 to min(total_3_items, m//3). For each x, we can compute the maximum cost for weight 3, and then solve the subproblem of selecting items from weight 1 and 2 with total weight <= (m - 3x).\n\nBut solving the subproblem for weight 1 and 2. How?\n\nFor the subproblem of weight 1 and 2, given a capacity of W, what's the maximum cost?\n\nThis is similar to the classic unbounded knapsack problem, but with items of weight 1 and 2. However, since we have a limited number of items for each weight, it's actually the 0-1 knapsack problem for those items. Wait, no, each item is unique. So for the weight 1 and 2 items, we have a list of items, each with their own weight and cost. But how can we compute the maximum value for a given capacity W?\n\nBut since the items are sorted by cost, maybe there's a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, for the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can precompute for each possible weight up to m, the maximum cost. But even that would be O(m) time for each x, which could be O(m) * O(m) steps. Which would be O(m^2) time, which is not acceptable for m up to 3e5.\n\nSo that approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, since their weights are 1 and 2, perhaps we can find an optimal way to select them given a certain capacity.\n\n",

The constraints are large, so a brute-force approach is not feasible.
