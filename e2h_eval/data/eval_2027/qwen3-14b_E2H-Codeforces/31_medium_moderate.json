Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x, but each card can be used as many times as needed? Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says that initially he had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So he can take any number of cards, each with any value between -x and x, but each individual card's value is within that range.\n\nSo the task is: given the current sum of the found cards, what's the minimal number of cards needed to add so that the total sum becomes zero. And each added card can be any number between -x and x, but we need to choose them optimally.\n\nLet me think. Let's first compute the sum of the found cards. Let's call that S. We need to find some numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k such that their sum is equal to -S. And each a_i is between -x and x. And we need to find the minimal k possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the minimal number of terms (each between -x and x) that sum up to T, where T is -S. What's the minimal number of terms needed?\n\nSo how do we find this minimal k?\n\nLet me think about the possible values. For example, if T is zero, then k is zero. But that's not possible here since the original sum is S, which may not be zero. But in the problem statement, the initial sum is S, and we need to add some cards so that the total sum is zero. So the sum of the new cards must be -S.\n\nSo the question is: what is the minimal number of cards needed to reach a sum of T = -S, given that each card can contribute between -x and x.\n\nLet me think about the minimal number of cards. Let's say T is the target sum. Let's think of the maximum possible sum we can get with k cards. The maximum sum is k * x. Similarly, the minimum sum is -k * x. So for T to be achievable with k cards, it must be that |T| ≤ k * x. Because each card can contribute up to x or down to -x. So the minimal k is the smallest integer such that |T| ≤ k * x. But wait, because for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then with k=3, 3*2=6 ≥5. So possible. So the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x). But wait, maybe there's a case where even though |T| is less than or equal to k*x, you can't get exactly T? No, because for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then with k=3, you can have 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. But wait, the cards can be any numbers between -x and x. So for example, you can have numbers that are not necessarily x. So the idea is that the maximum possible sum is k * x, and the minimum is -k * x. So if T is within that range, then it's possible to find such a sum. So the minimal k is the minimal integer such that k * x ≥ |T|. Because once that's true, you can adjust the numbers to reach exactly T. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then k=3. Because 3*2=6 ≥5. Then you can take two cards of 2 and one of 1. But how do you know that for any T, once |T| ≤ k * x, then it's possible to reach it with k cards?\n\nYes, because suppose T is positive. Let's say T is some value. Then, the maximum sum with k cards is k * x. So if T is less than or equal to that, then you can take some combination. For example, you can take floor(T/x) cards of x, and then adjust the remaining. Let me think: For example, T = 5, x=2. Then, 5 divided by 2 is 2.5. So you can take two 2s and then one 1. Which is 2+2+1=5. So that's three cards. So the minimal k is ceil(T / x). But wait, T can be negative. But since we're taking absolute value, the same logic applies.\n\nSo the minimal k is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, let's check some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input: the input is 3 2, with numbers -1, 1, 2. The sum S is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So the target sum is -2. So |T| is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 = 1. So ceil(1) is 1. Which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nIn the second sample input: the input is 2 3, numbers -2 and -2. Sum S is -4. So T is 4. |T| is 4. x is 3. So 4 / 3 is 1.333..., ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that works.\n\nAnother example: say T is 3, x is 2. Then |T| is 3. 3/2 is 1.5, ceil is 2. So with two cards, maximum is 4. So possible. For example, 2 + 1 = 3. So that's two cards.\n\nAnother example: T is 0. Then the required k is 0. But that's only if the original sum was zero. So in that case, no cards are needed.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the given numbers. Let's call it S.\n\n2. Compute T = -S. Because the sum of the new cards must be T.\n\n3. If T is zero, then the answer is 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal k such that k * x >= |T|. And since k must be an integer, the minimal k is ceil( |T| / x )\n\nBut wait, how to compute that?\n\nIn Python, for example, |T| divided by x, rounded up.\n\nFor example, |T| = 5, x=2: 5/2=2.5, ceil is 3.\n\nBut how to compute that in code? Well, in Python, we can compute it as (abs(T) + x - 1) // x.\n\nBecause for example, (5 + 2 -1) // 2 = 6//2=3. Which is correct. For 4, (4 +3 -1)/3 = 6/3=2. Which is correct. For 3, (3 +2-1)/2 =4/2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula is (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut let's check when T is zero. Then, the answer is zero. So that's a special case.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n and x, then the list of numbers.\n\nCompute S = sum of the list.\n\nIf S is zero, then output 0.\n\nElse, compute T = -S.\n\nThen compute the minimal k as (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the case where T is 0. Then, the answer is 0. So that's handled.\n\nBut what if T is zero? For example, if the original sum is zero, then no cards are needed. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_S = sum of the list.\n\nif sum_S == 0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   T = -sum_S\n\n   required = ceil( |T| / x )\n\n   print required.\n\nBut how to compute that in code.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample:\n\nsum_S is 2. So T is -2. |T| is 2. x is 2. So (2 + 2-1) //2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: sum_S is -4. T is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if T is 5, x is 2. (5+2-1)//2 =6//2=3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 3, x is 3. (3 +3-1)/3 =5//3=1. Which is correct. Because 3 is exactly 1 *3. So 1 card.\n\nAnother example: T is 1, x is 1. (1 +1-1)/1= 1/1=1. Correct. One card.\n\nWhat if T is 1, x is 2? (1 +2-1)/2 = 2/2=1. So one card. Which is possible: take 1.\n\nSo yes, this formula works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's handle the edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: sum_S is zero. Output 0.\n\nEdge case 2: T is zero. But that's covered by the first condition.\n\nAnother edge case: when T is exactly divisible by x. For example, T=4, x=2. So (4 +2-1)/2 =5//2=2. Which is correct. 2 cards of 2 each.\n\nAnother edge case: T=0. So sum_S is zero. Output 0.\n\nAnother edge case: T is negative. But since we take absolute value, it's handled.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input. For example, the first line is two integers n and x. Then the second line is n integers.\n\nIn Python, the code could be:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_S = sum(nums)\n\nif sum_S == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    T = -sum_S\n\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n\n    k = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but what if x is zero? No, the problem says x is at least 1. Because in the input constraints, x is between 1 and 1000. So no division by zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nLet's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2. So T is -2. abs_T is 2. (2 + 2-1) // 2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. T is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is zero. Input like 1 5 0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 3, x=3 → 3/3=1 → 1.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 4, x=3. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Which is correct. Because 3 + 1 =4. So two cards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is given as part of the input.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sum Calculation**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Target Sum**: Determine the target sum needed to balance the current sum to zero. This target sum is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Calculate the minimum number of cards required to achieve this target sum. This is done by ensuring that the absolute value of the target sum can be achieved using the maximum possible value per card (x). The formula used is derived from the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by x, which can be efficiently computed using integer arithmetic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_S = sum(nums)\nif sum_S == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    T = -sum_S\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n    k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of cards found (n), the maximum absolute value (x), and the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is calculated. If this sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Target Sum Calculation**: If the sum is not zero, the target sum needed to balance it to zero is determined.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using the formula `(abs(target_sum) + x - 1) // x`, we compute the minimum number of cards required. This formula effectively computes the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by x, ensuring we use the minimum number of cards by leveraging the maximum value each card can contribute.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result in constant time after calculating the sum of the input list, making it optimal for the given constraints.",
