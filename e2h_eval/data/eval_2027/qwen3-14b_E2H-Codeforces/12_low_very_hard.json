The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. The key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For the first input, n=4, m=3, and the tasks are [3,2,3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1. First task is at 3. How long does that take? From 1 to 3 clockwise: that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, task 1 is done. Next task is 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2, since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, she can go from 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. So total so far is 2+3=5. Then, third task is at 3 again. She's already at 2. Moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total becomes 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is to track her current position, and for each task, calculate the time needed to move from her current position to the next task's house, considering the direction (clockwise only). Then accumulate all those times.\n\nBut how to compute the time between two houses?\n\nLet me think. Suppose she is currently at position curr, and needs to go to position next. Since the movement is clockwise, the number of steps is (next - curr) mod n if next is greater than curr. Wait no, because if curr is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - curr + next) steps. For example, n=4, curr=3, next=2: steps are 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. Which is (4-3 + 2) = 3? Or (next - curr + n) % n? Let me see:\n\nThe formula for the number of steps from curr to next in a clockwise direction is (next - curr) if next >= curr, else (next - curr + n). Which can be written as (next - curr) % n if the mod is handled properly. Wait, but if next is less than curr, then (next - curr) is negative. For example, next=2, curr=3, n=4: (2-3) = -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the steps between curr and next is (next - curr) if next >= curr, else (next - curr + n). Which can be calculated as (next - curr) % n if we use modulo n. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results. So for example, (2-3) %4 is 3. So yes, the steps between curr and next is (next - curr) % n. But wait, if next is equal to curr, then the steps are zero. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the tasks can have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house. So if the current position is already at the next house, then no steps are needed. So for example, if the previous task was at 3, and the next task is also 3, then the time added is zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1 (since she starts there). Then, for each task in the list a_1 to a_m, compute the steps needed to get from current to a_i, add that to the total time, then update current to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the tasks must be done in order. So for each task i (from 1 to m), we have to process them in order. So for the list a_1, a_2,...a_m, we process each in sequence.\n\nSo for example, the first task is a_1. So the steps from 1 to a_1. Then, for a_2, steps from a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\ncurrent = 1\n\nfor each ai in the list a:\n\n    steps = (ai - current) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current = ai\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 as given.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house of the task.\n3. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Use modulo arithmetic to handle the circular movement. The number of steps from the current house to the target house can be calculated using `(target - current) % n`, which ensures that moving clockwise around the ringroad is handled correctly.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the steps required for each move to get the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    m = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2 + m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    for ai in a:\n        diff = (ai - current) % n\n        total_time += diff\n        current = ai\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and split into individual components for processing.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the number of steps needed to move from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Update Position**: After each move, update the current position to the target house of the current task.\n- **Output Total Time**: Print the accumulated total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
