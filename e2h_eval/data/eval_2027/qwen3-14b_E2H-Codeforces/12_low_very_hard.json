The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task must be done in a specific house, and she can only do the i-th task after completing all previous ones. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to do all tasks.\n\nHmm, the input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks), followed by a list of a_i's. The initial position is house 1. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, so from house n, moving to 1 is one step.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. For each task, she needs to move from her current position to the required house for that task. But since the tasks have to be done in order, each subsequent task depends on the previous.\n\nSo, for example, if the first task is at house 3, she starts at 1. How many steps? Well, moving clockwise from 1 to 3: 2 steps (1→2→3). But if the next task is at 2, then she has to go from 3 to 2. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, she can't go backward. So from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2? That's 3 steps. Or maybe there's a shorter way. Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, the distance between two houses x and y is (y - x) mod n if y >=x, but if y < x, then (n - x + y) steps. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe distance between current position (current) and target (target) is calculated as follows: since movement is only clockwise. So if current is at position c and target is t, the number of steps needed is (t - c) mod n if t >= c? No, wait. For example, if c is 3, t is 2, n is 4. Then moving clockwise, you have to go 3 →4 →1 →2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) mod 4 = 3. So the general formula is (t - c) if t >=c, else (t - c + n). Which can be written as (t - c) % n if we are considering the minimal steps. Wait, but (t -c) mod n would give the same result. For example, when t=2, c=3, n=4: 2-3 = -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, no. Because if the target is ahead, then the distance is target - current. If it's behind, then (n - (current - target)).\n\nBut in the case where current is 3, target is 2, n=4: (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the formula (target - current) % n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, what if target is equal to current? Then it's zero steps. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the approach would be: track Xenia's current position, and for each task in order, compute the steps needed to get from current to a_i, add that to the total time, then update current to a_i.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the tasks are given as a list a_1 to a_m. And she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i before doing the i-th task. So the order is sequential. So for each task in the list, in order, we need to compute the time to get from the previous position to the current task's house.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list:\n\n   distance = (a_i - current_position) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_position = a_i\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me check the first example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nSo the steps:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. distance is (3-1) mod 4 = 2. Add 2. Now current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. Add 3. Now current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. (3-2) mod 4 = 1. Add 1. Total is 2+3+1=6. Which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n4 3\n\n2 ",
