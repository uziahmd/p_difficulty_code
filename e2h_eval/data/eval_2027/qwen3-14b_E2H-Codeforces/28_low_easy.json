String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. The task is to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. A beautiful string has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's a catch: we need to be able to modify the string through certain operations to end up with the character g. \n\nLet me think about what the modification process entails. The modification operation replaces the last two characters with one. For example, if the last two are '00', they become '1'; if they are '01' or '10', they become '0'; and '11' becomes '0'? Wait, the problem says that when you replace two last characters, the new character is 1 if you replace two zeros, otherwise zero. So, for two zeros, it becomes 1. For any other pair (like 01, 10, 11), it becomes 0. \n\nThe key here is that after some number of modifications, the string must end up with exactly the character g. But how does this affect the original string?\n\nLet me think about the process. Each modification reduces the length of the string by 1. Starting from a string of length (n + m), after k modifications, the length is (n + m - k). Eventually, we want to end up with a single character, which must be g. But the problem says that the modifications can be done any number of times (possibly zero) as long as the string length is at least two. So, the final string after all modifications must be exactly g. \n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a string that can be reduced to g through these operations. What properties must this string have?\n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of operations. Because each operation reduces the length by 1, to get from the original length (let's call it L = n + m) to 1, we need exactly L-1 operations. But the problem states that we can perform any number of modifications, not necessarily until it's reduced to one character. However, the problem says that we can obtain the character g from the string s with some number of modifications. So perhaps the string s must be reducible to g through some number of steps. But how do we determine that?\n\nWait, the problem says that we can perform some (possibly zero) number of modifications. So the string s must be such that there exists a way to perform modifications (as per the rules) to end up with the character g. But how can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the final character after reducing the entire string (as much as possible) must be g. Because if you can perform some number of modifications to reach g, then you can also perform all possible modifications until you get to a single character, which must be g. Because if you can reach g in some steps, but then you can keep modifying until you reach a single character. Wait, but maybe that's not the case. For example, suppose you have a string that can be modified to reach g in k steps, but then you can't do more steps. However, if you can reach g in k steps, but then you can stop there. But the problem says that the string s must allow obtaining g via some number of modifications. So the question is whether there exists a way to perform some number of modifications (possibly zero) so that the resulting string is exactly g. \n\nBut since the modifications can be done in any order, perhaps the key is to find out what the final character would be if you perform all possible modifications until the string is reduced to one character. Because if that final character is g, then the string is acceptable. Otherwise, it's not. Because if you can reach g in some steps, but then you can't reach it in others. Wait, but maybe the process of modifying the string is deterministic. Like, regardless of the order of operations, the final character after all possible reductions is fixed. Let me check.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the string is \"0011\". Let's see what happens when we reduce it. Let's try different orders:\n\nFirst approach: reduce the last two characters. The string is \"0011\" → first modification: replace last two (11) with 0 → \"000\". Then, replace last two (00) with 1 → \"01\". Then replace last two (01) with 0 → \"0\". So final character is 0.\n\nAnother approach: reduce the first two 0s. Wait, but the modification operation always replaces the last two characters. Oh right! The modification operation is always replacing the last two characters. So the order is fixed. So regardless of how you perform the operations, the order of replacements is determined by the sequence of steps. Wait, no. Wait, the operation is to replace the last two",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of \"beautiful\" strings that can be reduced to a given character `g` through a series of specific modification operations. A beautiful string consists of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, and the modifications involve replacing the last two characters with a single character based on specific rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Modifications**: Each modification reduces the length of the string by 1. The final character after all possible modifications depends on the initial counts of zeros and ones.\n2. **Parity Check**: The key insight is that the result of reducing the string to a single character depends on the parity (even or odd) of the number of ones and zeros. This is because each operation effectively reduces the count of characters in a way that depends on their parity.\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: We use combinatorial mathematics to count the number of valid permutations of zeros and ones that can be reduced to the target character `g`. This involves precomputing factorials and inverse factorials for efficient combination calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial up to 2*1e5 + 1\n    max_n = 2 * 10**5 + 10\n    fact = [1] * (max_n)\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n)\n    \n    for i in range(1, max_n):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    \n    inv_fact[max_n-1] = pow(fact[max_n-1], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_n-2, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    def comb(n, k):\n        if n < 0 or k < 0 or k > n:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD\n    \n    results = []\n    for line in data:\n        n_str, m_str, g_str = line.split()\n        n = int(n_str)\n        m = int(m_str)\n        g = int(g_str)\n        \n        total = n + m\n        if total == 0:\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Determine the required parity\n        # The final character depends on the parity of the number of 1s and 0s\n        # Let's think about the process of reducing the string to one character\n        # Each operation replaces two characters with one, so the total number of operations is total - 1\n        # The final character is determined by the parity of the number of 1s and 0s\n        # Let's think recursively: the value of the string is determined by the parity of the number of 1s and the parity of the number of 0s\n        # For example, if the total number of operations is even or odd?\n        # Actually, the result depends on the parity of the number of 1s and the parity of the number of 0s\n        # Because each operation replaces two characters with one, which affects the count of 1s and 0s in a certain way.\n        # However, the exact logic is complex.
