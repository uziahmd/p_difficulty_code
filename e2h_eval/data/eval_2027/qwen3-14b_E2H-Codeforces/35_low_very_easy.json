    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum value of a function f(x) where x is between 0 and m, inclusive. The function f(x) is calculated by summing the array elements a_i for each bit set in x's binary representation. So, for example, if x has the i-th bit set, we add a_i to the sum.\n\nThe challenge here is to find the maximum possible sum given the constraints of x not exceeding m. Let's think about how to approach this efficiently, especially considering that n can be up to 1e5, which suggests that brute-force methods (like checking all x up to m) are not feasible when m is large.\n\nFirst, let's understand what m is. The input gives us a binary string s, which represents m. For example, if the input is '10', then m is 2^1 * 1 + 2^0 * 0 = 2. But wait, the binary string is given as s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}, which probably corresponds to the bits from least significant to most? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that m equals the value of the binary string. For example, in the first sample input, the binary string is '10' which is 2 in decimal, but the note says m is 20? Wait, no, looking back at the first example:\n\nWait the first input example is given as:\n\nInput:\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', ...]\n\nWait the note says for the first test case, m=20. Wait that's conflicting. Oh wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the input. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe third line is a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals ... Wait, the problem says that m is equal to the value of the binary string. But how is the binary string interpreted? For example, if the binary string is '10', then it's 1 followed by 0. But in binary, that's 2. However, the note says that in the first test case, m=20. Wait, the first input example is:\n\nInput is:\n\n2\n\n3 8\n\n10\n\nSo the third line is '10', which is two characters. So n is 2, and the binary string is length 2. So the binary string is s_0 s_1. So the value of m is s_0 * 2^0 + s_1 * 2^1? Or is it s_0 * 2^{n-1} + ... ?\n\nWait, the problem says that the binary representation of m is given as s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}. So for example, in the first sample, the binary string is '10', which would be s_0=1, s_1=0. Then m is 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 = 1? But the note says m is 20. That can't be right. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me recheck the note.\n\nIn the first test case, the input is:\n\nn=2, array [3,8], and binary string is '10'. The note says m=20. Wait, how?\n\nAh, wait the note says that in the first test case, m=20. But according to the input, the binary string is '10' which is 2 in decimal. That doesn't match. So there's something wrong here. Wait, maybe the binary string is interpreted as a binary number with leading zeros? Or perhaps the binary string is of length n, but m is the value of the binary string interpreted as a binary number. For example, in the first sample, the binary string is '10' which is 2 in decimal. But the note says m=20. That doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait looking back at the note: In the first test case, m=20. The input is given as the third line being '10'. How is that possible? Oh, maybe the binary string is of length n, but the bits are ordered from the highest to the lowest. Like, for example, if the binary string is '10' for n=2, then m is 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2. But that's not matching the note. Alternatively, perhaps the binary string is the binary representation of m, but with leading zeros to make it length n. For example, if m is 20, which is 10100 in binary, but the input is given as '10'? That seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the problem",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of a function `f(x)` for all integers `x` in the range `[0, m]`, where `m` is given as a binary string. The function `f(x)` sums the elements of an array `a` based on the positions of set bits in the binary representation of `x`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function `f(x)` sums the elements of the array `a` at indices corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `x`. For example, if `x` has the i-th bit set, we add `a[i]` to the sum.\n\n2. **Binary Representation of m**: Convert the binary string `s` into its decimal equivalent `m`. This gives us the upper bound for `x`.\n\n3. **Greedy Strategy**: To maximize the function `f(x)`, we should include as many high-value elements from the array `a` as possible. This can be done by checking each bit position from the most significant to the least significant and including the bit if it contributes positively to the sum without exceeding `m`.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating through all possible values of `x` up to `m`, which would be inefficient for large `m`, we use a greedy approach to construct the optimal `x` by considering each bit position.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    s = input[idx]\n    \n    # Convert binary string s to integer m\n    m = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        m = (m << 1) | int(ch)\n    \n    # Sort the array in descending order\n    a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum sum\n    max_sum = 0\n    current_m = m\n    for val in a_sorted:\n        if current_m == 0:\n            break\n        if val > 0:\n            # Check if we can take this bit\n            # Find the highest bit that can be set\n            # We need to find the highest bit not yet set in current_m\n            # But since we are using a greedy approach, we just take the highest possible\n            # So we check if the bit is set in current_m\n            # Wait, no. The way to think is: the bits that can be set in x are those that are set in m.\n            # So, we can greedily take the highest possible bits first.\n            # However, since the array is sorted, we want to take the largest a_i's first.\n            # But how do we know which bits are available?\n            # Actually, the maximum f(x) is the sum of all a_i where the bit is set in x, and x <= m.\n            # The optimal x is the one that has the highest possible bits set (those with the largest a_i's)\n            # So we can iterate over the bits from highest to lowest, and if the bit is set in m, we include it.\n            # But how to determine which bits are set in m?\n            # Let's find the positions of set bits in m.\n            # Then, sort the array in descending order, and for each bit in m that is set, include the corresponding a_i.\n            # Wait, but the array indices correspond to the bit positions. So for each bit i (starting from 0), if the bit is set in m, we can include a[i] in the sum.\n            # But wait, the problem says that the binary string s represents m, and the bits correspond to the array indices. So for example, if the binary string is '10', then m has the 0th bit as 0 and 1st bit as 1. So for array indices 0 and 1.\n            # Therefore, the maximum sum is the sum of a[i] for all bits set in m. Wait, but that would be the case if we can choose x = m. But maybe there is a larger sum by choosing a different x < m.\n            # Oh, right! Because for example, if m is 101 (binary 5), and the array is [1, 10, 1], then choosing x=100 (4) gives a[0] + a[2] = 1+1=2, but x=101 gives a[0] + a[2] = same. But if a[1] is 100, then x=10 (2) would give a[1] = 100, which is better. But m is 5 (101), so x=2 is allowed.\n            # So the problem is not simply taking the sum of all a[i] for bits set in m. It's about selecting any subset of bits that form a number <= m, such that the sum of a[i] for those bits is maximized.\n            # Therefore, the optimal solution is to select the bits that have the highest a[i] values, provided that setting those bits does not exceed m.\n            # So, the approach is to sort the array in descending order, and for each element, check if we can include it in the sum by setting the corresponding bit.\n            # But how to check if setting that bit (or multiple bits) is allowed?\n            # Here's a better approach: for each bit position i, if the bit is set in m, we can include a[i] in the sum. But this is only true if we can set that bit in x. However, the optimal x may not be m itself, but another number with some bits set that gives a higher sum.\n            # However, the best way to maximize the sum is to include as many high-value a[i] as possible, regardless of their bit positions, as long as the resulting x is <= m.\n            # Therefore, we can think of it as a knapsack-like problem, but with the constraint that each item (bit) can be chosen once, and the total weight (value of x) must be <= m.\n            # But with n up to 1e5, this approach is not feasible.\n            # Wait, but the key insight is that each bit corresponds to a power of two. So, the value of x is the sum of 2^i for each bit i set. So, the maximum sum is the sum of a[i] for all bits i that can be set in x such that x <= m.\n            # To maximize the sum, we should include all bits i where a[i] is positive and the bit can be set in x without violating x <= m.\n            # But how to find which bits can be set? The optimal x would be the one that includes all the bits that are set in m, but if some bits in m are not contributing (i.e., a[i] is negative), we might want to exclude them and include other bits.\n            # However, the problem states that a[i] can be zero or positive. Since all a[i] are non-negative, the optimal x is the one that includes all bits set in m. Because adding more bits can't decrease the sum. Wait, because if a[i] is non-negative, then including any bit will not decrease the sum. Therefore, the maximum sum is simply the sum of all a[i] for which the i-th bit is set in m.\n            # Wait, this is a crucial point. Because if all a[i] are non-negative, then including any bit (i.e., setting it in x) will contribute a non-negative value. Therefore, the optimal x is the one that includes all the bits set in m. Because m is the maximum possible x, and including all bits set in m would give the maximum sum.\n            # But what if m is not the maximum x? No, m is the upper limit. So, x can be any number up to m. But if you can include all the bits set in m, then that x is m, and the sum is the sum of a[i] for all bits set in m. Any other x that is less than m would have fewer bits set, hence a smaller sum.\n            # Therefore, the answer is simply the sum of a[i] for all bits set in m.\n            # Wait, but in the first sample input:\n            # n=2, a=[3,8], m is 10 (binary string is '10'), which is 2 in decimal. So the bits set in m are the 1st bit (since 2 is 10 in binary). So the sum is a[1] = 8. But the sample output is 3. That contradicts this reasoning.\n            # Oh, this suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. Let me recheck the sample.\n            # First sample input:\n            # n=2, array is [3,8], m is '10' which is binary 10, which is 2 in decimal. So m is 2. The possible x values are 0, 1, 2.\n            # For x=0, sum is 0.\n            # x=1: binary 01, sum is a[0] =3.\n            # x=2: binary 10, sum is a[1] =8. But the sample output is 3. Wait, why? The note says that in the first test case, the maximum is 3. But according to this, x=2 should give 8. What's wrong here?\n            # Looking back at the note: \"In the first test case m=20=1, f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3.\" Wait, this seems to be a mistake in the note. Or perhaps the problem statement has a different way of interpreting the binary string.\n            # Ah, here's the confusion. The binary string s is given as s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}, which represents the binary digits of m, but the bits are interpreted as follows: s_0 is the least significant bit (2^0), s_1 is 2^1, etc. So for the first sample, the binary string is '10', which means s_0=1, s_1=0. Therefore, m = 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 = 1. So m is 1, not 2. Then, the maximum x is 1, which gives sum a[0] =3. That matches the sample output.\n            # So the previous understanding was incorrect. The binary string is interpreted as bits from least significant to most significant. So for the binary string '10', the value is 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 = 1.\n            # Therefore, the correct way to convert the binary string to m is to treat it as a binary number where s_0 is the 2^0 bit, s_1 is 2^1, etc.\n            # So, for the binary string 's', m is calculated as sum( (s[i] == '1') * 2^i for i in 0..n-1 )\n            # Now, the problem becomes clear. So, to compute m correctly, we need to process the binary string from left to right, where the first character is the least significant bit.\n\n            # Now, with this correct interpretation, the approach is to compute m correctly, then find the maximum sum of a[i] where the i-th bit is set in x, and x <= m.\n            # Given that all a[i] are non-negative, the optimal x is the one that includes as many bits as possible. So, the maximum sum is the sum of a[i] for all bits i that are set in m. Because any x less than m would have fewer bits set, thus a smaller sum.\n            # However, this is only true if all a[i] are non-negative. Which they are according to the input constraints (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4).\n            # Therefore, the solution is to calculate m correctly, then sum all a[i] where the i-th bit is set in m.\n\n    # Recalculate m correctly\n    m = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            m += (1 << i)\n    \n    # Sum all a[i] where the i-th bit is set in m\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if (m >> i) & 1:\n            result += a[i]\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of elements `n`, the array `a`, and the binary string `s`.\n\n2. **Convert Binary String to Integer**: The binary string `s` is converted to its decimal equivalent `m` by treating each character as a bit starting from the least significant bit (rightmost).\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Sum**: The maximum value of the function `f(x)` is obtained by summing the elements of `a` at positions where the corresponding bit is set in `m`. This works because all elements in `a` are non-negative, so including all set bits in `m` gives the maximum sum.",

Wait, why? The note says that in the first test case, the maximum is 3. But according to this, x=2 should give 8. What's wrong here?\n            # Looking back at the note: \"In the first test case m=20=1, f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3.\" Wait, this seems to be a mistake in the note. Or perhaps the problem statement has a different way of interpreting the binary string.\n            # Ah, here's the confusion. The binary string s is given as s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}, which represents the binary digits of m, but the bits are interpreted as follows: s_0 is the least significant bit (2^0), s_1 is 2^1, etc. So for the first sample, the binary string is '10', which means s_0=1, s_1=0. Therefore, m = 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 = 1. So m is 1, not 2. Then, the maximum x is 1, which gives sum a[0] =3. That matches the sample output.\n            # So the previous understanding was incorrect. The binary string is interpreted as bits from least significant to most significant. So for the binary string '10', the value is 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 = 1.\n            # Therefore, the correct way to convert the binary string to m is to treat it as a binary number where s_0 is the 2^0 bit, s_1 is 2^1, etc.\n            # So, for the binary string 's', m is calculated as sum( (s[i] == '1') * 2^i for i in 0..n-1 )\n            # Now, the problem becomes clear. So, to compute m correctly, we need to process the binary string from left to right, where the first character is the least significant bit.\n\n            # Now, with this correct interpretation, the approach is to compute m correctly, then find the maximum sum of a[i] where the i-th bit is set in x, and x <= m.\n            # Given that all a[i] are non-negative, the optimal x is the one that includes as many bits as possible. So, the maximum sum is the sum of a[i] for all bits i that are set in m. Because any x less than m would have fewer bits set, thus a smaller sum.\n            # However, this is only true if all a[i] are non-negative. Which they are according to the input constraints (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4).\n            # Therefore, the solution is to calculate m correctly, then sum all a[i] where the i-th bit is set in m.\n\n    # Recalculate m correctly\n    m = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            m += (1 << i)\n    \n    # Sum all a[i] where the i-th bit is set in m\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if (m >> i) & 1:\n            result += a[i]\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
