The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the approach should be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, yes. Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. So the total is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys). \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. Calculate the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) and min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11). \n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7). \n\nThen, min(3,1) is 1 (even chests paired with odd keys). Then min(2,3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: chests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0. So min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_chests 0. Keys even is 4, odd 0. So min(1,0) is 0 and min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the logic seems solid. \n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the list of a_i, count even and odd.\n- Read the list of b_j, count even and odd.\n- Compute the sum as described.\n\nSo in Python, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the next line as list of integers for a. Then the next line for b.\n\nCount even_a = number of elements in a where x % 2 == 0. Similarly for odd_a. Same for even_b and odd_b.\n\nThen the answer is min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple keys and chests? For example, if there are more even chests than odd keys, but also some odd chests and even keys. But the code correctly takes the minimum of each pair.\n\nYes. So this approach should work.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as per the examples, but in the problem statement, the input is given as three lines. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nFirst line: n and m.\n\nSecond line: n integers a_1...a_n.\n\nThird line: m integers b_1...b_m.\n\nSo, the code needs to read three lines. But in the sample input, the first example is given as:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', ...]\n\nWhich suggests that the input is given as a single string per test case,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. The key condition is that the sum of the number on a chest and the number on a key must be an odd number. This translates to pairing even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and odd-numbered chests with even-numbered keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Optimal Pairing**: Calculate the maximum possible pairs by:\n   - Pairing even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys.\n   - Pairing odd-numbered chests with even-numbered keys.\n3. **Sum Minimums**: The result is the sum of the minimum values between the counts of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum values between the counts of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_a = n - even_a\n    \n    even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_b = m - even_b\n    \n    result = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into a list of strings for easier processing.\n- **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We count how many numbers are even and odd in both the chests and keys lists.\n- **Calculating Maximum Pairs**: By using the minimum of the relevant counts (even chests with odd keys and vice versa), we ensure that we are optimally using available keys and chests to maximize the number of opened chests.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution in linear time relative to the size of the input lists, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the constraint limits.",
