Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the remains of burned-out candles. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take 'b' of them to make a new one. And this new candle can be used again. So the question is to find the total hours possible.\n\nLet me think of the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles. That gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned ones are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are burned, so he can make 2 / 2 = 1 new candle. Uses that, adding 1 hour. Now, that one is burned, but he can't make any more since 1 < 2. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Oh right, and that's how it works.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's see:\n\nStart with 6: 6 hours. Then 6 / 3 = 2 new. Use them, 2 hours. Then 2 /3 is 0, so total 6+2=8. Wait, but wait. Wait, the note says in the first example that after making two new ones, he uses them, then makes another. So maybe the process is that each time you have some burned candles, you can make new ones as long as you have enough.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitially, the total hours is a. Because he uses all the initial candles. Then, each time he uses the burned ones to make new ones.\n\nBut wait, the process is:\n\nEach time you use a candle, it becomes a burned one. So the total number of burned candles increases by the number of candles used. Then, whenever you have enough (>=b) burned candles, you can make new ones. But each time you make a new candle, you subtract b from the burned count, and add 1 to the available candles. Which can be used again.\n\nSo maybe the way to model this is:\n\n- Start with a candles. Total hours is a.\n\n- Then, the number of burned candles is a.\n\n- Then, while the number of burned candles >= b:\n\n   - Take as many as possible (divided by b) to make new candles.\n\n   - The number of new candles is (burned // b).\n\n   - Add that number to the total hours.\n\n   - The burned candles are now (burned % b) + (number of new candles). Because the new candles are used, but they are added to the burned pile once they are used.\n\nWait, no. Because when you make new candles, you take (burned // b) * b from the burned pile. Then, those new candles are used, so each of them adds 1 hour. So the process is:\n\nLet me think again. Suppose you have 'burned' number of burned candles. You can make (burned // b) new candles. Each of those new candles will be used, adding (burned // b) hours. Then, those new candles are now burned again. So the new burned count is (burned % b) + (burned // b). Because the remaining burned candles after making new ones is (burned % b), plus the new ones that were used (which is (burned // b)).\n\nWait, no. Because when you make a new candle, you take 'b' burned candles to make one. So if you have 'burned' number of burned candles, then the number of new candles you can make is (burned // b). Each of these new candles is used, which takes 1 hour each. So the total hours increases by (burned // b). Then, after that, the burned candles are (burned % b) + (burned // b). Because the new candles are now burned again. So for example, in the first case:\n\nInitial a is 4, b is 2. So initial hours is 4. Burned is 4.\n\nFirst iteration: 4//2 = 2. So add 2 hours. Now total is 6. The new burned count is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nSecond iteration: 2//2=1. Add 1 hour. Total is 7. New burned count is 0 +1=1.\n\nThird iteration: 1 < 2.",
