Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. Hmm. So, the key here is to find a bipartite matching where the edges don't cross each other. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The input gives R spaceships and B bases. But since it's a perfect matching, R must equal B. Oh wait, the first line says R and B. Wait, the problem statement says that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. So that implies that R must equal B. But looking at the input examples, the first example is 3 3, and the second is 2 1. Oh, but in the second case, since R is 2 and B is 1, there can't be a perfect matching. So the first thing to check is whether R equals B. If they are not equal, immediately output No.\n\nSo the first step is to check if R != B, then output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, assuming R = B. Then, we need to find a perfect matching between the two sets (spaceships and bases) such that no two edges cross each other.\n\nHow do I model this? Well, for each possible pairing between spaceships and bases, we need to check if all the edges in the matching are non-crossing.\n\nBut since R and B are up to 10, the total number of possible perfect matchings is (R!) which for 10 is 3.6 million. Wait, 10! is 3,628,800. For each possible permutation, we need to check if all the edges in the matching are non-crossing. But how?\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Generate all possible perfect matchings (permutations of the bases for the spaceships).\n- For each permutation, check if all pairs of edges in the matching are non-crossing.\n- If any such permutation exists, output Yes; else No.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments cross?\n\nWait, the problem states that any two paths (straight lines from a base to its assigned spaceship) should not intersect. So, for a given matching, all the line segments between the matched pairs must be non-intersecting. So even if two line segments share a common point (like endpoints), but since the problem says that no two points coincide, and no three points are colinear. So, the line segments can't share a point except their endpoints. So, for two line segments (from ship A to base X) and (ship B to base Y), they can't cross each other. \n\nSo, the key is to check for any pair of edges in the matching whether their line segments intersect. If any pair does, then that permutation is invalid.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each permutation (possible assignment of bases to ships):\n\n   For all pairs of edges in the permutation, check if any two edges intersect. If none do, return Yes.\n\nNow, how to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nI need a function that takes two line segments (each defined by two points) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nThe standard way to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect is to use the orientation method. \n\nFirst, check if the two segments intersect properly (i.e., not just at endpoints). However, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, any two line segments can't have overlapping parts, but they can intersect at a point (but since all points are unique, the only way two line segments can intersect is if they cross each other, not sharing endpoints). Wait, but if two line segments share an endpoint, that's allowed? Because the problem says that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base to exactly one spaceship. So in a valid matching, each line segment is between a unique pair. So, two line segments can't share an endpoint. Because each ship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base to exactly one ship. So, for two different pairs in the matching, their endpoints are all distinct. Therefore, two line segments in the matching cannot share any endpoints. Therefore, when checking for intersections, we can ignore the case where they share endpoints. So, the segments can only intersect if they cross each other in the middle.\n\nSo, the function to check if two segments AB and CD intersect can be implemented using the orientation method. The steps are as follows:\n\n- Check if the segments AB and CD intersect. Since no three points are colinear, we don't have to worry about colinear cases.\n\nThe steps for checking intersection between two segments AB and CD:\n\n1. Find the orientation of A, B, C and A, B, D.\n2. Find the orientation of C, D, A and C, D, B.\n3. If the orientations are different for both pairs, then the segments intersect.\n4. Also, check if any of the endpoints lie on the other segment. But since the problem states that no three points are colinear, this can't happen. Because if a point lies on another segment, then three points would be colinear. For example, if C lies on AB, then A, B, C are colinear. Which is not allowed. Therefore, the only possible way for two segments to intersect is if they cross each other properly, i.e., their orientations are opposite.\n\nWait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, the line segments can't have any of their endpoints lying on the other segment. Because that would require three points being colinear. So, in our case, the two segments can't have overlapping endpoints, and no endpoint lies on the other segment. Thus, the only possible way for two segments to intersect is if they cross each other, which can be checked with the orientation method.\n\nSo, the code for checking if two segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # returns True if AB and CD intersect\n    # compute orientation of A, B, C\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # general case: if o1 and o2 are different, and o3 and o4 are different\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nBut what about the case where one of the segments is a single point? No, because the problem says that all points are unique, and each segment is between two distinct points. So, the segments are proper.\n\nNow, the orientation function. The orientation of three points (p, q, r) can be determined by the cross product of vectors pq and pr. The cross product (q.x - p.x)*(r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y)*(r.x - p.x). The sign of this value tells us the orientation.\n\nIf the value is 0, the points are colinear. But according to the problem statement, this can't happen. So in our code, we can assume that the cross product is not zero.\n\nSo, the orientation function can be:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        # but according to problem statement, this can't happen\n        # but perhaps in code, we can return 0, but since the input is guaranteed, maybe we can ignore\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nBut for the purpose of checking if the orientations are different, the actual value isn't important. For example, if o1 and o2 are different, that means that C and D are on opposite sides of AB. Similarly for o3 and o4.\n\nSo, the function segments_intersect will return True if the two segments cross each other.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n- Read R and B. If R != B, output No.\n- Else, read R points for ships, then B points for bases.\n- Generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each ship is matched to exactly one base, and each base to exactly one ship).\n- For each permutation (which represents a possible matching), check if all pairs of line segments (from ship to base) are non-intersecting.\n- If any permutation passes the check, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut generating all permutations could be computationally feasible for R=10. Let's see: 10! is around 3.6 million. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of segments. For each permutation, the number of pairs is (R choose 2) = 45 for R=10. For each pair, we check if they intersect. So total operations are 3.6e6 * 45 = 162 million. For Python, this might be tight, but given that R and B are up to 10, and the constraints are small, it's manageable.\n\nBut wait, for R=10, 10! is 3,628,800. Let's think about the time. Each check for a permutation would involve O(R^2) checks. For R=10, that's 100 checks per permutation. So 3.6e6 * 100 = 3.6e8 operations. That's a lot for Python, but perhaps with some optimizations, it can pass.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for small R, it's manageable. Let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, how to generate permutations. The ships are in a list, and the bases are in a list. For each permutation of the bases, we assign the first base to the first ship, the second base to the second ship, etc. So, for example, if the permutation is [base_2, base_1, base_3], then ship_1 is connected to base_2, ship_2 to base_1, etc.\n\nNow, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of edges. For example, for each pair (i, j) with i < j, check if the segment between ship_i and base_perm[i] intersects with the segment between ship_j and base_perm[j].\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R ship coordinates into a list ships.\n\nRead B base coordinates into a list bases.\n\nGenerate all permutations of bases (since each permutation represents a possible perfect matching).\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   For all pairs of indices i and j (i < j):\n\n      Check if the line between ships[i] and perm[i] intersects with the line between ships[j] and perm[j].\n\n      If any intersection is found, break and try next permutation.\n\nIf all pairs are non-intersecting, return Yes.\n\nIf after checking all permutations, none are valid, return No.\n\nNow, the problem is how to generate permutations. The permutations are of the bases. For example, if bases are [b1, b2, b3], then permutations are all possible orderings of these elements.\n\nBut in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. So, for the bases list, generate all permutations, and for each permutation, check the conditions.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nBut first, note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. The sample input shows two inputs, and outputs. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first example input is given as a list of strings, and the output is a list of strings. But the problem says that the input comes from stdin. Wait, the user provided sample input seems to be for two separate test cases. But the actual problem says that the input is read from stdin. So, perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases in the sample, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: first line contains R and B, then R lines for ships, then B lines for bases.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples. However, the user's code is supposed to read input from stdin. So, perhaps the problem is that the user provided two test cases as input. But in reality, the code should process one test case per run. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but the actual problem's input is a single test case. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSample Output: Yes\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSample Output: No\n\nBut in the problem's input description, the first line is R and B, followed by R lines for ships, then B lines for bases. So, the code needs to read a single test case.\n\nBut in the sample input provided by the user, the first input is given as a list of strings. However, in the code submission, the code is supposed to read from stdin. So, the code needs to process one test case. So, perhaps the sample input is showing two test cases. But in the problem's context, the code is supposed to process a single test case. Therefore, the code should read from stdin, process one test case, and output Yes or No.\n\nBut the user's example shows that for the first input, the output is 'Yes', and for the second input, 'No'. So, the code should read the input once, process it, and output accordingly.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print No.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R ship coordinates.\n\nRead B base coordinates.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   Check if all pairs of segments in the permutation are non-intersecting.\n\n   If yes, return Yes.\n\nIf none found, return No.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nNow, for the permutations. The bases are stored as a list. For example, bases = [ (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... ].\n\nEach permutation is a possible assignment of bases to ships. So, for the i-th ship, the assigned base is permutation[i].\n\nNow, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of edges.\n\nNow, the code for checking segments.\n\nImplementing the orientation function and the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut in Python, for the code, perhaps the functions can be written as helper functions.\n\nLet me code that.\n\nFirst, the orientation function:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # p, q, r are tuples (x, y)\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear, but problem says no three points are colinear, so this shouldn't happen\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nThen, the segments_intersect function:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # Check if segment a1a2 intersects with segment b1b2\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n\n    # General case: if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nWait, but this is the standard method for checking if two segments intersect. However, this method returns True if the segments intersect properly. But in our case, since no three points are colinear, and the segments are not overlapping, this is sufficient.\n\nNow, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of edges.\n\nFor example, for a permutation perm, which is a list of base points (each being a tuple), then for each i < j, check if the segment between ships[i] and perm[i] intersects with the segment between ships[j] and perm[j].\n\nIf any of these checks return True, then this permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    R = int(input[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    B = int(input[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[idx])\n        y = int(input[idx+1])\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=2\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[idx])\n        y = int(input[idx+1])\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=2\n    # Now generate all permutations of bases\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # Check all pairs\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # check if segment ships[i] to perm[i] intersects with ships[j] to perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, the code uses permutations of the bases. However, since the bases are stored as a list, and permutations returns tuples of the elements, but in the code, the bases are stored as tuples, so the permutations would be generated correctly.\n\nBut wait, the bases list is a list of tuples. So, permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings of the bases. For example, if the bases are [(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ...], then each permutation is a tuple of these elements.\n\nBut for the code, in the loop, perm is a tuple of base points. So, for each i, perm[i] is the base assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nNow, the problem is that for R=10, the permutations can be 10! which is 3.6 million. For each of these, checking all pairs of edges. But in Python, this might be slow. However, given that R is up to 10, and the constraints are small, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\n3 3\n\nShips: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\nBases: (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\nOne possible permutation is the same order. So, ship 0 connects to base 0, ship 1 to base 1, ship 2 to base 2.\n\nCheck all pairs:\n\nBetween ship 0 and base 0 (0,0) to (-2,1), and ship 1 and base 1 (2,0) to (0,3). Do these segments cross?\n\nWe can compute the orientations.\n\nBut perhaps in this case, they don't cross. So the code would find that this permutation is valid and return Yes.\n\nSample 2:\n\nR=2, B=1. So, R != B, output No.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Suppose ships are (0,0), (1,1). Bases are (0,1), (1,0). Then, the two permutations are [(0,1), (1,0)] and [(1,0), (0,1)]. For the first permutation, the lines are (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0). These are vertical lines, which don't cross. So the answer is Yes. But if the permutation is [(0,1), (1,0)], then the lines are (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0). No crossing. So the code would return Yes.\n\nAnother test case: ships at (0,0), (2,2), and bases at (1,1), (3,3). Then, the possible permutations are [ (1,1), (3,3) ] and [ (3,3), (1,1) ]. In the first case, the lines are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(3,3). These are colinear, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. Wait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So in this case, the input would not be allowed. Because the ships and bases are given with no three points colinear. So, the code can assume that any two line segments that are colinear would not exist, but the code's segments_intersect function would return False for them, because the orientations would be same for both ends.\n\nWait, for example, suppose two segments AB and CD are colinear. But since no three points are colinear, that can't happen. Because if AB is a segment, and CD is a segment, then if they are colinear, then points A, B, C, D are colinear. Which would imply that there are three points colinear. Which is not allowed. So in the problem's input, such a case is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed safely.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut wait, the code uses permutations of the bases. However, if there are duplicate bases? No, the problem says that no two points coincide. So all the bases are unique, and all the ships are unique. So, permutations are generated correctly.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nThe input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, ships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nIn the first permutation, which is the same order, the lines are:\n\nShip 0 (0,0) to base 0 (-2,1)\n\nShip 1 (2,0) to base 1 (0,3)\n\nShip 2 (3,1) to base 2 (2,2)\n\nCheck between each pair:\n\nCheck between ship0-base0 and ship1-base1.\n\nDo these lines cross?\n\nLet me compute the orientation.\n\nFor segment A (0,0) to B (2,0), and segment C (-2,1) to D (0,3).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first segment is (0,0) to (-2,1), and the second is (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nSo, the code would check if these two segments intersect.\n\nCompute orientation of A, B, C and A, B, D.\n\nA is (0,0), B is (-2,1). Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, the first segment is between (0,0) and (-2,1). So the first segment is A1 (0,0) and A2 (-2,1). The second segment is B1 (2,0) and B2 (0,3). So, checking if A1A2 and B1B2 intersect.\n\nSo, orientation of A1, A2, B1: points (0,0), (-2,1), (2,0).\n\nval = (-2 - 0) * (0 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) → (-2)(0) - (1)(2) = 0 - 2 = -2 → negative. So orientation is 2 (since val is negative).\n\nThen orientation of A1, A2, B2: points (0,0), (-2,1), (0,3).\n\nval = (-2 - 0)*(3 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(0 - 0) → (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6 → negative. So orientation is 2 again.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are same. So the first condition (o1 != o2) is false. Hence, the segments do not intersect. So, the code would return false for this pair.\n\nSimilarly, check between other pairs. So, in this case, the code would accept this permutation.\n\nBut perhaps there's another pair that crosses?\n\nWell, the sample says that there's a valid permutation, so the code would find it.\n\nNow, the code would generate all permutations, and for each, check all pairs. So, in this case, the code would find that at least one permutation is valid.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input would output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n2 1\n\n... which R != B. So output 'No'.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nCase when R = B = 1. Then, only one possible matching. So output 'Yes'.\n\nCase when R=B=2, and the two ships and two bases are arranged such that the two possible matchings both have crossing lines. Then output 'No'.\n\nBut how to arrange that?\n\nFor example:\n\nShips: (0,0), (2,2)\n\nBases: (0,2), (2,0)\n\nPossible permutations:\n\nPermutation 1: bases are (0,2) and (2,0). So the lines are (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These are vertical lines, no crossing. So valid.\n\nWait, but that's not crossing. So the code would return Yes.\n\nAnother example where both permutations have crossing lines? Not possible. Because for two ships and two bases, there are two possible matchings. But if the two lines cross in both cases?\n\nLike ships at (0,0) and (1,1), bases at (1,0) and (0,1). Let's see:\n\nPermutation 1: assign base (1,0) to ship 0, and (0,1) to ship 1. The lines are (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These are two horizontal and vertical lines that cross at (1,0) and (0,1)? No. Wait, the first line is from (0,0) to (1,0): horizontal line. The second line is from (1,1) to (0,1): horizontal line. They are parallel. So no intersection.\n\nWait, but that's not crossing. So the code would return yes.\n\nAnother example: ships at (0,0) and (2,2), bases at (1,1) and (3,3). But the problem says no three points are colinear. So this input is invalid, since the three points (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) are colinear. So the input would not be allowed.\n\nAnother example where the two possible permutations have crossing lines. How?\n\nLet me think of ships (0,0) and (3,3), bases (1,2) and (2,1). So the two permutations:\n\nPerm1: base (1,2) to ship 0, base (2,1) to ship 1. Lines: (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1). Do these cross?\n\nLet me compute.\n\nCheck if the two segments cross.\n\nSegment A: (0,0)-(1,2).\n\nSegment B: (3,3)-(2,1).\n\nCompute orientation for A's endpoints and B's endpoints.\n\nFor the first segment A (0,0) to (1,2), check points B's endpoints.\n\nOrientation of A (0,0), A (1,2), B's first point (3,3):\n\nval = (1-0)*(3-0) - (2-0)*(3-0) → 1*3 - 2*3 = 3 -6 = -3 → negative.\n\nOrientation of A's segment for B's second point (2,1):\n\nval = (1-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) → 1*1 - 2*2 → 1-4 = -3 → negative. So same orientation. So segments do not cross.\n\nNow, check the other permutation: assign base (2,1) to ship 0, and (1,2) to ship 1. So lines are (0,0)-(2,1) and (3,3)-(1,2). Do they cross?\n\nCheck if these two segments cross.\n\nSegment A: (0,0) to (2,1).\n\nSegment B: (3,3) to (1,2).\n\nCompute orientations.\n\nFor segment A, check B's endpoints.\n\nOrientation of A's segment for B's first point (3,3):\n\nval = (2-0)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(3-0) → 2*3 - 1*3 = 6-3=3 → positive.\n\nOrientation of A's segment for B's second point (1,2):\n\nval = (2-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(1-0) → 2*2 - 1*1 = 4-1=3 → positive. So same orientation. So no crossing.\n\nThus, in this case, both permutations are valid. So code returns Yes.\n\nAnother example: ships at (0,0) and (2,0), bases at (1,1) and (1,-1). So possible permutations.\n\nFirst permutation: ship 0 to base (1,1), ship 1 to base (1,-1). The lines are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,0)-(1,-1). These two lines cross each other?\n\nYes. Because they cross at (1, 0.5) ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nLine 1: from (0,0) to (1,1): y = x.\n\nLine 2: from (2,0) to (1,-1): slope is (-1 -0)/(1-2) = (-1)/(-1) = 1. So equation is y -0 = 1*(x -2) → y = x - 2. The two lines y=x and y =x-2 are parallel? No, same slope. So they are parallel. So they don't cross. So no intersection.\n\nSo the code would return yes.\n\nHmm. So perhaps it's hard to find a case where there's no valid permutation. But for the code, it's handled.\n\nNow, considering that the code is correct, the next step is to code it in Python.\n\nBut in the code, the permutations are generated for the bases. However, the code may have a problem with the way the input is read. Let me check.\n\nIn the code, the input is read as a single string split into tokens. For example, the first line is R and B. Then, R lines for ships, each with two integers. Then B lines for bases, each with two integers.\n\nBut when reading from stdin, the code uses input = sys.stdin.read().split(). This splits all the input into a list of strings, separated by whitespace. So, for example, the first line's R and B are first two elements. Then, for each ship, two elements, etc.\n\nYes. So the code reads the input correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code uses permutations of the bases. However, the bases are read as a list of tuples. So for example, for the first sample input, bases are [ (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2) ].\n\nNow, the code for permutations would generate all possible orderings of these bases.\n\nNow, the code for checking all pairs of segments.\n\nNow, the code for the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut what about the order of the points in the segments? For example, the function segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2) checks if the segments a1a2 and b1b2 intersect. The order of a1 and a2 doesn't matter, since the orientation function is based on the cross product, which is the same regardless of the order of the points.\n\nBut in the code, the function segments_intersect is called with (ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]). So the segments are between ships[i] and perm[i], and between ships[j] and perm[j]. The order of the two points in the segment doesn't matter for the orientation function.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in Python, the permutations function returns tuples of the elements. So, for example, if the bases list is [b1, b2, b3], then each permutation is a tuple (b1, b2, b3), etc.\n\nThus, in the code, perm[i] is the base assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nNow, the code for the segments_intersect function.\n\nNow, the code for the helper functions is inside the main function? Or outside? Well, in the code, the functions are inside the main function, but in Python, that's not possible. Wait, no. The code is written as:\n\ndef main():\n    ...\n    def orientation(p, q, r):\n        ...\n    def segments_intersect(...):\n        ...\n\nBut no, in Python, the helper functions need to be defined inside the main function, or outside. Alternatively, the code can have the helper functions outside.\n\nBut in the code, the helper functions can be written as nested functions, or outside. However, for code efficiency, perhaps it's better to define them outside. However, in the code, the code is written as part of the main function.\n\nAlternatively, the code can have the helper functions inside the main function. But in Python, that's allowed.\n\nBut in the code, the code is written as:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    R = int(input[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    B = int(input[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[idx])\n        y = int(input[idx+1])\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=2\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[idx])\n        y = int(input[idx+1])\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=2\n    # Now generate all permutations of bases\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # Check all pairs\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # check if segment ships[i] to perm[i] intersects with ships[j] to perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut this code may have some issues. For example, the permutations function returns tuples of the bases. However, since the bases are stored as tuples, and the permutations are generated correctly.\n\nBut in Python, the permutations function returns tuples of the elements of the list. So, for example, if the bases list is [ (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ... ], then perm will be a tuple of those elements. Thus, perm[i] is the base assigned to ship i.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input 1 would generate permutations and check them.\n\nBut what about the order of the ships? For example, the code assumes that the ships are ordered as per their input, and the permutation assigns the bases to them in order.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input 1 should return Yes, and for the sample input 2 returns No.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. However, what about the case when R = B = 0? According to the input constraints, R and B are at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, R and B are between 1 and 10. So, the code handles R=1 and B=1. For example, if there is one ship and one base. The code generates one permutation, and since there are no pairs to check, returns Yes.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Ships are (0,0), (1,0). Bases are (0,1), (1,1). Then, the two permutations are:\n\nperm1: [(0,1), (1,1)] → lines (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,0)-(1,1). No intersection.\n\nperm2: [(1,1), (0,1)] → lines (0,0)-(1,1) and (1,0)-(0,1). These two lines cross. So in this case, the first permutation is valid. So the code",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base and each base is assigned exactly one spaceship, with the additional constraint that no two connecting paths intersect in the 2D plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, output \"No\" immediately as a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For the given number of spaceships and bases, generate all possible permutations of bases. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of bases to spaceships.\n3. **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation, check if all connecting paths between spaceships and their assigned bases intersect. If any permutation results in non-intersecting paths, output \"Yes\".

This helps determine if points are clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear.\n- **Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the orientation check to determine if two line segments intersect. It checks if the segments straddle each other, which would indicate an intersection.\n- **Permutations and Validation**: The main function reads input, checks for equal numbers of spaceships and bases, generates permutations of bases, and validates each permutation to ensure no intersections exist between any pair of connecting paths.
