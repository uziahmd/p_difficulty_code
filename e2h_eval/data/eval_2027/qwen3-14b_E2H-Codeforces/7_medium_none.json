The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure of the snowflake.\n\nFrom the description:\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so those leaves) are connected to k more new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So the construction process involves multiple layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step. Let's consider the example given for k=4. The smallest snowflake would have:\n\nInitial step: 1 node. Then connect to 4 nodes. Now total is 1+4=5. Then each of those 4 nodes (which are leaves) get connected to 4 new nodes each. So adding 4*4=16 nodes. Total becomes 5+16=21. But wait, the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nWait the example input has 13 as a valid case. Let me think again. Maybe the process can be done in different steps. Let me think recursively.\n\nThe snowflake is built as follows:\n\n- Start with one node (level 0).\n- Then, add k children to it (level 1). Now total nodes is 1 + k.\n- Then, for each node in level 1 (each of which has degree 1), add k children. This is level 2. Each such node adds k nodes. So total nodes after this step is 1 + k + k*k = 1 + k + k². But this step must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do this once. Wait, but the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Let's see: suppose k=3. Then 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1+3+9=13. Oh right! So that's why 13 is valid. So the minimal snowflake is when we have two steps: initial step (adding level 1), then adding level 2. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k². But also, maybe there are more steps. For example, after adding level 2, we can add level 3 by adding k children to each node in level 2. So the total would be 1 +k +k² +k³. But in that case, the process requires that each time you add a new layer, you do it for all the leaves. So the snowflake is built in layers, where each layer is added by expanding all the leaves from the previous step.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding level 1) is required, and then at least one more step (like adding level 2). So the minimal possible is when there are two layers: level 0 (root), level 1 (children of root), and level 2 (children of level 1 nodes). So the total is 1 + k + k².\n\nBut what if there are more layers? Like, say three layers. Then the total would be 1 +k +k² +k³. Or even more. So for any m ≥ 2 layers (since the step is done at least once), the total number of nodes would be sum_{i=0}^m k^i, but with m ≥ 2?\n\nWait no. Because the initial step is adding level 1. Then, for each step after that, you add another level. So the number of layers is m, where m ≥ 2. Because the first step (adding level 1) is done once, then the second step (adding level 2) is done once. So the total number of nodes would be sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2? Wait, no. Because the initial node is 1. Then adding level 1 gives 1 +k. Adding level 2 adds k^2 nodes. Adding level 3 adds k^3. So the total is 1 + k + k² + ... +k^m, where m is the number of layers minus 1. But the process requires that the step of adding to the leaves is done at least once. So the minimal case is when m=2 (so total is 1 +k +k²).\n\nSo the total number of nodes for a snowflake is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Wait, no. Wait, the first step is adding k nodes (level 1). Then the second step is adding k^2 nodes (level 2). Then third step adds k^3 nodes (level 3), etc. So the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2? Because the step of adding to the leaves is done once (for level 2), but perhaps m can be higher. So for example, if m is 2, then the total is 1 +k +k². If m is 3, then 1 +k +k² +k³. So for any m ≥ 2, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, but since the initial term is 1 (i=0), then the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Wait, the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But for the snowflake, the sum must be equal to n. And m must be ≥ 2 (since the step is done at least once, which implies that there are at least two layers: level 1 and level 2).\n\nWait, but maybe not. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then the step of adding new nodes to the leaves (each leaf is connected to k new nodes) is done at least once. So the step is done once, which adds level 2. So the minimal case is when the sum is 1 +k +k². But if you do the step again, you add level 3, and so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes for a snowflake is S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Wait, no. Because m is the number of layers. Let me think again. The initial node is level 0. Then, level 1 is added (k nodes). Then, level 2 is added (k² nodes). Then level 3 (k³ nodes). So the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m is the number of layers minus 1. For example, if m=1 (only level 1), then the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding to the leaves (the initial step) is done once. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, so the first step is adding the k children (level 1). Then, the step (adding k children to each leaf) is done at least once. So the step is done once, which adds level 2. Therefore, the minimal snowflake has 1 +k +k² nodes. So the total number of nodes can be written as S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2? No, because for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². But m here is the maximum exponent. So the sum is S = sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2. Because the first step (adding level 1) is part of the construction, and then the step of adding to the leaves is done once (level 2). So the sum is 1 +k +k². But if we do the step again (adding level 3), then the sum is 1 +k +k² +k³, etc.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if there exists integers k>1 and m≥2 such that n equals sum_{i=0}^m k^i. But since m can be any integer ≥ 2, and k can be any integer ≥2.\n\nAlternatively, the sum can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Because the sum of a geometric series from 0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo our problem is to check if n can be expressed in the form (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k≥2 and m≥2. However, note that m is the maximum exponent in the sum. For example, m=2 gives sum 1 +k +k² = (k^3 -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut wait, m can be any integer ≥ 2. So for example, for m=2, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k² +k +1. For m=3, it's (k^4-1)/(k-1) = k³ +k² +k +1. So for each possible m ≥2, and k≥2, the sum is S(n) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo the problem becomes: given n, is there some k≥2 and m≥2 such that S(n) equals n?\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for a given n, whether such k and m exist.\n\nBut how can we check this efficiently for large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nFirst, let's think about possible approaches. For each test case, n, we need to check if there exists k ≥2 and m ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nBut since n is up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check all possibilities.\n\nLet me think of possible values for m. Since m ≥2, m can be 2,3,... up to log_2(n). Because for m=2, the minimal k is 2, so the minimal value for S(n) is 2² +2 +1 =7. For m=2, the sum is k² +k +1. For larger m, the sum increases.\n\nBut for each possible m, we can check whether there exists a k such that the equation holds.\n\nBut how many possible m's are there? For example, for a given n, the maximum possible m is log_2(n). Because for k=2, m+1 is the exponent. For example, for m=2, the sum is 2^3 -1/(2-1) = 7. For m=3, sum is 2^4-1/(2-1) =15. For m=4, 31, etc. So for n=1e18, the maximum m could be around 60, because 2^60 is about 1e18. So for each possible m (from 2 up to 60), we can check if there exists a k such that the equation holds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n, check for all possible m (starting from 2 up to some upper limit), and for each m, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nIf for any m and k this is true, return YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nBut how to check for each m?\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n(k^{m+1} -1) = (k-1)*n\n\nBut that's not helpful directly. Alternatively, the equation is:\n\nsum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nk^0 +k^1 + ... +k^m =n.\n\nBut for fixed m, this is a function of k. For each m, we can perform a binary search over possible k's.\n\nBut for each m, what is the possible range of k?\n\nLet's think for fixed m. For example, for m=2, the equation is k^2 +k +1 =n. So k^2 +k +1 =n → k^2 +k + (1 -n) =0. Solving for k, the positive root is [ -1 + sqrt(1 -4*(1-n)) ] / 2 → [sqrt(4n -3) -1]/2. So for each m, we can compute possible k's.\n\nBut since k must be ≥2, for each m, we can find the possible k's via binary search.\n\nBut for each m, the minimal possible sum is when k=2. For example, for m=2, the sum is 2²+2+1=7. For m=3, sum is 2^4-1/(2-1)=15. For m=4, 31, etc. So for a given m, the minimal sum is S_min = 2^{m+1} -1/(2-1) = 2^{m+1} -1. Wait no, the sum for k=2 and m steps is sum_{i=0}^m 2^i = 2^{m+1} -1. So for m≥2, the minimal sum for that m is 2^{m+1} -1. So if n is less than that, then for this m, there is no possible k.\n\nSo for each m, we can check if n is at least 2^{m+1} -1. If not, skip this m. Otherwise, perform a binary search on k between 2 and some upper bound.\n\nBut what's the upper bound for k for a given m? Well, for a given m, the sum increases with k. So for a given m, the sum for k is sum_{i=0}^m k^i. Let's think for m fixed. Let's say for m=2, the sum is k^2 +k +1. For larger k, the sum increases. So for a given n, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper limit. What's the upper limit?\n\nWell, for a given m, the sum is at least k^m (since all terms are positive). So k^m ≤ sum =n → k ≤ n^(1/m). So for binary search, the upper bound can be n^(1/m) +1. But since m can be up to around 60, for n=1e18, n^(1/m) is manageable.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check for m from 2 up to max_m (like 60, since 2^60 is about 1e18). For each m:\n\n   - Compute the minimal possible sum for m, which is 2^{m+1} -1. If n < this value, skip.\n\n   - Else, perform a binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound] to see if there exists a k such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i =n.\n\n   - If found, return YES.\n\nIf none of the m's work, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given m and k? For m up to 60 and k up to say 1e9, it's possible that the sum would overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, we can compute the sum incrementally and check if it exceeds n. For example, for a given k and m, compute sum_{i=0}^m k^i. If during the computation, the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's too big.\n\nSo for a given k and m, compute the sum step by step:\n\nsum = 0\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0..m:\n\n   sum += current_term\n\n   current_term *=k\n\n   if sum >n: break\n\nif sum ==n: return yes.\n\nBut for m up to 60, and k up to say 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nBut how to perform the binary search for k for each m?\n\nLet me think for each m:\n\nWe can binary search k in the range [2, upper], where upper is something like n^(1/m) + 1.\n\nBut how to find upper? Well, since sum_{i=0}^m k^i >= k^m. So k^m <=n → k <= n^(1/m). So upper can be set to n^(1/m) +1. But calculating n^(1/m) can be done via binary search or using math.pow. However, for very large exponents, even this can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, for binary search on k, we can start with low=2 and high= some value. For example, high can be 2, and then double until the sum for that k and m is larger than n. Once we have a high that is larger than the possible k, we can perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis approach avoids having to compute the exact upper bound.\n\nSo for each m, we can:\n\nInitialize low=2, high=2.\n\nWhile the sum for k=high and m is less than n, multiply high by 2. Once we have a high where the sum is larger than n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nOnce we have that range, perform binary search for k in that range. For each candidate k, compute the sum and check if it's equal to n.\n\nNow, for each m, the steps are:\n\nCheck if the minimal sum (for k=2) is <=n. If not, skip.\n\nElse, find the possible k via binary search.\n\nBut for m up to 60, and t up to 1e4, this approach may be feasible.\n\nNow, what about the case when m is such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i =n for some k?\n\nLet me take the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFor example, n=13. The output is YES. Let's see:\n\nFor m=2, the equation is k^2 +k +1 =13 → k^2 +k -12=0. Solving: k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +48)]/2 → sqrt(49) is 7 → ( -1 +7 )/2 = 3. So k=3. Which is valid. So YES.\n\nAnother example: n=6. The output is NO. Let's see:\n\nCheck for m=2: sum is k² +k +1 =6 → k² +k -5=0. The roots are (-1 ± sqrt(21))/2. Not integer. So no solution. For m=3, sum is k^3 +k² +k +1 =6. Let's try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15>6. So no. So no solution.\n\nAnother example: n=15. Output is YES. For m=3, sum is k^3 +k² +k +1 =15. Let's try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15. Yes. So m=3, k=2. Valid.\n\nSo the code needs to check all possible m's up to log2(n) +1.\n\nNow, the next question is, what is the maximum m that needs to be checked?\n\nFor example, for n=1e18, the maximum m is such that 2^{m+1} -1 <=n. Let's compute m_max:\n\n2^{m+1} -1 <=1e18 → 2^{m+1} <=1e18 +1 → m+1 <= log2(1e18) ≈ 60. So m_max is up to 60. So for m from 2 to 60, we can check.\n\nSo the code can loop m from 2 to 60 (since for m=60, 2^{61} is about 2e18, which is bigger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 60.)\n\nThus, for each test case, we can loop m from 2 to 60, and for each m, perform the binary search on k.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, for each test case n:\n\nIf n is 1, output is NO (since the minimal possible is 7 for m=2, k=2).\n\nBut let's check the sample input. For n=1, the output is NO. For n=2, output is NO. For n=3, output is NO. For n=6, output is NO. For n=13, output is YES.\n\nSo the code needs to handle these cases.\n\nNow, for each m in 2 to 60:\n\n   Compute the minimal sum for m, which is when k=2. sum_min = 2^{m+1} -1. If n < sum_min, skip.\n\n   Else, perform binary search for k in the range [2, ... ] to find if there's a k where the sum equals n.\n\nNow, how to compute the sum for a given k and m?\n\nWe can compute it as follows:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return total\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut since m can be up to 60, and k up to say 1e6, this loop is manageable.\n\nBut for very large k, even for m=2, the sum can be very big. However, during the binary search, we can check for overflow early.\n\nSo during the binary search, for a given k and m, compute the sum, and if it exceeds n, we can return early.\n\nSo, in code, for each m, we can:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, m) < n:\n\n    high *=2\n\nOnce we have high such that compute_sum(high, m) >=n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut for some cases, even when high is 2, compute_sum(high, m) could be larger than n. For example, when m=2 and n=7, compute_sum(2, 2) is 7, which equals n.\n\nBut during the binary search, we need to find if there exists a k in [low, high] such that compute_sum(k, m) ==n.\n\nOnce the binary search is done, if found, return YES.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=7. For m=2, k=2. Sum is 1+2+4=7. So YES.\n\nCase 2: n=15. For m=3, k=2. Sum is 1+2+4+8=15. YES.\n\nCase 3: n=31. For m=4, k=2. Sum is 1+2+4+8+16=31. YES.\n\nAnother case: n=21. For m=2, k=4. Sum 1+4+16=21. So YES.\n\nSo the code should catch all these.\n\nAnother case: n=1. For all m, sum_min for m=2 is 7>1. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=2. Same as above.\n\nNow, what about when the sum is for m=2, but k is not integer?\n\nFor example, n=8. For m=2, the equation is k² +k +1 =8 → k² +k -7=0. The discriminant is 1 +28=29. sqrt(29) is irrational. So no solution. So check for other m's. For m=3, sum is k^3 +k² +k +1 =8. Trying k=2 gives 15>8. So no. So answer is NO.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\n   if n is 1: print NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      flag = False\n\n      for m in 2 to 60:\n\n          sum_min = 2^(m+1) -1. If n < sum_min: continue.\n\n          else:\n\n              perform binary search for k in [2, ... ] to find if compute_sum(k, m) ==n.\n\n              if found, set flag=True and break.\n\n      if flag: print YES else NO.\n\nBut how to compute sum_min? For m up to 60, 2^(m+1) can be very big. For example, m=60, 2^61 is 2e18, which is bigger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, when m is 60, sum_min is 2^61-1, which is larger than 1e18. So for m=60, sum_min would be 2^61-1. So for n=1e18, this sum_min is larger than n, so we skip.\n\nThus, for each m, we can calculate sum_min as 2^{m+1} -1. But for m up to 60, 2^{m+1} can be up to 2^61, which is about 2e18. So for n up to 1e18, sum_min for m=60 is 2^61-1 which is larger than 1e18. So in that case, the code skips m=60.\n\nBut how to compute 2^{m+1} -1? For m up to 60, 2^{m+1} can be computed as 1 << (m+1), but for m+1 up to 61, which is manageable.\n\nBut for m up to 60, 2^{m+1} can be up to 2^61, which is 2,251,799,813,685,248. For n up to 1e18 (which is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000), sum_min for m=59 is 2^60 -1. Which is 1,152,921,504,606,846,975. Which is larger than 1e18. So for m=59, sum_min is 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, sum_min is 1.15e18>1e18. So for m=59, sum_min is larger than n. Thus, for m up to say 50, sum_min can be less than n.\n\nBut how to compute sum_min?\n\nIn code, for each m, sum_min = (1 << (m+1)) -1. However, when m+1 is up to 60, this is manageable. However, for m=60, (1<<61) is 2^61, which is 2,251,799,813,685,248. For n up to 1e18, this is larger than n. So for each m, compute sum_min and check if n >= sum_min.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nBut in Python, for m up to 60, 1 << (m+1) is manageable.\n\nBut for m=60, 1 << 61 is 2^61. So for n=1e18, sum_min is 2^61 -1, which is about 2.25e18, which is larger than 1e18. So the code will skip.\n\nNow, let's proceed to code.\n\nNow, implement the compute_sum function as a helper.\n\nBut in code, for a given k and m, compute the sum and check if it's equal to n.\n\nBut for large k and m, the sum can be very big. However, during the computation, we can check if the sum exceeds n and break early.\n\nImplementing this in code:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, target):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > target:\n\n            return total\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, this can be slow? Well, since m is up to 60, and for each binary search step, this is O(m) operations. For each m, the binary search steps are O(log(high)), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, for each m, we need to find if there exists a k such that compute_sum(k, m, n) ==n.\n\nSo for each m, the steps are:\n\nCompute the minimal sum for k=2. If n is less than that, skip.\n\nElse, find the upper bound for k.\n\nOnce the upper bound is found, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nNow, code for the binary search part:\n\ndef find_k(n, m):\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    # Find upper bound\n\n    while compute_sum(high, m, n) < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # Now binary search between low and high\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n\n        if s == n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif s < n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut need to handle cases where compute_sum returns a value greater than n. Also, during the binary search, the compute_sum function returns the sum, which may be larger than n. So if the sum is larger than n, we need to adjust the high.\n\nBut in the binary search, for each mid, if compute_sum(mid, m, n) is less than n, then we need to search higher. Else, search lower.\n\nOnce this function returns True, then there exists a k for this m.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut for the case when m is such that the sum for k=2 is already larger than n, we can skip.\n\nBut for the code, for each m in 2 to 60:\n\nsum_min = 2^(m+1) -1\n\nif n < sum_min:\n\n   continue\n\nelse:\n\n   check if there exists a k >=2 such that compute_sum(k, m, n) ==n.\n\nBut how to compute sum_min?\n\nsum_min = (1 << (m+1)) -1 ?\n\nBut for m=2, 1 << 3 is 8, minus 1 is 7, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for m up to 60, 1 << (m+1) can be up to 1 << 61, which is 2^61. However, for n up to 1e18, when m is large, sum_min can be larger than n, so we skip.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor m in range(2, 61):\n\n    sum_min = (1 << (m+1)) -1\n\n    if n < sum_min:\n\n        continue\n\n    else:\n\n        check if there exists k.\n\nBut wait, sum_min is the sum when k=2. So for example, if n is exactly sum_min, then k=2 is a solution. So for example, n=7 (m=2, sum_min=7). So code will check.\n\nBut for m=2 and sum_min=7, n=7 is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code for each test case.\n\nBut what about when m is such that sum_min is 2^{m+1} -1, but n is larger than that. For example, m=2, sum_min=7. Suppose n=8. Then, we need to check if there's a k>2 such that the sum equals 8.\n\nFor m=2, the sum is k² +k +1 =8 → k² +k -7 =0. The solution is k=( -1 + sqrt(1+28 )) /2 = sqrt(29) ~5.385. So no integer solution. So for this case, returns false.\n\nBut for m=3, sum_min is 2^4 -1=15. So for n=8, it's less than sum_min. So code skips m=3.\n\nThus, returns no.\n\nAnother example: n=15. For m=3, sum_min is 15. So check. For k=2, compute_sum(2,3,15) is 1+2+4+8=15. So returns yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, handling the case when m is such that sum_min is exactly n. For example, n=7, m=2. Then returns yes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for very large exponents, the sum_min calculation may overflow? For example, m=60, 1 << 61 is 2^61. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead t.\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   read n.\n\n   if n ==1: print NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      flag = False\n\n      for m in 2 to 60:\n\n          sum_min = (1 << (m+1)) -1\n\n          if n < sum_min:\n\n              continue\n\n          else:\n\n              # check if there exists k for this m.\n\n              # perform the binary search.\n\n              # call find_k(n, m)\n\n              if find_k(n, m):\n\n                  flag = True\n\n                  break\n\n      if flag:\n\n          print(\"YES\")\n\n      else:\n\n          print(\"NO\")\n\nBut what about other possibilities where the sum is not in the form of sum_{i=0}^m k^i, but for example, for m=2, but the sum is 1 +k +k^2, but with m=2, but the sum could be achieved for some other m and k?\n\nNo, because we check all possible m up to 60, and for each possible m, check if there's a k.\n\nBut what about cases where m is larger than 60? For example, m=61. But for m=61, sum_min is 2^62 -1. Which is way larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, m can't be larger than 60.\n\nSo the code covers all possible m's.\n\nNow, what about when the sum is for m=2 and k=3 (sum is 1+3+9=13), which is the sample input. The code would check m=2, sum_min=7. Since 13 >=7, proceed to check. Then find k=3.\n\nBut how does the binary search find it?\n\nLet's think for m=2, n=13.\n\nsum_min is 7. So proceed.\n\nInitially, low=2, high=2. compute_sum(2, 2, 13) is 1+2+4=7 <13. So high *=2 → 4. compute_sum(4, 2,13) is 1+4+16=21>13. So binary search between 2 and 4.\n\nmid = (2+4)//2 =3. compute_sum(3,2,13) is 1+3+9=13 → equal. return True.\n\nThus, code returns yes.\n\nNow, code seems to handle this.\n\nAnother example: n=255. The sample output says YES. Let's see.\n\nWhat is 255?\n\nFor example, m=2, k=15: 1+15+225= 241 <255. Not.\n\nm=2, k=16: 1+16+256=273>255.\n\nNo. What about m=3?\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² +k³ = (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =255.\n\nTry k=4: 1+4+16+64=85 <255.\n\nk=5: 1+5+25+125= 156 <255.\n\nk=6: 1+6+36+216= 259>255. Close. So no.\n\nWhat about m=4?\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² +k³ +k^4 = (k^5 -1)/(k-1) = 255.\n\nTry k=3: 1+3+9+27+81= 121 <255.\n\nk=4: 1+4+16",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single vertex and adding layers of vertices connected in a specific manner. The challenge is to check if there exists a valid configuration of layers and branching factor `k` that results in exactly `n` vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands in layers. Each layer adds vertices such that each vertex in the previous layer connects to `k` new vertices. The total number of vertices after `m+1` layers (starting from 0) can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: $ S = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} $.\n\n2. **Constraints on Parameters**: For a valid snowflake, `k` must be greater than 1, and the number of layers `m` must be at least 2. This translates to checking possible values of `k` and `m` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: Given the constraints on `n` (up to $10^{18}$), we iterate over possible values of `m` from 2 to 60 (since $2^{60}$ is slightly more than $10^{18}$). For each `m`, we perform a binary search on `k` to check if there exists an integer `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, target):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n        total += current\n        if total > target:\n            return total\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef find_k(n, m):\n    low = 2\n    high = 2\n    # Find upper bound\n    while compute_sum(high, m, n) < n:\n        high *= 2\n    # Binary search between low and high\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n        if s == n:\n            return True\n        elif s < n:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if n == 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        for m in range(2, 61):\n            sum_min = (1 << (m + 1)) - 1\n            if n < sum_min:\n                continue\n            if find_k(n, m):\n                found = True\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series for given `k` and `m`, stopping early if the sum exceeds `n`.\n- **find_k**: This function uses binary search to determine if there exists a valid `k` for a given `m` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n- **main**: Reads input, processes each test case, and checks all possible values of `m` (from 2 to 60) to see if a valid `k` exists. If found, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible configurations using geometric series properties and binary search, ensuring it handles the large constraints effectively.",
