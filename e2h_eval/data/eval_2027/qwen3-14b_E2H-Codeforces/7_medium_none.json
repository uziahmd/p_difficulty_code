The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such graphs.\n\nFrom the description, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, each time we add new vertices by connecting them to existing ones that have only one connection. Each such step adds k new vertices to each of those nodes. And this process must be done at least once. Also, k has to be greater than 1.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's consider the steps:\n\nInitially, there's 1 node (let's call this level 0). Then, in the first step, we connect this node to k new nodes. So after step 1, total nodes are 1 + k. But then, each of those k nodes has only one connection (they are leaves), so in the next step, each of them gets connected to k new nodes. So for each of these k nodes, we add k nodes. So adding k * k nodes. The total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the step of adding new nodes (the expansion) must be done at least once. So for example, the minimal snowflake would be when we do the initial step (adding k nodes) and then do one expansion step. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once. So for example, the example given for k=4: the minimal snowflake has 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1+4+16=21? But the sample input says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm, maybe I need to re-express the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is a tree where each node has exactly k children except for the leaves. Wait, but the way the snowflake is constructed is similar to a tree where each node is expanded once. Let's think recursively.\n\nThe construction process:\n\n- Start with a root node (level 0).\n- Then, the root is connected to k children (level 1). Now, each of these level 1 nodes is a leaf.\n- Then, each of those leaves is connected to k new nodes (level 2). Now, the level 1 nodes have k children each, and the level 2 nodes are leaves.\n- This process can be repeated multiple times. However, the expansion step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two levels: root (level 0), level 1 (k nodes), and then each level 1 node is expanded once (so level 2 nodes). So total nodes is 1 + k + k*k.\n\nWait, but the sample input includes n=13. Let's see: For example, if k=3, then 1 + 3 + 3*3 = 1+3+9=13. Which matches the sample input where n=13 is a YES. So that's the case. So the snowflake can be constructed with 1 + k + k^2 nodes. But also, perhaps other possibilities where there are more levels. For example, maybe after expanding once, you can expand again. Let's think.\n\nSuppose the process is done m times. Let's model the number of nodes. Let me think of m as the number of expansion steps. The initial step (step 0) is the root. Then, the first expansion (step 1) adds k children to the root. Then, each expansion step adds k children to each existing leaf. But how does the number of nodes grow?\n\nLet me think of it as layers. The first layer (layer 0) is the root. Then, layer 1 has k nodes. Layer 2 has k * k nodes. Layer 3 has k * k * k nodes. So for m layers, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i. But wait, the expansion steps are done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first layer) is required, then at least one expansion step (adding the second layer). So the minimum number of layers is 2. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. But if there are more expansion steps, like adding a third layer, then the total would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3, etc.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as the sum of a geometric series of the form sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m >= 2 (since the expansion must be done at least once, which implies that m is at least 2?), or maybe m >= 1? Wait, let me recheck the rules.\n\nThe rules say:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., the leaves) is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the first step is to add k children to the root. Then, the step of expanding the leaves (which are the children of the root) is done at least once. So the minimal case is when we add the first layer (k nodes) and then expand once (adding k^2 nodes). So the total is 1 + k + k^2. So the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe first expansion is the initial step of adding the k nodes. Then, the expansion step (adding new nodes to leaves) is done once. So the initial step is not considered an expansion step. The expansion steps are the steps where you take all the leaves and add k children to each. So the initial step (adding the first layer) is required. Then, the expansion steps are done at least once. So for example, the minimal case is:\n\nInitial step (add k nodes) → then expansion step 1 (each of the k leaves gets k children). So total nodes is 1 + k + k*k.\n\nIf there's another expansion step (step 2), then each of the k^2 leaves gets k children. So total nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m >= 2. Because sum from i=0 to m is (k^(m+1) -1)/(k-1). Wait, sum from i=0 to m is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. For m=2, that's 1 + k +k^2. So the problem requires that the sum equals n, and that m >= 2. Wait, no. Because the expansion steps are done at least once. So the sum would be for m >= 2?\n\nWait, the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, the expansion steps (the part where you add new nodes to leaves) is done at least once. So that would mean that the number of layers is at least 2 (the root, the first layer, and the second layer). So the sum is 1 + k + k^2, which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. But the sum for m=2 is 1 + k +k^2. So the total number of nodes is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, the process can be thought of as follows. Let's say that the snowflake is built with m levels. The root is level 0. Then, each level i (for i ≥ 1) is formed by adding k children to each node of level i-1. But the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal number of levels is 2. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m (k^i) where m ≥ 2. Because for m=2, that's 1 +k +k^2. For m=3, it's 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the problem is to check if there exists integers k>1 and m≥2 such that n equals sum_{i=0}^m k^i.\n\nBut how can we check this for a given n?\n\nThe approach is to find for each possible k>1 and m≥2, whether the sum equals n. However, since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check all possibilities.\n\nBut trying all possible k and m is impossible for large n. So we need to find a way to check for possible values of k and m.\n\nFirst, note that the sum S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for given n, we need to find integers k>1 and m≥2 such that this equation holds.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible m (starting from 2 upwards), we can check whether there exists a k>1 such that S =n.\n\nBut what are the possible values of m? Let's think. For m ≥ 2, the sum S is at least 1 +k +k^2. Since k>1, for m=2, the minimal sum is 1+2+4=7. For example, when n=6, the answer is NO, which matches the sample input.\n\nSo for each possible m ≥2, we can try to find if there exists a k>1 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how to find m and k?\n\nBut for large n, m can't be too big. For example, even for m=2, the minimal value of k is 2, leading to sum 1+2+4=7. For larger m, the sum grows exponentially. So for a given n, the possible m's are limited.\n\nFor example, for n=1e18, the maximum possible m is log_2(n) (since for k=2, the sum would be 2^{m+1}-1 over 1, which is 2^{m+1} -1. So solving for m+1 ≈ log2(n) gives m up to around 60).\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate m from 2 up to some maximum (like 60), and for each m, check if there exists a k>1 such that the sum equals n.\n\nNow, how to check for a given m and n, if there's a k such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nLet me denote m+1 as t. So t = m+1, and since m≥2, t ≥3. So for each t ≥3, we can check if there exists k>1 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nSo the problem becomes for each t ≥3, check if there exists k>1 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how to find k for given t and n?\n\nWe can note that (k^t -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1} =n.\n\nSo for each t, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for fixed t, the function f(k) = sum_{i=0}^{t-1}k^i is strictly increasing in k. So for each t, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... upper_bound], and see if f(k) equals n.\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k? Well, since f(k) is sum_{i=0}^{t-1}k^i = (k^t -1)/(k-1). For k ≥2, this is ≥ 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... +2^{t-1} = 2^t -1. So for n to be equal to this sum, k must be ≤n^(1/(t-1)), because the sum is at least k^{t-1} (since all terms are positive). So for example, the largest term is k^{t-1}, so k^{t-1} ≤n →k ≤n^{1/(t-1)}.\n\nBut since t can be up to log_2(n) (for example, when t=60, then k can be 2, and sum would be 2^60-1, which is about 1e18). So for each t, the upper bound for k is something like n^(1/(t-1)).\n\nBut for each t, we can perform a binary search for k between 2 and some upper limit, say, n^(1/(t-1)) +1.\n\nBut how to compute that upper limit? Well, for binary search, even if we set the upper limit as n, but for large t, the binary search will quickly find that k is too big. But given that t can be up to 60, and for each test case, for each t up to 60, the binary search is O(log n) steps, this should be manageable.\n\nSo the algorithm steps for each test case n are:\n\nFor each possible t (from 3 up to max_t):\n\n   Check if there exists a k>1 such that sum_{i=0}^{t-1}k^i =n.\n\nIf any of these checks returns true, then output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the maximum possible t to check for a given n?\n\nLet me think. For t=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =n. The minimal value for this is 1+2+4=7. For larger t, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}. For fixed k≥2, the sum increases with t. So for a given n, the maximum possible t is such that for k=2, the sum is less than or equal to n. For example, for t=60, the sum for k=2 is 2^60 -1 ~ 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, t can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate t from 3 up to 60 (or until the sum for k=2 is larger than n). For each t, perform a binary search for k in 2 to upper_bound, and check if the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and t? Well, for large exponents, we need to compute it carefully, avoiding overflow. Since n can be up to 1e18, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.\n\nBut during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally. For example, for a given k and t, compute the sum as 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nBut calculating this directly may be time-consuming for large t. However, since t is up to 60, even for t=60, the loop is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute it using the formula (k^t -1)//(k-1). However, for k=1, this formula is invalid, but since k>1, it's okay.\n\nBut when computing this, we have to be careful with integer division. However, since the sum is an integer, the formula (k^t -1) divided by (k-1) will always be an integer.\n\nSo for the binary search step, for each candidate k, compute the sum using the formula and compare with n.\n\nBut for large exponents, computing k^t could be expensive? Well, for k up to 1e18 and t up to 60, k^t could be very big. However, since n is up to 1e18, once during the calculation of the sum, if the intermediate value exceeds n, we can break early and return that the sum is larger than n.\n\nSo for example, during the computation of the sum for a given k and t, we can compute it incrementally, adding each term. If at any point the sum exceeds n, we can stop and return that it's too big.\n\nThis is important to avoid overflow (but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily big, but for efficiency, it's better to break early).\n\nSo here's the plan for checking a given t and n:\n\nWe can perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound. The upper_bound for k can be determined as follows: for the minimal sum for that t (when k=2), which is 2^t -1. If this is already larger than n, then no need to check. So the upper bound for k can be something like n^(1/(t-1)), but since we can't compute that exactly, perhaps we can use binary search from low=2 to high= some value.\n\nBut for binary search, we can start with low=2 and high= something like n. However, since for a given t, the sum increases with k, the maximum possible k that can be considered is such that the sum for k is <=n. So for binary search, we can start with high=2, and keep doubling until the sum exceeds n, then use that as the upper bound. Alternatively, since for k >=2, the sum is at least 1 +k + ... +k^{t-1} >= k^{t-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{t-1} <=n → k <= n^{1/(t-1)}. So for example, for t=3, the upper bound is sqrt(n). For t=60, the upper bound is n^(1/59), which for n=1e18 is 1e(18/59) ~ 1e0.3, which is about 2.\n\nSo in practice, for higher t, the upper bound is small. So for each t, the binary search can be done efficiently.\n\nSo putting this together, for each test case n:\n\nCheck if n is 1: then answer is NO (since the snowflake requires at least 1 +k + ... with k>1, so for n=1, no).\n\nElse, for each t in 3 to max_t:\n\n   compute the minimal possible sum for k=2, which is (2^t -1)/(2-1) = 2^t -1. If this is larger than n, then no need to check higher t.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (say, up to n) to see if there exists a k such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\n      if found, return YES.\n\nAlso, we need to consider the case where the sum is for m >=2. Wait, earlier we said that t = m+1, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, no. Wait, the sum is for t terms. For example, when t=3 (sum of 3 terms), which corresponds to m=2 (since m+1 =t). So m is t-1. And since m must be >=2, then t must be >=3. So our loop for t starts at 3.\n\nBut what about other possibilities? Are there other ways to construct the snowflake? For example, what if the expansion steps are done multiple times, but not all the way to the full depth. Like, maybe the snowflake is built with some layers but not all the way. Wait, no. Because according to the construction rules, every time you add new nodes to the leaves. So the process is that each expansion step adds a new layer. So the total number of nodes is the sum of a geometric series with t terms (for t ≥3).\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1 → output NO\n\n2 → NO\n\n3 → NO\n\n6 → NO\n\n13 → YES (for k=3, t=3: 1+3+9=13)\n\n15 → YES (for example, 1+2+2^2 + 2^3= 1+2+4+8=15? No, that's for t=4. Wait, for t=3, 1+2+4=7. For t=4, sum is 1+2+4+8=15. So yes, 15 is sum for k=2, t=4. So t=4, which is allowed (since t≥3). So answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 255. Let's see: 2^8 -1 = 255. So for t=8, sum is (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So yes. So answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's see why. Let's check for possible t and k. For example, for t=3, the sum is 1 +k +k² =n. So solving k² +k +1 = 1e18. The solution for k is approximately sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. Let's compute k² +k +1 for k= 999999999. That's about 1e18. But maybe there's no integer solution. So perhaps for this case, there is no such k and t.\n\nSo the code needs to check for all possible t from 3 up to some maximum (like 60), and for each t, perform a binary search for k.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement for each test case n:\n\nif n < 7 (since the minimal possible sum is 7 for t=3, k=2), then return NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for t in 3 to 60:\n\n      compute the minimal sum for k=2: 2^t -1. If this is larger than n, break (since higher t will have even larger minimal sums).\n\n      else:\n\n         perform binary search for k between 2 and upper_bound (could be up to n^(1/(t-1)) )\n\n         during binary search, for a given k, compute the sum s = (k^t -1)/(k-1). Compare with n.\n\n         if s ==n, return YES.\n\nBut how to compute s without overflow? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, but for efficiency, during the calculation, we can compute the sum incrementally and check if it exceeds n, breaking early.\n\nAlternatively, compute the sum using the formula, but with care.\n\nBut for the binary search, perhaps it's better to compute the sum incrementally, to avoid possible issues with very large exponents. For example, for k=2 and t=60, the sum is 2^60 -1, which is manageable in Python.\n\nBut for larger k and t, it could be very big, but since during the binary search, we can check whether the sum exceeds n and break early.\n\nSo here's a helper function to calculate the sum for a given k and t, and return whether it equals n, or is larger than n, etc.\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(t):\n\n        total += k**i\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return 1  # sum exceeds n\n\n    if total ==n:\n\n        return 0  # equal\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # less than n\n\nBut for t=60 and k=2, this would compute 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^59 = 2^60 -1. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for larger k and t, this might be slow. However, given that t is up to 60, and for each test case, this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula (k^t -1) // (k-1). But need to compute k^t. For example, for k=2 and t=60, 2^60 is manageable.\n\nBut how to compute k^t? Well, in Python, pow(k, t) is straightforward.\n\nBut again, for large exponents, the formula can be used. However, during the calculation, we need to make sure that the sum doesn't exceed n. For example, if the formula gives a value larger than n, but during the incremental sum calculation, it's possible to break early.\n\nBut perhaps using the formula is faster. Let's think:\n\nsum = (k^t - 1) // (k-1)\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBut for cases where k=1, but since k>1, we don't have to worry.\n\nBut for large exponents, calculating k^t could be expensive. However, since t is up to 60, even for k=1e9, k^t is 1e540, which is a very big number. But in Python, it's manageable, but for the purpose of comparing to n (up to 1e18), once k^t exceeds n*(k-1) +1, then the sum will be larger than n.\n\nBut perhaps during the binary search, we can compute the sum using the formula, but check if it's equal to n.\n\nBut how to avoid overflow? Well, in Python, there's no overflow, but for performance, perhaps the incremental approach is better.\n\nBut given that t is small, the incremental approach is acceptable.\n\nSo the code for checking for a given t and n is:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = ?\n\nBut to find high, we can start with high=2, and while compute_sum(high, t, n) is -1 (sum is less than n), multiply high by 2. Once the sum is larger than n, then we can binary search between low and high.\n\nSo for each t, the steps are:\n\nInitialize low=2, high=2.\n\nWhile compute_sum(high, t, n) == -1:\n\n   high *=2\n\nOnce the high is such that compute_sum(high, t, n) is 0 or 1.\n\nThen perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut for cases where even high=2 gives sum exceeding n, then there's no solution for this t.\n\nOnce the binary search is done, if any k is found, return YES.\n\nSo putting all this together.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase n=7: possible with t=3, k=2 → 1+2+4=7 → YES.\n\nn=6: no. So sample input for 6 is NO.\n\nAnother case: n=15. For t=4, k=2 → sum is 1+2+4+8=15 → YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3. The minimal sum is 7, so no.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nIn Python, the code would read t test cases, then for each n:\n\nif n is 1 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   check for all possible t from 3 up to 60 (or until 2^t -1 exceeds n).\n\n   for each t:\n\n      compute the minimal sum for k=2: 2^t -1. If this is larger than n, break.\n\n      else:\n\n         perform the binary search for k in this t.\n\n         if found, return YES.\n\n   if none found, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal sum for k=2? For t, it's 2^t -1. So for each t, check if 2^t -1 >n. If yes, then for higher t, it will be even larger, so break the loop.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nBut for t starting from 3, and increasing until 2^t -1 <=n.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, 2^t -1 can be up to 1e18. Let's compute the maximum t for which 2^t -1 <=1e18.\n\nFor example, 2^60 is ~1.15e18. So 2^60 -1 is ~1.15e18. So for n=1e18, t can go up to 59, since 2^59 is ~5.7e17, which is less than 1e18.\n\nSo the loop for t can run up to 60.\n\nThus, in code, for each test case n:\n\nif n < 7: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for t in range(3, 61):\n\n      min_sum = 2^t -1\n\n      if min_sum >n:\n\n          break\n\n      else:\n\n          perform binary search for k in this t.\n\n          if found, return YES.\n\n   if no t found, check if there's another possibility. Wait, what about other possibilities where the sum is not a full geometric series. For example, maybe the snowflake is built with different layers. But according to the problem statement, the construction is such that each expansion step is done on all leaves. So the sum must be a geometric series. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about cases where the snowflake is not built to full depth. For example, suppose after building up to some layers, but not all. But according to the construction rules, the expansion steps are done at least once. So the snowflake must be built with layers up to some m, which is the same as the sum of the geometric series. So the code is correct.\n\nSo now, the code steps:\n\nImplement the helper function to compute the sum for a given k and t.\n\nBut for the binary search, the code for each t:\n\ndef check_t(n, t):\n\n    # find if there exists k>1 such that sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i =n.\n\n    # compute the minimal sum for k=2.\n\n    # first, find upper bound for k.\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    while True:\n\n        s = compute_sum(high, t, n)\n\n        if s == 0:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif s == 1:\n\n            break\n\n        else:\n\n            high *=2\n\n    # Now binary search between low and high.\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, t, n)\n\n        if s == 0:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif s == 1:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return False\n\nBut how to implement compute_sum.\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(t):\n\n        total += k**i\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return 1\n\n    if total ==n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1\n\nBut for large t and k, this could be slow. However, since t is up to 60, it's acceptable.\n\nBut for k=2 and t=60, it's 60 iterations. For each test case, and for each t up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nBut for the binary search steps, for each t, the binary search could take up to log2(high) steps, which for high up to n^(1/(t-1)), but since t is up to 60, and for n up to 1e18, this is manageable.\n\nNow, considering that for each test case, the code will check up to 60 t values, and for each t, the binary search is O(log(high)), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample input 13:\n\nFor t=3, the minimal sum is 2^3 -1=7 ≤13.\n\nSo perform binary search for k between 2 and ... let's see.\n\nInitially, high=2. compute_sum(2,3,13) is 1+2+4=7 <13 → returns -1. So high is multiplied by 2 → 4.\n\ncompute_sum(4,3,13): 1 +4 +16 =21>13 → returns 1. So binary search between 2 and 4.\n\nmid=(2+4)//2=3.\n\ncompute_sum(3,3,13) → 1+3+9=13 → returns 0 → return True. So yes.\n\nAnother sample input is 15. For t=4, the minimal sum is 2^4 -1=15. So check t=4, k=2. compute_sum(2,4,15) is 1+2+4+8=15 → returns 0. So yes.\n\nAnother sample input is 255. For t=8, 2^8 -1=255. So yes.\n\nSample input 1000000000000000000 (1e18). Let's see. For t=3, we need to find k such that 1 +k +k² =1e18. Solving k² +k +1 = 1e18. The approximate solution is k ≈ sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. Let's compute k= 999999999. Then k² is (1e9 -1)^2 = 1e18 - 2e9 +1. Adding k gives 1e18 -2e9 +1 + 1e9 -1 +1 = 1e18 - e9 +1. Which is less than 1e18. So for k= 999999999, sum is less than 1e18. For k= 1e9, sum is 1e18 + 1e9 +1. Which is larger than 1e18. So no solution for t=3. For higher t, maybe?\n\nFor example, for t=2? No, since t starts from 3. So for t=3, no solution. For t=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³. For k= 1e6, sum is 1 + 1e6 + 1e12 + 1e18. Which is way larger than 1e18. So perhaps for some t, there is a solution. But according to the sample input, the answer is NO. So why?\n\nBecause the code would check all possible t and k, but none of them would satisfy.\n\nSo for n=1e18, the code returns NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the code for the sample input 15. For t=4, the code would find k=2 and return YES.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, handling the case when n is 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n ==1 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   flag = False\n\n   for t in 3 to 60:\n\n      compute min_sum = 2^t -1.\n\n      if min_sum >n → break.\n\n      else:\n\n         perform the binary search for k in this t.\n\n         if found → flag = True, break.\n\n   if flag → YES else NO.\n\nBut how to compute 2^t? In Python, 2 ** t.\n\nBut for t up to 60, 2^60 is manageable.\n\nBut for large t, even 2^t can be larger than n. So for example, for t=3, 2^3-1=7. For n=7, it's okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the helper functions.\n\nBut in Python, for each test case, the code can be written as:\n\ndef solve():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    t_cases = int(input[0])\n\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t_cases+1]))\n\n    for n in cases:\n\n        if n ==1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        found = False\n\n        for t in range(3, 61):\n\n            # Compute 2^t -1\n\n            min_sum = (1 << t) -1  # 2^t -1.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed based on specific rules. The snowflake graph is built in layers, starting from a single vertex and expanding each layer by connecting new vertices to existing leaves. The key insight is that the total number of vertices in such a graph follows a geometric series.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph's vertex count follows the sum of a geometric series. For a given number of layers `t`, the sum of vertices is given by the formula $ \\frac{k^t - 1}{k - 1} $, where `k` is the number of new vertices added at each step.\n2. **Constraints Check**: For each test case, we check if `n` can be represented as such a sum for any valid `k > 1` and `t ≥ 3`.\n3. **Binary Search**: For each possible number of layers `t`, we perform a binary search on `k` to check if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(t):\n        term = k ** i\n        total += term\n        if total > n:\n            return 1\n    if total == n:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return -1\n\ndef check(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    for t in range(3, 61):\n        min_sum = (1 << t) - 1  # 2^t - 1\n        if min_sum > n:\n            break\n        # Binary search for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound\n        while True:\n            res = compute_sum(high, t, n)\n            if res == 0:\n                return True\n            elif res == 1:\n                break\n            else:\n                high *= 2\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            res = compute_sum(mid, t, n)\n            if res == 0:\n                return True\n            elif res == 1:\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t_cases = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t_cases+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if check(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check Function**: This function determines if a valid snowflake graph can be formed for a given `n`. It iterates over possible values of `t` (number of layers) and uses binary search to find a valid `k` for each `t`.\n3. **compute_sum Helper Function**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series for given `k` and `t`, checking against `n` to determine if it matches, exceeds, or is less than `n`.\n4. **Binary Search**: For each `t`, we use binary search to efficiently find if there exists a `k` such that the geometric series sum equals `n`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the snowflake graph within the constraints, leveraging mathematical properties and binary search for optimal performance.",
