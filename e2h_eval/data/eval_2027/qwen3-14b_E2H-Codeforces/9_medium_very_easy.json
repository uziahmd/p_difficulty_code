Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting souvenirs with maximum total cost without exceeding the weight limit. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. But each souvenir's weight is between 1 and 3. Oh right, that's a key point here. Because the weights are small, maybe we can find an efficient way to handle this.\n\nSo, the classic knapsack problem, but with weights limited to 1, 2, 3. The standard DP approach for knapsack would be O(nm), which for n=1e5 and m=3e5 would be 3e10 operations—way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are only 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can group the items by their weight and then process them in a way that allows us to compute the optimal selection efficiently.\n\nFor example, for each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight category, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, when considering how many items of each weight to take, we can use some greedy approach combined with dynamic programming.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think about the problem again. For each weight class, we can take as many items as possible, but the problem is that combining different classes may lead to better results. However, since the weight is small, maybe we can model the problem with a DP that tracks the maximum value for each possible weight up to m, but optimized using the fact that each item's weight is small.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a modified knapsack problem where we handle each weight group separately. Let me think of the approach used in some similar problems.\n\nAnother idea: For each weight type, sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight type, precompute the prefix sums. Then, for the DP, we can process each weight group and for each possible weight, decide how many items of that weight to take.\n\nBut how to combine them. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nLet's say we have three groups: items of weight 1, 2, 3. For each group, we sort them in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, we compute the prefix sum array. For example, for weight 1, the prefix sum array would be sum of top k items.\n\nThen, the problem becomes choosing how many items from each group to take, such that the total weight is <= m, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. Let's consider that the total weight is the sum of (number of weight 1 items) *1 + (number of weight 2 items)*2 + (number of weight 3 items)*3. So, for each possible number of weight 1 items and weight 2 items, we can compute how many weight 3 items can be taken. However, even that approach might be too slow if done naively.\n\nBut given that the maximum possible weight is 3e5, perhaps we can find a way to iterate through the possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method inspired by the knapsack problem with multiple items of same weight:\n\nWe can use dynamic programming where dp[w] represents the maximum value achievable with weight exactly w. Then, for each weight group, we process them and update the dp accordingly. However, given that m can be up to 3e5, and for each group, we have O(m) steps, this could be feasible.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, but each item is processed once, maybe this approach is manageable.\n\nWait, but the standard knapsack approach is O(nm), which is not feasible here. However, since the items are grouped by weight, perhaps we can optimize.\n\nFor example, for all items of weight 1, since they are sorted, we can take the top k items. For each possible weight w, we can compute the maximum value for taking k items of weight 1, and then proceed similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n- Preprocess the items for each weight (1, 2, 3), sort them in descending order of cost, and compute prefix sums.\n\n- Then, for the DP, we can use a 1D array where dp[w] is the maximum value achievable with total weight w.\n\n- Initialize dp[0] = 0, and others as -infinity or something.\n\n- Then, for each weight group (say, weight 1), we can iterate over the possible number of items to take, and update the dp accordingly. But how?\n\nWait, but perhaps we can do this in a way similar to the unbounded knapsack, but since each item can be taken at most once, but the items are grouped.\n\nAlternatively, for each weight group, we can process the items in a way that for each possible weight, we try adding the best possible number of items from that group.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Since the weight is small (1,2,3), the problem can be handled with a modified DP that considers the counts of each weight.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: For each weight group, we can take any number of items (up to the available count) of that weight. So for example, for weight 1 items, we can take 0,1,...,k items, where k is the number of weight 1 items. But since the items are sorted, taking the top k items gives maximum value.\n\nSo the idea is to precompute for each weight group the prefix sums, and then for each possible weight, try to find the optimal combination of taking some items from each group.\n\nBut how to combine them. Let's think of the following:\n\nLet's suppose we have three arrays:\n\nsum1: prefix sums for weight 1 items (sorted descending). sum1[k] is the sum of the first k items.\n\nsum2: same for weight 2.\n\nsum3: same for weight 3.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose a, b, c such that a*1 + b*2 + c*3 <= m, and sum1[a] + sum2[b] + sum3[c] is maximized.\n\nBut how to find a, b, c efficiently.\n\nThe problem is that a can be up to the number of weight 1 items (say, cnt1), and similarly for b and c. But with m up to 3e5, and cnt1 up to 1e5, this seems challenging.\n\nBut perhaps we can fix two variables and compute the third. For example, for each possible a and b, compute the maximum c that can be taken given that a*1 + b*2 + c*3 <= m. But even that approach would be O(cnt1 * cnt2) which could be O( (1e5)^2 ), which is 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weights are 1,2,3, perhaps for each possible total weight, we can compute the best way to reach it by considering the previous steps.\n\nLet me think of the DP approach again. Let's create a dp array where dp[w] is the maximum value achievable with total weight w. Initially, dp[0] = 0, others are -infinity or zero?\n\nBut how to update this array for each weight group.\n\nFor example, for the weight 1 items, we can process them as follows: for each possible weight w in reverse (from m down to 1), and for each possible number of items of weight 1 that can be added. However, since the items are sorted, taking as many as possible would be optimal. Wait, but this is similar to the 0-1 knapsack problem, but with multiple items of the same weight.\n\nWait, no. Each item is unique. So for the weight 1 group, we have multiple items, each of weight 1. We need to select a subset of them. Since they are sorted by cost, the best way to take k items is the first k items. So for the weight 1 group, the maximum value for taking k items is sum1[k], which is the prefix sum.\n\nSo the problem becomes similar to the bounded knapsack problem, where for each weight group, we can take up to k items (for weight 1, k is the count of items with weight 1).\n\nBut how to process this efficiently.\n\nAn efficient way to handle this is using the \"monotonic queue\" optimization for bounded knapsack, but that's complicated and perhaps not necessary here given the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is 1, 2, or 3, perhaps we can find for each weight group the best way to include them into the DP.\n\nLet me think for each weight group:\n\nFor weight 1 items:\n\nEach item has weight 1. So for the DP, for each possible weight w, we can consider taking 0, 1, ..., up to min(cnt1, w) items. But since the items are sorted, taking the top k items gives the maximum value for k items. So for the DP, after processing the weight 1 items, for each weight w, dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - k] + sum1[k]) for all possible k (but how to compute that efficiently).\n\nBut this seems like O(m * cnt1) time, which again is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each weight group, we can process it in a way that for each possible weight, we take the best possible number of items from that group.\n\nFor example, for weight 1:\n\nWe have sorted items in descending order. For each possible weight w, the best is to take as many of the top items as possible. However, since we are building a DP, perhaps for each weight group, we can process it in a way that for each possible weight, we check all possible numbers of items from that group.\n\nBut again, for large m, this is expensive.\n\nWait, here's another approach. Since the items are sorted, for each weight group, the best way to take items is to take the first k items. So for each group, the maximum value for taking k items is known. So for each possible weight, we can try to take some number of items from the group and update the DP accordingly.\n\nFor example, for the weight 1 group, we can loop through the possible number of items to take (k) and for each possible weight w, update dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - k] + sum1[k]). But again, this seems O(m * cnt) time.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute this more efficiently. For example, for the weight 1 group, the maximum number of items we can take is min(cnt1, m). So for each possible weight w, we can take up to w items. However, for each w, the optimal choice is to take as many as possible, but that depends on the previous state. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the weight is 1, we can process this group in a way similar to the unbounded knapsack. But since each item can be taken once, but the items are sorted, perhaps for each weight w, the best is to take the top k items where k is up to the number of items available and up to w. But again, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following. For each weight group (say, weight w_i), we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, during the DP phase, for each weight group, we can iterate through the possible weight values and for each possible weight, try adding all possible numbers of items from that group. However, for large m, this is still O(m * cnt) time.\n\nBut given that the weight is small (1, 2, 3), maybe there's a way to optimize this.\n\nLet me think of the DP approach again. Let's assume that we have processed the weight 1 items. Then, for each weight w, dp[w] is the maximum value achievable with total weight w. Now, for the weight 2 items, we can process them similarly. For each weight w from m down to 2, and for each possible number of items of weight 2 that can be taken (say, k items), then dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - 2*k] + sum2[k]).\n\nBut again, for each weight w, trying all possible k is expensive.\n\nBut wait, for weight 2 items, the maximum number of items that can be taken is min( cnt2, floor( (m)/2 ) ). However, even that is O(m) for each group.\n\nBut here's an alternative idea. For each weight group, process the items in a way that for each possible weight, we can take any number of items from that group. For example, for weight 1, since the items are sorted, taking the first k items gives the best value for k items. So for each possible weight, we can try taking 0, 1, ..., up to possible items. However, for the DP, we can do this in a way that for each possible weight, we check for each possible number of items from that group. But again, this seems computationally heavy.\n\nAnother thought: Since the weight is 1, 2, or 3, perhaps we can use a greedy approach for some parts. For example, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can take as many as possible, but considering the combination with the other weights.\n\nBut the problem is that greedy approaches don't always work for knapsack problems. However, since the weights are small, maybe there's a way to find an optimal solution by combining some greedy choices with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- For each weight group (1, 2, 3), sort the items in descending order of cost.\n\n- Precompute prefix sums for each group.\n\n- Then, for the DP, we can use a 1D array of size m+1.\n\n- For each weight group, we can process it in a way that for each possible weight, we try adding as many items from that group as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0, and others as -infinity or 0?\n\nWait, the standard approach for the 0-1 knapsack is to process each item and for each possible weight, check whether including the item improves the value. But here, we have groups of items with same weight.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, since they are sorted, we can take up to k items, where k is the number of items in that group. So for the DP, when processing this group, for each possible weight w, we can try to take any number of items from this group. However, since the items are sorted, taking the first k items is optimal for k items. So for each possible weight, we can compute the maximum possible value by taking some number of items from this group.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nLet's think of the following. For the weight 1 group, the maximum number of items we can take is min( cnt1, m ). Let's say we have prefix sums sum1[0...cnt1], where sum1[k] is the sum of the first k items. For each possible weight w, we can take up to k = min(w, cnt1) items. For each possible k, we can check if dp[w - k] + sum1[k] is larger than the current dp[w]. But doing this for all possible w and k would be O(m^2) in the worst case, which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can find that for each weight w, the optimal k is the maximum possible. But that's not necessarily true. For example, taking one less item might allow for more items from other groups.\n\nHmm. This seems tricky.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Since the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can model the problem with a dynamic programming approach that tracks the maximum value for each weight modulo 3 or something like that. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a solution I've read before for similar problems. When the item weights are small, we can use a modified knapsack approach where for each weight group, we process it in a way that allows us to take up to a certain number of items.\n\nFor example, for the weight 1 group:\n\nWe can process each item in the group, and for each weight from m downto 1, we check if taking this item improves the value. However, since the items are sorted, we can take them greedily. But this would be O(nm), which is still not feasible for n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5.\n\nWait, but for the weight 1 group, the number of items is up to 1e5. If we process them one by one, and for each item, we update the DP array from m downto 1, then it's O(nm) time. Which would be 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nThis suggests that this approach isn't feasible.\n\nSo what's the alternative?\n\nLet me think again about the problem constraints. Since the weights are 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can find a way to combine the groups.\n\nLet me think about the following. For each weight group, after sorting, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, for each possible number of items from the weight 1 group (a), and from the weight 2 group (b), compute how much weight is left for the weight 3 group.\n\nBut again, with a and b possibly up to m, this is O(m^2), which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can find that for each possible total weight, we can find the best combination of a and b, and then compute c accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight of the 3 group is 3, for each possible remaining weight after taking a and b, we can take as many as possible from the 3 group.\n\nBut how to compute a and b optimally.\n\nLet me think. For each possible weight w, the maximum value is the sum of:\n\nvalue from weight 1 items (a items, total weight a)\n\nvalue from weight 2 items (b items, total weight 2b)\n\nvalue from weight 3 items (c items, total weight 3c)\n\nsuch that a + 2b + 3c ≤ m.\n\nBut how to find the optimal a, b, c.\n\nAnother idea: Since the weight is small, we can iterate over the number of weight 3 items. For example, for each possible c (number of weight 3 items taken), we can compute the remaining weight (m - 3c), and then solve the problem of selecting items with weight 1 and 2, with total weight ≤ (m - 3c). Then, take the maximum over all possible c.\n\nSimilarly, for each c, we can compute the best possible value from weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute that for each c quickly.\n\nLet's think about this. For each possible c (ranging from 0 to min( cnt3, floor(m/3) )), we can compute the remaining weight rem = m - 3c. Then, we need to choose a and b such that a + 2b ≤ rem, and the sum of sum1[a] + sum2[b] is maximized.\n\nNow, how to compute this for each rem. For this, we can precompute for all possible rem the maximum value of sum1[a] + sum2[b] where a + 2b ≤ rem.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nFor this part, the problem reduces to solving a knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2. But since the weight is small, we can find an efficient way.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have for the weight 1 and 2 groups, sorted and with prefix sums. For a given rem, how to find the best a and b.\n\nLet me think for a fixed rem. For each possible b (number of weight 2 items taken), the maximum a is min(rem - 2b, cnt1). So the value would be sum2[b] + sum1[min(rem - 2b, cnt1)]. We can try all possible b from 0 to min( cnt2, floor(rem / 2) ), and take the maximum.\n\nBut for each c (which could be up to m/3), this would be O(rem) time. Which could be O(m^2) overall. Not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute for all possible rem the maximum value of sum1[a] + sum2[b] with a + 2b ≤ rem.\n\nHow to precompute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following. For each possible rem, we can find the best b (number of weight 2 items) and then take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nFor example, for a given rem, the maximum b is min( cnt2, floor(rem/2) ). For each possible b in 0 to this maximum, the corresponding a is min(rem - 2b, cnt1). Then, the value is sum2[b] + sum1[ a ].\n\nThe maximum over all possible b is the value for this rem.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all rem.\n\nBut if we can precompute for each possible rem the best value, then for each c, we can get the best value for rem = m - 3c.\n\nSo the question is, how to compute this for all possible rem up to m.\n\nLet me think of this as a separate problem. Let's say we have two groups: items of weight 1 and 2, sorted and with prefix sums. How to compute for each possible weight W, the maximum value of sum1[a] + sum2[b], where a + 2b ≤ W.\n\nLet's denote this function as f(W).\n\nHow to compute f(W) for all W from 0 to m.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for computing f(W):\n\nFor each possible b (number of weight 2 items), we can take up to b_max = min( cnt2, floor(W / 2) ). For each b, the maximum a is min( W - 2b, cnt1 ). So the value is sum2[b] + sum1[ min( W - 2b, cnt1 ) ].\n\nWe can find for each W the maximum over all possible b.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all W.\n\nIf we precompute for all possible b, and for each possible W, find the maximum value for that b.\n\nBut for each b, the range of W where this b is possible is from 2b to ... ?\n\nAlternatively, for each b, the contribution to f(W) is for W ≥ 2b. And for each such W, the value is sum2[b] + sum1[ min( W - 2b, cnt1 ) ].\n\nBut how to find for each W the maximum over all possible b.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with some pre-processing.\n\nLet me think for each possible W:\n\nThe optimal b for W is the one that maximizes sum2[b] + sum1[ min( W - 2b, cnt1 ) ].\n\nBut since sum1 is non-decreasing (as we take more items), for each W, the best b is up to floor( W / 2 ), and for each b, the corresponding a is min( W - 2b, cnt1 ).\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly.\n\nLet me consider that for each W, the optimal b can be found in O(1) time if we have some precomputed data.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, the optimal b is either floor( (W - x)/2 ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that for a fixed W, as b increases, the term 2b increases, so W - 2b decreases. Thus, the term sum1[ min( W - 2b, cnt1 ) ] decreases as b increases. However, sum2[b] increases as b increases. So there's a trade-off between the two terms.\n\nThus, the maximum is achieved at some particular b, which could be found by iterating over possible b values for each W. But this would be O( (m/2) ) per W, which is again O(m^2) time.\n\nThis seems impractical for m up to 3e5.\n\nBut perhaps we can find that for a fixed W, the optimal b is around the point where the marginal gain of adding another weight 2 item is higher than the loss of reducing the weight 1 items.\n\nBut this might not help in practice.\n\nLet me think of another angle. Let's precompute for the weight 2 group the prefix sums sum2, and for the weight 1 group the prefix sums sum1. For each possible W, the best value is the maximum over all b in [0, min( cnt2, floor(W/2) ) ] of sum2[b] + sum1[ min( W - 2b, cnt1 ) ].\n\nBut for each W, the maximum over b can be found by iterating over all possible b for that W. However, since W can be up to 3e5, and for each W, the number of b's is up to 3e5/2, this is again O(m^2) time.\n\nBut perhaps we can find that for each W, the optimal b is up to a certain small number. For example, if the number of items in the weight 2 group is small, then the maximum b is small. However, in the worst case, this is not helpful.\n\nWait, but what if we precompute for each possible b, the minimal W where this b is considered. For example, for each b, the minimal W is 2b. Then, for all W >= 2b, this b is a candidate. But again, I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for computing f(W):\n\nWe can precompute for all possible b, the maximum possible a for that b, which is min( cnt1, W - 2b ). So for a fixed b, the contribution to f(W) is sum2[b] + sum1[ min( cnt1, W - 2b ) ].\n\nNow, for a fixed b, this contribution increases as W increases. So for each b, the contribution to W is a function that is increasing with W.\n\nBut how to find for each W the maximum among all these functions.\n\nThis sounds like a line sweep problem. For each b, we can imagine that for W >= 2b, the contribution is sum2[b] + sum1[ min( cnt1, W - 2b ) ].\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nAnother Idea: For a fixed W, the maximum possible b is up to floor(W/2). Let's say that the maximum number of weight 2 items is B = min( cnt2, floor(W/2) ). Now, for this W, the optimal b is somewhere between 0 and B. But since sum2 is non-decreasing and sum1 is non-decreasing, but the sum1 part decreases as b increases, the function may have a single peak, allowing binary search.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose sum2 is [0, 3, 5, 7], and sum1 is [0, 10, 15, 20], with cnt1 = 3. For a given W, say W=4. The possible b values are 0, 1, 2.\n\nFor b=0: a can be 4 → sum1[3] = 20 → total 0+20=20.\n\nFor b=1: 2b=2 → a=4-2=2 → sum1[2]=15 → total 3+15=18.\n\nFor b=2: 2b=4 → a=0 → sum1[0]=0 → total 5+0=5.\n\nSo the maximum is 20.\n\nAnother example: W=5.\n\nPossible b values: 0,1,2.\n\nFor b=0: a=5 → sum1[3] =20 → total 20.\n\nb=1: 2*1=2 → a=5-2=3 → sum1[3]=20 → total 3+20=23.\n\nb=2: 2*2=4 → a=1 → sum1[1]=10 → total 5+10=15.\n\nSo maximum is 23.\n\nSo in this case, the optimal b is 1.\n\nNow, for W=6:\n\nb can be up to 3 (if cnt2 allows). Let's assume cnt2 is enough.\n\nb=0: a=6 → sum1[3]=20 → total 20.\n\nb=1: a=6-2=4 → sum1[3]=20 → total 3+20=23.\n\nb=2: a=6-4=2 → sum1[2]=15 → 5+15=20.\n\nb=3: a=6-6=0 → sum1[0]=0 → 7+0=7.\n\nMaximum is 23.\n\nSo here, the optimal is b=1.\n\nAnother example: W=7.\n\nb can be up to 3 (assuming cnt2 is sufficient).\n\nb=0: a=7 → sum1[3]=20.\n\nb=1: a=5 → sum1[3]=20 → total 3+20=23.\n\nb=2: a=7-4=3 → sum1[3]=20 → 5+20=25.\n\nb=3: a=7-6=1 → sum1[1]=10 → 7+10=17.\n\nMaximum is 25.\n\nSo the optimal is b=2.\n\nSo for increasing W, the optimal b increases. So perhaps for a given W, the optimal b is around floor( (W - x)/2 ), but I'm not sure.\n\nBut this suggests that for each W, the optimal b increases as W increases. If this is the case, then we can use a two-pointer approach to find the optimal b for each W.\n\nLet me think. For each W, the optimal b is somewhere between the previous W's optimal b and the maximum possible b for W.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, for all possible W, we can iterate b from 0 to max_b, and keep track of the best value.\n\nBut again, this seems too slow.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible W, the optimal number of weight 2 items is either floor((W - a)/2), but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about the following: For a given W, the maximum value is achieved when we take as many weight 2 items as possible, but not so many that the remaining weight for weight 1 items is too small.\n\nBut since weight 1 items are more valuable per unit weight (if they are), but it depends on the actual values.\n\nBut since the items are sorted in descending order, the best way to maximize sum1[a] + sum2[b] for a + 2b <= W is to take the best combination.\n\nBut this seems stuck.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each possible W, the best value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking the best possible number of weight 2 items (b), and then taking the best possible weight 1 items for the remaining weight.\n\nOR\n\n- Taking the best possible number of weight 1 items, and then taking the best possible weight 2 items for the remaining weight.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, the maximum value can be computed as the maximum of:\n\nmax_{b} (sum2[b] + sum1[ min( W - 2b, cnt1 ) ] )\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each W, we can try b in the range [max(0, b_prev - K), min(B, b_prev + K)], where K is a small number like 100. This would be a heuristic, but for the purposes of this problem, maybe it works.\n\nBut this is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum2 is non-decreasing and sum1 is non-decreasing, but for a fixed W, the term sum2[b] + sum1[...] is not necessarily monotonic in b, but it might have a single peak.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each W, we can perform a ternary search on b to find the maximum.\n\nTernary search requires the function to be unimodal. Is this the case here?\n\nLet's see: For a fixed W, as b increases, sum2[b] increases, but the term sum1[...] decreases. The overall function could be unimodal, reaching a maximum at some point.\n\nFor example, in the earlier examples, the function increases up to a certain point and then decreases.\n\nIf this is true, then ternary search can be applied.\n\nAssuming that this is unimodal, for each W, we can perform a ternary search on b in the range [0, B], where B is min( cnt2, floor(W/2) ). This would reduce the time complexity for each W to O(log B), which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nLet me take a hypothetical scenario. Suppose sum2 is [0, 3, 5, 7], sum1 is [0, 10, 15, 20].\n\nFor W=7, the possible b ranges from 0 to 3 (assuming cnt2 >=3).\n\nThe values are:\n\nb=0: 0 + sum1[7] = 20 (since cnt1 is 3, min(7,3)=3).\n\nb=1: 3 + sum1[5] = 3 + 20 = 23.\n\nb=2: 5 + sum1[3] = 5 + 20 = 25.\n\nb=3: 7 + sum1[1] = 7 + 10 = 17.\n\nSo the function increases from b=0 to b=2, then decreases at b=3. So it's unimodal.\n\nAnother example: W=5.\n\nb ranges from 0 to 2.\n\nValues:\n\nb=0: 0 + sum1[5] = 20.\n\nb=1: 3 + sum1[3] = 3+20=23.\n\nb=2: 5 + sum1[1] = 5+10=15.\n\nSo it increases then decreases.\n\nAnother example: W=6.\n\nb ranges from 0 to 3 (if cnt2 >=3).\n\nb=0: 0 + sum1[6] = 20.\n\nb=1: 3 + sum1[4] = 3+20=23.\n\nb=2: 5 + sum1[2] = 5+15=20.\n\nb=3: 7 + sum1[0] =7+0=7.\n\nSo again, increases to b=1, then decreases.\n\nSo it seems that the function is unimodal. Thus, ternary search is applicable.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each W, we can perform a ternary search on b in the range [0, B], where B is min( cnt2, floor(W/2) ). This would reduce the time complexity for each W from O(B) to O(log B), making the overall time feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess the three groups (weight 1, 2, 3), sort each in descending order of cost, and compute prefix sums.\n\n2. For each possible c (number of weight 3 items taken), compute the remaining weight rem = m - 3*c. If rem < 0, skip.\n\n3. For rem, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items using the ternary search approach described above.\n\n4. The overall maximum is the maximum over all c of (value from step 3 + sum3[c]).\n\nNow, the question is: How to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut first, what is the maximum number of c? For m up to 3e5, c can be up to floor( m / 3 ), which is up to 1e5. So for each c, we have to perform a ternary search on b for rem = m - 3*c. This would be O(1e5 * log(1e5)) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, implementing this:\n\nFirst, for the weight 3 group, we need to precompute sum3, the prefix sums.\n\nThen, for each c from 0 to min( cnt3, floor(m/3) ), we calculate rem = m - 3*c. If rem < 0, continue. Otherwise, calculate the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items for rem, and add sum3[c] to it. Keep track of the maximum overall.\n\nNow, the key part is calculating the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items for a given rem.\n\nTo implement the ternary search for this part:\n\nFor a given rem, B = min( cnt2, rem // 2 )\n\nThe range for b is [0, B].\n\nWe perform ternary search on this range to find the b that maximizes the value.\n\nFor each candidate b, compute the value as sum2[b] + sum1[ min( rem - 2*b, cnt1 ) ]\n\nOnce we find the maximum value for this rem, we add sum3[c] to it.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut what about cases where the rem is very large, and B is also large? Well, with ternary search, it's O(log B) steps per rem.\n\nNow, what about the sum1 and sum2 prefix sums?\n\nFor example, sum1 is a list where sum1[0] = 0, sum1[1] = cost of first item, sum1[2] =",
