Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (which is 1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I need to think about the approach. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, 3, maybe we can handle each weight category separately. For example, for items with weight 1, we can take as many as possible, but since they might have varying costs, we should sort them in descending order of cost and take the top ones. Same for weight 2 and 3.\n\nBut how do we combine them optimally? Because taking a certain number of weight 2 items might be better than taking some weight 1 items, depending on their cost per unit weight. But since the weight is small, perhaps we can use dynamic programming, but with the constraints of the problem.\n\nWait, but with m up to 3e5 and n up to 1e5, a standard knapsack approach (like O(nm)) would be too slow. So we need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet me think: since all items have weights 1, 2, or 3, perhaps we can process each group (based on weight) and then find the optimal combination between them.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFor each weight (1, 2, 3), sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, compute the prefix sums. This way, for any number of items taken from that group, we can quickly calculate the total cost.\n\nOnce we have the prefix sums for each group, we can try different combinations of taking items from each group, such that the total weight doesn't exceed m.\n\nBut how to combine these?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. Let's say we have for weight 1, a list of prefix sums where the i-th element represents the maximum cost for taking i items. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items taken (say, k), we can calculate the remaining weight, and then find the best combination between weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut even that might be tricky. However, since the weight is small, perhaps we can iterate through all possibilities for the weight 3 items, and for each case, compute the optimal for the remaining weight using weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is small, maybe we can use a dynamic programming approach that handles each weight group.\n\nAnother idea: For each weight group, precompute the maximum possible value for each possible weight. Then combine them.\n\nBut again, with m up to 3e5, how can we do that?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that the items can be grouped by their weight. Let's process each weight group separately and then combine them.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For weight 1 items: we can take up to k items, where k is min(number of items, m). But since each item is weight 1, the maximum number is m. So we sort them in descending order and take as many as possible.\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nBut how to combine them optimally?\n\nLet me think of this as a 3-dimensional problem. But since the weights are small, perhaps we can find for each possible remainder modulo 1, 2, or 3, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nWe can first process all the weight 1 items, sort them in descending order of cost, and compute their prefix sum array. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items taken (let's say x), the total weight taken is 3x. The remaining weight is m - 3x. Then, for that remaining weight, we can take a combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items for a given capacity?\n\nFor that, perhaps we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, but given that m is 3e5, that might be feasible. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for the remaining capacity after taking some weight 3 items, let's say rem = m - 3x. Then, for rem, we can take some number of weight 2 items and some number of weight 1 items. How to find the optimal for that?\n\nLet me think: For a given capacity rem, we can take up to y weight 2 items, and the rest (rem - 2y) weight 1 items. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, and so are the weight 2 items, perhaps we can find the best y for that rem.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose we have a capacity of rem. Let's say we have a list of weight 2 items sorted in descending order, and their prefix sum. Similarly for weight 1.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 2 items (up to min( (rem)//2, len(weight2)), we can take y items, and then take (rem - 2y) weight 1 items. But since the number of weight 1 items can't exceed their count, but if we take the maximum possible, which is (rem - 2y) items, but only if there are enough items.\n\nSo for each possible y (number of weight 2 items taken), we can calculate the total cost as (sum of y weight 2 items) + (sum of (rem - 2y) weight 1 items). However, (rem - 2y) can't be negative, and also can't exceed the number of weight 1 items available.\n\nBut how to find the optimal y?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a two-pointer approach, or by checking for each possible y in a certain range.\n\nBut considering that for each x (number of weight 3 items), we need to compute the best combination for rem, which could be up to m. So for each x, the time would be O(k), where k is the number of weight 2 items. But if x can be up to m/3 (which is 1e5 for m=3e5), then this could be O( (m/3) * (m/2) ) = O( (3e5/3) * (3e5/2) ) = O(1e5 * 1.5e5) = 1.5e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible. So this approach is not going to work.\n\nAlternative idea: For the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value. Then, when considering weight 3 items, we can just subtract their weight from m and look up the precomputed value.\n\nBut how to compute that combination for weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have for weight 1 items, a sorted list (descending) and prefix sum. Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\nNow, for a given capacity W, what is the maximum value we can get from combining weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nLet me think of this as a knapsack problem with two types of items. But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, the optimal number of weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each possible capacity W, we can try taking up to k weight 2 items, where k is min( (W // 2), len(weight2)). For each possible k, the remaining capacity is W - 2k, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (up to min(remaining capacity, len(weight1))). The maximum over all k would be the answer.\n\nBut again, doing this for each possible W is O(W) per W, which would be O(m^2) in total. Which is not feasible.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted in descending order of cost. So for weight 1 items, the best is to take as many as possible. Similarly for weight 2 items. But when combining, perhaps for a given W, the optimal is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items. But how to find the optimal balance between the two?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, the maximum possible is the sum of those items plus the sum of the weight 1 items that fit into the remaining weight. Since the weight 1 items are sorted, the maximum number is min(remaining weight, len(weight1)), and the sum is the prefix sum up to that number.\n\nSo for a given W, we can iterate over the possible number of weight 2 items taken (from 0 to min(W//2, len(weight2))), and for each such y, compute the sum of y weight 2 items plus the sum of (W - 2y) weight 1 items. Then take the maximum over all possible y.\n\nBut even for this, for each W, this would take O(k) time, where k is the number of weight 2 items. But with W up to m, this is again O(m * k) time, which is not feasible for m=3e5 and k=1e5.\n\nSo this approach is not efficient enough.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the weight 2 items are sorted, and weight 1 items are sorted, perhaps we can find the optimal number of weight 2 items to take for a given W by binary search or some other method.\n\nFor example, for a given W, the optimal y (number of weight 2 items) is such that 2y is as large as possible, but not exceeding W, and the sum of the weight 2 items plus the sum of weight 1 items for the remaining weight is maximized.\n\nBut how to find this y efficiently?\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For each possible W, the optimal y can be found by considering that for each y, the remaining weight is W - 2y, and the number of weight 1 items we can take is min( (W - 2y), len(weight1) ). Let's assume that the number of weight 1 items is sufficient (i.e., len(weight1) >= W - 2y). Then, the total cost would be sum_2[y] + sum_1[W - 2y]. But if len(weight1) < (W - 2y), then it's sum_2[y] + sum_1[len(weight1)].\n\nBut how to find the best y?\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(y) = sum_2[y] + sum_1[ min( (W - 2y), len_1 ) ].\n\nWe need to find the y that maximizes this function, where y ranges from 0 to min( (W // 2), len_2 ), and also 2y <= W.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum quickly?\n\nThe function f(y) may have a single peak, so perhaps we can use ternary search to find the maximum. However, since the function may not be strictly unimodal, ternary search might not work. Alternatively, we can note that for y increasing, the sum_2 increases (since the items are sorted in descending order), but the sum_1 decreases (since W - 2y decreases). So the function may be unimodal, but not sure. However, even if it's not, trying all possible y in a small range around the optimal point might be feasible.\n\nBut how to find the optimal y?\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, the optimal y can be found by checking all possible y in the range [max(0, (W - len_1) // 2), min( (W // 2), len_2 )], because beyond that, taking more weight 2 items would require taking fewer weight 1 items, but maybe not optimal.\n\nWait, for example, if we have a lot of weight 1 items, then perhaps taking more weight 2 items would be better. But how to find the optimal?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted, and weight 1 items are sorted, the best possible y is either the maximum possible number of weight 2 items, or the maximum number that allows taking as many weight 1 items as possible. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, the optimal y can be found by considering that the marginal gain of adding a weight 2 item (which is the cost of that item minus the cost of two weight 1 items). If the marginal gain is positive, take it, else stop. But this would require knowing the next items, which could be implemented with pointers.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of this as a greedy approach. Suppose we have a list of weight 2 items sorted in descending order, and weight 1 items sorted in descending order.\n\nInitially, take zero weight 2 items and take as many weight 1 items as possible. Then, check if swapping one weight 2 item (the best one) for two weight 1 items (the next two) gives a better result. If yes, do it, and repeat.\n\nBut this seems like a possible approach. However, implementing this for each W would be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible capacity W, the maximum value. Let's call this dp[W]. Then, for all W from 0 to m, we can compute dp[W] as follows:\n\nFor each weight 1 item, we can take it or not. But since we have a lot of items, this isn't feasible. However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, the optimal is to take as many as possible. So for any W, the maximum number of weight 1 items is min(W, len1), and the sum is sum1[min(W, len1)].\n\nSimilarly, for weight 2 items, the maximum number of items is min(W//2, len2), and the sum is sum2[min(W//2, len2)].\n\nBut combining both is tricky. However, perhaps we can model this as follows: For each possible number of weight 2 items (y), the total weight used is 2y, and the remaining weight is W - 2y. Then, the maximum number of weight 1 items is min(W - 2y, len1). So the total is sum2[y] + sum1[min(W - 2y, len1)].\n\nBut how to find the maximum over all possible y?\n\nIf we can find the optimal y for each W, then we can compute dp[W] quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach for combining weight 1 and 2 items:\n\nWe can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2 items. Then, for any capacity W, we can iterate over all possible y in the range [max(0, (W - len1) // 2), min(W//2, len2)], and compute the corresponding value. Because if we take more than (W - len1)/2 weight 2 items, then W - 2y would be less than len1, meaning that we can take all weight 1 items. So the possible range of y is limited.\n\nBut even this, for each W, could be O(1) or O(1) steps if the range is small.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose len1 is 1000, and W is 1000. Then, (W - len1) is 0, so (W - len1)/2 is 0. So the range of y is from 0 to min(W//2, len2). But if len2 is large, then this could be up to 500 steps. So for each W, it's O(500) steps. For m up to 3e5, that would be 3e5 * 500 = 1.5e8 operations, which might be manageable in Python if optimized properly.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Split the items into three groups based on their weight (w=1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost, and compute their prefix sums.\n\n3. For the weight 3 items, iterate through all possible numbers of items taken (x), from 0 to min(len3, m//3). For each x, the total weight used is 3x, and the remaining capacity is rem = m - 3x. Then, compute the maximum value for rem using the combination of weight 1 and 2 items as discussed above. Keep track of the maximum overall value.\n\n4. The maximum among all these possibilities is the answer.\n\nBut how to handle the combination of weight 1 and 2 items efficiently?\n\nLet me proceed with the code outline:\n\nFirst, read the input and separate the items into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order, compute prefix sums.\n\nFor example:\n\nprefix1[i] = sum of first i items in w1.\n\nSimilarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n\nThen, for each possible x in 0 to len3 (but 3x <= m):\n\n   rem = m - 3x\n\n   if rem < 0: continue\n\n   compute max_val for rem using w1 and w2.\n\n   current_total = prefix3[x] + max_val\n\n   update the global maximum.\n\nSo the key part is how to compute max_val for rem.\n\nTo compute max_val for rem, we need to find the best combination of w1 and w2 items.\n\nAs discussed earlier, for rem, we can iterate y from 0 to min(rem//2, len2), but considering that for each y, the number of w1 items is min(rem - 2y, len1). However, iterating all possible y for each rem might be expensive. But perhaps with some optimizations, it's manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the worst case. For each x, rem can be up to m (say 3e5). And for each rem, we iterate up to min(rem//2, len2). Let's assume len2 is up to 1e5, and rem is 3e5. Then, for each x, the inner loop could be up to 1.5e5 steps. For x up to 1e5 (since m is 3e5 and each x takes 3 units), that would be 1e5 * 1.5e5 = 1.5e10 steps. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is not feasible. So we need a better way.\n\nAlternative Idea: Precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nHow?\n\nLet me think of it as a knapsack problem where we can take items of weight 1 and 2. But since the items are sorted, maybe we can find a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut even then, the standard knapsack approach is O(nm), which is not feasible here. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find a way to compute the maximum for each capacity.\n\nWait, for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted, the best is to take as many as possible. Similarly for weight 2 items. So for any capacity W, the best is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find the optimal number of weight 2 items to take?\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items:\n\nFor a given capacity W, the optimal number of weight 2 items (y) is between max(0, (W - len1) // 2) and min(W//2, len2). Because if you take more than (W - len1) / 2 weight 2 items, then the remaining capacity (W - 2y) will be less than len1, so you can take all the weight 1 items. So the optimal y is in this range.\n\nBut how to find the best y in this range?\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the optimal y is the one that maximizes (sum2[y] + sum1[min(W - 2y, len1)]).\n\nSince sum1 is non-decreasing (as y increases, W - 2y decreases, so min(...) decreases, but sum1 is the prefix sum of sorted items, which increases with the number of items taken). So sum1 is non-decreasing as the number of items increases. But when we take fewer weight 2 items, the remaining capacity increases, allowing more weight 1 items. So the function may have a peak somewhere.\n\nBut how to find it quickly?\n\nLet me think of this as follows: For the given W, the optimal y is such that 2y is as close as possible to W - k, where k is the number of weight 1 items we can take. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the optimal y by considering that for each possible y, the value is sum2[y] + sum1[ min(W - 2y, len1) ].\n\nLet me think of this as two cases:\n\nCase 1: W - 2y >= len1. In this case, we can take all weight 1 items, and the value is sum2[y] + sum1[len1].\n\nCase 2: W - 2y < len1. In this case, we can take W - 2y weight 1 items, and the value is sum2[y] + sum1[W - 2y].\n\nSo the optimal y for case 1 would be the maximum possible y such that 2y <= W - len1. Let's call this y_max_case1 = floor( (W - len1)/2 )\n\nFor case 2, we need to find the best y between 0 and floor(W/2), but ensuring that 2y + (W - 2y) = W.\n\nBut how to find the optimal y in both cases?\n\nFor case 1, the maximum value is sum2[y] + sum1[len1], where y can be up to y_max_case1. Since sum2[y] is increasing with y, the best y in this case is y_max_case1. So the value for case 1 is sum2[y_max_case1] + sum1[len1].\n\nFor case 2, the value is sum2[y] + sum1[W - 2y], where y can be up to floor(W/2). To find the maximum of this, we can consider that for each y, the term W - 2y is the number of weight 1 items taken. Since the weight 1 items are sorted, the more weight 1 items you take, the higher the sum. But taking more weight 1 items means taking fewer weight 2 items. So there's a trade-off between the two.\n\nBut since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, and the weight 1 items are also sorted, perhaps the optimal y for case 2 is the one where the next weight 2 item is better than two weight 1 items.\n\nThis sounds like a greedy approach. Let me think: initially, take as many weight 2 items as possible, and fill the rest with weight 1 items. Then, check whether swapping one weight 2 item with two weight 1 items gives a better result. Repeat until no more swaps are beneficial.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm for case 2:\n\nInitialize y = min( len2, W//2 )\n\nThen, while y >= 0:\n\n   current value is sum2[y] + sum1[ W - 2y ]\n\n   compare with sum2[y-1] + sum1[ W - 2(y-1) ] = sum2[y-1] + sum1[ W - 2y + 2 ]\n\n   if the latter is larger, decrease y by 1.\n\n   else, break.\n\nBut this would take O(k) steps for each W, where k is the number of steps until the optimal is found. However, in practice, this might be fast enough.\n\nBut again, this would need to be done for each W, which could be expensive.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the weight 2 items are sorted and weight 1 items are sorted, the optimal y for case 2 is such that the next weight 2 item is not better than two weight 1 items.\n\nLet me think of this as follows: For the current y, the next weight 2 item (if we reduce y by 1) would give us 2 more weight 1 items. So, the difference between the sum of the y-th weight 2 item and the sum of two weight 1 items.\n\nIf the weight 2 item at position y is more valuable than two weight 1 items, then we should keep it. Otherwise, it's better to replace it with two weight 1 items.\n\nSo, the optimal y is the maximum y where the y-th weight 2 item is >= the sum of the next two weight 1 items.\n\nThis seems like a way to find the optimal y.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly?\n\nLet me think of this as follows: We can find the optimal y by comparing the cost of the y-th weight 2 item (which is the cost of the last item taken in the y weight 2 items) with the sum of the next two weight 1 items.\n\nWait, no. For example, when you take y weight 2 items, the total is sum2[y]. If you take y-1 weight 2 items, then you can take 2 more weight 1 items. So the difference between the two options is (sum2[y] - sum2[y-1]) vs (sum1[W - 2y + 2] - sum1[W - 2y]).\n\nWhich is comparing the cost of the y-th weight 2 item to the sum of the (W-2y+1)-th and (W-2y+2)-th weight 1 items.\n\nIf the weight 2 item is more valuable, keep it. Else, remove it and take the two weight 1 items.\n\nThis suggests that we can greedily adjust y until this condition holds.\n\nBut how to find the optimal y?\n\nLet me think of the following approach for case 2:\n\nStart with y = min( len2, W//2 )\n\nThen, while y > 0 and the cost of the y-th weight 2 item is less than the sum of the next two weight 1 items (which are the (W - 2y + 1)-th and (W - 2y + 2)-th items, if they exist):\n\n   decrease y by 1.\n\nThis would give the optimal y for case 2.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly?\n\nThis seems promising. Let's see.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose W is 5, and we have:\n\nsum2[y] is the sum of y weight 2 items.\n\nsum1 is the prefix sum of weight 1 items.\n\nAt y = 2, 2y =4, W - 2y =1. So sum1[1].\n\nIf the third weight 2 item (since y starts from 0) is c2, and the next two weight 1 items are c1 and c0 (assuming they exist), then we compare c2 with c1 + c0. If c2 < c1 + c0, then it's better to take one less weight 2 item and two more weight 1 items.\n\nSo this seems to be a way to find the optimal y.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nBut for each W, this requires checking the current y and possibly adjusting it. However, this seems like it would take O(1) steps per W, assuming that we can quickly compare the values.\n\nBut how to get the current y-th weight 2 item and the needed weight 1 items?\n\nWell, the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order. So the y-th item (assuming 1-based or 0-based index?) Well, the prefix sum arrays are typically 0-based. For example, prefix2[0] = 0, prefix2[1] = cost of first item, etc. So the y-th item (when we take y items) is the (y)th element in the sorted list.\n\nSo for the y-th weight 2 item, it's the (y)th element (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the prefix sum would be sum of first y items.\n\nAssuming the prefix arrays are 0-based, where prefix2[0] = 0, prefix2[1] = cost of first item, prefix2[2] = cost of first two items, etc.\n\nSo, the cost of the y-th weight 2 item is (prefix2[y] - prefix2[y-1]).\n\nSimilarly, the sum of the next two weight 1 items would be sum1[ (W - 2y) + 2 ] - sum1[ W - 2y ] ?\n\nWait, no. For example, if we have W - 2y weight 1 items taken, then if we decrease y by 1, we can take 2 more weight 1 items. So the new number of weight 1 items is (W - 2y + 2) = (W - 2(y-1)).\n\nBut W - 2y + 2 must be <= len1. So the sum of those two weight 1 items is sum1[ (W - 2y + 2) ] - sum1[ (W - 2y) ] ?\n\nYes.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\ncurrent_num_w1 = W - 2y.\n\nIf current_num_w1 + 2 <= len1, then the sum of two new items is sum1[current_num_w1 + 2] - sum1[current_num_w1].\n\nElse, it's the sum of the remaining items.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, during the adjustment of y, we can compute this.\n\nBut for the purpose of this comparison, we can assume that there are enough weight 1 items. If not, then we can't take the two items, and thus the comparison would be invalid.\n\nBut this seems complex. Perhaps, for the purposes of the algorithm, we can ignore the edge cases and just proceed, and during the calculation of the value, we'll take the minimum between the computed number and len1.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for all possible W, the optimal y for case 2, using this greedy approach.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe this is getting too complicated. Let's think back to the original problem.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps we can find an alternative way to handle the combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nFor the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for a capacity W can be calculated as follows:\n\nTake as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill with weight 1 items. Also, take as many weight 1 items as possible, and then fill with weight 2 items. Then, compare these two options and choose the better one. But this is not necessarily the optimal, but maybe it's a good approximation.\n\nAlternatively, take the maximum between:\n\na) the maximum number of weight 2 items possible, and fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nb) the maximum number of weight 1 items possible, and fill the rest with weight 2 items.\n\nc) some other combinations.\n\nBut this may not cover all possibilities, but it's worth trying.\n\nFor example, for a given W:\n\noption1 = take y = min(W//2, len2) weight 2 items, and take (W - 2y) weight 1 items.\n\noption2 = take (W - k) weight 1 items, where k is the number of weight 2 items that can be taken. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, option2 = take as many weight 1 items as possible, then fill with weight 2 items.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a few possible values of y around the optimal range and take the maximum.\n\nFor example, for a given W, try y = floor(W/2), y = floor(W/2) - 1, ..., down to max(0, floor(W/2) - 10), and similarly for the upper range. Since the optimal y is likely to be near the maximum possible y, this might work for practical purposes.\n\nBut this is a heuristic and may not work for all cases.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the following: since the weight 1 items are sorted, and the weight 2 items are sorted, the optimal combination is to take as many as possible of the higher value items. For example, if a weight 2 item is worth more than two weight 1 items, take it; otherwise, take the two weight 1 items.\n\nThis is similar to the greedy algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem, but since we can't take fractions, it's more complex.\n\nBut perhaps we can simulate this process for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\nWe have two pointers, i for weight 2 items and j for weight 1 items.\n\nInitially, i = 0 (number of weight 2 items taken), j = 0 (number of weight 1 items taken).\n\nWe want to maximize the total value, subject to 2i + j ≤ W.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nWe can compare the value of the next weight 2 item (if any) with the value of two weight 1 items (if any). If the next weight 2 item is more valuable, take it. Else, take two weight 1 items.\n\nThis would give us the optimal selection.\n\nBut how to implement this for a given W?\n\nLet me think of the following steps for a given W:\n\nInitialize i = 0 (number of weight 2 items taken), j = 0 (number of weight 1 items taken).\n\nWhile 2i + j < W and there are items left to consider:\n\n   if i < len2 and j + 2 <= W and (weight2[i] >= weight1[j] + weight1[j+1]):\n\n       take the weight 2 item: i += 1, add its cost to the total.\n\n   elif j + 1 <= W:\n\n       take a weight 1 item: j += 1, add its cost to the total.\n\n   else:\n\n       break.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach and may not always give the optimal solution. However, it's worth trying.\n\nBut how to implement this for a given W?\n\nFor example, for W = 5:\n\nInitially, i=0, j=0.\n\nCheck if there are weight 2 items and if taking one would be better than two weight 1 items. If yes, take it. Else, take one weight 1 item.\n\nBut this process would take O(len2 + len1) time for each W, which is not feasible.\n\nThus, this seems impractical for large W.\n\nBack to the original problem: what's the maximum possible m?\n\nm can be up to 3e5. So for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can precompute a dynamic programming array, where dp[w] is the maximum value for capacity w.\n\nThe recurrence would be:\n\ndp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - 1] + cost_of_weight1_item, dp[w - 2] + cost_of_weight2_item)\n\nBut since we have multiple items, this would not be directly applicable. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can use a different approach.\n\nWait, the items are sorted in descending order. So for weight 1 items, the best is to take as many as possible. Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\nSo for the dp approach:\n\nWe can process all weight 1 items first, then all weight 2 items.\n\nBut for weight 1 items, since they are all of weight 1, the maximum for any capacity w is the sum of the first min(w, len1) items.\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 items: the maximum for any capacity w is the sum of the first min(w//2, len2) items.\n\nBut combining both is the challenge.\n\nBut perhaps for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for a capacity w is the maximum between:\n\n- the maximum value for weight 1 items only (sum1[min(w, len1)])\n\n- the maximum value for weight 2 items only (sum2[min(w//2, len2)])\n\n- or a combination of both.\n\nBut how to find this combination?\n\nPerhaps we can precompute for each possible capacity w, the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items by using the following formula:\n\nfor each w, the maximum value is max( sum1[min(w, len1)], sum2[min(w//2, len2)], max_{y} (sum2[y] + sum1[min(w - 2y, len1)] )) )\n\nBut again, this brings us back to the same problem of finding the best y.\n\nBut if we can limit the number of y's we check for each w, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me think: for each w, the optimal y is in the range [max(0, (w - len1) // 2), min(w//2, len2)].\n\nLet's calculate the size of this range. For example, if len1 is large (say 1e5), and w is 3e5, then (w - len1) is 2e5, divided by 2 is 1e5. So the range is from 1e5 to min(3e5//2, len2). If len2 is 1e5, then the range is 1e5 to 1e5, which is one value. So for this case, it's just one value to check.\n\nAnother example",
