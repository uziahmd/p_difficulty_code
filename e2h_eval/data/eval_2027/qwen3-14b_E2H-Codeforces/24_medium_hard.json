She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem says that each second she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. So I need to model the steps she needs to take optimally.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial state. The current position is pos. The tabs that need to stay are from l to r. So any tabs outside this range need to be closed. But how do we do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The key is to find the optimal path where she moves the cursor to positions where she can close the necessary tabs with minimal steps.\n\nLet me consider the cases based on where the current position is relative to the target range [l, r].\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, maybe she doesn't need to do anything if l == r and pos is there. But if there are tabs outside, she needs to close them. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor. For example, if she is at position i, she can close all tabs to the left (so from a to i-1) or to the right (i+1 to b). But after closing, the a and b values change. So the idea is to find the optimal way to close all tabs outside [l, r], which may involve moving to certain positions and closing.\n\nBut since the target is to have only [l, r] open, the steps required would be:\n\n- Close all tabs to the left of l. So, if there are tabs to the left of l, she needs to close them. Similarly for tabs to the right of r.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the positions where she can perform the closing operations.\n\nFor example, to close all tabs to the left of l, she needs to be at position l. Because if she's at l, then closing tabs to the left would close [a, l-1]. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to be at r, and close the right side.\n\nAlternatively, if she can close all left tabs by being at some position, but perhaps the minimal steps involve moving to the correct positions and performing the closes.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Determine whether she needs to close tabs on the left and/or right.\n\nLet me define:\n\nIf l > 1: there are tabs to the left of l that need to be closed. So she needs to close them. Similarly, if r < n: tabs to the right need to be closed.\n\nSo, for example, if l is 2, then she needs to close tabs to the left of 2. To do that, she must be at position 2, then close the left. But how does she get there?\n\nSimilarly for the right side.\n\nSo the steps would involve:\n\n1. Moving to the position where she can close the left part (if needed).\n\n2. Closing the left part (if needed).\n\n3. Moving to the position where she can close the right part (if needed).\n\n4. Closing the right part (if needed).\n\nBut the order might matter. For example, if she needs to close both left and right parts, which order is better?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the target is [l, r] = [2,4], and the initial position is 3. She needs to close tabs to the left of 2 (tabs 1) and to the right of 4 (tabs 5,6 if n=6). So, she can first close left, then move to the right and close right. Or vice versa. Which is better?\n\nWell, the movement steps would depend on where she is. Let's say she's at 3. To close left, she needs to be at 2. So moving from 3 to 2 takes 1 step. Then closing left (1 second). Then, she's at 2. To close the right, she needs to be at 4. So moving from 2 to 4 takes 2 steps. Then closing right (1 second). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which matches the first example in the input.\n\nAlternatively, if she first moves to 4 (the right side), then closes right (if possible). Wait, but to close the right, she needs to be at 4, then close right. But if she is at 4, closing right would close tabs from 5 to n. But in this case, that's correct. Then, she needs to close left. So she would have to move from 4 to 2 (steps: 2 steps), then close left. So steps: moving to 4 (from 3: 1 step), close right (1 sec), then move to 2 (2 steps), close left (1 sec). Total steps: 1+1+2+1 = 5 again. Same result.\n\nSo the order of closing left and right doesn't affect the total steps in this case. But in some other cases, perhaps the order matters. So perhaps the optimal approach is to calculate the steps for both possibilities (close left first then right, or right first then left) and choose the minimum.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the general case.\n\nFirst, check if there are tabs to the left of l. That is, if l > 1. Similarly for tabs to the right of r (r < n).\n\nIf there are tabs to the left, then she needs to move to l, and close them. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut how to get to the positions where she can perform the closing operations.\n\nLet me think of the steps required for each part.\n\nFor the left part:\n\nIf l > 1, then she needs to be at position l to close the left. The time to get there is the distance from her current position (pos) to l. But wait, no. Because during the process, she may have already closed some tabs. But in the initial state, all tabs are open. So the initial a is 1, and b is n. So when moving, she can move freely between 1 and n.\n\nBut once she closes some tabs, the movement is constrained. However, in the problem statement, the movement is allowed to the left or right as per the current a and b. However, during the process of closing, she can perform the steps. But perhaps, the optimal strategy is to first move to the required positions (before any closing) because closing can be done once she's in the right spot.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when you close tabs, the a and b change. For example, if she closes the left tabs first, then the a becomes l. But if she closes the right first, then the b becomes r. However, when moving, she can move between the current a and b. So, during the movement steps, she can move between the original a and b (since she hasn't closed any tabs yet). So the movement steps can be calculated as if all tabs are open. Because the movement is allowed even if some tabs are closed, but during the movement steps, the a and b are adjusted as the tabs are closed.\n\nWait, but during the movement steps, the a and b are determined by the current open tabs. However, in the initial steps, before closing any tabs, all tabs are open. So, for example, if she is moving to reach a position to close the left, she can move freely between 1 and n. Once she closes the left, then the a becomes l, and movement is between l and n. But for the purposes of movement steps, perhaps the optimal path is to move directly to the required positions without considering the a and b changes until after the closing steps.\n\nBut maybe the movement steps can be considered as the distance between positions, regardless of the a and b, because during the movement steps, the a and b are not yet modified. Because she hasn't closed any tabs yet.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nIf she needs to close the left part (l > 1), then she needs to move to l, then close it. The movement steps from pos to l is |pos - l|. Then, one second to close.\n\nSimilarly, if she needs to close the right part (r < n), then she needs to move to r, then close it. Movement steps from pos to r is |pos - r|, plus one second.\n\nBut what if she needs to do both? Then, she has to choose between two options:\n\nOption 1: Move to l, close left (steps: |pos - l| + 1), then move from l to r (steps: |l - r|), then close right (steps + 1). Total steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1.\n\nOption 2: Move to r, close right (steps: |pos - r| + 1), then move from r to l (steps: |r - l|), then close left (steps + 1). Total steps: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if she can reach a position where she can close both sides in one movement. But I don't think so. Because closing left and right requires being at l and r respectively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close both left and right in a single operation. But no, because closing left would close tabs to the left of current position, and closing right would close tabs to the right. So, if she is at l, she can close left (tabs before l), and then she can close right (tabs after r) by moving to r and closing right.\n\nSo the total steps for both cases is the sum of the steps for each part, plus the movement steps between the two positions.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the target range? For example, if the initial pos is within [l, r], then maybe she doesn't need to move. But if she needs to close left and/or right, she has to move to the required positions.\n\nLet me take the example given in the problem:\n\nFirst input is 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close tabs left of 2 (tab 1) and right of 4 (tabs 5,6).\n\nSo for the left part, she needs to move to 2 (distance from 3 to 2 is 1 step). Then close (1 sec). Then move to 4 (distance from 2 to 4 is 2 steps). Then close (1 sec). Total steps: 1+1+2+1 = 5, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: input 6 3 1 3. Output is 1. Because the current position is 3. She needs to close tabs to the right (tabs 4-6). So she can be at 3, and close right. That takes 1 second. So the answer is 1.\n\nThird sample: 5 2 1 5. The target is all tabs, so nothing to do. Answer is 0.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nCalculate the steps required to close the left and right parts, if needed.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me break it down into variables:\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nIf left_needed is true, then she needs to close the left. Which requires moving to l, and closing.\n\nIf right_needed is true, then she needs to close the right. Which requires moving to r, and closing.\n\nBut the movement steps depend on the order in which she closes them.\n\nSo, the total steps would be:\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   option1: move to l, close left (steps: |pos - l| + 1), then move to r (steps: |l - r|), close right (steps + 1). Total: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\n   option2: move to r, close right (steps: |pos - r| + 1), then move to l (steps: |r - l|), close left (steps + 1). Total: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\n   choose the minimum between option1 and option2.\n\nif only left_needed:\n\n   steps: |pos - l| + 1\n\nif only right_needed:\n\n   steps: |pos - r| + 1\n\nBut wait, what if she can close both in a single movement? Like, if she is already at l and r is adjacent, but that's covered in the above.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is n? Then no steps needed. So the code needs to check if l == 1 and r ==n, then answer is 0.\n\nBut let's think about the cases again.\n\nAnother scenario: suppose l is 3 and r is 5. pos is 4. So she needs to close left (if l is 3, then tabs 1 and 2 need to be closed. So to close left, she needs to be at 3. She is at 4. So movement steps is 1. Then close left. Then, she is at 3. Then, she needs to close right (tabs 6,7... if n>5). So movement steps from 3 to 5 (distance 2) and close right. So total steps 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nBut what if she is already at l (pos is l) and needs to close left? Then steps are 0 (movement) + 1 (closing). Similarly for the right.\n\nBut also, what if she can close both left and right in one movement? For example, if she is at l, and r is such that she can close right from l? No, because to close the right, she has to be at r.\n\nSo, the steps for the left and right parts are as described.\n\nBut there's another possibility. What if she can close both left and right in one step? Well, that's not possible unless l = r, but in that case, she's already at the position and the left and right are not needed. For example, if l = r = 3, then there are no tabs to close left or right. So that's handled by the code.\n\nNow, what about the case where she is already in the correct position to close both left and right? For example, if l is 2 and r is 4, and pos is 2. She can close left (which is tabs to the left of 2, i.e., 1). Then she can move to 4 and close right. But she could also, after closing left, move to 4. Or perhaps, after closing left, she is at 2, and then moving to 4.\n\nBut the code as outlined would capture that.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCompute the steps as follows:\n\nInitialize total_steps = 0\n\nCheck if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   compute option1: steps to move to l, then move to r.\n\n   compute option2: steps to move to r, then move to l.\n\n   add 2 (for the two closing steps) to each option.\n\n   take the minimum of the two options.\n\nElse if left_needed:\n\n   steps to move to l, plus 1.\n\nElse if right_needed:\n\n   steps to move to r, plus 1.\n\nElse:\n\n   0 steps.\n\nBut wait, what if she can close both left and right from the same position? For example, if l = r, and the current position is l. Then, there's nothing to close. So steps is zero.\n\nBut what if l = r, but there are tabs to the left and right? For example, l = r = 3, n=5. Then, she needs to close tabs 1,2 and 4,5. So she needs to close left and right. How?\n\nIn that case, she can be at l (3), close left (tabs 1-2), then move to r (3, same position), and close right (tabs 4-5). So the steps would be:\n\nmove to l (if not already there) + 1 (close left) + move to r (0 steps) + 1 (close right). So total steps is |pos - l| + 1 + 0 + 1 = |pos - l| + 2.\n\nWhich is handled by the first case (left and right needed).\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut let's test the second example given in the input:\n\nInput is '6 3 1 3' → output is 1. So, l is 1, r is 3. So, n=6. Tabs to the right of 3 (tabs 4-6) need to be closed. So, right_needed is true. left_needed is false (since l is 1, no tabs to the left). So steps are |pos - r| + 1. pos is 3, r is 3. So steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input '5 2 1 5' → output 0. Since l=1 and r=5, which is the entire range. So no steps needed.\n\nAnother example: suppose n=4, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So left_needed (l=2>1), right_needed (r=3 <4). So steps would be:\n\nOption1: move to l (2) from pos (1): steps 1. Then move to r (3) from 2: steps 1. Total steps 1+1 + 2 (for closing) = 1+1 + 2 = 4?\n\nWait, no. The formula is:\n\noption1 is |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n\nBut what's the actual steps:\n\nMove from 1 to 2 (1 step). Close left (1 sec). Now, the a is 2. Then move from 2 to 3 (1 step). Close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. Correct.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, move to 3 first, then close right, then move to 2 and close left. Let's see:\n\nOption2: |pos - r| is |1-3|=2 steps. Then move from 3 to 2 (steps 1). So total steps is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. Which is worse than option1. So the code would choose the minimum between 4 and 5, which is 4. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about if the current position is already in the correct place for both left and right?\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So left_needed (l=2>1), right_needed (r=4 <5). So steps would be min( |3-2| + |2-4| + 2, |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 ) → min( (1 + 2 + 2) =5, (1 + 2 + 2)=5). So total steps 5.\n\nWhich would be: move to 2 (1 step), close left (1), move to 4 (2 steps), close right (1) → total 1+1+2+1=5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: pos is already at l. For example, pos is 2, l=2, r=4. So steps for left is 0 steps (already at l), close left (1 step). Then move to r (4) which is 2 steps, close right (1). Total steps 0+1 +2 +1=4.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what if the left and right are not needed? Like, when l=1 and r=n. Then steps is zero.\n\nSo the code would check left_needed = (l>1) → false, right_needed = (r <n) → false. So output 0.\n\nSo the code logic seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nThe input is four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nWe need to compute the steps as discussed.\n\nFirst, determine if left_needed and right_needed.\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n\n   option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n   total = min(option1, option2)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n   total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n   total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n   total = 0\n\nWait, but what if the pos is already in the correct position for closing left and/or right?\n\nLike, if l=2, pos=2, and left_needed is true. Then, moving steps is 0. So the code adds 0 + 1, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me think about the case where l=2, pos=2, and right_needed is also true. Then, the code would compute option1 and option2. For example, if r is 4, then option1 is 0 + 2 (abs(2-4)) + 2 → 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the pos is already at r? For example, pos is 4, l=2, r=4. So left_needed is true (l>1), right_needed is false (r=4, n=4). So the code would compute steps as abs(4-2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 steps. Which is correct: move from 4 to 2 (steps 2), then close left (1 sec). Total 3.\n\nBut what if the pos is already at l and r? Like, l=2, r=2, n=2. Then, no steps needed. Because left_needed is l>1? l is 2, so left_needed is 2>1 → yes. But r is 2, which is equal to n=2. So right_needed is false. So code computes steps as abs(pos - l) + 1. If pos is 2, then 0 +1 =1. But wait, why?\n\nWait, in this case, l=2, r=2. So the target is to leave tabs 2 open. So, the tabs to the left of 2 (tab 1) need to be closed. So, the steps would be: move to l (2) (already there) and close left (1 sec). So total 1 sec. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the initial pos is 1, l=2, r=2, n=2. Then steps would be |1-2| + 1 → 1 +1 =2. Which would be: move from 1 to 2 (1 sec), then close left (1 sec). Total 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=3, n=5. So left_needed is false (l=1), right_needed is true (r=3 <5). So steps are |pos - r| +1. For example, if pos is 3, then 0 +1 =1. Which is correct: close right (tabs 4-5) by being at 3, which takes 1 sec.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at r? Then, the steps are 1 sec. Which is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: l = r = pos. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3. Then, left_needed is l>1 → 3>1 → yes. right_needed is r <n → 3<5 → yes. So, we need to close left and right. So steps would be min( |3-3| + |3-3| + 2, ... ) → 0 + 0 + 2 = 2. Which would be: move to l (no steps), close left (tabs 1-2). Then move to r (same as l, 3 steps?), no steps. Close right (tabs 4-5). So total steps 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: l=1, r=n. So no steps needed. So code returns 0.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r= n. So code returns 0.\n\nAnother case: pos is outside [l, r]. For example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. Then, left_needed is l=2>1 → yes. right_needed is r=3 <5 → yes. So steps would be min( |1-2| + |2-3| + 2 = 1 +1 +2 =4, or |1-3| + |3-2| + 2 → 2 + 1 + 2 =5. So min is 4. So steps are 4.\n\nWhich would be: move to 2 (steps 1), close left (tabs 1) → 1 sec. Then move to 3 (steps 1), close right (tabs 4-5) → 1 sec. Total steps 1+1+1+1=4. Correct.\n\nAnother case: pos is to the left of l. For example, n=6, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So steps would be min( (1-2 steps? No, absolute value. |1-2| is 1. Then |2-4| is 2. So option1 is 1+2+2=5. Option2 is |1-4| is 3, then |4-2| is 2. 3+2+2=7. So min is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nThe code needs to read the input line, split into four integers, and compute the steps as per the above logic.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line of input with four integers. But in the sample input, the input is given as:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Because the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code should process one line per test case. However, the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and print the output. So perhaps the input is multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut the problem says \"the only line of input\" — but perhaps the problem is written in a way that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. This is conflicting. However, looking at the note, the sample input is given as three separate test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is described as a single line. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement. But according to the problem's input description, the code should read one line of input with four integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is in the format where multiple test cases are given, each in their own line. But the problem says \"the only line of input\".\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe first paragraph says:\n\nThe following is a competitive programming problem.\n\nThen the problem is presented. The input is given as:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers...\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects one test case per line. However, the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, which could be multiple lines.\n\nBut the problem says, \"the only line of input\", which suggests that the code should read one line. However, the sample input shows three lines. But perhaps this is a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects to process one test case per line.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows three lines, and the output has three lines, perhaps the actual code should read multiple lines (each line being a test case) and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem says, \"the only line of input\". So this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as a single line. So perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly. Alternatively, the problem may have multiple test cases, and the code should read all lines from stdin.\n\nBut the problem says, \"the only line of input contains four integers\", which implies that the code should read one line. However, the sample input shows three lines. This is a contradiction. However, the user's note says that the code should read input from standard input and print the outputs. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each given on a separate line.\n\nBut how to resolve this? Well, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe first sample input line is '6 3 2 4', and the output is 5.\n\nThe second line is '6 3 1 3' and output is 1.\n\nThird line is '5 2 1 5' and output is 0.\n\nSo the code should read each line from stdin, process it, and output the corresponding answer.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the result for each.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single line. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. So perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the code should read multiple lines.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the code should read multiple lines, each representing a test case.\n\nBut how to handle this? In Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin. For multiple lines, perhaps the code should read all lines, split each into four integers, and process them.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as a single line. So this is conflicting. However, the sample input and output show multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is intended to have multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut given that the problem says \"the only line of input\", perhaps the sample input is wrong. However, the user's note shows that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout, and the sample input is given as three lines, with three outputs.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, for each line, split into four integers, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is a single test case, but the sample input is given as multiple lines for illustration. However, the user's note says that the code should read from stdin, which may contain multiple lines.\n\nTo resolve this, perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case.\n\nThus, the code will read lines from stdin until EOF, process each line, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, it says that the input is a single line. But the sample shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where multiple test cases are given, and the code should process them all.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving the problem, I'll assume that the code should read one line of input (for a single test case), but the sample input is given with multiple lines. But that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is a single line, but the sample input is presented in a way that shows multiple test cases. However, the actual code should read one line.\n\nBut the user's note shows that the code should read input from stdin, and the sample input is given as three lines, and the output is three lines. Therefore, the code should read multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nSo the code will read all lines from stdin, split each into four integers, and compute the answer for each line.\n\nNow, back to the code.\n\nSo, for each test case, read n, pos, l, r.\n\nThen, compute left_needed = (l > 1), right_needed = (r <n).\n\nThen, proceed as discussed.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut for the code, the input is read from stdin. So, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute steps\n\n    left_needed = l > 1\n\n    right_needed = r < n\n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n        total = min(option1, option2)\n\n    elif left_needed:\n\n        total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_needed:\n\n        total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        total = 0\n\n    print(total)\n\nWait, but let's test this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: '6 3 2 4' → output 5.\n\nleft_needed = 2>1 → True. right_needed = 4 <6 → True.\n\noption1: |3-2| + |2-4| + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. option2: |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 =5. min is 5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: '6 3 1 3' → left_needed is 1>1? No. right_needed is 3 <6 → yes. So total is |3-3| +1 → 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: '5 2 1 5' → left_needed is 1>1? No. right_needed is 5 <5? No. So total is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3 → left_needed and right_needed.\n\noption1: |1-2| + |2-3| + 2 = 1 +1 +2 =4. option2: |1-3| + |3-2| +2 = 2+1+2=5. So min is 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, pos=1, l=2, r=2. left_needed is 2>1 → yes. right_needed is 2 <2 → no. So total is |1-2| +1 → 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=2. left_needed is 1>1? No. right_needed is 2 <2? No. So total is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=2, l=1, r=3. left_needed is 1>1? No. right_needed is 3 <3? No. So total 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=2, l=1, r=2. right_needed is 2 <3 → yes. So steps: |2-2| +1 = 1. Which is correct, since she needs to close tab 3. So move to 2 (already there), close right (1 sec). Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut what about when l is 1 and r is n, but pos is somewhere else? For example, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=5. Then total is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=5, pos=3. So no steps needed. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=5, pos=5. No steps needed. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=5, pos=5. So no steps needed. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read from stdin. However, in some programming competition platforms, the input is read as a single line, but in others, multiple lines. But according to the sample input, the code should process multiple lines. Hence, the code uses a loop over sys.stdin.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a single line. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. So this is confusing. However, given that the sample input shows three lines and the output three lines, the code should process each line as a test case.\n\nThus, the code is as written above.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a single line. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. But perhaps",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves calculating the optimal path to close the tabs on either side of the segment efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` (i.e., `l > 1`) and/or to the right of `r` (i.e., `r < n`).\n2. **Calculate Movement Steps**:\n   - If both left and right tabs need closing, compute the minimum steps required by considering two possible paths: closing left first then right, or right first then left.\n   - If only left tabs need closing, calculate the steps to move to `l` and close them.\n   - If only right tabs need closing, calculate the steps to move to `r` and close them.\n   - If no tabs need closing, the result is zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        n, pos, l, r = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        left_needed = l > 1\n        right_needed = r < n\n        \n        if left_needed and right_needed:\n            option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n            option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n            total = min(option1, option2)\n        elif left_needed:\n            total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        elif right_needed:\n            total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        else:\n            total = 0\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each representing a test case with four integers: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`.\n- **Determine Tabs to Close**: Checks if there are tabs to the left of `l` and/or to the right of `r`.\n- **Calculate Steps**:\n  - For both left and right tabs needing closure, it calculates two possible paths and chooses the minimum.\n  - For single-sided closures, it directly computes the steps needed to move to the respective end of the segment and close the tabs.\n- **Output**: Prints the minimum number of seconds required for each test case.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps required by considering both possible paths for closing tabs on both sides of the segment, ensuring optimal performance.",
