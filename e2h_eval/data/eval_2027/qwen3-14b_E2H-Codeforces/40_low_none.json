The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to compute this modulo a given mod value. Oh right, n can be up to 500, which is quite big. So I need an efficient approach here.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to compute the number of inversion pairs for all permutations. But since n is up to 500, generating all permutations is impossible. So there must be some mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think: The total number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q is equal to (total number of permutation pairs) / 2 minus the number of pairs where p equals q. Wait, since each pair (p, q) with p != q is either p < q or p > q. Since there are n! permutations, the number of pairs where p < q is (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of such pairs is (n! choose 2), which is (n!*(n!-1))/2. But the problem wants those pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how do I find the count of such pairs?\n\nLet me consider that for each possible inversion count i and j, how many permutations have i inversions, and how many have j inversions. Then, for all pairs (i, j) where i > j, multiply the counts of permutations with i inversions and those with j inversions, and then sum over all such i and j. But then, since we need p < q, we have to account for that as well. Wait, but maybe the lex order and inversion counts are independent? Or maybe not. Because the lex order and inversion count are two different properties.\n\nWait, but perhaps the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to [ (total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q)) - (number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q)) ] / 2 + something? No, maybe not. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose we consider all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q. For each such pair, either p < q or q < p. Now, suppose that inv(p) and inv(q) are compared. Let's think about the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q). Let's call this T. Then, since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds (if they are different). If they are equal, then neither. So, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). Let's say that for all permutations, the number of permutations with k inversions is C[k]. Then T is the sum over all i > j of C[i] * C[j].\n\nNow, for the problem, we need the number of (p, q) pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's denote this as the answer. How can we relate this to T?\n\nWell, note that for any pair (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So, if we look at all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, then the total number of such pairs is (n!)^2 - n! = n! (n! - 1). And the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is T. Now, among these, for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is considered. Suppose that inv(p) > inv(q). Then, in the ordered pairs, (p, q) contributes to T if p < q? No, no. Wait, T counts all ordered pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q), regardless of lex order. So, for each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) will be counted in T. For example, if inv(p) > inv(q), then (p, q) is counted in T. But (q, p) is not. So the total T is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) >",
    "response": "To solve the problem of counting the number of permutation pairs $(p, q)$ such that:\n\n1. $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$, and  \n2. The number of inversions in $p$ is strictly greater than the number of inversions in $q$,  \n\nwe need an efficient approach that avoids brute-force enumeration of all permutations.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n- **Total Number of Pairs:** There are $n!$ permutations. So the total number of distinct ordered pairs $(p, q)$ with $p \\ne q$ is $n! \\cdot (n! - 1)$.\n- **Lexicographical Order:** For any two distinct permutations $p$ and $q$, exactly one of $p < q$ or $q < p$ is true.\n- **Inversion Count Comparison:** Let $C[k]$ be the number of permutations of $n$ elements with exactly $k$ inversions. Then the total number of pairs $(p, q)$ with $p \\ne q$ and $\\text{inv}(p) > \\text{inv}(q)$ is:\n  $$\n  T = \\sum_{i=0}^{n(n-1)/2} \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} C[i] \\cdot C[j]\n  $$\n\n- **Answer Relation to Total Pairs:** Since for each pair $(p, q)$ with $p \\ne q$, exactly one of $p < q$ or $q < p$ holds, the number of pairs where $p < q$ and $\\text{inv}(p) > \\text{inv}(q)$ is exactly half of the number of unordered pairs $(p, q)$ where $\\text{inv}(p) > \\text{inv}(q)$. That is:\n  $$\n  \\text{Answer} = \\frac{T}{2}\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### Efficient Computation\n\nWe can compute $C[k]$, the number of permutations of length $n$ with $k$ inversions, using dynamic programming.\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` represent the number of permutations of length $i$ with $j$ inversions. The recurrence is:\n\n$$\ndp[i][j] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\min(j, i-1)} dp[i-1][j-k]\n$$\n\nThis works because inserting the $i$-th element (which is the largest so far) into a position that creates $k$ new inversions.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Precompute Inversion Counts:**\n   - Use a 2D DP table to store the number of permutations of size `i` with `j` inversions.\n   - Initialize `dp[1][0] = 1`.\n\n2. **Compute Total Valid Pairs:**\n   - Iterate over all pairs $(i, j)$ with $i > j$, and sum up $C[i] \\cdot C[j]$.\n\n3. **Divide by 2 and Modulo:**\n   - Since we only want pairs where $p < q$, divide the total by 2.\n   - Apply the given modulo at each step to prevent overflow.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n, mod = map(int, input().split())\n\n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    dp = [[0] * (max_inv + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[1][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(max_inv + 1):\n            for k in range(min(j, i - 1) + 1):\n                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - k]\n                dp[i][j] %= mod\n\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(max_inv + 1):\n        for j in range(i):\n            total += dp[n][i] * dp[n][j]\n            total %= mod\n\n    result = total * pow(2, mod - 2, mod) % mod\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n- We use modular inverse of 2 (`pow(2, mod - 2, mod)`) since division in modular arithmetic is not straightforward.\n- This solution runs in $O(n^3)$ time, which is acceptable for $n \\le 500$.\n- All intermediate steps are taken modulo `mod` to ensure no overflow occurs.\n\nThis code should correctly compute the required count of valid permutation pairs modulo `mod`.",
