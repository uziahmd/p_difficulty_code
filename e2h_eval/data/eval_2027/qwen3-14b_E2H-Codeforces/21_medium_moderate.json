The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm. Let me think about the parity here. For a chest with a_i and a key with b_j, a_i + b_j is odd. That means one of them is even and the other is odd. So, if the chest is even, the key must be odd. If the chest is odd, the key must be even. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, look at the keys: count how many are even and how many are odd. \n\nWait, right. Because for each even chest, we need an odd key. And for each odd chest, we need an even key. \n\nBut since each key can be used once and each chest can be opened once, the maximum number of chests is determined by the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nOh right! Because for example, if there are 3 even chests and 5 odd keys, then we can open 3 chests (each even chest uses an odd key). Similarly for the other way around. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys = 1, even_keys = 3.\n\nSo min(3, 1) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the first output.\n\nSecond example: chests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests =5, odd_chests=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So min(5, 1) + min(0, 0) = 1 + 0 =1. Which matches the second output.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. And odd_chests is 0, even_keys is 4. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the logic works. So the plan is:\n\n- Count even and odd in a list (chests)\n- Count even and odd in keys list\n- Compute the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of a_i. Then count how many are even and odd.\n\nThen read the list of b_j. Count even and odd.\n\nCompute the answer as described.\n\nNow, implement that in Python.\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd?\n\nFor each number in the list, check if it's even or odd. For example, for a_i, even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 ==0), same for odd_chest = n - even_chest.\n\nSame for keys.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\na = list of integers from input.\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\nThen for keys:\n\nb = list of integers.\n\neven_key = sum(1 for x in b if x %2 ==0)\n\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nThen answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_chest: 14,6,2 → 3. odd_chest is 2.\n\nkeys: [8,4,7,20]. even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7).\n\nso min(3,1) is 1. min(2,3) is 2. total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: n=5, m=1. a is [2,4,6,8,10]. even_chest=5, odd_chest=0. keys: [5]. even_key=0, odd_key=1. So min(5,1) is 1. min(0,0) is 0. total 1.\n\nThird sample: n=1, m=4. a is [10] → even_chest=1, odd_chest=0. keys are [20,30,40,50] → even_key=4, odd_key=0. So min(1,0) is 0. min(0,4) is 0. total 0. Correct.\n\nEdge cases: what if there are zero even chests? Or zero odd keys?\n\nLike, if all chests are odd, and all keys are even. Then min(odd_chest, even_keys) would be the answer.\n\nAnother case: chests have 2 even and 3 odd. Keys have 1 even and 4 odd. Then min(2,4) is 2, min(3,1) is 1. Total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead input. But note that the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait the input is given as follows. The first line is n and m. Then second line is the a_i. Third line is the b_j.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three test cases. Wait, the sample input shows three examples, but the actual input is per test case. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the input is for a single test case. The sample input shows three different test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich is one test case. Then another input is 5 1 etc. So the code needs to process a single test case. So the code will read n and m, then read the next two lines as the a and b lists.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute even_chest, odd_chest, even_key, odd_key.\n\nThen compute the answer.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead from stdin. But in Python, the input can be read via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, when there are multiple lines, it's better to read via sys.stdin. However, for code submission, perhaps the standard way is to read via input().\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute even_chest, etc.\n\nBut for the code to work, even if the input is read correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes.\n\nThat's the code.\n\nLet me test it against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_chest = 3.\n\nodd_chest = 2.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]. even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7).\n\nans = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na = [2,4,6,8,10]. even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\n\nb = [5]. even_key=0, odd_key=1.\n\nans = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1. Correct.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na = [10]. even_chest=1, odd_chest=0.\n\nb = [20,30,40,50]. even_key=4, odd_key=0.\n\nans = min(1,0) + min(0,4) → 0 + 0 = 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when there are 0 chests. But according to constraints, n and m are at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. a is [3], b is [2]. Then even_chest is 0, odd_chest is 1. even_key is 1, odd_key is 0. ans is min(0,0) + min(1,1) → 0 +1=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a is [1,3], b is [2,4]. even_chest is 0, odd_chest is 2. even_key is 2, odd_key is 0. ans is min(0,0) + min(2,2) → 0 +2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Similarly, count how many keys are even and how many are odd.\n2. **Match Parities**: For each even chest, we need an odd key, and for each odd chest, we need an even key. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the number of even chests and odd keys plus the minimum of the number of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of chest numbers `a`, and the list of key numbers `b`.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We count how many chests and keys are even or odd. This helps us determine potential matches.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openable Chests**: The result is calculated by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys (since each even chest needs an odd key) and adding it to the minimum of odd chests and even keys (since each odd chest needs an even key).\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys by leveraging parity checks and simple counting, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
