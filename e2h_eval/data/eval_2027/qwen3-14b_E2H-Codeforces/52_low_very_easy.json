Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the ones that have gone out. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The conversion rate is 'b' used candles to make one new one. And this new candle can be used again, so it's a loop.\n\nThe example given is when a=4 and b=2. The output is 7. Let me think through that example. \n\nFirst, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 used candles are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are used, so he can make 2/2 = 1 new candle. That adds 1 hour. Now, after that, he has 1 used candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b=2), so total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Right.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStart with 'a' candles. Each time you burn a candle, you add 1 hour, and you get one used candle. Then, whenever you have enough used candles (>=b), you can convert them into new ones. So the process is:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\nused_candles = 0\n\nBut wait, initially, he has 'a' candles. So he can burn them all, which adds 'a' hours. Then, the used_candles becomes 'a'.\n\nThen, while used_candles >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used_candles // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    used_candles = (used_candles % b) + new_candles\n\nWait, because after converting, the new_candles are burned, which adds their count to the total hours. But each time you convert, you take 'b' used candles to make one new. So for example, if you have 4 used, and b=2, you make 2 new. Then, after burning those, you have 2 used, which can be converted again.\n\nWait, but when you make new candles, you have to burn them. So each time you create new candles, you add that number to the total hours, and then those new candles become used again.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\ntotal_hours = a\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total_hours += new\n    used = (used % b) + new\n\nSo this loop continues until used is less than b.\n\nLet me test this with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts as 4. used =4.\n\nLoop: 4 >=2. new =4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. used is 4%2=0 +2 = 2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2. new=2//2=1. total is 6+1=7. used is 0 +1=1. Now, 1 <2, so exit. So total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input 6 3. Output is 8.\n\nLet's see:\n\ntotal_hours starts at 6. used=6.\n\nLoop: 6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. used is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now, 2 <3. So loop ends. So total is 8. Which matches the example. Wait, but what about the 2 used candles? Can't do anything with them. So yes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. used=5. Then 5//5=1. total becomes 6. used is 0 +1=1. Now, can't do anything. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 5. used=5.\n\nFirst loop: 5//3=1. total becomes 5+1=6. used is 5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nAgain, 3 >=3. new is 1. total is 6+1=7. used is 0 +1=1. Now done. So total is 7.\n\nYes, that's correct. Because 5 candles burn, 5 hours. Then 5 used, make 1 new (3 used). Burn that (1 hour), now used is 1 (from",
