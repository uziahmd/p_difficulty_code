При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the beginning of the second, and the overlapping part has at least one character but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where the entire message is overlapped) is not considered an error. Similarly, just appending without overlapping isn't considered an error either.\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if there exists a string s such that t is formed by overlapping two copies of s with some positive overlap (but not full overlap). If yes, output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key is to find a possible s such that when two copies of s are merged with some overlap, we get t. Let's think about the conditions for that.\n\nLet me denote the length of s as len_s. Then, the length of t should be equal to 2*len_s - k, where k is the overlap length. Since k is between 1 and len_s -1 (since the overlap must be positive and less than len_s). So:\n\nlen(t) = 2*len_s - k → rearranged, len_s = (len(t) + k)/2. But since k can vary, perhaps we can find possible len_s values based on the length of t.\n\nBut since k is between 1 and len_s-1, substituting len_s into that gives us constraints.\n\nAlternatively, considering that len(t) = 2*len_s - k. Since k is at least 1, len(t) ≤ 2*len_s -1. Also, since k is at most len_s-1, len(t) ≥ 2*len_s - (len_s-1) → len(t) ≥ len_s +1. So combining these:\n\nlen_s +1 ≤ len(t) ≤ 2*len_s -1.\n\nRearranging for len_s:\n\nlen(t) +1 ≤ 2*len_s → len_s ≥ (len(t)+1)/2.\n\nAnd len(t) ≤ 2*len_s -1 → len_s ≥ (len(t)+1)/2. Also, since len_s must be such that 2*len_s -k = len(t), and k is between 1 and len_s-1, then len_s must satisfy that len(t) is between len_s +1 and 2*len_s -1.\n\nBut perhaps another way to look at it is that for the original s, when you overlap two copies, the total length is 2*len_s - k. So the length of t must be such that there exists a len_s where len(t) = 2*len_s -k, with 1 ≤k < len_s.\n\nBut how do I find possible len_s values?\n\nAlternatively, since k can be any value between 1 and len_s-1, then for a given len_s, the possible len(t) can be from len_s+1 (when k = len_s-1, 2*len_s - (len_s-1) = len_s +1) up to 2*len_s -1 (when k=1).\n\nBut how do I find len_s given t's length?\n\nLet me think of possible len_s values. For example, len(t) must be less than 2*len_s (since k is at least 1). Also, len(t) must be greater than len_s (because k is at least 1, so len(t) = 2*len_s -k → len(t) = len_s + (len_s -k) → since k ≥1, len_s -k ≤ len_s -1. So len(t) is at least len_s +1? Wait:\n\nIf len_s is the length of s, then len(t) = 2*len_s -k. Since k is between 1 and len_s-1, then:\n\nMinimum possible len(t) is when k is maximum (len_s-1): 2*len_s - (len_s-1) = len_s +1.\n\nMaximum possible len(t) is when k is minimum (1): 2*len_s -1.\n\nSo len(t) must be between len_s +1 and 2*len_s -1. Which implies that len_s must be in the range:\n\nFor len(t) = L, len_s must satisfy:\n\nL ≥ len_s +1 → len_s ≤ L-1\n\nand \n\nL ≤ 2*len_s -1 → len_s ≥ (L +1)/2.\n\nSo combining:\n\nceil( (L +1)/2 ) ≤ len_s ≤ L-1.\n\nSo for each possible len_s in this range, we can check whether there exists a k (1 ≤k < len_s) such that 2*len_s -k = L. Which is equivalent to k = 2*len_s - L. And since k must be between 1 and len_s-1, then:\n\n1 ≤ 2*len_s - L ≤ len_s -1.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n2*len_s - L ≥ 1 → len_s ≥ (L +1)/2.\n\nWhich is already covered by our earlier condition. And also:\n\n2*len_s - L ≤ len_s -1 → 2*len_s - L ≤ len_s -1 → len_s ≤ L -1 → which is also covered by our earlier condition.\n\nTherefore, for each possible len_s in the range [ceil( (L+1)/2 ), L-1], we can compute k = 2*len_s - L. Then, check if this k is between 1 and len_s-1 (which it will be by construction).\n\nOnce we have a possible len_s, we need to check whether the string t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s with an overlap of k characters.\n\nHow to check that? Let me think.\n\nSuppose s is some string of length len_s. Then, when we overlap two copies of s with k characters, the resulting string would be s[0 ... len_s -k -1] + s. Wait, no. Wait, the first s is followed by the second s, but overlapping by k characters. So the first s's last k characters are the same as the second s's first k characters. So the merged string is s concatenated with s, but with the overlapping part merged. So the merged string is s + s[k:] ?\n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose s is \"abcd\", and k is 2. Then, overlapping the two copies by 2 characters. The first s ends with 'cd', the second starts with 'ab'. Wait, but for them to overlap, the end of the first must match the start of the second. So in this case, the overlapping part must be same. So for example, if s is \"abab\", and k is 2. Then the first s ends with 'ab', and the second starts with 'ab'. So overlapping them would result in 'abab' + 'ab' → but with the overlapping part merged. So the merged string would be 'abab' (the first) plus the remaining part of the second s after the overlapping part. The second s is 'abab', so after overlapping 2 characters, the remaining part is 'ab'. So the merged string is 'ababab' (length 6). Which is 4 + 4 - 2 = 6.\n\nSo in general, the merged string is s + s[k:], which has length len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k, which matches.\n\nSo for the given t, we need to check if there exists a len_s in the range mentioned above, and a corresponding k, such that:\n\nt equals s + s[k:].\n\nBut how to find s? Because s is the original string, which is the same as the first part of the merged string. Let me think.\n\nIn the merged string, the first part is s. So the first len_s characters of t must be s. But then, the overlapping part is the last k characters of s (which must be equal to the first k characters of s). So for the merged string to be t, the following must hold:\n\nt starts with s, and then the rest of the string (after the first len_s -k characters) must be s[k:]. Also, the overlapping part must be equal.\n\nBut how can I find s? Well, for a given len_s, the first len_s characters of t would be s. Then, the next part would be s[k:]. But since the overlapping part must be same, the last k characters of s (i.e., s[-k:]) must be equal to the first k characters of s (s[:k]).\n\nSo, for a given len_s, the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if the first len_s characters of t can be s. Then check if the overlapping part (last k characters of s) equals the first k characters of s. Also, check that the rest of the string (after the first len_s -k characters) is s[k:].\n\nBut how to check that? Let me think.\n\nOnce len_s is fixed, k is determined as 2*len_s - len(t). Then, the merged string is supposed to be s + s[k:]. Which would be of length len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k = len(t).\n\nSo, the entire t must be equal to s + s[k:]. But since s is the first len_s characters of t, then:\n\ns = t[0 : len_s]\n\nThen, the rest of the string (from len_s -k onwards?) Wait, perhaps I should think of the merged string as:\n\nThe first s is of length len_s, and the second part is s[k:], which is length len_s -k. So the total length is len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k = len(t). Therefore, the entire string t must be equal to s + s[k:].\n\nSo, given that s is the first len_s characters of t, then we can check whether the rest of the string (t[len_s:]) equals s[k:]. Also, we must check that the overlapping part is correct, i.e., that the last k characters of s (s[-k:]) are equal to the first k characters of s (s[:k]).\n\nWait, but if the merged string is s + s[k:], then the overlapping part is the last k characters of s (since the first s ends with those, and the second s starts with those). So the overlapping is valid only if those parts are equal.\n\nSo, for a given len_s, the steps would be:\n\nCompute k = 2*len_s - len(t).\n\nCheck that k is between 1 and len_s-1. Which it should be because of the len_s selection.\n\nThen:\n\ns_candidate = t[0 : len_s]\n\nCheck if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]. If not, then this len_s is invalid.\n\nAlso, check that the rest of the string (t[len_s:]) equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf both conditions are true, then this s_candidate is a valid solution.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop through all possible len_s in the range [ceil( (L+1)/2 ), L-1], where L is the length of t.\n\nFor each len_s, compute k = 2*len_s - L.\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and len_s-1. Well, since len_s is in that range, this should be automatically satisfied.\n\nThen, check the two conditions:\n\n1. s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]\n\n2. t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]\n\nIf both are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the len_s values work, then output NO.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nFor example, the sample input 'abcabc' outputs NO. Let's see why.\n\nThe length of t is 6. Possible len_s ranges from ceil( (6+1)/2 ) = ceil(7/2) = 4 to 5.\n\nSo len_s can be 4 or 5.\n\nFor len_s =4: k= 2*4 -6 = 8-6=2. So k=2.\n\nCheck for s_candidate = first 4 chars: 'abca'.\n\nCheck if s_candidate[-2:] (i.e., 'ca') equals s_candidate[:2] ('ab')? No. So invalid.\n\nThen, for len_s=5: k=2*5 -6 = 4. Check if k is between 1 and 4 (yes, since len_s is 5, len_s-1 is 4).\n\ns_candidate is first 5 chars: 'abcab'.\n\nCheck if s_candidate[-4:] (i.e., 'bcab') equals s_candidate[:4] ('abca')? No. So invalid. Hence, output is NO.\n\nAnother sample input is 'acacacaca' which outputs YES with 'acaca'.\n\nLet me check. The length of t is 9. So L=9.\n\nPossible len_s ranges from ceil( (9+1)/2 ) = 5 to 8.\n\nSo len_s can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nLet's try len_s=5. Then k=2*5-9=1.\n\nCheck s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'acaca'.\n\nCheck if last 1 character (a) equals first 1 character (a). Yes.\n\nThen check if t[5:] equals s_candidate[k:] (s_candidate[1:] is 'caca').\n\nt[5:] is 'cacaca' (original t is 'acacacaca', positions 5 to end: indices 5-8 (assuming 0-based). Let me count:\n\nOriginal t is a c a c a c a c a → indexes 0-8 (length 9). len_s=5, so t[5:] is from index 5 to 8: 'c a c a' → 'caca'? Wait, 5th index is 'c', then 6th is 'a', 7th 'c', 8th 'a' → yes, 'caca'.\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'caca' (since s_candidate is 'acaca'). So yes. So this works. So the answer is YES, and s_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nSo the code needs to check all possible len_s in that range.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor the given t, compute L = len(t).\n\nIf L is 1, then it's impossible (since two messages can't be merged into a single character). But according to the problem statement, the input is non-empty, but for example, if t is length 1, then output is NO.\n\nBut for general cases:\n\nFor each possible len_s in the range [ (L+1)//2 ... L-1 ]:\n\n   compute k = 2*len_s - L\n\n   if k is not between 1 and len_s-1, skip (but according to our selection of len_s, it should be)\n\n   s_candidate = t[0 : len_s]\n\n   check if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]\n\n   check if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]\n\n   if both are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the len_s values work, return NO.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the possible len_s values? Let's code it.\n\nFirst, read the input string t.\n\nThen, L = len(t). If L < 2, then output NO. Because for example, if L is 1, then even if two messages were merged, but the merged length would be 2*len_s -k. For len_s to be at least 1, and k >=1. So 2*len_s -k >= 2*1 - (len_s-1) ?\n\nWait, but for L=1, the possible len_s must be between (1+1)/2 = 1 and L-1=0. Which is impossible. So no possible len_s. Hence, output is NO.\n\nSo for L=1, output NO.\n\nElse, loop through len_s in the range from (L+1)//2 to L-1 inclusive.\n\nFor each len_s in that range:\n\n   compute k = 2*len_s - L\n\n   if k <1 or k >= len_s: continue? But according to the selection of len_s, this shouldn't happen. Let me check.\n\nFor example, len_s is in [ceil( (L+1)/2 ), L-1 ].\n\nLet me see for len_s = (L+1)//2.\n\nLet me take L as even and odd.\n\nFor example, if L is 5, then (L+1)/2 is 3. So len_s starts at 3. For len_s=3, k= 2*3 -5=1. Which is 1, which is between 1 and len_s-1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nFor len_s=L-1, k= 2*(L-1) - L = 2L-2 -L = L-2. Since len_s is L-1, len_s-1 is L-2. So k is exactly len_s-1. Which is allowed (since k must be < len_s). So yes.\n\nThus, for all len_s in the range, k is between 1 and len_s-1.\n\nSo no need to check again.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nNow, for each len_s, compute s_candidate = t[:len_s], then check:\n\nif s_candidate ends with the same k characters as it starts with.\n\nThen check that the rest of the string (t[len_s:]) equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf both conditions are met, return YES and s_candidate.\n\nNow, code this.\n\nBut how to handle the cases where len_s is such that len_s is larger than the length of t? No, because len_s is up to L-1. So for example, if L is 5, len_s can be up to 4, which is less than 5.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nRead t.\n\nL = len(t)\n\nif L < 2:\n\n   print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n   for len_s in range( (L+1)//2 , L ):\n\n      k = 2 * len_s - L\n\n      # check if k is between 1 and len_s-1. Well, according to previous reasoning, it is.\n\n      s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n\n      # check if the overlapping part is correct\n\n      if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n          # check if the rest of the string matches s_candidate[k:]\n\n          if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n              print(\"YES\")\n\n              print(s_candidate)\n\n              exit()\n\n   print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but the loop is for len_s in range( (L+1)//2 , L ). But in Python, range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, if L is 5, then L-1 is 4, and the range would be from (5+1)//2 = 3 to L (5), so range(3,5) → 3,4. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me test with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → output is YES abrakadabra.\n\nLet me check the length of this input. Let me count:\n\n\"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" → let's see:\n\nOriginal sample input says that the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the merged string. The output is 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. Let me check the length of the input.\n\nOriginal input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" → let's count letters:\n\nabrakadabra is 11 letters. Then the merged string isabrakadabra + brakadabra with overlap of 1. So the merged string is 11 + 11 -1 = 21 letters. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → let me count letters. Let me write it:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → that's 21 letters. So len(t) is 21.\n\nSo for L=21, the len_s ranges from (21+1)/2 = 11 to 20.\n\nSo len_s can be 11, 12,...,20.\n\nFor len_s=11, k= 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. So check if the first 11 letters (abrakadabra) ends with 1 character (a) and starts with 1 character (a). Yes. Then check if the rest of the string (t[11:] is 'brakadabra') equals s_candidate[k:] which is s_candidate[1:] → 'brakadabra'? Let's see:\n\ns_candidate is 'abrakadabra' (len 11). s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra' (len 10). t[11:] is the substring starting at index 11. Let me see:\n\nOriginal t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → indexes 0-20. t[:11] is 'abrakadabra', then t[11:] is 'brakadabra' which is 10 letters. Which is equal to s_candidate[1:] (which is 'brakadabra'). So yes. So this would be accepted. So the code would output YES and the s_candidate.\n\nSo this works.\n\nAnother sample input is 'acacacaca' (length 9). The code would check len_s from (9+1)/2 = 5 to 8.\n\nFor len_s=5, k= 10-9=1. s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'acaca'. Check if last 1 char is 'a' and first 1 is 'a' → yes. Then t[5:] is 'cacaca' (positions 5-8: 9-5=4 letters?), wait len(t) is 9. len_s is 5. t[len_s:] is t[5:] which is 4 characters. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] which is 'caca' (4 letters). So t[5:] is 'cacaca'? Wait no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal t is 'acacacaca' → indexes 0-8. Let's write the letters:\n\nIndices 0:a, 1:c, 2:a, 3:c, 4:a, 5:c, 6:a, 7:c, 8:a.\n\nt[5:] is from index 5 to 8: c a c a → 'caca'. Which is same as s_candidate[1:] (s_candidate is 'acaca', [1:] is 'caca'). So yes. Thus, returns YES.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abcabc' → output is NO. As discussed earlier.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' → output is YES with 'ababab'.\n\nLet me check. The input is 'abababab' which is 8 letters. So L=8. len_s ranges from (8+1)/2 = 4.5 → ceil is 5, to 7.\n\nSo len_s can be 5,6,7.\n\nLet's check len_s=5: k= 2*5 -8 = 2. Check if s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'ababa'. Check if last 2 letters (ba) equals first 2 letters (ab)? No. So invalid.\n\nNext len_s=6: k= 2*6 -8 = 4. Check if s_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'.\n\nCheck if last 4 letters of s_candidate (abab) equals first 4 letters (abab). Yes. Then check t[6:] is 'ab' (since len(t) is 8, t[6:] is positions 6 and 7: 'ab'. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[4:] → 'ab'. So yes. Thus, this is valid. So output YES and s_candidate 'ababab'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where multiple possible len_s exist? For example, the second sample input 'acacacaca' (length 9) could have len_s=5 (as discussed) or maybe other len_s?\n\nLet me check len_s=6. For len_s=6, k= 2*6 -9 = 3. Check if s_candidate is first 6 letters: 'acacac'.\n\nCheck if last 3 letters (cac) equals first 3 letters (aca)? No. So invalid.\n\nFor len_s=7, k=2*7 -9=5. Check s_candidate is first 7 letters: 'acacaca'.\n\nCheck if last 5 letters (cacaca?) Wait len_s is 7, k=5. So last 5 letters of s_candidate is s_candidate[-5:] → positions 2 to 6: 'acaca' (assuming s_candidate is 'acacaca' (indices 0-6). Let me see:\n\ns_candidate is 'acacaca' (length 7). The first 5 letters are 'acaca'? Wait, no. The first k=5 letters are s_candidate[:5] → 'acaca' (positions 0-4). The last 5 letters are positions 2-6: 'acaca' (since the string is a c a c a c a → positions 2-6 are a c a c a → 'acaca'). So yes, they are equal. Then check if t[7:] equals s_candidate[k:] → t[7:] is 'ca' (since len(t)=9, t[7:] is positions 7 and 8: 'ca'). s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[5:] → positions 5-6: 'ca'. So yes. So this is also valid. So the code would return the first possible len_s, which is 5. But the sample says that 'acaca' is acceptable, and also 'acacaca' is acceptable. However, the code would return the first possible len_s (5) and thus output 'acaca'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut note that in Python, when you slice a string, if the slice is beyond the string length, it just returns up to the end. But in our case, since len_s is in the correct range, and k is computed properly, the slices should be okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t from input.\n\nL = len(t)\n\nif L < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    for len_s in range( (L+1)//2, L ):\n\n        k = 2 * len_s - L\n\n        s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n\n        # Check if the overlapping part matches\n\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n            # Check if the rest of the string matches\n\n            if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n                print(s_candidate)\n\n                exit()\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where len_s is such that len_s is (L+1)//2, but for example, when L is even?\n\nLet me test for L=6. (L+1)//2 is (6+1)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5 floored? Wait in Python, (L+1)//2 is integer division. For example, (6+1)//2 is 3 (since 7//2 is 3). But the correct lower bound for len_s is ceil( (L+1)/2 ). For example, when L=6, (L+1)/2 is 3.5 → ceil is 4. So the code's current calculation of (L+1)//2 is incorrect for even L?\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nFor example, when L is 6:\n\n(L +1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil(3.5) is 4. But (L+1)//2 in Python is 7//2 = 3. So the code's loop is starting at 3, but the correct starting point is 4.\n\nWait, this is a problem! Oh no! Because the code uses (L+1)//2 as the starting point for len_s, but that's not correct.\n\nBecause the lower bound for len_s is ceil( (L+1)/2 )\n\nFor example, when L is even:\n\nLet me take L=6.\n\n(L+1)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4.\n\nBut (L+1)//2 is 3. So the code's current loop would start at 3, which is less than the required lower bound.\n\nThis is a mistake. So the code is wrong here.\n\nSo what's the correct way to compute the lower bound for len_s?\n\nThe lower bound is ceil( (L+1)/2 )\n\nBut how to compute that in Python?\n\nWell, (L +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example, for x = (L+1)/2, ceil(x) can be written as (x numerator + denominator -1 ) // denominator.\n\nSo for (L+1)/2, ceil is ((L+1) + 1) // 2 ?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor example, L=6:\n\n(L+1) =7. (7 +1) //2 = 8//2=4 → correct.\n\nFor L=5:\n\n(L+1)/2 = 3 → ceil is 3. (5+1 +1)//2 = 7//2=3.5 → 3.5 floored is 3. So 7//2 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nWait, (L+1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula for ceil(a / b) is (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo for (L+1)/2, the ceil is ( (L+1) + 2 -1 ) // 2 = (L+2) // 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for L=6, (6+2)//2 = 8//2=4 → correct.\n\nFor L=5, (5+2)//2 =7//2=3 → correct.\n\nSo the lower bound is (L + 2) // 2.\n\nSo the code should loop len_s in range( (L+2)//2 , L )\n\nBut in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, for L=6, (L+2)//2 is 4, and the upper bound is L (6), so the range is 4,5. Which is correct.\n\nSo in the code, the loop should be:\n\nfor len_s in range( (L + 2) // 2, L ):\n\nBut earlier code used (L +1) // 2, which was wrong.\n\nThis is a critical error. Let me re-examine the earlier example where L=6.\n\nIf len_s is in the range [4, 5].\n\nFor len_s=4, k= 2*4 -6= 2. Which is between 1 and 3 (since len_s is 4, len_s-1=3). So yes.\n\nSo for example, if t is 'ababab', which is length 6. Let's see if it can be formed by overlapping two copies of 'abab' (len_s=4, k=2).\n\ns_candidate is 'abab'.\n\nCheck if last 2 chars (ab) equals first 2 (ab). Yes.\n\nCheck t[4:] is 'ab' (since len(t) is 6, t[4:] is 'ab'), which equals s_candidate[k:] → s_candidate[2:] is 'ab'. So yes. So this would be valid. So the code would return YES and 'abab'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the case where two messages are simply appended (without overlapping) is not considered an error. For example, if t is 'abcabc', which is two copies of 'abc' concatenated, then it's not considered an error. But in this case, the code would check for possible overlaps.\n\nWait, but for the case of t being two copies of s concatenated (no overlap), then len(t) is 2*len_s. So for len(t) = 2*len_s. So for this case, len_s would be len(t)/2. But according to our len_s range, which is (L+2)//2 to L-1.\n\nFor example, if L=6, len_s=3. But (L+2)//2 is (6+2)/2=4. So len_s=3 is not considered. Hence, the code would not consider the case where there is no overlap. Which is correct, because the problem says that simple appending is not considered an error.\n\nSo, the code is now correct with the new lower bound.\n\nSo the previous mistake was using (L+1)//2 instead of (L+2)//2. That's why the code would miss some cases.\n\nSo the correct code is:\n\nRead t.\n\nL = len(t)\n\nif L < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    for len_s in range( (L + 2) // 2, L ):\n\n        k = 2 * len_s - L\n\n        s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n            if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n                print(s_candidate)\n\n                exit()\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nLet me test this for the case where L=6 and len_s=4. Which is in the range (L+2)//2 = (6+2)/2=4, so range(4,6) is 4 and 5.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the sample input where L=6, t is 'abcabc' (which should output NO). Let's see:\n\nFor len_s=4, k= 2*4 -6 = 2. s_candidate is 'abca'.\n\nCheck if s_candidate[-2:] is 'ca' and s_candidate[:2] is 'ab' → no. So invalid.\n\nFor len_s=5: k=2*5 -6 =4. Check if len_s=5 is allowed (since L=6, len_s is up to 5). k=4. len_s-1 is 4. So k=4 is allowed.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 letters: 'abcab'.\n\nCheck if s_candidate[-4:] is 'bcab' and s_candidate[:4] is 'abca' → no. So invalid. Hence, output is NO. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: for L=4, the possible len_s is (4+2)//2=3. So len_s ranges from 3 to 3 (since L is 4, range(3,4) is [3]).\n\nSo len_s=3, k= 2*3 -4 = 2. Check if the first 3 letters (say, 'abc') have last 2 letters 'bc' equal to first 2 letters 'ab'? No. So output is NO. Which is correct because the case where two messages are merged with full overlap (e.g., 'abcd' is two copies of 'ab' with overlap of 2 letters? Wait, no. For len_s=2, but len_s is 3 in this case. So this example is for t of length 4, which can't be formed by overlapping two copies of s with k=2. So code returns NO.\n\nSo the code now is correct.\n\nNow, let's adjust the code accordingly.\n\nSo, the code should use (L+2)//2 as the starting point for len_s.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t from input.\n\nL = len(t)\n\nif L < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    for len_s in range( (L + 2) // 2, L ):\n\n        k = 2 * len_s - L\n\n        s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n\n        # Check if the overlapping part matches\n\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n            # Check if the rest of the string matches\n\n            if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n                print(s_candidate)\n\n                exit()\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nNow, let's test for the sample input 'abababab' (length 8). The code would have (8+2)//2 = 5. So len_s ranges from 5 to 7.\n\nFor len_s=5: k= 2*5 -8 = 2. s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'ababa'.\n\nCheck if last 2 letters (ba) == first 2 (ab)? No.\n\nlen_s=6: k= 2*6 -8 =4. s_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'.\n\nCheck if last 4 letters (abab) equals first 4 letters (abab) → yes. Then check t[6:] is 'ab' and s_candidate[4:] is 'ab' → yes. So returns YES.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input 'tatbt' outputs NO. Let's see:\n\nt is 'tatbt', length 5.\n\n(L+2)//2 = (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5 floored is 3. So range(3,5) is 3,4.\n\nFor len_s=3: k",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the beginning of the second, and the overlapping part has at least one character but less than the length of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Overlap**: For a string `t` of length `L`, we need to check if there exists a string `s` such that `t` is formed by overlapping two copies of `s`. The length of `s` (denoted as `len_s`) must be such that `len_s` ranges from `(L + 2) // 2` to `L - 1`.\n2. **Overlap Calculation**: For each possible `len_s`, compute the overlap `k` as `2 * len_s - L`. This ensures that the total length of `t` is `2 * len_s - k`.\n3. **Validation**: For each valid `len_s`, check if the substring `t[:len_s]` (candidate for `s`) can form `t` when overlapped correctly. This involves verifying:\n   - The last `k` characters of `s` match the first `k` characters of `s`.\n   - The remaining part of `t` after the initial `len_s` characters matches the part of `s` starting from index `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nL = len(t)\nif L < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for len_s in range((L + 2) // 2, L):\n        k = 2 * len_s - L\n        s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n        # Check if the overlapping part matches\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n            # Check if the rest of the string matches\n            if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                found = True\n                break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `L` is determined.\n- **Edge Case Check**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, it's impossible to form `t` from two overlapping messages, so we immediately print \"NO\".\n- **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: We iterate through possible lengths `len_s` of the candidate string `s` starting from `(L + 2) // 2` to `L - 1`.\n- **Overlap Check**: For each `len_s`, calculate the overlap `k` and verify if the candidate string `s_candidate` can form `t` when overlapped correctly.\n- **Validation Steps**: Ensure the overlapping part of `s_candidate` matches and the remaining part of `t` aligns with the non-overlapping part of `s_candidate`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths for `s` and ensures correctness by validating both the overlap and the remaining part of the string.",
