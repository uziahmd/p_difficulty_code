Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But you can't swap 0 and 2 directly. So, what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the allowed swaps. Since we can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, but not 0 and 2. So, the key here is that 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s. But 0s can't move past 2s. Wait, but maybe through some steps? Like if there's a 0 and a 2 with some 1s in between, can they swap positions?\n\nWait, no. Because to move a 0 past a 2, you need to swap them, but that's not allowed. So, for example, if you have \"02\", you can't swap them. However, if there's a 1 in between, like \"0 1 2\", then you can swap the 0 and 1, then the 1 and 2. So, perhaps the 0 can move to the right of the 2 via moving past the 1s? Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, suppose I have \"012\". Let's see: the 0 can swap with the 1, making \"102\". Then, the 1 and 2 can swap, making \"120\". But then the 0 is still after the 2. So, in this case, the 0 can't get past the 2. Because the 0 can only move past 1s, and the 1 can move past 2s. But the 0 can't move past the 2 directly. So, the relative order between 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because if there's a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. But if there's a 0 followed by 1s followed by 2s, then the 0 can move to the left of the 1s, and the 2s can move to the right of the 1s. But the 0 can't cross the 2s. So, the original order of 0s and 2s is fixed? Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, suppose the original string is \"02\". Then, no swaps are allowed. So the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So their order remains. If the original string is \"012\", then the 0 can move left or right through 1s, and the 1 can move through 2s. But how does that affect the 0 and 2? For example, in \"012\", the 0 can move to the right of the 1, but the 1 can move to the right of the 2. So maybe the 0 can end up after the 2? No, because the 0 can't swap with the 2. So the 0 can't pass through the 2. So in this case, the 0 can't get past the 2. Therefore, the relative positions of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because any 0 that comes before a 2 can't move past it. Similarly, any 2 that comes before a 0 can't move past it. So the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string is fixed. Only the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, that's a crucial insight. So, the 0s and 2s can't be swapped. So their relative positions are fixed. But 1s can be moved around. So, for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, the 1 can be moved to either side of the 0 or the 2. But the 0 and 2 can't move past each other.\n\nSo the problem reduces to arranging the 1s as much as possible to the left, but considering that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative positions. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the original string as consisting of some 0s, 1s, and 2s. The key idea is that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered relative to each other. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 at position i and a 2 at position j where i < j, then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. Similarly, if a 2 comes before a 0 in the original string, then",
    "response": "To solve the problem of obtaining the lexicographically smallest ternary string under the given constraints, we need to understand that:\n\n- **0s and 1s can be swapped freely** (since they are adjacent).\n- **1s and 2s can also be swapped freely**.\n- **0s and 2s cannot be swapped directly**, so their relative order must remain the same as in the original string.\n\nThis implies that **0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order**, but **1s can be moved freely between them**.
