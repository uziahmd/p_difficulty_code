Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the blocks are structured. Each road divides the plane into regions. The key here is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, but only if they share a common segment. But how do I model this?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph. Each node represents a block. Edges exist between nodes if their corresponding blocks share a common border (so you can move between them in one step). Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n roads, the number of blocks can be very large, especially with many roads. However, considering that each new road can split existing regions into two parts, but with n up to 300, the number of regions could be O(2^n), which is impossible to handle directly. So, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nWait, maybe there's a smarter way. Since each step involves crossing a road, and the movement is allowed between adjacent blocks, perhaps the problem can be modeled using the roads and the positions of the home and university relative to them.\n\nAnother thought: For any given point not on a road, it's located in a certain region. When you cross a road, you move into an adjacent region. The minimal steps would correspond to the minimal number of roads you have to cross to get from the home to the university.\n\nBut how do we model the regions? Well, each region can be represented by the set of signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, the point is either on one side or the other. If we can determine for the home and university which side of each road they are on, then maybe the problem becomes similar to a BFS where each state is the set of signs, but that's not feasible due to the high dimensionality.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of the parity of the number of roads crossed. Wait, but that might not directly apply here.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let me consider each road as a hyperplane. The regions are determined by the sign of each equation. For each road, the home and university are on one side or the other. Now, two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if two regions differ in exactly one road, then they share a common boundary (the line of that road). If they differ in more than one road, then their boundaries are intersections of multiple roads, and they might not share a common edge.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to go from the home's region to the university's region. Each step corresponds to flipping the sign of exactly one road.\n\nBut how do I model this? Let's think of each region as a binary vector of length n, where each bit represents the sign of the corresponding road (positive or negative). But since the actual value depends on the equation, for each road i, the sign is determined by a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i. For the home point, compute for each road whether it's positive or negative. Similarly for the university. The problem then becomes finding the minimal number of bits to flip between the two vectors such that each flip changes exactly one bit, and the path between them is through adjacent states (each differing by one bit).\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because each region is uniquely determined by the signs of all roads. However, two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. So, the minimal steps between the home and university regions is the minimal number of roads where their signs differ, but with some constraints. Wait, no. Because the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that you need to cross. Each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. But wait, that's not correct. Because if the home and university have different signs for k roads, then the minimal steps is k? Or maybe not, because you can't just flip all those roads in sequence. Wait, suppose that the home's sign vector is S, and the university's is T. The Hamming distance between them is the number of roads where S and T differ. But the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance, since each step can flip one road's sign. However, that's only possible if the regions are connected via steps that flip one bit at a time. But how?\n\nFor example, imagine that the Hamming distance is 2. Then, you can flip one road, then another. Each step moves you to a neighboring region. So the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. Therefore, the answer is the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university points.\n\nWait, that seems too simple. But let's look at the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x +1y +0 =0 (which is y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor the home point (1,1):\n\nFor road 1: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0 → sign is +.\n\nFor road 2: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → sign is +. So the home's sign vector is [+, +].\n\nUniversity is (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign is -.\n\nRoad 2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 <0 → sign is -.\n\nSo the sign vector is [-, -]. Hamming distance is 2. The answer is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nCheck for home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → 1>0 → +.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → 1>0 → +.\n\nRoad 3: 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\n\nSign vector: [+, +, -].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: -1 <0 → -.\n\nRoad 2: -1 <0 → -.\n\nRoad 3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -.\n\nSign vector: [-, -, -].\n\nSo Hamming distance is 2 (road 1 and 2 differ). Answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to work. So the problem reduces to computing for each road, whether the home and university are on the same side or not. The answer is the count of roads where they are on different sides.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So, if the home and university differ in k roads, then you need to cross those k roads, and each crossing is a step. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing roads.\n\nBut why can't there be a shorter path? Suppose that there's a way to reach the university by crossing some roads that are not in the differing set. But that's impossible because the sign vector of the university is different from the home's in exactly those roads. So, any path must cross each differing road once. So the minimal steps is the Hamming distance.\n\nSo the solution is to compute for each road, the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. For each road, if the signs are different, increment the count. That's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let's test another case. Suppose there are two roads, and home and university differ in two roads. Then according to the logic, the answer is 2. But what if those two roads intersect, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. But perhaps there's a way to cross both roads in one step? No, because each step crosses exactly one road. So each step can only change one sign. Therefore, you need two steps.\n\nYes. So the answer is indeed the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward:\n\nFor each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) for home and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i) for university. Check if their signs are different. Count the number of such roads.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So for each road, the value for home is non-zero, same for university. So we can safely check the sign.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1 (home), x2, y2 (university). Read n roads. For each road, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If val1 * val2 < 0, then count +=1. Finally, output count.\n\nBut wait, why does this work? Because each time the signs differ, you need to cross that road once. And the minimal steps is the number of roads where the signs differ.\n\nYes, because each step allows you to cross exactly one road. So, for each differing road, you have to cross it once. So the minimal steps is the count.\n\nThis seems surprisingly simple. But the sample input matches this approach. Let me think of another test case.\n\nTest case: Suppose home is on one side of a single road, and university is on the other. Then answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nIf there are two roads, and home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then answer is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: suppose there are two roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of one road, but same side of the other. Then answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. So the problem is really just checking the sign differences for each road.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead home coordinates, read university coordinates, read n roads. For each road, compute for home and university the value. If their product is negative, increment the count.\n\nSo the code can be written in Python as:\n\nRead the input lines. For each test case, process as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nFor each a, b, c:\n\nval1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\nval2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n    count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 are never zero. So the product can't be zero. So the code is safe.\n\nYes. So this is the solution. The problem is much easier than it initially appeared. The key insight is that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me check the sample input again.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are y=0 (0x +1y +0=0) and x=0 (1x +0y +0=0).\n\nFor first road:\n\nval1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * -1 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1. product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nRoads are x=0, y=0, x + y -3 =0.\n\nHome (1,1):\n\nFor x=0: 1 → positive.\n\nFor y=0: 1 → positive.\n\nFor x + y -3: 1+1-3 =-1 → negative.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nx=0: -1 → negative.\n\ny=0: -1 → negative.\n\nx + y -3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 → negative.\n\nSo for first two roads, product is (1 * -1) = -1 → count +=1 for each. Third road: (-1) * (-1) = 1 → no. So total count is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nTherefore, the code is easy to implement. Now, let's write the Python code.\n\nThe code needs to read from stdin. The input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the example input:\n\nThe first example input is given as a list of strings. But in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWhich probably represents two test cases. So the code should process multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the input description. However, the problem says that the input is given as per the input format. But in the sample input, the user provided two test cases, but the problem says that the input is given as per the input description. So perhaps the code needs to read from standard input, which may contain multiple test cases?\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1 — home.\n\nSecond line: x2, y2 — university.\n\nThird line: n — number of roads.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo each test case is a single input. However, the sample input seems to show two test cases. But perhaps that's part of the example, where the first input is one case, and the second is another. So the code needs to process one test case per input.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. How is the input given? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is given as multiple test cases. However, according to the problem's input description, each test case is given as per the input format. But the problem says that the input is given as per the input format. However, the sample input shows two test cases, which suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ... etc.\n\nSo, the code should process a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. However, perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. However, the user's note says that the first example input is a list of strings, but perhaps in the actual problem, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases. But the problem's input description doesn't mention multiple test cases. So perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the actual code should read a single test case.\n\nWait, the problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers... etc. So the code should read a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. How is that possible? Maybe the sample input is for two different examples. For example, the first example's input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSample Output 1: 2\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nSample Output 2: 2.\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. But when the user provides the input, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description doesn't mention that. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input, the user provided a list of two inputs, but perhaps that's for the purpose of the example. However, in practice, the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, the third line is n, followed by n lines of coefficients. Therefore, the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, the code is given as two test cases. However, the user's note says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases? But the problem's input description doesn't say that. So perhaps the code should process one test case.\n\nBut the sample input in the problem is given as two separate test cases. However, perhaps the problem is designed such that the code reads a single test case, and the sample input is for two different examples. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut in the problem's input, the third line is n, followed by n lines of coefficients. So the code needs to read that.\n\nTherefore, the code should read the input as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nCompute the count as explained.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead from stdin. But in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nBut for multiple lines, perhaps the code should read all lines first.\n\nBut for the code, the steps are:\n\nRead the first line as x1, y1.\n\nRead the second line as x2, y2.\n\nRead third line as n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nSo, the code could be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    count = 0\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n            count += 1\n\n    print(count)\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the home and university are in the same block? Then the count is zero. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut why is the problem considered \"very easy\"? Because the solution is straightforward once the insight is found.\n\nSo this code should pass all test cases. Let's test it against the sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nval1 for first road is 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 is 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 → product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product -1 → count is 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nFirst road: val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1. Third road: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 =-1. val2: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3=-5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no increment. Total count 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, handle possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=0. But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, the input says n is given as 1<=n<=300. Wait, no. The problem says:\n\nThird line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n is at least 1. So no need to handle n=0.\n\nAnother edge case: when home and university are on the same side of all roads. So the answer is 0. For example, home and university are same point, but the problem says that they are not on any road. But the code would return 0.\n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by one road. Answer is 1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city with infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. The home and university blocks are located in different regions determined by these roads. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks. This is determined by checking the sign of the value obtained by substituting the coordinates of the home and university into each road's equation. If the signs differ for a road, it means the home and university are on opposite sides of that road, and thus, this road must be crossed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Sign Check:** For each road, compute the value of the road's equation at the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Steps:** Each road that separates the home and university contributes one step to the total count.
