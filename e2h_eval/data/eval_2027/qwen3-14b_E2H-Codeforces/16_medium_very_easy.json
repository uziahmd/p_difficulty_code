Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the blocks are structured. Each road divides the plane into regions. The key here is that moving between blocks requires sharing a non-zero length boundary. So, adjacent blocks (sharing a line segment) can be moved between in one step. But if two blocks only meet at a point (like intersections of multiple roads), then you can't move between them in one step.\n\nThe challenge is to model the blocks and find the shortest path between the home and university blocks. But since there are infinite blocks, we can't model them all directly. So, we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea: each block can be represented by a region determined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, a point is either on one side or the other. Since the home and university are not on any road, they are in some region. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each step across a road changes the sign of one equation, but maybe?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a graph where each node represents a region (block). Two regions are connected if they share a common boundary (i.e., they are separated by exactly one road). Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home's region and the university's region. But how do we model this graph efficiently?\n\nBut with n up to 300, the number of regions could be huge. However, the key insight here is that the minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nEach time you cross a road, you change your region. But the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to get from home to university. However, how do we find that?\n\nAnother approach: For each road, determine whether the home and university are on the same side of the road or not. If they are on opposite sides, then crossing that road would be part of the path. But how does this relate to the minimal steps?\n\nWait, the problem is similar to finding the minimal number of hyperplanes (roads) that separate the two points. Because each step allows you to cross a road. So, the minimal steps needed is the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to get from the home to the university. But how do you compute that?\n\nLet me think of this as a BFS problem. Each state is a set of roads crossed. But that's not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a subset of roads, but that's impossible for n=300.\n\nWait, but here's another idea: the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each step crosses a road. But how to compute that?\n\nLet me think of each road as a hyperplane. The home and university are points not lying on any road. For each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides. Let's say that for a road i, the value of a_i x + b_i y + c_i is positive for the home and negative for the university. Then, this road separates them. The minimal number of steps would be the minimal number of such separating roads that you need to cross. However, this might not be straightforward because crossing one road may not directly connect to another.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a graph where each node is a region. Two regions are connected if they are separated by exactly one road. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between the home and university regions. But how to model this without knowing all regions?\n\nBut here's a trick: the regions can be uniquely determined by the sign of each road. For example, for each road, the point is either on one side or the other. So, for each road, we can assign a bit (0 or 1) indicating which side the point is on. The home's position can be represented as a vector of bits (for each road, 0 or 1), and similarly for the university. The minimal steps between the two regions would be the Hamming distance between these two vectors divided by something? Or maybe not exactly, because two regions that differ in k roads can be connected via a path of k steps. But perhaps not. Because if two regions differ in k roads, then you can cross each of those roads once, but maybe that's not possible if the roads are not arranged properly.\n\nWait, but in terms of graph theory, each region can be considered as a node in a graph, and edges exist between regions that are separated by exactly one road. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home region and the university region. However, the number of regions is 2^n, which is impossible for n=300. So, we need a way to model this without enumerating all regions.\n\nBut here's another thought: the minimal number of steps required is the minimal number of roads that you have to cross to get from home to university. Each time you cross a road, you change your region. So, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that you need to cross, which is equivalent to the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university. However, this is not exactly accurate. For example, suppose there are two roads that separate the home and university. Then, you can cross one road, then another, but maybe those two roads are not adjacent. Wait, but if two roads separate the home and university, then the minimal steps would be 2. However, perhaps there's a way to cross one road that's not separating them. But that's not possible. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as a BFS where each state is the set of roads that you have crossed. But that's not feasible.\n\nAnother approach: For each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides. Let's call such roads as \"separating\" roads. The minimal steps required is the minimal number of separating roads that you need to cross. But how?\n\nSuppose that the home and university are in the same region. Then, the answer is zero. Otherwise, the minimal steps is the minimal number of separating roads. Wait, but that's not correct. Because even if two roads separate them, maybe there's a path that crosses one road. Wait, no. If two points are on opposite sides of a single road, then they can be connected by crossing that road once. So the minimal steps is 1. But if they are separated by two roads, then maybe you need to cross both roads. But how?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose there are two roads, each of which separates home and university. So, home is on one side of road 1 and university is on the other. Similarly for road 2. But if the two roads cross each other, then the home and university could be in regions that are separated by both roads. So, to get from home to university, you need to cross both roads, which would take two steps. But maybe there's a way to cross one road and then another. So the minimal steps would be 2.\n\nBut how can we compute this? It seems like the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of roads that you need to cross, which is the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university. However, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that you need to cross. So, this is equivalent to finding the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region. Each edge connects regions that share a common boundary (i.e., differ by exactly one road). Then, the minimal steps is the minimal number of edges between the home region and the university region. \n\nNow, the key is to model this as a BFS problem. However, the problem is that there are 2^n possible regions, which is impossible for n=300. Therefore, we need a way to model this without explicitly considering all regions.\n\nBut here's the thing: the home and university are fixed points. So, perhaps we can model the BFS based on the parity of the roads crossed. Let me think. \n\nFor the home, the initial state is the set of roads that are on one side. For each step, you can cross a road, which toggles the sign of that road. So, the problem becomes finding the minimal number of steps to reach the state of the university from the home state. \n\nWait, this is similar to a BFS where each state is a binary vector of length n (each bit indicates whether the current region is on the positive or negative side of the road). The initial state is the vector for the home, and the target is the vector for the university. Each step flips one bit (crossing a road). The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of bit flips required to reach the target vector from the initial vector. But that's not exactly correct, because flipping a bit corresponds to crossing a road. However, in reality, each road can be crossed multiple times. But since the regions are determined by the signs of all roads, flipping the same bit twice brings you back to the original state. So, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the two vectors. Because each differing bit requires a flip, and each flip is a step. But wait, this would imply that the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the home and university vectors. \n\nBut is this correct? Let's take an example. Suppose the home and university vectors differ in k bits. Then, the minimal steps is k. Because each differing bit can be flipped once. But how can that be? Because each step can flip exactly one bit. So, the minimal steps is indeed the Hamming distance between the two vectors. \n\nBut why? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the corresponding bit. So, if the home and university differ in k bits, then you need to cross those k roads. But how can you cross them in sequence? Because crossing a road changes your position, and the next road you cross would be in the new region. But regardless of the order, each differing bit requires exactly one flip. \n\nSo, the answer is the Hamming distance between the home's vector and the university's vector. \n\nWait, but this would mean that the answer is simply the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road contributes a differing bit. Let me check with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 (which is y=0) and 1x + 0y +0 =0 (x=0).\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nCheck for each road:\n\nFirst road: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 >0 → so for this road, home is on the positive side. For the university (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So this road separates them. So this is a differing bit.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1>0. For university: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So this also separates them. So the Hamming distance is 2, which matches the sample output of 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input: \n\nSample Input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, and x+y-3=0.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1 (x=0): 1>0 → positive. University (-1,-1) gives -1 <0 → different. So road 1 is separating.\n\nRoad 2 (y=0): same as above, 1>0, university is -1 <0. Different. Road 2 is separating.\n\nRoad 3: 1+1-3 = -1 <0. University: -1 + -1 -3 = -5 <0. Same sign. So road 3 doesn't separate. So Hamming distance is 2, which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nSo this approach seems to work for the samples. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to: compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The answer is the count of such roads. \n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each step allows crossing one road, and each road that separates them must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them. \n\nBut why can't there be a shorter path? For example, imagine two roads that cross each other. Suppose home is in a region that is separated from the university by both roads. So, the Hamming distance is 2. But can you cross one road and then another to reach the university? Well, yes. That would take two steps. Which is the same as the Hamming distance. \n\nAnother scenario: suppose there are three roads, and the home and university differ in three roads. Then, the minimal steps is 3. \n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. \n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The answer is the count of such roads. \n\nBut wait! How do we check if two points are on opposite sides of a road?\n\nFor a road defined by ax + by + c = 0, the sign of ax + by + c determines which side of the road the point is on. For a point (x1,y1), compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c. Similarly for (x2,y2), compute val2. If val1 and val2 have opposite signs, then the road separates them. \n\nSo, for each road, compute val1 and val2. If val1 * val2 < 0, then the road separates them. Count the number of such roads. \n\nThis is a very simple solution. And the sample inputs match this. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because the minimal steps required is the number of roads separating them. \n\nBut why can't there be a case where some roads are not separating them, but you have to cross them? For example, suppose there are two roads that are parallel. The home is on one side of both roads, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, the Hamming distance is 2. But you can cross one road, then the other. So two steps. Which is the same as the count. \n\nAnother example: suppose the home and university are separated by a single road. Then, the answer is 1. Which is correct. \n\nBut what if there are multiple roads that are not separating them, but you have to cross them to get to the university? For example, imagine home is in a region, and the university is in another region that is separated by two roads. But those two roads are not separating the home and university. How is that possible? \n\nWait, no. If the home and university are in different regions, then there must be at least one road that separates them. Because each road divides the plane into two regions. So, if two points are in different regions, then there must be at least one road that separates them. \n\nBut the number of roads that separate them is the Hamming distance. \n\nSo according to this approach, the answer is the count of roads that separate the two points. \n\nBut why does this work? Because each road that separates them must be crossed once, and each such road contributes one step. \n\nThis seems to be the case. So the code is straightforward. \n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. Read the home coordinates (x1, y1) and the university coordinates (x2, y2).\n\n2. Read the n roads.\n\n3. For each road, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, and val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. \n\n4. If val1 * val2 < 0, then this road separates them. Increment the count.\n\n5. Output the count.\n\nWait, but this is too easy. But the sample input matches. Let me think again. \n\nIn the first sample input, the answer is 2, and indeed, both roads separate the points. \n\nAnother test case: suppose home is (1,0), university is (-1, 0), and there's one road x=0. Then, the road separates them, so the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: home is (1,1), university is (2,2). There are two roads: x + y = 0 and x + y = 1. \n\nFor home, x + y = 2, which is positive. For university, x + y = 4, which is also positive. So neither road separates them. So the answer is 0. Which is correct, since they are in the same region. \n\nBut what if there's a third road x + y = 3. Then, the home and university are on the same side of all roads, so answer is 0. \n\nBut what if there are two roads that cross each other. Suppose home is in one region and the university is in another region that is separated by both roads. Then, the answer is 2. \n\nBut according to the approach, the answer is the number of roads that separate them, which is 2. Which would be correct. \n\nThus, the solution is to count the number of roads that separate the home and university. \n\nThis seems to be the case. Therefore, the code is straightforward. \n\nSo, the Python code would read the input, compute for each road the value for home and university, check if their product is negative, and count. \n\nBut wait, what about the case where the home and university are in the same region, but there are roads that separate them? No. If they are in the same region, then they are not separated by any road. Because the region is defined by being on the same side of all roads. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nFor each a, b, c:\n\n   val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n   val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n   if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n       count +=1\n\nPrint count.\n\nBut wait, the sample input 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSo for the first road (0x +1y +0=0 → y=0). \n\nval1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * -1 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road is 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. total 2. Correct.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → x=0\n\n0 1 0 → y=0\n\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0 → x + y =3.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nval1 for first road: 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1 → positive.\n\nval2 for university (-1,-1): 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: same as before, product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2 -3 = -1. For university: 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. Both are negative. product is positive. So no count. Total count is 2. Which matches sample output.\n\nYes, this works. \n\nThus, the code is as simple as that. \n\nBut why is the problem called \"Crazy Town\"? Because maybe there's a trick here. But according to the analysis, this approach is correct. \n\nLet me think about another case. Suppose home is (0, 1), university is (0, -1). There is one road y=0. Then, the answer is 1. Which is correct. \n\nAnother case: home (0, 1), university (0, -1). Two roads: y=0 and y=0 again. But the problem says that no two roads are same. So, that's not possible. \n\nWhat about two roads that are parallel. For example, y=0 and y=1. Home is (0, 2) and university is (0, -1). For the first road (y=0), home is positive (2), university is negative (-1). So separated. For the second road (y=1), home is 2-1=1>0, university is -1-1 = -2 <0. So separated. So count is 2. But the minimal steps is 2. Which is correct. Because you have to cross both roads. \n\nBut what if there's a path that goes through other roads? No, because the roads are parallel. So the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. So, you need to cross both roads. Hence, two steps. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nSo, the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of the n lines:\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, line.split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's it. \n\nBut why is the problem considered as a competitive programming problem? Because maybe someone might overcomplicate it with BFS or other methods. But the actual solution is straightforward once you realize that the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points.\n\nSo, the code is simple. Now, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut need to read the input correctly. The input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line is n.\n\nThen n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first two lines as x1, y1 and x2, y2. Then read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut for the input, sometimes the input may be provided as a single string, but in practice, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code. \n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nSo, this code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city with infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common border between blocks, which is defined by the roads.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight here is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road separates them. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the number of roads that separate these two points.\n\nTo determine if a road separates the home and university, we evaluate the sign of the linear equation of the road at both points. If the signs are different, the road separates them. We count such roads and this count gives us the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Checking Separation:** For each road, we compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, meaning the road separates them.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads:** The number of such separating roads is counted and printed as the result. This count directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each separating road must be crossed once.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal and straightforward solution.",
