Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l. \n\nFirst, I think the approach here is to sort the lantern positions. Because if they're sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum gap. Then, the required d would be half of that maximum gap. Wait, but why?\n\nLet me think. Suppose there are two adjacent lanterns. Let's say they are at positions a and b, with a < b. The area between them that isn't covered by either lantern would be the middle part. The maximum distance from either lantern to the midpoint between them would be (b - a)/2. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d must be at least half the distance between them. Because if you have a gap between two lanterns, the worst case is the middle of that gap. So the maximum of all these gaps divided by two is the minimal d needed.\n\nBut wait, what about the ends? Like, the first lantern might not be at 0. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position, and then the same for the end of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The radius needs to cover that. Similarly, the last lantern's position is an, and the distance from an to l is l - an. So those two edges need to be considered as well.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. That's a candidate for max_gap.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to the end (l). Another candidate.\n4. Then check all consecutive pairs in the sorted array, compute their difference, and find the maximum difference. Then divide that by two. That's another candidate.\n5. The minimal d is the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nWait, yes. Because for the first part, the first lantern's coverage must reach 0. So if the first lantern is at position a, then the radius must be at least a. Similarly for the last lantern. But for the middle parts, the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns is split into two parts, so the required radius is half of that gap. So the maximum between these three values (first distance, last distance, max_gap/2) is the answer.\n\nSo for example, in the second sample input:\n\nInput is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. The sorted array is [2,5]. \n\nFirst check the start: 2 - 0 = 2. Then the end: 5 to 5 is 0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum between 2, 0, and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input. Let's see:\n\nSample Input 1: 7 15 with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, it's 0,3,5,7,9,14,15. \n\nCheck the first distance: 0 - 0 is 0. The last distance is 15 -15 = 0. Now the gaps between consecutive lanterns are 3-0=3, 5-3=2, 7-5=2, 9-7=2, 14-9=5, 15-14=1. The maximum gap is 5. Divide by two gives 2.5, which is the sample output.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them. Then compute the initial max_gap as the first lantern's position (since 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0). Then compute the last part as l - a[-1]. Then iterate through the sorted list, compute the differences between consecutive elements, and track the maximum. Then the answer is the maximum between the first part, the last part, and (max_consecutive_gap / 2).\n\nBut wait, the first part is a[0] - 0, but what if the first lantern is at 0? Then that distance is zero. Similarly for the last lantern.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nSort the array.\n\nmax_d = 0\n\nCompute the first distance: a[0] - 0. Then the last distance: l - a[-1]. Then compare those two with the max_consecutive_gap / 2.\n\nBut wait, the first distance is a[0] - 0. But if the lantern is at 0, then this is zero. But the radius needs to cover from 0 to a[0] + d. But since the lantern is at 0, the radius is d. So the distance from 0 to the lantern is zero, so the radius needs to be at least zero. So that's okay.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nthen, the max_d is the maximum between (sorted_a[0], l - sorted_a[-1], max_gap / 2)\n\nWait, no. Because sorted_a[0] is the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to that lantern is sorted_a[0] - 0. So the radius must be at least that. Similarly for the last lantern. So the maximum between these two and the max_gap / 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer is the maximum of (sorted_a[0], l - sorted_a[-1], max_gap / 2).\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern?\n\nLike n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then sorted_a is [3]. The first distance is 3, the last distance is 5-3=2. The max_gap is 0 (since there are no consecutive elements). So the maximum between 3, 2, and 0/2=0. So the answer is 3. Which is correct, because the lantern is at 3, and the radius needs to cover from 0 to 5. So the radius must be 3 (to cover from 0 to 3 + 3 = 6, but since the street is up to 5, that's okay. But the other end is 5-3=2. So the maximum between 3 and 2 is 3. Correct.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nSo the code should:\n\nHandle the case where n is 0? No, because n >=1 according to input constraints (n is at least 1).\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute first_part = a[0] (since 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0 = a[0])\n\nlast_part = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n    current_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    if current_gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = current_gap\n\nthen, the required d is the maximum between first_part, last_part, max_gap / 2.\n\nBut wait, the first_part is a[0] - 0, which is a[0]. Similarly, last_part is l - a[-1].\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 15, with lanterns [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. Sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nfirst_part is 0.0. last_part is 15 -15 = 0. The max_gap between consecutive is 14-9=5. So max_gap is 5. So the required d is max(0, 0, 5/2) = 2.5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 2 5, lanterns [2,5]. sorted is [2,5]. first_part is 2, last_part is 5-5=0. max_gap is 5-2=3. So max between 2, 0, 3/2=1.5. So answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. first_part is 3, last_part is 2. max_gap is 0. So answer is 3.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then first_part is 0, last_part is 0. max_gap is 10. So d is 10/2=5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then first_part is 0, last_part is 0. max_gap is 5. So d is 5/2=2.5.\n\nBut if the street is 10, and lanterns at 0, 5, 10. Then the middle is covered by 5's radius. So yes, 2.5 is sufficient.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in Python, how to handle this?\n\nRead input. The first line has n and l. Then the next line has n integers.\n\nBut the input may be given as a list of strings, like in the example. Wait, the user provided input examples as:\n\nFor example, the first input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nBut perhaps the actual input is read via stdin, which is two lines. Wait, the problem says that the input is read from standard input. So for each test case, the first line is n and l, then the next line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's given as two separate test cases. So the code needs to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l... Then the next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read two lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen another test case:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two separate test cases. However, the code is supposed to read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or is it one test case per run?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's input description: The first line contains two integers n and l. The next line contains n integers. So the code should read two lines. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or maybe the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case per run.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement's input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, there are two test cases. The output has two lines. So the code must process multiple test cases. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement's sample input:\n\nIt's written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich is two test cases. So the code should read multiple test cases. But how? How many test cases are there? The problem says that the input is given as per the first line with n and l, then the next line with the a_i. But the sample shows two test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how do we know how many test cases there are? Because the problem says that the input is given as per the first line with n and l, etc. But the sample shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read until EOF?\n\nBut the original problem statement's input format is unclear. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l...\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle one test case. Wait, but the sample output shows two outputs. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user provided the sample input as two separate test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, in the problem's original description, the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention that. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's original input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l... Then the next line contains n integers. So the input is for a single test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, and the code should process each of them.\n\nBut how to read that? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not say so. However, in this case, the problem's sample input shows two test cases, and the output shows two lines. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to read them? Because in Python, when reading from stdin, the code can read all lines at once. So perhaps the code should read all lines, split into groups of two lines, and process each group as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nBut looking back at the problem's input description, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the first test case's n and l, the second line is the a_i for that test case, then the third line is the next test case's n and l, etc. So the code should process multiple test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to determine that? Well, the problem's sample input shows two test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says \"the first line contains...\" which implies that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSample Output:\n\n2.5000000000\n\n2.0000000000\n\nSo the input is two test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. But how many? How to read them?\n\nIn programming competition problems, when multiple test cases are present, the input is usually given as multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description may not mention that. So perhaps the problem's input is actually multiple test cases. But the problem's original input description says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l... So that suggests that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, so perhaps the problem allows multiple test cases. But how to read them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process only one test case. However, the sample output shows two lines, which would correspond to two test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking at the problem's original input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWell, perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs of two lines (each pair being a test case). For example, the first line is n and l, the second line is the list of a_i. Then repeat for each test case.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, perhaps read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' — which is two lines. Then the next line is '2 5\\n2 5' — which is two lines. So perhaps the code should read lines until EOF, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nFor example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin using sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), and then process them in pairs. So for each i in 0, 2, 4, ...:\n\ntest case 1: lines[0], lines[1]\n\ntest case 2: lines[2], lines[3]\n\netc.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nBut perhaps the problem's original input is only one test case, and the sample input is presented in a way that's not accurate. For example, perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to read one test case. But that would not make sense for the sample output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user provided the sample input as two test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample output has two lines, which would be for two test cases.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking back at the problem's original input description, the first line contains n and l. So the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output shows two outputs. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects that the code reads multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is for one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases, which is a mistake. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample output shows two answers. That would be impossible unless the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input and output show two test cases, I think that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original input description, the first line contains n and l. The next line contains n integers. So the code should read two lines per test case. So the code should read all test cases until EOF.\n\nTherefore, the code should process multiple test cases. So in Python, the code can read all lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nSo, for example, the code would read all lines from stdin. Then, for each pair of lines (i and i+1), process them as a test case.\n\nBut how to read that in Python?\n\nIn Python, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n    n, l = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    # process and output\n\nBut this would work for the sample input. However, what if the number of lines is odd? Well, the problem's input is supposed to have even number of lines, since each test case has two lines.\n\nBut perhaps the code should process pairs of lines, assuming that the input is correct.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input is given as two test cases, and the code must output two answers, this seems correct.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output, the first input line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' — which is two lines. Then the second test case is '2 5\\n2 5' — again two lines. So the code can process them as two test cases.\n\nThus, the code will read all lines, and process them two at a time.\n\nSo now, the code structure is:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nSort the a array.\n\nCompute first_part = a[0], last_part = l - a[-1], max_gap between consecutive elements.\n\nThen compute the maximum between first_part, last_part, max_gap / 2.\n\nThen print that value with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in the first test case, the first_part is a[0] which is 0, and the last_part is 0. The max_gap is 5. So 5/2 is 2.5.\n\nSo the code should output that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this.\n\nBut in code, for each test case:\n\nn, l = map(int, first_line.split())\n\na = list(map(int, second_line.split()))\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nfirst_part = sorted_a[0]\n\nlast_part = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\nd = max(first_part, last_part, max_gap / 2)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1? Then the loop for i in 1..n-1 (which is 1..0) doesn't run. So max_gap remains zero. Then the max between first_part (a[0]), last_part (l - a[0]), and 0/2 = 0. So that's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when n is 0? Well, the problem says n ≥ 1.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=7, l=15, a = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]\n\nsorted_a = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_gap is 14-9=5.\n\nfirst_part is 0, last_part is 0. So d is max(0, 0, 5/2) = 2.5.\n\nSample output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. sorted is [2,5]. max_gap is 3. first_part is 2, last_part is 0. So d is max(2, 0, 3/2=1.5) → 2.0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. sorted_a is [3]. first_part is 3, last_part is 5-3=2. max_gap is 0. So d is max(3, 2, 0) → 3.0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0,5,10]. sorted is [0,5,10]. max_gap is 5. first_part is 0, last_part is 0. d is 5/2 = 2.5.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the output formatting. The problem says that the answer must be printed with enough decimal digits, such that the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 1e-9. So printing with 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nIn Python, using the format string with 10 decimal digits, like \"{:.10f}\".format(d) would suffice.\n\nBut what about cases where the required d is an integer? For example, the second sample's output is 2.0000000000. Which is printed correctly.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead all lines, process in pairs.\n\nBut how to read the input? Because in some cases, the input may be provided with multiple test cases. So the code should read all lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n        # process each test case\n\n        n_l_line = lines[i]\n\n        a_line = lines[i+1]\n\n        n, l = map(int, n_l_line.split())\n\n        a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n\n        sorted_a = sorted(a)\n\n        max_gap = 0\n\n        for j in range(1, n):\n\n            gap = sorted_a[j] - sorted_a[j-1]\n\n            if gap > max_gap:\n\n                max_gap = gap\n\n        first_part = sorted_a[0]\n\n        last_part = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\n        d = max(first_part, last_part, max_gap / 2)\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nBut wait, what if the input has an odd number of lines? For example, if there is a test case with only one line? But according to the problem statement, each test case has two lines. So the code assumes that the input is correct.\n\nBut in practice, the code may crash if the number of lines is odd. However, the problem's input is guaranteed to be correct.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input lines:\n\nLine 0: '7 15'\n\nLine 1: '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'\n\nLine 2: '2 5'\n\nLine 3: '2 5'\n\nProcessing i=0:\n\nn=7, l=15, a is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. max_gap is 5. first_part is 0, last_part 0. d=2.5 → printed.\n\ni=2:\n\nn=2, l=5. a is [2,5]. sorted [2,5]. max_gap 3. first_part 2, last_part 0. d=2.0 → printed.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code is written. Let's write it properly, with proper imports and functions.\n\nBut in the problem's note, the code should read from stdin and print to stdout. So the code is as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n        n, l = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n        sorted_a = sorted(a)\n\n        max_gap = 0\n\n        for j in range(1, len(sorted_a)):\n\n            gap = sorted_a[j] - sorted_a[j-1]\n\n            if gap > max_gap:\n\n                max_gap = gap\n\n        first_part = sorted_a[0]\n\n        last_part = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\n        d = max(first_part, last_part, max_gap / 2)\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the for loop for j in range(1, len(sorted_a)): because n can be 1, then len(sorted_a) is 1. So range(1, 1) is empty. So no problem.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting for n=1, l=5, a=[3], the code would compute first_part = 3, last_part = 5-3=2, max_gap is 0. So d is max(3, 2, 0) = 3.0 → printed as 3.0000000000.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. sorted_a is [0,5,10]. max_gap is 5. So d is max(0, 0, 5/2) = 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can light up a segment of length `2d` around its position. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Initial Gaps**: Determine the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Find Maximum Gap Between Consecutive Lanterns**: Iterate through the sorted list of lantern positions to find the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius required is the maximum value among the initial gaps and half of the maximum gap found between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        n, l = map(int, lines[i].split())\n        a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n        sorted_a = sorted(a)\n        max_gap = 0\n        for j in range(1, len(sorted_a)):\n            gap = sorted_a[j] - sorted_a[j-1]\n            if gap > max_gap:\n                max_gap = gap\n        first_part = sorted_a[0]\n        last_part = l - sorted_a[-1]\n        d = max(first_part, last_part, max_gap / 2)\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing each test case.\n2. **Sorting Lanterns**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Gaps Calculation**: The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street are calculated.\n4. **Maximum Gap Between Lanterns**: By iterating through the sorted positions, we determine the largest gap between any two consecutive lanterns. This gap is crucial because the radius must cover half of this gap to ensure continuous illumination.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The required minimum radius is determined by taking the maximum of the initial gaps and half the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. This ensures that all parts of the street are illuminated without any dark spots.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, followed by a linear pass through the sorted list, making it suitable for large inputs as specified.",
