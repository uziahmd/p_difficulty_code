Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various points. Each lantern can light up a segment of length 2d around it. So, the goal is to find the minimal d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this? Well, the key idea is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum required d for those gaps. Because if two lanterns are close together, their coverage areas might overlap, but if there's a big gap between them, that's where the maximum d would be needed.\n\nWait, but also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, we can't check consecutive pairs properly.\n2. Check the distance between the start (0) and the first lantern. The required d here is (first lantern's position - 0) / 2? Or maybe that's not right. Wait, suppose the first lantern is at position a. Then the leftmost part of the street is 0. The lantern's coverage extends to a - d. To cover 0, we need a - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a. Wait no, wait: the lantern's coverage is from a - d to a + d. So for the left end (0), the maximum distance from the first lantern is a_0. So the required d must be at least a_0. Because if the first lantern is at a_0, then the left end is 0, which is a_0 away. So the lantern's coverage needs to reach there, so d must be at least a_0. Similarly, for the right end, the distance from the last lantern to l is l - a_n. So d must be at least that.\n\nBut then between two consecutive lanterns, say at positions a and b (sorted), the maximum distance between them is (b - a). But since each lantern covers a radius d, the middle point between them would require that the coverage overlaps. Wait, the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns is (b - a). For the coverage to reach from a to b, the required d must be at least (b - a)/2. Because if you have two lanterns, the maximum distance between them is (b - a). The worst case is in the middle. So the distance from the first lantern's coverage to the second's is (b - a) / 2. For example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then each needs to cover 2 units. So that the middle point is covered by both. So the required d for that gap is (b - a)/2.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions.\n- Compute the maximum between the first lantern's position (distance from 0) and the last lantern's distance from l. Then, for each consecutive pair, compute (current - previous)/2 and take the maximum of all these values. The answer is the maximum among all these values.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Then the maximum would be the max between (a1 - 0) and (l - a1). Because that's the distance from the ends to the lantern, and d has to cover those. So for example, if the lantern is at 5, and l is 15, then the distance from the lantern to the end is 10. So d must be at least 10.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 is a[0], so max_d = max(max_d, a[0]).\n\nCheck the last lantern's position. The distance from l is l - a[-1], so max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1]).\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ngap_requirement = current_gap / 2\n\nmax_d = max(max_d, gap_requirement)\n\nThen, the answer is max_d.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, the positions are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nCheck first lantern is 0, so distance from 0 is 0. So initial max_d is 0.\n\nLast lantern is 15, distance from l (15) is 0. So max_d remains 0.\n\nNow check consecutive pairs:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2=1.5 → current max is 1.5.\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting, [2,5].\n\nFirst lantern is 2: distance from 0 is 2 → max_d starts at 2.\n\nLast lantern is 5: distance from l (5) is 0. So max_d is 2.\n\nThen consecutive pair: 5-2=3 → 3/2=1.5. So max_d is max(2, 1.5) → 2. So answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: if there is one lantern at position 0, and l is 10. Then the first lantern's distance is 0, last lantern's distance is 10-0=10. So max_d is 10. Which makes sense, because the lantern needs to cover from 0 to 10, so radius must be 10.\n\nAnother case: lanterns at positions 0 and 10, l=10. The first lantern's distance is 0, last is 0. The gap between them is 10, so 10/2=5. So the answer is 5.\n\nAnother case: lanterns at 0 and 5, l=10. Then the first lantern is 0, last is 5. The distance from last lantern to l is 5. So max_d is 5. The gap between 0 and 5 is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the max is 5. So answer is 5.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and l.\n\n- Read the list of a_i.\n\n- Sort the list.\n\n- Initialize max_d as 0.\n\n- Check first element: max_d = max(max_d, a[0] - 0).\n\n- Check last element: max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1]).\n\n- For each consecutive pair, compute (current - previous) / 2, and compare with max_d.\n\n- Finally, output max_d.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when dealing with floating points, how to handle precision? The problem says that the answer's absolute or relative error must not exceed 1e-9. So we need to output with sufficient decimal digits. So when printing, we can format it to 10 decimal digits, like the sample does.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nRead input. The first line is n and l. The next line is n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which is split into two lines. So for the code, we can read the first line as n, l. Then the second line as list of integers.\n\nBut in Python, for reading from stdin, perhaps the code should read via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, the input may be provided with multiple lines. So for example, the first line is n and l. The second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nRead the next line as list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the max_d as explained.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase when n=1. Then the code will check the first and last (same) element. Then the max_d is max between a[0] and l - a[0]. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when all lanterns are at 0. For example, n=3, l=5, a = [0,0,0]. Then the first is 0, last is 0. The gaps between consecutive are 0. So the max_d is max(0, 5-0=5) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when lanterns are at 0 and l. Then the gap between them is l. So the required d is l/2. But also, the first and last checks would be 0 and 0. So the maximum is l/2. Which is correct.\n\nSo code seems solid.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n, l from input. Then read the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.0.\n\nCheck first element:\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nCheck last element:\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, l - a[-1] )\n\nThen loop from 1 to n-1:\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nThen print max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for example, when the max_d is 2.5, we need to output 2.5000000000.\n\nSo formatting with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut in Python, for example, if the value is integer, like 2, then it would print 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, the input for the first example is:\n\nn=7, l=15, and the list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, it becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nSo the code would process that correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i.\n\nBut note that the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace is fine.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n == 0:\n\n    # but according to input constraints, n >=1 ?\n\nWait, no. The input constraints say 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. So n is at least 1.\n\nSo no need to handle n=0.\n\nSo:\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nmax_d = max( max_d, l - a[-1] )\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but for the first part, a[0] is the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 is a[0] - 0 = a[0]. So yes, that's correct. Similarly for the last lantern.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the second sample input:\n\nInput is 2 5, and a is [2,5]. After sorting, [2,5].\n\nmax_d starts as 0.0.\n\nmax(0.0, 2) → 2.0.\n\nmax(2.0, 5-5=0 → remains 2.0.\n\nThen for i=1, gap is 5-2=3 → 3/2=1.5. Which is less than 2.0. So max_d remains 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[0]. Then:\n\nmax_d is max(0, 0) → 0. Then check l - a[-1] is 10-0=10. So max_d is 10. So output is 10.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the first check is a[0] =5. The last check is 10 -5 =5. So max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then first check is 0, last check is 0. The gap between is 10, so 5. So max_d is 5. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut need to read the input correctly. For example, in the first sample input, the first line is '7 15', then the next line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nSo the code reads the first line as n=7, l=15. Then the next line is split into 7 integers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    a.sort()\n\n    max_d = 0.0\n\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n        current = gap / 2.0\n\n        if current > max_d:\n\n            max_d = current\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you do division, it returns a float. So all the calculations are done as floats.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, check for the sample input.\n\nSample 1: output is 2.5, which is printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2: 2.0, printed as 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=0. Wait, but according to the input constraints, l is at least 1. Because the input says 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9. So no, l can't be zero. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother case: when lanterns are at the same position. For example, n=3, l=10, a = [2,2,2]. Then the first is 2, last is 2. So the max_d is max(2, 10-2=8) → 8. Then the gaps between consecutive are 0, so no change. So the answer is 8.0.\n\nWhich is correct, because the lanterns are all at 2, so the distance from 0 to 2 is 2, but the distance from 2 to 10 is 8. So the radius must be 8 to cover the end of the street.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to light up an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can illuminate a segment of length `2d` around its position. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking consecutive gaps.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the end of the street (`l`) to the last lantern. These distances are critical as they determine the minimum radius needed to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Check Consecutive Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum radius required to cover this gap is half the gap's length, as the lanterns' coverage areas must overlap to ensure the entire street is illuminated.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius is the maximum value obtained from the above checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of lanterns `n` and the length of the street `l`. The second line contains the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking consecutive gaps.\n3. **Initial Checks**: The initial checks for the distances from the start and end of the street to the nearest lanterns are performed to ensure these endpoints are covered.\n4. **Gap Analysis**: By iterating through the sorted positions, the gaps between consecutive lanterns are analyzed. The maximum radius required to cover these gaps is calculated as half the gap's length.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that all parts of the street are covered with the minimum possible radius, efficiently handling edge cases and ensuring correctness.",
