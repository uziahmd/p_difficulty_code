The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task must be done in a specific house, and she can only do the i-th task after completing all previous ones. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to do all tasks.\n\nHmm, the input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks), followed by a list of a_i's. The initial position is house 1. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, so from house n, moving to 1 is one step.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. For each task, she needs to move from her current position to the required house for that task. But since the tasks have to be done in order, each subsequent task depends on the previous.\n\nSo, for example, if the first task is at house 3, she starts at 1. How many steps? Well, moving clockwise from 1 to 3: 2 steps (1→2→3). But if the next task is at 2, then she has to go from 3 to 2. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, she can't go backward. So from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2? That's 3 steps. Or maybe there's a shorter way. Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, the distance between two houses can be calculated as (target - current) mod n. Wait, but if the target is before the current position, then moving clockwise would require going around the ring.\n\nWait, for example, if current is 3 and target is 2. The distance is (2 - 3 + n) % n. Let's see: (2-3) is -1, adding n (say n=4) gives 3. So 3 steps. Which matches the example given in the note.\n\nSo the formula for the time between current position and target is (target - current) % n if we're moving clockwise. Wait, no. Because if target is larger than current, then moving clockwise is (target - current) steps. If target is smaller, then it's (target - current + n) steps. Which is equivalent to (target - current) mod n. But since the mod can be negative, perhaps we should compute it as (target - current + n) % n. Because for example, target=2, current=3, n=4: (2-3 +4) = 3, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each consecutive task, we need to calculate the steps from the previous position to the current target, and accumulate that.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given as a list. So for the first task, Xenia is at position 1. Then, for each task in order, she moves from her current position (which is the position of the previous task) to the current task's position. Wait, but the tasks can be in the same house. For example, if the tasks are [3,3], then she doesn't need to move between them. So the time between those two would be zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nFor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n   compute the distance from current position to a_i, moving clockwise.\n\n   add that distance to total_time.\n\n   set current position to a_i.\n\nSo the key is to compute the distance between consecutive positions.\n\nBut how to compute that distance?\n\nYes, for each step, the distance is (a_i - current_pos) % n if that's positive? Or wait, let's take an example.\n\nIf current_pos is 3, and a_i is 2, n=4.\n\nThen the distance is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4 = 3 mod 4 = 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: current_pos is 4, a_i is 1. Then (1 -4 +4) = 1. Which is correct (moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step).\n\nAnother example: current is 1, a_i is 3. Then (3-1) = 2 steps. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which can be written as (target - current) % n if the mod is handled correctly. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So (target - current) % n would give the correct distance.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ntarget = 2, current = 3, n=4. (2-3) = -1. -1 %4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the formula for distance between current and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, if target is equal to current, then it's 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each task, we calculate (a_i - current_pos) % n, add that to total_time, and set current_pos to a_i.\n\nWait, but why? Because the movement is clockwise. So, for example, if current is 3 and target is 2, then the distance is (2-3) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. So yes.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Let's test it against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, tasks are [3,2,3]\n\nInitial current position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance is (3-1) mod 4 = 2. Add 2. Total is 2. Current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance is (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod4 = 3. Add 3. Total is 5. Current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance is (3-2) mod4 = 1. Add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So that works.\n\nAnother sample input: '4 3\\n2 3 3'\n\nSo the tasks are [2,3,3].\n\nInitial position 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1. Add 1. Current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. Add 1. Total is 2. Current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-3) mod4=0. Add 0. Total is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So that works.\n\nSo the code needs to read n and m, then read the list of a_i's.\n\nThen, initialize current_pos as 1, total_time as 0.\n\nLoop through each a_i in the list:\n\n   compute distance = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n   add distance to total_time\n\n   set current_pos to a_i\n\nFinally, print total_time.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 2? Let's say current is 1, target is 2. (2-1) mod2=1. Which is correct. If current is 2, target is 1: (1-2) mod2= -1 mod2=1. Which is correct (moving from 2 to 1 is 1 step).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. n and m can be up to 1e5. So the code needs to process m elements in O(m) time. Which is acceptable.\n\nNow, in Python, reading the input is important. The input is given as two lines. First line has n and m. Second line has m integers.\n\nBut the input may have leading or trailing spaces. So, in code, we can read the first line with input().split(), then the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when there are multiple test cases, but in the problem statement, the sample input shows two examples. However, the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and m. The second line contains m integers. So the code needs to read one test case.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples, but that's probably for illustration. The actual input is for a single test case. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nRead the next line as list of integers.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen, current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in the list:\n\n   distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = ai\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive value. So that's correct.\n\nTesting with the first sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod4 is 2 → total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4 is 3 → total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1 → total is 6. Which is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 is 1 → total 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1 → total 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3) mod4 is 0 → total remains 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the tasks are [1,1,1], then total time is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The steps would be:\n\ncurrent is 1 → first ai is 2: (2-1) mod2 = 1 → total 1. Then current is 2. Next ai is 1: (1-2) mod2 = -1 mod2=1 → total 2. Which is correct: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut need to read the input. So:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read the second line as list of integers.\n\nIn Python, for reading from stdin, we can use:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen, current_pos = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but what if the list a is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because in the input, m is given as 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nBut let's check the sample input. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be read as a list [3,2,3]. The code loops through each element.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when the list is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nLet me check the sample input again.\n\nSample 1: output is 6. The code would produce that.\n\nSample 2: output is 2. The code would produce that.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. The first move is from 1 to 5: (5-1) mod5 =4. Then from 5 to 1: (1-5) mod5 = -4 mod5=1. So total is 4+1=5. Which is correct: 1→2→3→4→5 (4 steps), then 5→1 (1 step). Total 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses numbered clockwise from 1 to n. Xenia starts at house 1 and must move clockwise to complete each task in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the ringroad is circular and movement is only allowed clockwise, the distance between two houses can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. The distance from the current position to the target house is given by `(target - current) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task, compute the distance from Xenia's current position to the task's house, accumulate this distance to the total time, and update her current position to the task's house.\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution processes each task in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This ensures efficiency even for large input sizes up to 100,000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        diff = (ai - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = ai\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line of input is read to get the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of houses where each task must be completed.\n- **Initialization**: Xenia starts at house 1. The total time is initialized to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. Accumulate this distance into the total time and update the current position to the target house.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution.",
