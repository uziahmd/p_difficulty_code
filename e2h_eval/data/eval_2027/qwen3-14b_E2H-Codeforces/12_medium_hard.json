The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks in certain houses arranged in a ringroad. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. \n\nSo the problem says that each task i requires her to be in house ai, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. Oh right, so the tasks are ordered. So the order of tasks is important. Also, moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. And since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, so from house n, moving to 1 is one step.\n\nThe input gives n and m, then m numbers representing the sequence of tasks. For example, in the first sample input, the tasks are 3, 2, 3. So she has to do task 1 (at house 3), then task 2 (at house 2), then task 3 (at house 3 again). But since each task must be done in order, she can't do task 2 before task 1. \n\nThe initial position is house 1. So the challenge is to compute the total time taken to move between the required houses in the order of tasks, considering the ringroad's circular nature.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's consider that for each task, we need to calculate the time taken to get from the previous position to the current task's house, and accumulate that.\n\nBut how do we compute the movement between two houses? Let's say she is currently at position prev, and needs to go to position curr. Since the movement is clockwise, the distance between prev and curr can be calculated as (curr - prev) mod n? Wait, no. Because if prev is 4 and curr is 1, then moving clockwise would take 1 step. But (curr - prev) would be -3, mod n (4) would be 1. So yes, (curr - prev) mod n gives the number of steps needed. Wait, but if prev is 3 and curr is 2, then (2-3) is -1 mod 4 is 3. But moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require moving 3 steps: 3→4→1→2. Which is correct. So yes, the formula for the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which is equivalent to (curr - prev) % n, but since in Python, modulo can be negative, maybe we need to adjust it. Wait, in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3. So yes, (curr - prev) % n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, let's test:\n\nprev = 3, curr = 2, n=4. (2-3) is -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes. So the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) % n. But wait, what if prev is 1 and curr is 1? Then steps is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1. Then for each task in the sequence, calculate the steps from current position to the task's house, add that to the total time, and update current position to the task's house.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given as a list a1, a2, ..., am. So for each i from 1 to m, we have ai. But the tasks must be done in order. So for each task in the list, in order, compute the steps from previous position to ai, add to total.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, tasks are [3,2,3].\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3: steps from 1 to 3. (3-1) = 2 steps. So total is 2. Now current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2: steps from 3 to 2. (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. So add 3. Total is 5. Now current position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3: steps from 2 to 3. (3-2) = 1. Add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to process the list of tasks, and for each consecutive pair, compute the steps between them, sum all those steps.\n\nBut how about when there are multiple consecutive tasks in the same house? Like if the tasks are [3,3,3]. Then the steps between them are zero. So the code will just add zero for each of those steps.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total_time = 0\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\nfor each ai in the list of tasks:\n\n    steps = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but wait: for the first task, the initial position is 1, and the first ai is a1. So steps from 1 to a1. Then for the next task, steps from a1 to a2, etc.\n\nYes. So the code should process all the tasks in order, and accumulate the steps between each consecutive pair.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of m integers as a list.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in the list:\n\n    steps = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nWait, but why does this work? Let's check the second sample input.\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nSo the tasks are 2, 3, 3.\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps (2-1) = 1. total is 1. current_pos is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: steps (3-2) = 1. total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps (3-3) = 0. total remains 2. So output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the tasks are [1,1,1], then the total steps would be 0 (from 1 to 1, then 0, then 0). So total is 0.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2, tasks [1,2]. Steps from 1 to 1 (0) then from 1 to 2 (1). Total is 1.\n\nBut wait, initial position is 1. First task is 1: steps is 0. Then second task is 2: steps is 1. So total is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, tasks [3, 5, 1]. So steps:\n\nfrom 1 to 3: 2 steps.\n\nfrom 3 to 5: 2 steps (3→4→5).\n\nfrom 5 to 1: (1-5) mod 5 = -4 mod 5 = 1. Because moving clockwise from 5 to 1 is 1 step. So total steps 2+2+1=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and m. The second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first example is:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be read as n=4, m=3, and the list is [3,2,3].\n\nSo the code would process that correctly.\n\nNow, in Python, reading from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading input, there might be leading or trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace should handle that.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\ntasks = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n\n    diff = (a - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = a\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait: for the case when n is 1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nWait the problem statement says 2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5. So n is at least 2. So no division by zero issues.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, tasks [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond a=2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird a=3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1. total is 6. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nAs discussed earlier.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, what about when the tasks are in the same house? Like m=2, tasks [1,1]. Then the total steps would be (1-1) mod n (0) + (1-1) mod n (0) → 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, tasks [5, 1, 5]. Initial position is 1.\n\nFirst step: 5-1 mod 5 is 4. total is 4. current is 5.\n\nSecond step: 1-5 mod 5 is (1-5) = -4 mod 5 = 1. total 5. current is 1.\n\nThird step: 5-1 mod 5 is 4. total 9. So total steps 4+1+4=9.\n\nWhich is correct. Because:\n\nFrom 1 →5: 4 steps (clockwise). Then 5 →1: 1 step. Then 1 →5: 4 steps. Total 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. Each task must be completed in sequence, and moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house number 1.\n2. **Task Sequence Processing**: For each task in the given sequence, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house of the task.\n3. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Use modular arithmetic to compute the shortest path on the ringroad. The movement from house `prev` to house `curr` is calculated as `(curr - prev) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    tasks = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for a in tasks:\n        diff = (a - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = a\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The second line contains `m` integers representing the sequence of tasks.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `total` time initialized to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task in the sequence:\n   - Calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n   - Update the total time and the current position after each task.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the accumulated total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle circular movements, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `n` and `m`.",
