There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, the challenge is to figure out how to structure the tournament so that the winner plays as many games as possible under this constraint.\n\nLet me think about some examples first. For example, when n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, the second game would be against someone who has zero games (since player 3 hasn't played yet). Wait, but according to the rule, the difference in games played must be no more than one. So when the winner has played one game (against player 2), then player 3 has played zero. So the difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. Hence the answer is 2.\n\nBut for n=4, the answer is 2. Why? Because if you have four players, the optimal way is to have two initial matches (like 1 vs 2 and 3 vs 4). Then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner (1) has played two games. But why can't he play three games? Let's think. Suppose the winner plays three games. That would require that in each round, he plays against someone who has played either the same number or one less. But for that, maybe the structure would need to be different.\n\nWait, the maximum number of games the winner can play is equal to the number of rounds in the tournament. Because in each round, the winner plays once. So for a standard knockout tournament with n players, the number of rounds is log2(n), but that's only if it's a perfect binary tree. However, when n isn't a power of two, the structure changes. But in this problem, the structure is not fixed, but we can arrange the matches in a way that allows the maximum number of games for the winner.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum possible number of games the winner can play, given that the tournament is arranged optimally under the given constraints.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the winner plays k games. Then, in each game, he must have faced opponents that meet the condition. Let's think about how the opponents are chosen.\n\nFor the winner to play k games, he must have played against k opponents. Each time, the opponent must have a number of games played that differs by at most one from the winner's current count.\n\nLet me think about the structure. For example, the first game, the winner has 0 games, so the opponent also has 0. Then after winning, the winner has 1 game. The next opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. If the winner plays again, then the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. Let's imagine that the winner is in a situation where he can play against someone who has 1 game. How?\n\nThis seems similar to building a Fibonacci sequence. Because, for example, to have a player reach k games, they need to have opponents that are arranged in such a way that each step allows for the next game. Let me think: Let's say that f(k) is the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, he must have played k-1 games before, and then play another game. But to do that, he needs an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. Wait, perhaps the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, in order for the winner to play the k-th game, he must have an opponent who has played k-1 games (so that their difference is 0) or k-2 games (difference is 1). But how does that work?\n\nLet me take some examples. For k=1, the minimal players is 2 (f(1)=2). For k=2, the minimal players is 3. Because the winner plays two games. First, he plays against someone (needs 2 players). Then, he needs to play another game. The opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. But if the opponent has played 0 games, that's possible. For example, in the case of n=3. So the minimal players for k=2 is 3. Now, for k=3, the minimal players would be f(3) = f(2)+f(1) = 3+2=5. Because, to have the winner play a third game, he needs to face an opponent who has played 2 games (so that the difference is 1). How can that opponent have played 2 games? Well, that requires that there's a subtree where that opponent has played 2 games, which requires f(2) players. And the winner's previous path requires f(2) players as well. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe idea is that for the winner to play k games, he must have in each step an opponent that meets the condition. So, for the k-th game, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. But in order for that to happen, the number of players required would be the sum of the players required for those two cases.\n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example:\n\nf(1) = 2 (needs 2 players)\nf(2) = 3 (needs 3 players)\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5\nf(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8\nf(5) = 8+5=13, etc.\n\nSo the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number? Or something like that. Let's check:\n\nFor example, for k=1, f(1)=2. Let's see the Fibonacci numbers. Let's say Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, etc. Then, f(k) = Fib(k+2). For example, k=1: Fib(3) is 2. Yes. k=2: Fib(4)=3. Yes. k=3: Fib(5)=5. Yes. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is Fib(k+2). Therefore, given n players, we need to find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤ n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest k where Fib(k+2) ≤ n.\n\nBut how do we compute this? Let's take the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. The Fib(4) is 3. So k+2=4 → k=2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4. The Fib(5)=5 which is larger than 4. So the maximum k is 2 (since Fib(4)=3 ≤4, Fib(5)=5>4). So the answer is 2.\n\nSample Input 4: n=10. Let's see:\n\nFib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13. So Fib(6)=8 ≤10, Fib(7)=13>10. So k+2=6 → k=4. Which matches the sample output of 4.\n\nYes! So the problem becomes: find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Generate the Fibonacci sequence until the value exceeds n. Then, find the maximum k where Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to generate the Fibonacci numbers up to that value. Let's see how many terms that would take. The Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. For example, Fib(80) is around 2.34e16, Fib(90) is 2.88e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum k would be around 85 or so. So generating the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18 is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed 1e18. For each n, find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nWe can generate the Fibonacci numbers in a list. Let's start with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc. Then, for each n, find the largest m where Fib(m) <=n. Then k = m-2.\n\nWait, because Fib(k+2) <=n. So m is k+2. So k = m-2.\n\nFor example, when n=3, Fib(4)=3. So m=4, k=4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFind the maximum m such that Fib(m) ≤n. Then the answer is m-2.\n\nBut what if n is not exactly a Fibonacci number? For example, n=4. The largest Fib(m) ≤4 is 3 (m=4). So answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5. Fib(5)=5. So m=5. Answer is 5-2=3. Which would be the case where the winner plays 3 games. Let's see: for n=5, the minimal players is Fib(5)=5. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo the algorithm is to generate all the Fib numbers up to 1e18, then for a given n, find the largest Fib(m) <=n, then subtract 2.\n\nBut how to generate the Fib numbers?\n\nLet me code that.\n\nLet's think about generating the Fib numbers. We can start with a list, starting with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc. Let's generate until the next Fib number exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce we have that list, for a given n, we can perform a binary search to find the maximum m where Fib(m) <=n.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the list will be small. So even a linear search would be acceptable.\n\nSo for example, let's generate the list:\n\nfib_list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... ]\n\nBut let's think about the indices. Let's say that fib_list[0] = 1 (m=1), fib_list[1]=1 (m=2), fib_list[2]=2 (m=3), fib_list[3]=3 (m=4), etc. So for each index i, the value is Fib(i+1). Wait, perhaps better to generate the list as follows:\n\nInitialize a list, starting with Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) = 2, Fib(4) = 3, Fib(5) = 5, etc. So for m=1, Fib(m)=1; m=2, Fib(m)=1; m=3, Fib(m)=2, etc.\n\nSo for the list, let's generate until the Fib numbers exceed 1e18.\n\nOnce that is generated, for a given n, find the maximum m such that Fib(m) <=n. Then the answer is m-2.\n\nBut what if n is less than Fib(3) =2? For example, n=2. Then Fib(3)=2. m=3. answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. Fib(4)=3. m=4. answer 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4. The largest Fib(m) <=4 is Fib(4)=3 (m=4) or Fib(5)=5 is larger than 4. So answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=10. The Fib numbers up to 10 are 1,1,2,3,5,8,13. So the largest Fib(m) <=10 is 8 (m=6). answer is 6-2=4. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, precompute the Fib numbers up to 1e18.\n\nThen, for a given n, find the maximum m where Fib(m) <=n.\n\nBut how to handle the precomputation.\n\nLet's write code to generate the Fib numbers.\n\nInitialize a list, say fibs = [1, 1]. Then, while the next number is <= 1e18, append it.\n\nWait, but the initial list is Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1. Then Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nthen, while True:\n\nnext_num = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\nif next_num > 1e18: break\n\nappend to fibs.\n\nBut let's code this.\n\nOnce we have the list, for a given n, we can loop through the list to find the maximum m.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, we can use binary search.\n\nBut for the constraints of n up to 1e18, the list will have about 85 elements. So even a linear search is acceptable.\n\nSo, for example, for n=10, the list is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...], and we find the largest element <=10. Which is 8, which is at index 5 (assuming the list starts with index 0 as m=1, index 1 as m=2, etc.)\n\nWait, the list is built as follows:\n\nfibs[0] = 1 (m=1)\n\nfibs[1] = 1 (m=2)\n\nfibs[2] = 2 (m=3)\n\nfibs[3] = 3 (m=4)\n\nfibs[4] = 5 (m=5)\n\nfibs[5] = 8 (m=6)\n\nfibs[6] = 13 (m=7)\n\nSo for each index i, the m is i+1.\n\nSo, for example, if the list is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], then the maximum m for n=10 is 6 (since 8 is Fib(6) = 8).\n\nSo the code for a given n would be:\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] <=n:\n\n        max_m = i+1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nWait, but that would not be correct. Because the list is in increasing order. So, for example, for n=10, we can loop through all elements until we find the first element that is larger than n. Then the previous one is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, iterate through all elements and find the largest element <=n.\n\nOnce we find that, then m is the index +1.\n\nSo for example, for the list [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], and n=10, the largest element is 8, which is at index 5. So m is 5+1=6. Then answer is 6-2=4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code steps in Python would be:\n\nGenerate the list of Fib numbers as described.\n\nRead n.\n\nFind the maximum m such that Fib(m) <=n.\n\nThen, the answer is m-2.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Wait, the input constraints say n is >=2. So no need to handle n=1.\n\nBut let's see for n=2. The Fib numbers are 1,1,2, etc. So the maximum m is 3 (since Fib(3)=2). answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo now, the code:\n\nFirst, generate the list of Fib numbers.\n\nBut in Python, for very big numbers, it's manageable.\n\nSo let's code that.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nWe can generate the list as follows.\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nBut wait, for n up to 1e18, but the next_fib could be up to 1e18. So the loop continues until next_fib exceeds 1e18.\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float. It's better to use integers. So perhaps:\n\nmax_n = 10**18\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > max_n:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nBut then, for example, for n=10^18, the code would generate all Fib numbers up to that.\n\nOnce that is done, for a given n, we need to find the maximum m where Fib(m) <=n.\n\nBut for example, if n is 1, but according to the problem statement, n starts from 2.\n\nSo, the code for the problem:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nThen, find the largest m such that Fib(m) <=n.\n\nBut how?\n\nLoop through the fibs list, and track the maximum m.\n\nBut since the list is in increasing order, we can loop through each element and find the last element that is <=n.\n\nFor example:\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] <=n:\n\n        max_m = i+1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nWait, but this would stop at the first element that is larger than n. But what if the list is longer? For example, suppose the list is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], and n=5. Then, the first elements are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5. So for i=4, fibs[4] =5 <=n. Then, the next element is 8>5, so break. So max_m is 4+1=5. Which is correct.\n\nBut in this case, the code would loop through all elements until the first element that is larger than n, and then break. So that's okay.\n\nBut what if the list is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], and n=13. Then, the loop would check all elements. For i=6, fibs[6]=13 <=n. So max_m is 6+1=7. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] <= n:\n\n        max_m = i + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nBut wait, this would not work if the list is [1,1,2,3,5,8,13], and n is 10. The first elements are 1,1,2,3,5,8. Then, the next is 13 which is larger than 10. So the loop would set max_m to 5+1=6 (i=5, fibs[5] is 8). Then break. So the answer is 6-2=4, which is correct.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the Fib numbers are not in the list. For example, if n is 4, which is between 3 and 5. Then, the maximum Fib(m) is 3 (m=4). So the code would return 4, then answer is 4-2=2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the Fib list is not long enough? For example, if the code stops when next_fib exceeds 1e18, but for some n, the Fib numbers are larger than n but not in the list.\n\nWait, no. The code generates all Fib numbers up to 1e18. So for any n up to 1e18, the list includes all Fib numbers up to the maximum that is <= 1e18.\n\nSo, for example, if the last Fib number in the list is F, and the next Fib number is F', which is larger than 1e18. Then for any n between F and F', the maximum Fib(m) is F.\n\nSo, the code for the for loop would find that.\n\nSo the code for the for loop is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nOnce the list is generated, then:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] <= n:\n\n        max_m = i + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nBut wait, this code breaks when it finds the first element larger than n. However, there may be elements after that which are smaller than n. No, because the list is generated in increasing order. So once an element is larger than n, all following elements are larger than n. So the code is correct.\n\nBut the code is written as:\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] <=n:\n\n        max_m = i+1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nBut this would not check all elements. For example, if the list is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], and n is 8. Then, during the loop, i=0 (fibs[0]=1 <=8 → max_m=1), i=1 (fibs[1]=1 → max_m=2), i=2 (fibs[2]=2 → max_m=3), i=3 (fibs[3]=3 → max_m=4), i=4 (fibs[4]=5 → max_m=5), i=5 (fibs[5]=8 → max_m=6), i=6 (fibs[6]=13>8 → break. So the max_m is 6. Which is correct.\n\nBut if the list is [1,1,2,3,5,8,13], and n is 13. Then, during the loop, for i=6, fibs[6]=13 <=n → max_m=7. Then, the loop continues. But since the next element is beyond the list, the loop ends. So the code returns 7. Which is correct.\n\nBut the for loop runs for all elements in the fibs list. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the for loop is for i in range(len(fibs)), which is from 0 to len(fibs)-1. So the code would check all elements in the list.\n\nBut in the code above, the for loop will check each element in order, and if it's <=n, update max_m. But once it finds an element larger than n, it breaks. So for example, if the list is [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21], and n is 10. Then, the code checks i=0,1,2,3,4,5 (fibs[5]=8 <=10 → max_m=6). Then i=6, fibs[6]=13>10 → break. So the code returns 6. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code for finding max_m is correct.\n\nOnce we have max_m, the answer is max_m - 2.\n\nBut what if the max_m is 1 or 2?\n\nFor example, if n=2, then the fibs list has 1,1,2. So during the loop:\n\ni=0, fibs[0]=1 <=2 → max_m=1.\n\ni=1, fibs[1]=1 → max_m=2.\n\ni=2, fibs[2]=2 → max_m=3.\n\nThen, the loop continues. If there are more elements, but in this case, the next element is 3, which is larger than 2. So the code breaks. Thus, max_m=3. answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2. The answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1. But according to input constraints, n is >=2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut first, let's generate the fibs list.\n\nBut wait, the initial list is [1, 1], then we generate next numbers.\n\nBut in code:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float. So for very large numbers, it's better to use integers. So perhaps:\n\nmax_n = 10 ** 18\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > max_n:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nBut this would generate all the Fib numbers up to the maximum that is <= 1e18.\n\nOnce that is done, the code reads n as an integer, then loops through the fibs list to find the max_m.\n\nBut what about when n is larger than the last Fib number in the list? For example, if n is 1e18, but the last Fib number is less than that. Then, the code would have the max_m as the last index +1. But in that case, the code would not find any Fib number larger than n, so the loop would process all elements.\n\nSo, for example, if the last Fib number is F, and n is larger than F, then the code would set max_m to the index of F plus 1.\n\nBut then, the answer is max_m -2.\n\nBut in that case, the Fib(m) is F, which is the largest Fib number <=n.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input 2: n=3.\n\nThe fibs list would have [1,1,2,3,5,...].\n\nSo during the loop, for i=0 (fibs[0]=1 <=3 → max_m=1), i=1 (fibs[1]=1 → max_m=2), i=2 (fibs[2]=2 → max_m=3), i=3 (fibs[3]=3 → max_m=4). Then, next element is 5 which is larger than 3. So the loop breaks. So answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: n=10. The Fib numbers up to 10 are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. So during the loop, when i=5, fibs[5]=8 <=10 → max_m=6. Then, i=6, fibs[6]=13>10 → break. answer is 6-2=4. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: n=4. The max_m is 4 (fibs[3]=3). answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 2.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code needs to read n from stdin. Let's write the code.\n\nBut the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nGenerate the fib list.\n\nRead n.\n\nFind max_m.\n\nPrint max_m - 2.\n\nBut let's code this.\n\nBut first, let's generate the fib list. Let's code it.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Generate fib list\n\n    fibs = [1, 1]\n\n    max_n = 10**18\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n        if next_fib > max_n:\n\n            break\n\n        fibs.append(next_fib)\n\n    # Find max_m\n\n    max_m = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n        if fibs[i] <= n:\n\n            max_m = i + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            break\n\n    print(max_m - 2)\n\nBut wait, what if the Fib list is [1,1], and n is 2?\n\nIn that case, the code would generate next_fib as 1+1=2. Which is <=1e18. So it appends 2. Then the next iteration: next_fib is 1+2=3. Also <=1e18. So appends 3, etc. So the code for generating the fibs is correct.\n\nBut in the code above, the initial fibs is [1,1], and then the loop adds the next Fib numbers.\n\nBut for the case when n is 2, the code would process the list correctly.\n\nBut let's test the code for n=2. The fibs list would have [1,1,2,3,5,...]. Then during the for loop:\n\ni=0: 1<=2 → max_m=1.\n\ni=1: 1<=2 → max_m=2.\n\ni=2: 2<=2 → max_m=3.\n\ni=3: 3>2 → break. So the answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5. The fibs list includes 5. So the max_m is 5 (i=4, since fibs[4] is 5). Then answer is 5-2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut what about when n is larger than all elements in the fibs list? For example, suppose n is 1e18, and the last Fib number in the list is less than that. Then, the code will process all elements, and max_m is len(fibs) (since for each i, fibs[i] <=n). Then, the answer is len(fibs) -2.\n\nBut how is the fibs list generated?\n\nFor example, suppose the last Fib number in the list is F, which is <=1e18. Then, the next Fib number is F' = F + previous, which is larger than 1e18, so not added. So the code would have the last Fib number in the list as F.\n\nIf n is larger than F, then the code would process all elements in the list, and max_m is len(fibs) (since i ranges from 0 to len(fibs)-1, and for all i, fibs[i] <=n. So the code would set max_m = len(fibs) (i+1 for i = len(fibs)-1).\n\nThen, the answer is len(fibs) -2.\n\nBut for example, let's say that the last Fib number is F = Fib(m) and the next Fib number is Fib(m+1) = F + Fib(m-1) which is larger than 1e18. So for n=1e18, which is larger than F, but less than Fib(m+1). Then the code would return m as max_m, and the answer is m-2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nInput: 2 → Output:1.\n\nSample input 3: input 3 → output 2.\n\nSample input 4: input 4 → output 2.\n\nSample input 10 → output 4.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test for n=5. The answer is 3.\n\nAnother example: n=8. The Fib numbers up to 8 are 1,1,2,3,5,8. So the max_m is 6 → 6-2=4. So the answer is 4. Let's see: for n=8, the maximum games is 4?\n\nWait, let's think. The Fib(6) is 8. So m=6. answer is 6-2=4. How?\n\nThe winner plays 4 games. Let's see:\n\nHow is that possible? Let's imagine the structure.\n\nThe minimal players required is 8. So for 8 players, the winner can play 4 games. How?\n\nIt would be a structure where each time, the opponent has played either one less or same as the winner.\n\nBut perhaps the tournament is structured as a Fibonacci tree.\n\nBut regardless, according to our logic, the code returns 4 for n=8.\n\nBut according to the sample for n=10, the answer is 4. For n=8, the answer is 4 as well.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should work for all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The key insight is that the problem can be reduced to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the number of players, which allows us to compute the maximum number of games efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The tournament follows a knockout structure where each player is eliminated upon losing a game. The rule that two players can only play if their number of previously played games differs by at most one implies that the tournament structure can be optimized to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n2. **Fibonacci Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games corresponds to the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. This is derived from the fact that each game the winner plays requires an opponent who has played either the same number of games or one less, leading to a Fibonacci sequence structure.\n3. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to $10^{18}$ since the input constraints allow up to $10^{18}$ players. This precomputation allows efficient lookup for any given number of players.\n4. **Determine Maximum Games**: For a given number of players `n`, find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n` and use it to compute the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Generate Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18\n    fibs = [1, 1]\n    max_n = 10**18\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n        if next_fib > max_n:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_fib)\n    \n    max_m = 0\n    for i in range(len(fibs)):\n        if fibs[i] <= n:\n            max_m = i + 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    print(max_m - 2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: The code generates Fibonacci numbers up to $10^{18}$, storing them in a list. This allows quick lookup for any input value within the constraints.\n2. **Determine Largest Valid Fibonacci Number**: For a given number of players `n`, the code iterates through the precomputed Fibonacci numbers to find the largest value that does not exceed `n`.\n3. **Calculate Result**: The result is derived by subtracting 2 from the index (adjusted for 1-based indexing) of the largest valid Fibonacci number. This adjustment is based on the relationship between Fibonacci numbers and the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation even for very large values of `n`, leveraging the properties of Fibonacci numbers to determine the optimal tournament structure.",
