The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task must be done in a specific house, and she can only do the i-th task after completing all previous ones. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to do all tasks.\n\nHmm, the input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks), followed by a list of a_i's. The initial position is house 1. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, so from house n, moving to 1 is one step.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. For each task, she needs to move from her current position to the required house for that task. But since the tasks have to be done in order, each subsequent task depends on the previous.\n\nSo, for example, if the first task is at house 3, she starts at 1. How many steps? Well, moving clockwise from 1 to 3: 2 steps (1→2→3). But if the next task is at 2, then she needs to go from 3 to 2. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, she can't go backward. So from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2? That's 3 steps. Or maybe there's a shorter way. Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, the distance between two houses can be calculated as (target - current) mod n. Wait, but if the target is before the current position, then moving clockwise would require going around the ring.\n\nWait, for example, if current is 3 and target is 2. The distance is (2 - 3 + n) % n. Let's see: (2-3) is -1, adding n (say n=4) gives 3. So 3 steps. Which matches the example given in the first test case.\n\nSo the formula for moving from current position to target is (target - current) mod n. But wait, if the target is ahead, then that's the difference. If it's behind, then (target - current + n) mod n gives the correct number of steps. So for example, current is 3, target is 2. (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the first example, let's see:\n\nThe first test input is 4 3, with tasks [3,2,3]. The output is 6. Let's break down the steps.\n\nStarts at 1. First task is 3. Steps needed: 3-1 = 2 steps. So 1→2→3. Then, second task is 2. Current position is 3. Target is 2. So (2-3 +4) mod 4 = 3 steps. So 3→4→1→2. Then third task is 3. Current position is 2. Target is 3. So 1 step. Total steps: 2+3+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is: track the current position, and for each task, compute the steps needed to get from current to the target, add that to the total, then update the current position.\n\nBut wait, what about when the target is same as current? Then steps needed is zero. So for consecutive tasks in the same house, no steps are added.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n   if a_i == current_pos: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      compute steps = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n      if steps == 0: steps = 0?\n\nWait, no. Because (a_i - current_pos) mod n would be zero only if a_i equals current_pos. So for example, if a_i is same as current_pos, steps is zero. So in that case, we don't add anything.\n\nBut wait, for example, if current is 1 and target is 1, steps is zero.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each task in a:\n\n    if current_pos != task:\n\n        steps = (task - current_pos) % n\n\n        total_time += steps\n\n        current_pos = task\n\nBut wait, why not? Because the steps are the minimal steps needed to reach the target in clockwise direction.\n\nYes. So for each task, we calculate the steps from current position to the target, add it to the total, then update the current position.\n\nSo the problem reduces to processing each task in order, and accumulating the steps.\n\nBut wait, what about when the tasks are in the same house consecutively? Like if the list is [3,3,3], then the steps would be 2 (from 1 to 3) and then 0 for the rest. So the total is 2.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m, the second line has m integers.\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that the input can be given as a string like '4 3\\n3 2 3' and another input line. But in Python, when reading from stdin, we need to read the entire input. However, the user provided two examples here, but the actual problem expects that the code will read from stdin.\n\nSo, the code needs to read two lines: first line is n and m, second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So for example, the first input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be read as n=4, m=3, and a list [3,2,3].\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, split into these parts.\n\nNow, the code in Python would be something like:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen process the list as per the algorithm above.\n\nBut what about the constraints? n and m can be up to 1e5, which is manageable in Python as O(m) time.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list a of m elements.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nfor each ai in a:\n\n    if ai != current_pos:\n\n        steps = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n        total_time += steps\n\n        current_pos = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3. 3 != 1. steps = (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total becomes 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2. steps = (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. total is 2+3=5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3. steps = (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 5+1=6. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is '4 3\\n2 3 3'.\n\nSo n=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3].\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2. steps (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3. steps (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3. no steps. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then steps is 0. So output 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Steps: first is 0 (current is 1). Then steps (2-1) mod2 = 1. total is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Steps: first step is (2-1) mod2 = 1. total is 1. Then (1-2) mod2 = ( -1 ) mod2 = 1. total becomes 2. So total is 2.\n\nWhich makes sense: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). So total 2 steps.\n\nAnother case where the tasks are in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, a=[3,3,3]. The steps are (3-1) mod5 = 2. Then 0, then 0. Total is 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nBut need to read the input correctly.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading from stdin, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace is okay.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    if ai != current:\n\n        steps = (ai - current) % n\n\n        total += steps\n\n        current = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when the steps are zero? For example, when ai equals current, then steps is zero, but the code skips adding anything. So that's correct.\n\nYes. So this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nInput is 4 3, then 3 2 3.\n\nThe code processes as explained, outputs 6.\n\nSecond sample input: 4 3, then 2 3 3. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The code gives 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=1, a=[1]. Output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, what about when the list is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. Because in the input constraints, m is 1<=m<=1e5.\n\nWait, the input says m can be 1. So the code handles m=0? No, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses numbered clockwise from 1 to n. Each task must be completed in a specific house, and Xenia can only move clockwise between adjacent houses, taking one unit of time per move.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the number of steps required to move from the current house to the target house for that task.\n3. **Clockwise Movement Calculation**: The number of steps needed to move from the current house to the target house in a clockwise direction can be computed using modulo arithmetic. Specifically, the formula `(target - current) % n` gives the correct number of steps, considering the ringroad's circular nature.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the steps required for each task transition to get the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        if ai != current:\n            steps = (ai - current) % n\n            total += steps\n            current = ai\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of house numbers where each task must be completed.\n- **Tracking Position**: Xenia starts at house 1. For each task, we check if she is already at the required house. If not, we compute the number of steps needed to move clockwise to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Modulo Arithmetic**: The expression `(ai - current) % n` efficiently calculates the minimal steps required to move from the current house to the target house in a clockwise direction.\n- **Accumulating Total Time**: Each computed step count is added to the total time, which is printed at the end after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular movement constraints, resulting in an optimal O(m) time complexity.",
