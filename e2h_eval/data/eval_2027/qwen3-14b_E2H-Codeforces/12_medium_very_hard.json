The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks in certain houses arranged in a ringroad. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. \n\nSo the problem says that each task i requires her to be in house ai, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). Oh right, and moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Also, the houses are arranged in a circle, clockwise. So moving from house n to 1 would take 1 step, right?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation is that she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Start at 1. First task is 3. So she needs to get from 1 to 3. How long? Since it's clockwise, moving 2 steps (1→2→3). Time taken is 2. Then she does task 1.\n\nThen task 2 is at 2. But since she's currently at 3, she needs to move clockwise to 2. Wait, but moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going all the way around. Because clockwise direction is forward, so moving from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2. That's 3 steps. So total time so far is 2 + 3 = 5. Then she does task 2.\n\nThen task 3 is at 3 again. She is currently at 2. So moving clockwise to 3 takes 1 step. Total time is 5 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the key here is that for each task, we need to calculate the time it takes to get from the current position to the next required house, considering the direction (clockwise only), and accumulate that.\n\nBut how do we compute the movement between two houses?\n\nLet me think. Suppose Xenia is currently at position current_pos. She needs to move to target_pos. Since the movement is clockwise, the number of steps needed is (target_pos - current_pos) mod n if target_pos >= current_pos. But if target_pos is smaller than current_pos, then it's (target_pos + n - current_pos) steps. Or more generally, (target_pos - current_pos) if positive, else (target_pos - current_pos + n). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nFor example, current_pos is 3, target is 2. n is 4. The steps needed are 3 →4 →1 →2: 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) = 3. So yes, (target - current) mod n? Well, (target - current) could be negative. So the formula is (target - current) if positive, else (target - current + n). Which can be written as (target - current) % n? Wait, no. Because for example, (2-3) is -1. Mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So yes, the steps between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which is equivalent to (target - current) % n. But since in Python, modulo can return negative values if the numerator is negative, but in this case, since target and current are between 1 and n, perhaps the calculation can be done as (target - current) if target >= current else (target - current + n). Or perhaps (target - current + n) % n. Because if target is greater than current, then (target - current) mod n is same as target - current. If target is less, then adding n and mod n gives the correct steps.\n\nWait, for example, target=2, current=3, n=4. (2-3) = -1. Adding n gives 3. Which is correct. So the steps between current and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, when target is current, it's zero steps. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another example. If current is 1, target is 1. Steps is 0. (1-1) mod 4 is 0. Correct. If current is 4, target is 1. Steps is 1. (1-4) = -3. mod 4 is 1. Correct. So yes, the formula is (target - current) % n. But wait, in Python, the modulo operator returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So for example, (-3) %4 is 1. So yes, that's correct. So the steps between current and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, in the first example, when moving from 3 to 2, steps is (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1 (since Xenia starts there). Then, for each task in the list a1, a2, ..., am, compute the steps needed to get from current_pos to ai, add that to the total time, and then set current_pos to ai. But wait, the tasks have to be done in order, and each task must be done after all previous ones. So for the list of tasks, we process them in order. For each task, we calculate the steps from the previous position to the current task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if the tasks are [3,3], then moving from 3 to 3 takes zero steps. So the total time would be zero for that part.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total_time = 0\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\nfor each ai in the list of tasks:\n\n    steps = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but let's test this against the first example.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=4, m=3, tasks [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3. steps = (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2. steps = (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. total_time becomes 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3. steps = (3-2) mod4 = 1. total_time becomes 5+1=6. Which matches the example. Correct.\n\nAnother example given is input ['4 3\\n2 3 3', output is 2. Let's see:\n\nn=4, m=3, tasks [2,3,3].\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: steps (2-1) mod4 = 1. total_time is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: steps (3-2)=1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: steps 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example. Correct.\n\nSo that seems to work. So the approach is to process each task in order, and for each, calculate the steps from current position to the ai, add to total, and update current position.\n\nBut what about when the tasks are in the same house? For example, if the tasks are [1,1,1], then the steps between them are zero. So total time is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward. Read n and m, then read the list of a's. Then process as per the above.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m. The second line has m integers. So in Python, we can read the input as follows.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first example is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nOutput: 6.\n\nSo the code needs to read from stdin. So for Python, perhaps:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces. So splitting on whitespace is okay.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nRead the next line, split into m integers, which is the list a.\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1, total_time as 0.\n\nLoop through each element in a:\n\n   steps = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += steps\n\n   current_pos = ai\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 2? Let's test a case where n=2, m=2, and tasks are [2,1]. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps (2-1) mod2 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 1: steps (1-2) mod2 = -1 mod2 = 1. total is 2. Which is correct. Moving from 2 to 1 takes 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, tasks [1,2]. Steps:\n\nFirst step: 1 to 1: 0. Then 1 to 2: 1. Total is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about when the tasks are empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because in the input, m is given as 1<=m<=1e5. So no problem.\n\nBut in code, we need to read m numbers. So for m=0, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead list a of m elements.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total = 0.\n\nFor each ai in a:\n\n    total += (ai - current) % n\n\n    current = ai\n\nPrint total.\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive value. For example, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So that's handled correctly.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4=3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nFirst ai=2: (2-1) mod4=1. total=1. current=2.\n\nSecond ai=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total=2. current=3.\n\nThird ai=3: (3-3)=0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for these examples.\n\nWhat about when the tasks are in the same house but in sequence? Like [1,1,1]. Then steps are 0,0,0. So total is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. So steps from 1 to 5: (5-1) mod5=4. Then from 5 to 1: (1-5) mod5 = -4 mod5=1. So total is 4+1=5. Which is correct. Because moving from 5 to 1 is 1 step (clockwise).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, reading from stdin can be done with input().split(), but sometimes for large inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin. However, for the given constraints (up to 1e5 elements), using input().split() should be okay.\n\nBut for the case where the second line is m integers, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have multiple lines, but for the problem, the second line is exactly m integers.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next line as list of m integers.\n\nThen process as per the steps.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list a.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive value. For example, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the code is correct.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The code would compute:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: (2-1) mod2 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond num is 1: (1-2) mod2 = -1 mod2 = 1. total is 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=5, m=1, a=[1]. The steps are (1-1) mod5 =0. So total is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, m=1, a=[5]. Steps (5-1) mod5 =4. So total is 4. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she can only start a task after completing all previous tasks. The challenge is to calculate the total time required to move between houses optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving from one house to another clockwise can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. If Xenia needs to move from house `current_pos` to house `target_pos`, the number of steps required is `(target_pos - current_pos) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses. This formula handles both direct and wrap-around movements efficiently.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 as Xenia's initial position.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the steps needed to move from the current house to the target house specified by the task, accumulate the total time, and update the current position to the target house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        diff = (num - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially with large input sizes.\n- **Modulo Arithmetic**: The key part of the solution is using `(num - current) % n` to compute the number of steps needed to move from the current house to the target house. This ensures that both direct and wrap-around movements are handled correctly.\n- **Accumulating Time**: For each task, the calculated steps are added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the target house for subsequent tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
