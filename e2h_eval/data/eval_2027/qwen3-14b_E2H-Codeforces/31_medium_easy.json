Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need the minimal number of such cards.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimal number of cards needed to sum up to T, where each card's value is between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers in that range, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think. For example, if T is 0, then no cards are needed. But if T is non-zero, then we need to find the minimal k such that the sum of k numbers (each between -x and x) equals T.\n\nBut how to find that minimal k?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible sum with k cards. Each card can contribute up to x. So the maximum sum possible with k cards is k * x. Similarly, the minimum sum is -k * x. So for T to be achievable with k cards, it must be that |T| ≤ k * x. But since we want the minimal k, we need to find the smallest k where this holds.\n\nWait, but how? Let's take an example. Suppose T is 3 and x is 2. Then, for k=1: max sum is 2, which is less than 3. So not possible. For k=2: max sum is 4. 3 is less than 4. So possible. So the minimal k is 2. But how to compute this?\n\nSo the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| / x. But wait, because if |T| is divisible by x, then it's exactly |T|/x. Otherwise, it's floor(|T|/x) + 1.\n\nWait, for example, T=3, x=2. |T|=3. 3 divided by 2 is 1.5. Ceiling is 2. Which is correct. Another example: T=4, x=2. 4/2=2, so k=2. Which is correct. If T=5, x=2: 5/2=2.5 → ceiling is 3. So with 3 cards, maximum sum is 6, which can cover 5.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards required is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero. So the steps would be:\n\nCalculate T = -sum of found cards. If T is zero, return 0. Else, compute the minimal k as ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, maybe there's a case where even though |T| is less than or equal to k*x, but you can't get exactly T with k cards. But no, because for example, if you have k cards, each can contribute up to x. So for example, if T is 3, x is 2, and k is 2. The maximum sum is 4. So 3 can be achieved with 2 cards (like 2 + 1). So the minimal k is indeed ceil( |T| / x ). \n\nBut wait, let's think of another example. Suppose T is 1, x is 2. Then |T| is 1. So 1/2 is 0.5, ceiling is 1. So with one card, you can have 1. So yes. So that works.\n\nAnother example: T=5, x=3. |T|=5. 5/3 is ~1.666, so ceiling is 2. With two cards, maximum sum is 6. So 5 can be achieved with 3+2, for example. So yes.\n\nSo the formula is correct. Therefore, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only when T is not zero. If T is zero, then 0.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 0? Then the answer is 0. So the steps are:\n\nCompute the sum of the found cards. Let's call it S. Then T = -S. If T is zero, then answer is 0. Else, compute the minimal k as ceil( |T| / x )\n\nWait, but let's look at the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So |T| is 2. x is 2. So 2/2 is 1 → ceil is 1. Which matches the sample output of 1.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. T is 4. |T| is 4. x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nYes, that works. So the formula seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCalculate the sum of the given numbers. Compute T = -sum. If T is zero, return 0. Otherwise, compute the minimal k as ceil( |T| / x )\n\nBut how to compute ceil in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, for positive numbers, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b - 1) // b.\n\nFor example, 3 / 2 → (3 + 2 -1) // 2 = 4//2=2. Which is correct. 4/2 → (4 + 2-1)//2 = 5//2=2. Which is correct. 5/3 → (5 +3-1)/3 =7//3=2. Correct.\n\nSo for |T| divided by x, the minimal k is (|T| + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut only if T is not zero. So the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_S = sum of the list.\n\nT = -sum_S.\n\nif T == 0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute k = ceil( |T| / x )\n\n   print k.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? For example, if the sum of found cards is already zero. Then the answer is zero.\n\nBut let's test some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1, x=1, and the card is 0. Sum is 0. So answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: n=1, x=1, card is 1. Sum is 1. T is -1. |T| is 1. x is 1. So k is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x=2. T is -3. |T|=3. x=2. 3/2 is 1.5 → ceil is 2. So 2 cards. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read the list of numbers.\n\nsum_S = sum(numbers)\n\nT = -sum_S\n\nif T == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n\n    k = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nBut wait, let me check the second sample input.\n\nSample 2: sum is -4 → T is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1) //3 → (6) //3=2. Correct.\n\nYes. So this seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut what about when T is zero? Like if the sum of the found cards is already zero. Then the answer is zero.\n\nBut what if the sum is zero but T is zero? Well, yes.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: sum is zero. Output is 0.\n\nEdge Case 2: T is zero. Output is 0.\n\nEdge Case 3: T is exactly divisible by x. For example, T=5, x=5 → k=1.\n\nEdge Case 4: T is negative? Well, since we take absolute value, it's handled.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's implement it in Python.\n\nThe input is read from stdin. The first line has two integers n and x. The second line has n integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead the first line as n, x. Then read the second line as list of integers.\n\nCompute sum_S = sum of the list.\n\nT = -sum_S.\n\nif T == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n\n    k = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2 → T=-2. So abs_T is 2. (2 + 2-1) //2 → 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4 → T=4. (4 +3-1) //3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=3 → T=-5. abs_T=5. (5 +3-1)/3 =7//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 3, x=3 → (3 +3-1)//3 =5//3=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x=1 → (1 +1-1)//1=1//1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 4, x=3 → (4 +3-1)/3 =6//3=2. Which is correct (3+1=4, but 3+1 is two cards).\n\nYes, this seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, let's write it.\n\nBut wait, what about when x is 0? Wait, no, the problem says x is at least 1. Because in the input constraints, x is between 1 and 1000. So no division by zero here.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead input lines. For example, the first line is split into n and x. Then the second line is split into the list of numbers.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_S = sum(nums)\nT = -sum_S\nif T == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n    k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nThat's the code. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2. T=-2. So code computes abs_T=2. (2 + 2-1) //2 → 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4 → T=4. (4 +3-1) //3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nYes. So this should work.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, 0 → sum is 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, 1 → sum is 1 → T=-1. abs_T=1. (1 +1-1)//1 =1//1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 2, 3 → sum is 3. T=-3. abs_T=3. (3 +2-1)/2 →4//2=2. Which is correct. Because 2 cards: 2 and 1 (sum 3). Or 2 + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Target Determination**: Determine the target sum needed to balance the found cards to zero. This target is the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the maximum possible value each card can contribute. This formula is based on the ceiling of the absolute value of the target divided by the maximum absolute value on a card (x).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_S = sum(nums)\nT = -sum_S\nif T == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n    k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on a card), followed by a list of integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n3. **Target Determination**: Calculate the target value `T` which is the negative of the sum of the found cards. This target value is what we need to achieve using additional cards.\n4. **Zero Check**: If the target value `T` is zero, it means the sum of the found cards is already zero, so no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For non-zero targets, the minimum number of cards required is determined by the formula `(abs(T) + x - 1) // x`. This formula effectively computes the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target by `x`, ensuring we get the smallest integer number of cards needed to reach the target sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of cards required using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
