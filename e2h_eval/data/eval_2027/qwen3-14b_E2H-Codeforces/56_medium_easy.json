Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between R spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. And since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible matchings?\n\nFirst, the key thing is that for each possible perfect matching (which requires R = B, right?), we need to check if all the line segments between matched pairs don't cross each other.\n\nWait, the first thing to check is whether R equals B. Because a perfect matching requires that each has exactly one. So if R != B, then the answer is immediately No. Oh right, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So R must equal B. So in the input, if R != B, output No.\n\nSo first step: check if R and B are equal. If not, output No.\n\nOtherwise, for each possible permutation of the bases (since each spaceship must be matched to exactly one base), check if the lines between the matched pairs are non-intersecting.\n\nBut how do we check if any two line segments intersect?\n\nSo for a given permutation (matching), we have R line segments. We need to check that none of them intersect each other.\n\nSo for each pair of line segments in the matching, check if they cross. If any pair does, this matching is invalid.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- If R != B: return No.\n\n- Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each spaceship is matched to a base, and each base is matched once). For example, if there are R spaceships and R bases, then there are R! possible matchings.\n\n- For each permutation, check if all line segments between spaceship i and base permutation[i] do not intersect with each other.\n\n- If any permutation satisfies this condition, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nNow, the challenge is to generate all permutations of the bases, check each for non-intersecting line segments.\n\nBut for R=10, 10! is 3.6 million. Wait, but 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking all pairs of line segments. For each permutation, there are R*(R-1)/2 pairs of line segments. For R=10, that's 45 pairs. For each pair, check if the two line segments intersect.\n\nSo total operations would be around 3.6 million * 45 = 163 million operations. But given that R is up to 10, and Python's speed, maybe that's manageable? Let's think: 10^8 operations might take a while, but 10^8 is 100 million. 163 million is about 1.6e8. But perhaps with optimizations, it's okay. But maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since R is small (up to 10), even with 10! permutations, it's manageable. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, the next part is implementing the line segment intersection check.\n\nHow to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect?\n\nWe can use computational geometry techniques. The standard approach is to use the orientation method. The steps are:\n\nTwo segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n1. The orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different. (Which implies that the segments cross each other.)\n\nOR\n\n2. One of the segments' endpoints lies on the other segment. For example, if C is on AB, or D is on AB, etc. But since the problem states that no three points are colinear, this case can't happen. Wait, the note says that it's guaranteed that no three points are on the same line. Therefore, any two points (from the input) are not colinear with any third. So, for any two line segments, their endpoints are not colinear. Therefore, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other in the interior. So we don't have to handle the case where an endpoint lies on another segment.\n\nTherefore, the check for intersection can be done by checking if the two segments straddle each other. So the code for checking whether two segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\nCheck if the orientation of (A,B,C) is different from orientation of (A,B,D), and orientation of (C,D,A) is different from orientation of (C,D,B).\n\nSo the code for orientation is:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 0 if colinear, 1 if clockwise, 2 if counterclockwise\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nThen, the function to check if two segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases (but according to problem statement, these can't happen)\n    # Because no three points are colinear, so if any of the orientations is 0, then the points are colinear.\n    # But since no three points are colinear, then if any of the points is colinear, then it's only for the endpoints.\n\n    # However, since the problem says that no three points are colinear, but the endpoints of the segments could be colinear with another point. Wait, no. For example, if two segments AB and CD, and suppose A is colinear with C and D. But according to the problem's input constraints, no three points are colinear. So if AB is a segment, and CD is another segment, then the points A, B, C, D are all distinct. So if A, C, D are colinear, that would imply that three points are colinear. Which is not allowed. So the problem says that no three points are colinear. Therefore, the orientation of any three points (from the input) can't be zero. So in our code, the orientations o1, o2, o3, o4 can't be zero. Therefore, the code can ignore the special cases where a point lies on a segment. Thus, the only way two segments can intersect is if the general case holds.\n\nWait, but what if two segments share an endpoint? Like AB and BC. Then, the segments AB and BC share point B. But according to the problem statement, no two points coincide. So the endpoints are all unique. So in the problem's input, all points are distinct. So two segments can't share an endpoint. Because for example, if a spaceship is connected to a base, and another spaceship is connected to that same base, but that would be two segments sharing that base's point. However, in the problem's input, the spaceships and bases are all distinct points. So in the matching, each spaceship is matched to exactly one base, and each base is matched to exactly one spaceship. Therefore, the segments are between distinct points, and no two segments share an endpoint. Therefore, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other in their interiors. Therefore, the code can safely check the general case.\n\nTherefore, the function segments_intersect can be written as follows.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of segments. For example, for the permutation [b0, b1, b2], the segments are (s0, b0), (s1, b1), (s2, b2). For each pair of segments (s_i, b_i) and (s_j, b_j), where i < j, check if they intersect. If any pair does, then the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read R spaceships, then B bases.\n\nThen, generate all possible permutations of the B bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships). For example, for R=3, each permutation is a list of 3 bases, which are matched to the 3 spaceships in order.\n\nFor each permutation, check all pairs of segments for intersections. If none found, return Yes.\n\nIf after checking all permutations, none works, return No.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Since the bases are given as a list, say, bases = [ (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ... ].\n\nWe can generate all permutations of the bases, using itertools.permutations(bases, R). But since R equals B, and the length of bases is B, which is R. So permutations(bases, R) is the same as permutations(bases).\n\nBut for example, in the first sample input, the bases are 3 in number. So permutations of the 3 bases.\n\nEach permutation is a possible way to assign each spaceship to a base.\n\nNow, for each permutation, for each pair of indices i and j (i < j), check whether the segment between spaceship i and base permutation[i] intersects with the segment between spaceship j and base permutation[j].\n\nIf any such pair exists, the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut in Python, permutations can be generated via itertools.permutations.\n\nBut the problem is that for R=10, the permutations are 10! = 3.6 million. For each permutation, checking 10*9/2 = 45 pairs. For each pair, checking the four orientations.\n\nBut with R=10, that's 3.6e6 * 45 = 1.6e8 operations. Which might be acceptable in Python, but perhaps we can optimize.\n\nBut given that the constraints are small (R and B up to 10), and that the code is for a programming competition problem, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead R and B. Check if R != B: print No.\n\nElse, read R spaceships (as a list), then read B bases (as a list).\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   create a list of segments: for each i in 0..R-1, the segment between spaceship[i] and permutation[i]\n\n   check for all pairs of segments in this list whether they intersect.\n\n   if none intersect, return Yes.\n\nIf none of the permutations work, return No.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. Also, note that the spaceship and base coordinates are read as integers.\n\nNow, implement the orientation function and the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut wait, the segments are between (spaceship[i], base_permutation[i]) and (spaceship[j], base_permutation[j]).\n\nSo for each pair (i,j), i < j, check if the segment between spaceship[i] and base_permutation[i] intersects with the segment between spaceship[j] and base_permutation[j].\n\nSo for each permutation, we can loop through all i < j and check.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the orientation function.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can write it as a helper function.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps precompute all the points.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # p, q, r are tuples (x, y)\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # a and b are endpoints of first segment, c and d of second\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    # General case\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nThen, for each permutation:\n\nfor perm in permutations(bases):\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(R):\n        for j in range(i+1, R):\n            # check if segment between ships[i] and perm[i] intersects with segment between ships[j] and perm[j]\n            if segments_intersect(spaceships[i], perm[i], spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        exit()\nprint(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the permutations are of the bases. So for each permutation, the perm is a tuple of B elements (since B=R). So for each perm, the i-th element is the base assigned to the i-th spaceship.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, the ships are stored as a list, and the bases as a list. So for example, spaceships is a list of R tuples, bases is a list of B tuples. So when R=B, and we generate permutations of the bases, each permutation is a possible assignment.\n\nNow, the code for reading input.\n\nThe input is given as a single string. Wait, looking at the example input:\n\nThe first example input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the input is read from stdin. Wait, the user provided the example as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nBut that's probably a representation of two test cases. However, the actual input is read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin, which is a single input.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains R and B. Then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nWhich is R=3, B=3, then 3 spaceships, then 3 bases.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nThen read R lines of x and y for spaceships.\n\nThen read B lines of x and y for bases.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Now check all permutations of bases\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # check if segments (spaceships[i], perm[i]) and (spaceships[j], perm[j]) intersect\n                a = spaceships[i]\n                b = perm[i]\n                c = spaceships[j]\n                d = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut then, the functions orientation and segments_intersect need to be defined.\n\nSo integrating into the code:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 0, 1, 2\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the note says that no three points are colinear. Therefore, the orientation function will never return 0. So the code can assume that o1, o2, o3, o4 are not zero. However, the code still includes that check. But in practice, the problem's input ensures that no three points are colinear, so the code can ignore that.\n\nBut the code is correct regardless.\n\nBut wait, in the code for segments_intersect, the function returns True only if the orientations are different. However, the code may have some edge cases. For example, when one segment is entirely inside another, but since the problem says that no three points are colinear, this can't happen. Because if two segments are overlapping, then they would have colinear points. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, then two segments can't be colinear. Therefore, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other, which is handled by the code.\n\nBut the code for segments_intersect is correct?\n\nYes, according to the standard computational geometry approach.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nSo spaceships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nOne possible permutation is the same order. So the matching is:\n\nspaceship 0 -> base 0 (-2,1)\n\nspaceship 1 -> base 1 (0,3)\n\nspaceship 2 -> base 2 (2,2)\n\nCheck for intersections between the three segments.\n\nSegments:\n\n(0,0)-(-2,1), (2,0)-(0,3), (3,1)-(2,2).\n\nCheck if any two of them intersect.\n\nLet me visualize:\n\nFirst segment from (0,0) to (-2,1): this is a line going up and left.\n\nSecond segment from (2,0) to (0,3): this is a line going up and left.\n\nDo these two cross? Let's compute their equations.\n\nFirst line: from (0,0) to (-2,1). The slope is (1-0)/(-2-0) = -1/2. Equation: y = -1/2 x.\n\nSecond line: from (2,0) to (0,3). Slope is (3-0)/(0-2) = -3/2. Equation: y = -3/2 (x - 2) → y = -3/2 x + 3.\n\nFind if they intersect. Solve:\n\n-1/2 x = -3/2 x + 3 → (x) = 3 → x=3? Wait, substituting:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n- x = -3x + 6 → 2x = 6 → x=3. Then y = -1/2 *3 = -1.5.\n\nBut the first segment is from (0,0) to (-2,1), which is between x=-2 and x=0. The solution x=3 is outside of that. So the two segments do not cross.\n\nSo the two segments do not intersect. Similarly, other pairs.\n\nSo this permutation is valid. Hence, the code would return Yes.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nWait, the input is R=2, B=1. So R != B, output No. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: for R=2, B=2, and the spaceships and bases arranged in such a way that there's no possible matching. For example, if the two spaceships are (0,0) and (0,1), and the bases are (1,0) and (1,1). Then, the two possible permutations are:\n\nperm1: [(1,0), (1,1)] → segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1). These are parallel lines, no intersection. So valid. So output is Yes. But if the bases are arranged in such a way that any permutation would have crossing lines.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases.\n\nNow, the code should handle that.\n\nBut what about the code's performance? For R=10, it's 10! permutations. But 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking 45 pairs. Each pair requires 4 orientation checks. But in Python, perhaps this is manageable. However, for the worst case, it's possible that the code might take a while. However, given that R and B are up to 10, and that the problem is labeled as easy, perhaps this approach is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the line between the spaceship and base doesn't cross any other edges. But since the matching must be such that all edges are non-crossing, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding a non-crossing matching. However, the approach of trying all possible permutations is feasible for small R and B.\n\nAnother possible optimization: since the order of checking permutations can be early-exit. For example, once a valid permutation is found, return immediately.\n\nSo the code as written is correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the permutations function returns tuples of the elements. Since the bases are stored as a list of tuples, the permutations are generated correctly.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, note that in the code, the 'permutations' function may generate the same permutation multiple times if there are duplicate points. But according to the problem statement, all points are distinct. So the bases are all distinct, so permutations are unique.\n\nBut the code is correct regardless.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut in the code, the 'segments_intersect' function may be called multiple times. However, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut what about the case where R = B = 1? Then, there is exactly one matching. Since there are no pairs of segments, the code returns 'Yes'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: R = B = 2. Suppose the spaceships are (0,0), (0,1), and bases are (1,0), (1,1). The two possible permutations are:\n\nperm1: [(1,0), (1,1)] → segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1). These are parallel, no intersection. So valid.\n\nperm2: [(1,1), (1,0)] → segments (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0). These two segments cross each other. So the code would check for that. For i=0, j=1, check if segments (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0) intersect. The orientation calculations would find that they cross. So this permutation is invalid. But the first permutation is valid, so the code returns Yes.\n\nThus, the code would output 'Yes'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut note that in the code, the 'permutations' function is imported from itertools. Also, the code must read from stdin, and output to stdout.\n\nNow, the full code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Check all permutations of bases\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                # Check if segments between spaceships[i] and perm[i], and spaceships[j] and perm[j] intersect\n                if segments_intersect(spaceships[i], perm[i], spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the code may have a problem with the permutations. For example, in the first sample input, the bases are read as [(-2, 1), (0,3), (2,2)], and permutations are generated. The code checks each permutation. For the first permutation, which is the same as the original order, it returns yes.\n\nBut the code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nThe code will generate permutations of the bases. One of them is [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nIn that case, the code checks for all pairs of segments. For i=0, j=1: the segments (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3). As discussed earlier, they do not cross. Similarly for other pairs.\n\nSo the code returns Yes.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 1\n1 0\n2 2\n3 1\n\nHere, R=2, B=1. So R != B. Output is No.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2, spaceships at (0,0), (0,1), bases at (1,0), (1,1). The code would generate two permutations. The first is [(1,0), (1,1)] which is valid. So output is Yes.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2, spaceships at (0,0), (2,2), bases at (1,1), (3,3). Then, any permutation would have the segments (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(3,3) which are colinear, but according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. But in this case, the problem's input is invalid. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have no three points colinear. So the code can assume that the input is correct. So in this case, the code would generate permutations. For example, the first permutation is [(1,1), (3,3)]. The two segments are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(3,3). Are they considered as intersecting? Well, the code would check for segments_intersect. Let's see:\n\na = (0,0), b = (1,1), c = (2,2), d = (3,3).\n\norientation(a, b, c) is ( (1-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) )? Wait:\n\nWait, orientation(p, q, r) is calculated as (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x).\n\nFor p = (0,0), q = (1,1), r = (2,2):\n\n(q.x - p.x) = 1, (r.y - p.y) = 2. (q.y - p.y) = 1, (r.x - p.x) = 2. So val is 1*2 - 1*2 = 0. But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So this input is invalid. But the code would receive such input? According to the problem statement, no. So the code can assume that the input is valid, and thus no such case will exist.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base, with the constraint that no two connecting paths (segments) intersect in the 2D plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If not, output \"No\" immediately since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: If R equals B, generate all permutations of the bases. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of bases to spaceships.\n3. **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation, check if any pair of segments (connecting a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. This is done using computational geometry techniques to determine if two line segments intersect.\n4. **Early Exit**: If any valid permutation is found where no segments intersect, output \"Yes\". If no valid permutation is found after checking all possibilities, output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        spaceships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                if segments_intersect(spaceships[i], perm[i], spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Orientation Check**: The `orientation` function determines the orientation of three points (clockwise, counterclockwise, or colinear) using the cross product.\n- **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the orientation check to determine if two line segments intersect by checking if their orientations straddle each other.\n- **Permutations and Validation**: The main function reads input, checks for immediate impossibility (R ≠ B), generates permutations of bases, and validates each permutation by checking for intersecting segments. If a valid permutation is found, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible assignments are checked efficiently given the constraints (R, B ≤ 10), leveraging permutations and computational geometry to validate each potential assignment.",
