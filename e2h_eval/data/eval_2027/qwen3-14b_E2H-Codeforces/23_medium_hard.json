In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and I have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements. The initial hand has three tiles. After drawing some tiles (possibly zero), she must have at least one mentsu. The question is to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nLet me think about all possible cases.\n\nCase 1: The initial three tiles already form a mentsu. Then the answer is 0. For example, if they are all same (triplet) or form a sequence.\n\nCase 2: Not, but by adding one tile, she can form a mentsu. Like in the third example where adding one tile (like 1p or 4p) gives a triplet or sequence.\n\nCase 3: Need to add two tiles. Or maybe even three?\n\nBut what's the maximum possible? Let's think.\n\nThe worst case is when the initial tiles are all different and not forming any sequence. For example, suppose the three tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a triplet, she needs to get two more of any tile. But maybe there's a way to form a sequence with adding two tiles. Wait, for example, if she has 1m, 2m, 3m, then no need to add. But if she has 1m, 2m, 4m, then adding 3m would make a sequence. So that's one tile. So the minimal steps would depend on how close the existing tiles are to forming a triplet or sequence.\n\nSo the approach is: check all possibilities of possible mentsu that can be formed by adding some tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how do I model this?\n\nFirst, for the given three tiles, I need to check:\n\n- Are there any existing mentsu? If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then check for possibilities of adding 1 tile, then 2, etc., until I find the minimal steps.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the minimal steps, perhaps we can check for all possible scenarios that can be achieved with 0, 1, 2, ... tiles added.\n\nBut how to check if adding some tiles can form a mentsu.\n\nBut considering that the initial hand is three tiles. Let's think about the possibilities for each case.\n\nFor example, for the triplet case:\n\nIf the current tiles have three of the same, then it's already a triplet. Otherwise, to form a triplet, she needs to collect three of the same. So for example, if she has two of a tile, she needs one more. If she has one, she needs two more. If she has none, she needs three.\n\nBut perhaps there are multiple ways to form a triplet. For example, if the initial tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s, then to form a triplet, she needs to add two more of any of these. But maybe it's better to pick the one that requires the least steps. However, in this case, she can't form a triplet unless she adds two more of the same tile. So for example, if she adds two 1m's, then she has three 1m's.\n\nBut for the problem, the minimal steps is the minimal between all possible options.\n\nSimilarly for sequences. For example, the initial tiles could be 1m, 2m, 4m. Then adding 3m would form a sequence. So that's one tile.\n\nBut how to check all possible ways of forming a triplet or sequence with the initial tiles plus some added tiles.\n\nBut since the initial tiles are three, and adding tiles, the total number of tiles after adding can be 3 + k, where k is the number of tiles added.\n\nBut for a mentsu, the total number of tiles must be at least three. But since the initial is three, adding zero tiles is allowed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCheck if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if it's possible to form a mentsu by adding 1 tile. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, check if possible with adding 2 tiles. Return 2.\n\nElse, check for 3 tiles. But wait, what's the maximum possible steps needed?\n\nLet's think. Suppose the initial tiles are such that you can't form any triplet or sequence even after adding 2 tiles. How?\n\nFor example, suppose the initial tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. To form a triplet, you need to add two more of the same tile. For example, adding two 1m's would give three 1m's. So that would require adding two tiles. But in that case, the answer would be 2. But maybe there's another way to form a sequence. For example, adding two tiles to form a sequence. But that's impossible. Because for a sequence, you need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for example, if you have 1m, 2p, 3s, then adding 2m and 3m would allow a sequence of 1m, 2m, 3m. But that's adding two tiles. So that's possible. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo in this case, the answer would be 2.\n\nBut what about if the initial three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4p. Then, to form a sequence, you need to add 3m. Then you have 1m, 2m, 3m. So that's one tile. So answer is 1.\n\nSo the maximum number of tiles needed is 2? Or maybe 3?\n\nWait, let's think of a scenario where even after adding two tiles, there is no mentsu. Is that possible?\n\nSuppose the initial tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Then, to form a sequence, you need to add 2m and 4m (so two tiles) to form a sequence of 1,2,3,4,5. But that's not enough. Wait, a sequence is three consecutive. So for example, adding 2m and 4m would allow sequences like 1,2,3 (needs 3m, which is already present) — but 1m, 2m, 3m is a sequence. So with adding 2m, then the tiles would be 1m, 3m, 5m, 2m. Then, there's 1m, 2m, 3m. So that's a sequence. So adding one tile (2m) would suffice. So the answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: initial tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Adding 3m would form a sequence. So 1 tile.\n\nAnother example: initial tiles are 1m, 2m, 5m. To form a sequence, you need to add 3m and 4m. Then you have 1,2,3,4,5. So you can have 1,2,3 or 2,3,4 or 3,4,5. So adding two tiles. So answer is 2.\n\nSo in that case, the answer is 2.\n\nWhat about if the initial tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Then, adding two tiles (say 2m and 4m) allows a sequence of 1,2,3 or 3,4,5. So answer is 2.\n\nBut what if the initial tiles are 1m, 2m, 3m. Then answer is 0.\n\nSo, in general, the minimal steps required can be 0, 1, 2, or possibly higher?\n\nIs there a case where you need to add three tiles?\n\nLet's think. Suppose the initial tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Now, to form a triplet, you need to add two more of any tile. For example, adding two 1m's. Then you have three 1m's. So that's two tiles. But what if there's no way to form a triplet or sequence with adding two tiles?\n\nWait, for example, if the initial tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, adding two tiles: say, 1m and 1p. Then you have 1m, 1m, 1p, 2p, 3s. No triplet. But if you add 1m and 2m, then you can have 1m, 2m, and 3m (but you need to have a third tile). Wait, the initial tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. If you add 2m and 3m, then you have 1m, 2m, 3m. That's a sequence. So that's adding two tiles. So answer is 2.\n\nSo even in that case, the answer is 2.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum number of tiles needed is 2. Because, in any case, adding two tiles can allow forming a triplet or sequence.\n\nWait, but what if the initial tiles are all different suits and numbers. Let's say 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add two more of the same tile. For example, adding two 1m's. So you have three 1m's. So that's two tiles. So answer is 2.\n\nAlternatively, to form a sequence, you need to add two tiles. For example, add 2m and 3m. Then you have 1m, 2m, 3m. So that's two tiles.\n\nSo in any case, the answer is 2.\n\nSo the maximum possible answer is 2.\n\nWait, but what if the initial three tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add two more of the same tile. For example, adding two 1m's would make three 1m's. So that's two tiles. But perhaps there's a way to form a sequence. But since all three are different suits, you can't form a sequence. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo in this case, the answer is 2.\n\nSo the minimal steps can be 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, the algorithm should check for 0, then 1, then 2.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\nFirst, check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu. If yes, return 1.\n\nIf not, check if adding two tiles can form a mentsu. Return 2.\n\nBut how to check these possibilities.\n\nNow, the problem is how to check whether the initial tiles can form a mentsu, and how to check for possibilities after adding tiles.\n\nLet me first think about how to check if the initial three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nFor the initial three tiles:\n\nCheck if they are a triplet (all same tile) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in same suit).\n\nSo, for triplet: all three tiles are same.\n\nFor sequence: same suit, and numbers are consecutive.\n\nFor example, 1s, 2s, 3s is a sequence. Also, 3s, 2s, 1s is also a sequence. So order doesn't matter.\n\nSo, for the initial check, I can process the three tiles and see if they form a triplet or sequence.\n\nSo, for the first part, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, if that is not the case, then we need to check for possibilities with adding 1 or 2 tiles.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the collection can form a mentsu.\n\nLet me think about the possible ways to form a mentsu after adding tiles.\n\nFor example, when adding one tile:\n\nThe total tiles will be four. But a mentsu requires three tiles. So, among those four tiles, there must be a subset of three that forms a mentsu.\n\nSo, when considering adding one tile, the idea is that after adding, there exists a triplet or sequence in the four tiles.\n\nSimilarly, for adding two tiles, the total tiles are five. There must be a subset of three that forms a mentsu.\n\nBut how to check this efficiently?\n\nBut given that the initial tiles are three, and adding up to two tiles, the possibilities are manageable.\n\nBut for the problem, perhaps there's a smarter way than checking all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about the possible ways to form a triplet or sequence with the initial tiles plus some added tiles.\n\nCase 1: Forming a triplet.\n\nWe can consider all possible triplets that can be formed by adding some tiles. For example, if the initial tiles have two of a certain tile, then adding one more makes a triplet. If they have one, then adding two. If they have none, then adding three.\n\nBut since we want the minimal steps, perhaps the best approach is to check for each possible tile type (like, for all possible tile types in the game) how many of them are present in the initial tiles, and compute the required steps to form a triplet of that tile.\n\nFor example, for a tile X, if the initial count is 0, then need 3. If 1, need 2. If 2, need 1. If 3, already a triplet.\n\nThen, the minimal steps for forming a triplet is the minimum over all possible tile types of (3 - count) if count < 3.\n\nBut note that the initial three tiles may not have any of the same tile. For example, if the initial tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, for each tile type, count is 1. So the minimal steps for triplet is 2 (since 3 - 1 = 2). So adding two tiles of the same type (e.g., 1m and 1m) gives a triplet.\n\nBut in this case, the minimal steps would be 2. However, maybe there is a way to form a sequence with fewer steps. So, for the overall problem, the minimal steps is the minimum between the steps needed for triplet and the steps needed for sequence.\n\nSo, for each possible case, we need to check both possibilities: forming a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences.\n\nFor sequences, the approach is to check if there's a way to form a sequence by adding some tiles.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think about the initial three tiles. For sequences, they must be in the same suit. So, for each suit, we can collect the numbers of the tiles in that suit.\n\nFor example, if the initial tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s → already a sequence. If they are 1s, 2s, 4s → then adding 3s would form a sequence. So steps is 1.\n\nBut if the initial tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s → then adding 2s and 4s would form a sequence (e.g., 1,2,3) or (3,4,5). So steps is 2.\n\nAlternatively, adding 2s and 3s would allow 1,2,3 (if you have 3s already?), but initial tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s. So adding 2s gives you 1s, 2s, 3s. So steps is 1. Oh right! Because adding 2s gives you three tiles (1s, 2s, 3s) in the same suit. So that's a sequence. So steps is 1.\n\nWait, in this case, the initial tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s. So adding 2s would make the tiles 1s, 3s, 5s, 2s. Then, the subset {1s, 2s, 3s} is a sequence. So yes, steps is 1.\n\nSo, the approach for sequences is to look for possible sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFor sequences, the idea is to check for each possible suit, and for that suit, collect the numbers present in the initial tiles, and determine what's the minimal number of tiles to add to form a consecutive triplet.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's take the example of a suit. Suppose in the initial tiles, there are some numbers in that suit. Let's say, for example, the numbers are [1, 3, 5]. How can we form a sequence?\n\nWe can look for sequences of three consecutive numbers. For example, 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, etc.\n\nTo form a sequence, we need to have three consecutive numbers. For example, for the numbers [1, 3, 5], to form 1-2-3, we need to add 2. Then, the numbers would be 1, 2, 3. So steps is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-4-5, we need to add 4. Steps is 1. So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo, for a given suit, we can check all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers and see what's the minimal steps required to cover that sequence.\n\nSo, for each suit, collect the numbers present in the initial tiles. Then, for each possible triplet of consecutive numbers (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9), check how many of the numbers are already present. The steps required would be 3 minus the count of numbers present in that triplet.\n\nFor example, for the triplet 1-2-3, if the initial numbers have 1 and 3, then steps needed is 1 (need to add 2). If the initial numbers have 1, then steps is 2 (add 2 and 3).\n\nSo, for each possible consecutive triplet in the suit, compute the required steps, and take the minimum.\n\nBut the problem is that the initial tiles may have multiple numbers in the same suit. For example, if the initial tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then, for the triplet 1-2-3, need to add 3. For the triplet 2-3-4, need to add 3. For the triplet 3-4-5, need to add 3 and 4. So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo, for each suit, we can generate all possible consecutive triplets and compute the minimal steps required to form that triplet.\n\nThen, the overall minimal steps for sequences is the minimum across all suits and all possible triplets in that suit.\n\nOnce we have the minimal steps for forming a triplet (from the triplet case) and the minimal steps for forming a sequence (from the sequence case), then the overall minimal steps is the minimum between these two.\n\nBut how to combine this with the possibility of adding multiple tiles.\n\nWait, but for the case of adding one tile, perhaps the minimal steps for the sequence is 1, and for the triplet is 2, so the answer is 1.\n\nBut how do I compute this?\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the current problem, after checking if the initial three tiles form a mentsu (return 0), else:\n\nCompute the minimal steps required to form a triplet (call it min_triplet_steps) and the minimal steps required to form a sequence (call it min_sequence_steps). Then, the answer is the minimum between min_triplet_steps and min_sequence_steps.\n\nBut how to compute min_triplet_steps and min_sequence_steps?\n\nFor min_triplet_steps:\n\nWe can count the frequency of each tile in the initial three tiles. For each possible tile (like 1m, 2m, etc.), compute how many are present. For example, if a tile is present two times, then we need one more. For each such tile, the steps required is 3 - count. The minimal of these values is the min_triplet_steps.\n\nBut note that the initial three tiles may not have any duplicates. For example, if all are different. Then, for any tile, the count is 1. So steps required is 2 (3-1=2). So the minimal steps for triplet is 2.\n\nFor min_sequence_steps:\n\nFor each suit (m, p, s), collect all numbers present in the initial tiles. Then, for each possible consecutive triplet (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, etc.), compute how many numbers are already present in the initial tiles. The steps required is 3 - count. Take the minimum across all possible triplets in all suits.\n\nBut for example, if the initial tiles have numbers 1s, 3s, 5s. Then, for suit 's', the numbers are [1,3,5]. For triplet 1-2-3, the count is 2 (1 and 3 present). Steps needed: 1. For triplet 3-4-5, count is 2 (3 and 5 present). Steps needed: 1. For triplet 2-3-4, count is 1 (3). Steps needed: 2. So the minimal steps for the suit 's' is 1. So the overall min_sequence_steps would be 1.\n\nSo, combining these two, the answer would be the minimum between min_triplet_steps and min_sequence_steps.\n\nBut then, what if the min_sequence_steps is 1 and min_triplet_steps is 2? Then the answer is 1.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nIf the initial three tiles form a mentsu → 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute min_triplet_steps (the minimal steps to form a triplet) and min_sequence_steps (the minimal steps to form a sequence). The answer is the minimum between them.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where adding more than one tile allows for a mentsu that is not covered by this approach?\n\nFor example, suppose the initial tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. So, the min_sequence_steps would be 1 (adding 3m). The min_triplet_steps is 2 (for example, adding two 1m's). So the answer is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: initial tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, min_sequence_steps would be 2 (for example, adding 2m and 3m to form 1,2,3 in m suit). Or, for each suit, check. For suit m: numbers are [1]. So for possible triplets in m suit: 1-2-3. We have 1, need to add 2 and 3 → steps 2. For suit p: numbers [2], triplet 2-3-4 → steps 2. For suit s: numbers [3], triplet 1-2-3 → steps 2. So min_sequence_steps is 2. The min_triplet_steps is 2 (as explained earlier). So the answer is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there's a scenario where adding two tiles allows forming a triplet and a sequence, but the minimal steps is 2?\n\nBut according to this approach, the answer would be min(2, 2) = 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo, this approach seems correct.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, parse the input. The input is three strings. For example, in the sample input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut the input is given as a single line with three strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSo, the input is three strings, separated by spaces. For example, in the sample input, the first example is '1s 2s 3s' — but that's three tiles, but the input is three strings. Wait, no. Wait, the input is three strings. For example, in the sample input, the first input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] — but that's three entries. Wait, no, the actual input is three strings. Like, for example, the first input line is \"1s 2s 3s\" — meaning three tiles. But the problem says that the input is three strings. Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nThe input says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Wait, the input is three strings. Each string represents a tile. For example, if the input is \"1s 2s 3s\", that's three strings (each being \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\")? Or is the input a list of three strings, each being the three tiles?\n\nNo, the input is three strings. For example, the sample input shows:\n\nIn the first example, the input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] — but that's three entries. Wait, but the input is a single line. So perhaps the actual input is three strings, each representing a tile. So for example, the first example's input is \"1s 2s 3s\" — but that would be three tiles. But the problem says that the input is three strings. So perhaps the input is three tiles, each given as a string, separated by spaces. For example, the input is a single line with three strings, each being the tile. So for example, the input for the first sample is \"1s 2s 3s\" — but that's three strings. Wait, but that would be a single line with three strings, separated by spaces. So, the input is three strings. So, in code, the input is read as a list of three strings.\n\nSo, in Python, the input can be read as:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nWhich would split the input line into three elements. For example, for the first sample input, the input line is \"1s 2s 3s\", and tiles would be [\"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\"].\n\nSo, the code starts by reading the three tiles.\n\nOnce the three tiles are read, the code needs to check whether they form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, compute min_triplet_steps and min_sequence_steps, and output the minimum between them.\n\nSo, first, the code needs to check if the initial three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nFunction to check if the three tiles form a mentsu:\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check if triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check if sequence\n\n    # all same suit?\n\n    suit = tiles[0][1]\n\n    if tiles[1][1] != suit or tiles[2][1] != suit:\n\n        return False\n\n    # now, check numbers are consecutive.\n\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n\n    return nums[1] == nums[0]+1 and nums[2] == nums[1]+1\n\nYes. So, for example, the first sample input has tiles 1s, 2s, 3s. All same suit, sorted numbers are [1,2,3], which is consecutive. So returns True.\n\nThe second sample input is three 9m's. So triplet, returns True.\n\nThird sample input: 3p, 9m, 2p. The suits are p, m, p. Not same. So no sequence. Triplet? No. So returns False.\n\nSo, the code first checks if the initial tiles form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, compute min_triplet_steps.\n\nTo compute min_triplet_steps, we can count the frequency of each tile in the initial three.\n\nFor example, for the initial tiles, create a frequency dictionary. For each tile, count how many times it appears.\n\nThen, for each possible tile (like all possible 1m, 2m, ... 9m, etc.), compute how many are present. For each tile, the steps needed to form a triplet is 3 - count. But since the initial tiles may not have that tile, the count is zero. So for example, for a tile not present, steps needed is 3.\n\nBut since we can choose any tile, the minimal steps for triplet is the minimum of (3 - count) for all possible tiles.\n\nBut since the initial tiles have three tiles, the possible counts for any tile can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut in practice, for the initial three tiles, for each tile type (like 1m), the count is how many times it appears in the initial three.\n\nSo, for example, if the initial tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s, then for each tile, the count is 1. So steps for triplet would be 3 - 1 = 2 for each. So the minimal is 2.\n\nBut if the initial tiles are 1s, 1s, 2s. Then, for tile 1s, count is 2 → steps 1. For tile 2s, count is 1 → steps 2. For others, steps 3. So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nThus, the code can compute this as follows:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ncounts = defaultdict(int)\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    counts[t] += 1\n\nmin_triplet = min( (3 - v) for v in counts.values() )\n\nBut wait, no. Because for example, if there is a tile that is not present in the initial three, its count is zero. But the code above only considers the counts of the existing tiles. So, for example, if the initial tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s, then counts has keys 1s, 2s, 3s, each with value 1. The code would compute 3-1=2 for each. But the minimal steps is 2, which is correct. However, there's another option: choosing a tile that is not present. For example, 4m. Its count is 0. So steps is 3 - 0 = 3. Which is worse than 2. So the code is correct in taking the min of (3 - v) for existing counts. But what about other tiles not present in the initial three? Well, their (3 - v) is 3, which is worse than the existing ones. So the code would compute the minimal steps as the minimum between existing (3 - v) and 3.\n\nBut in this case, the code would not consider the 3. Because the existing counts have 1, 1, 1. So the min is 2. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but the code as written would take the min over the existing counts. But what if there's a tile not present, but adding three of them would require 3 steps. But the existing counts may have some with 3 - v being 2. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the counts.values() includes all the existing tiles. So, for example, if the initial three are 1s, 1s, 1s. Then counts.values() is [3]. So 3 - 3 = 0. So min_triplet_steps is 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the initial three are 1s, 1s, 2s. Then, counts.values() are 2 (for 1s) and 1 (for 2s). So the min(3 - 2, 3 - 1) = min(1, 2) = 1. Which is correct. So the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code for min_triplet_steps is:\n\ncounts = defaultdict(int)\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    counts[t] += 1\n\nmin_triplet = min( [3 - v for v in counts.values()] )\n\nBut wait, if the counts.values() is empty? No, because there are three tiles. So counts.values() has at least three entries.\n\nBut in code, the counts would have entries for each of the three tiles. For example, if all three are different, counts.values() would have three 1s.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut then, the code for min_triplet_steps is min_triplet = min( [3 - v for v in counts.values()] )\n\nBut in this case, the minimal steps to form a triplet is min_triplet. Because for example, if there's a tile that has count 2, then adding 1 tile gives a triplet.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, for min_sequence_steps.\n\nTo compute this, for each suit, collect the numbers present in the initial tiles for that suit.\n\nFor example, for each suit in m, p, s:\n\nCollect the numbers of the tiles in that suit.\n\nFor example, if the initial tiles are 1s, 2p, 3s, then for suit 's', the numbers are [1, 3], for 'p' [2], and for 'm' empty.\n\nThen, for each suit, generate all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers, and compute how many numbers are already present in the initial tiles for that suit. The steps required is 3 - count.\n\nThe minimal steps for the suit is the minimum over all possible sequences in that suit. Then, the overall min_sequence_steps is the minimum over all suits.\n\nSo, for each suit, process as follows:\n\nsuit_tiles = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles if t[1] == suit_char]\n\nThen, for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers in 1-9:\n\nfor i in range(1, 8):\n\n    seq = [i, i+1, i+2]\n\n    count = number of elements in suit_tiles that are in seq.\n\n    steps = 3 - count.\n\n    track the minimum steps for this suit.\n\nSo, for example, if suit_tiles is [1, 3, 5], then for i=1, the sequence is [1,2,3]. The count is 2 (1 and 3). Steps is 1. For i=2: [2,3,4] → count is 1 (3). Steps is 2. For i=3: [3,4,5] → count is 2 (3,5). Steps is 1. For i=4: [4,5,6] → count is 1 (5). Steps is 2. etc. So the minimal steps for this suit is 1.\n\nSo, the code for min_sequence_steps is:\n\nmin_sequence = infinity\n\nfor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    numbers_in_suit = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles if t[1] == suit]\n\n    # generate all possible sequences for this suit\n\n    for i in range(1, 8):\n\n        seq = [i, i+1, i+2]\n\n        # count how many numbers in numbers_in_suit are in seq\n\n        cnt = 0\n\n        for num in numbers_in_suit:\n\n            if num in seq:\n\n                cnt += 1\n\n        steps_needed = 3 - cnt\n\n        if steps_needed < min_sequence:\n\n            min_sequence = steps_needed\n\nSo, after checking all suits and all sequences, the min_sequence is the minimal steps for forming a sequence.\n\nBut then, what if there are no numbers in a suit? For example, for suit 'm', the numbers_in_suit is empty. Then, for any sequence, the cnt is 0. steps_needed is 3. Which is not helpful. So, the code would ignore that.\n\nSo, the code for min_sequence_steps would be:\n\nInitialize min_sequence to something like a very large value (like 10^9). Then, for each suit, process as above. Then, the overall min_sequence is the minimum between all possibilities.\n\nBut what if there are no possible sequences for any suit? For example, the initial tiles are in different suits. Then, for each suit, numbers_in_suit may have 1 element. For example, if the initial tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, for each suit, numbers_in_suit is [1], [2], [3]. For each of these suits, the possible sequences would be:\n\nFor suit m: possible sequences are 1-2-3. The count is 1. steps_needed is 2.\n\nSame for other suits. So min_sequence is 2.\n\nSo, the code would compute min_sequence as 2.\n\nSo, combining this with the triplet steps, the answer would be min(2, 2) = 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code for min_sequence_steps is as described.\n\nOnce we have min_triplet and min_sequence, the answer is min(min_triplet, min_sequence).\n\nBut wait, what if the min_sequence is 1 and min_triplet is 2. Then the answer is 1.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute min_triplet_steps.\n\nCompute min_sequence_steps.\n\nThe answer is the minimum between min_triplet_steps and min_sequence_steps.\n\nBut wait, there's a case where adding two tiles",
