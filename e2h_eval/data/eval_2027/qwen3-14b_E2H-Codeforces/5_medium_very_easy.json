Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to pair left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The colors can be letters or question marks, which are wildcards. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs and output them.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to think about how to pair them optimally. Let's think about the approach.\n\nThe key here is that each left boot can be paired with a right boot if their colors are compatible. For example, if a left boot is 'a' and the right is 'a', or if one is '?', then they can be paired.\n\nBut since each boot can be used only once, we need to find a way to maximize the pairs. How?\n\nLet me think about possible steps:\n\nFirst, maybe we can process the pairs where both are specific colors. For example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a', they can be paired. But if there are multiple such pairs, we need to match them.\n\nBut then, there are the question marks. They can act as wildcards. So, perhaps we can first match the specific colors, and then use the question marks to cover the remaining ones.\n\nWait, but how to do that optimally? Because maybe using a question mark to pair with a specific color is better than leaving it for another scenario.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\nWe can first try to pair left and right boots that have the same specific color. For example, for each color c (not '?'), count how many left boots have c, and how many right boots have c. The minimum of these two counts would be the number of pairs we can make for that color. Then, subtract those from the counts of left and right boots.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (which may include question marks), we can pair them by using the question marks. For example, any left '?' can be paired with any right boot (including '?') and vice versa. However, we need to make sure that we don't pair the same boots again.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n1. For each color c (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots with color c (call it left_counts[c]) and the number of right boots with color c (right_counts[c]). The number of pairs for this color is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). We can pair these directly.\n\n2. After handling all specific colors, we have some left and right boots left. These are either '?' or colors that didn't have matching counterparts. Now, the remaining left and right boots can be paired using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally? Because each '?' can be matched with any other boot (either a specific color or another '?'). However, since the '?' can be used as either, perhaps we can pair the remaining left and right boots as follows:\n\n- The number of left '?'s (left_q) and right '?'s (right_q). The maximum possible pairs here is the minimum of left_q + remaining_left_non_q and right_q + remaining_right_non_q? No, not sure.\n\nWait, after the first step, the remaining left boots are those that couldn't be paired with a specific color. For example, if a left boot is 'a' but there were no right 'a's, then it's left in the remaining. Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut now, any left boot (whether it's a specific color or '?') can be paired with any right boot (specific or '?') as long as they are compatible. However, the specific colors that remain are those where there was a mismatch in the first step. For example, if there were 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, then after pairing 2, there's 1 left 'a' left.\n\nSo, for the second step, we can pair the remaining left and right boots. But how?\n\nLet me think: For the remaining left boots, they can be either specific colors (that couldn't be matched in the first step) or '?'. Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut for the second step, the best way to pair them is to pair the left '?'s with the right non-'?'s (if possible), and then pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to pair the left '?' with right '?' first, but that might not be optimal. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs possible in the second step is the minimum between the total number of remaining left boots and the total number of remaining right boots. But how to actually pair them?\n\nBut how to compute that? Let's think:\n\nAfter the first step, suppose we have:\n\n- left_remaining: list of left boots that are not yet paired. These could be specific colors or '?'\n- right_remaining: list of right boots that are not yet paired. Same.\n\nNow, we need to pair each left_remaining with a right_remaining such that their colors are compatible.\n\nBut how to do that optimally. For example, if there are left boots with color 'a' and right boots with color 'b', they can't be paired. But if there's a left 'a' and a right '?', they can be paired.\n\nSo, the idea is to pair all possible combinations where either one is '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to:\n\n- First, pair all the left '?' with right non-? boots that are not already paired. Then, pair the remaining left '?' with right '?'.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to model it:\n\nWe can collect all the left boots that are not yet paired, and all the right boots that are not yet paired.\n\nThen, for each left boot in left_remaining, we can check if there's a right boot in right_remaining that can be paired with it. But since the order of pairing affects the result, how to choose which ones to pair?\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid pairing as long as it's maximum, perhaps we can proceed greedily.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\nAfter the first step (pairing same colors), collect:\n\n- left_left: list of left boots that are not yet paired (could be any color)\n- right_right: list of right boots that are not yet paired (could be any color)\n\nNow, for the second step, we can:\n\n1. For each left boot in left_left, check if there's a right boot in right_right that can be paired with it. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nBut considering that the number of left and right boots can be up to 150,000, we need an efficient way.\n\nAn alternative idea is to count the number of left and right boots with specific colors, and then pair the ones that can be matched.\n\nBut perhaps, the following steps:\n\nFor the second part:\n\nWe can first pair the left '?' with the right non-? boots. For example, for each right boot that is not '?', if there's a left '?' that hasn't been paired yet, pair them. Then, for the remaining right non-? boots (which can't be paired with any left boots, because the left boots have already been paired with their own '?'), and the left non-? boots, but since they are not compatible with the right non-? boots (since they were not paired in the first step), but wait, no. Because in the first step, we already paired all same-color boots. So, for example, if there's a left 'a' and a right 'a', they would have been paired in the first step. So in the second step, the remaining left and right boots are such that for any specific color c, the number of left c and right c have been adjusted to zero (since we took min of them in the first step). So in the remaining left and right boots, there are no left and right boots with the same color. So, any left non-? boot has a color that is not present in the right non-? boots. Therefore, the only way to pair them is if one of them is a '?'.\n\nSo, in this case, for the second step, the only compatible pairs are:\n\n- left '?' and right non-?\n- left non-? and right '?'\n- left '?' and right '?'\n\nSo, the plan for the second step is:\n\n- Pair as many left '?' with right non-? as possible.\n- Then pair as many left non-? with right '?' as possible.\n- Then pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think about the counts.\n\nSuppose after the first step:\n\nleft_has_q = number of left '?' not yet paired.\n\nright_has_q = number of right '?' not yet paired.\n\nAlso, the remaining left non-? boots have colors that are not present in the right non-? boots. So, for example, if there is a left 'a' in left_remaining, then there are no right 'a's in right_remaining.\n\nSo, for the second step:\n\nWe can pair left '?' with right non-? boots. Each such pair uses one left '?' and one right non-? boot. The number of such pairs is the minimum between left_has_q and the number of right non-? boots.\n\nSimilarly, then, the remaining right non-? boots can't be paired with any left non-? boots (since their colors are different), so they can't be paired. But the left non-? boots can be paired with right '?'s. The number of such pairs is the minimum between the number of left non-? boots and the remaining right '?'s after the first part.\n\nThen, the remaining left '?' and right '?' can be paired. The number of such pairs is the minimum between the remaining left '?' and right '?'.\n\nBut how to track the counts?\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to calculate the maximum possible pairs in the second step:\n\nLet:\n\nnum_left_q = number of left '?' remaining\n\nnum_right_q = number of right '?' remaining\n\nnum_left_non_q = number of left non-? remaining\n\nnum_right_non_q = number of right non-? remaining\n\nBut since in the first step, all same-color pairs have been handled, for any color c, the number of left c and right c in the remaining is zero. Therefore, num_left_non_q and num_right_non_q are not overlapping in their colors. So, the only way to pair them is if one is a '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs is:\n\nmin(num_left_q, num_right_non_q) + min(num_left_non_q, num_right_q) + min( (num_left_q - min(num_left_q, num_right_non_q)), (num_right_q - min(num_left_non_q, num_right_q)) )) \n\nBut perhaps this can be simplified as:\n\nThe total number of pairs is (num_left_q + num_right_q) - max( (num_left_q + num_right_q) - (num_left_non_q + num_right_non_q), 0 )\n\nWait, not sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe total number of remaining left and right boots is (num_left_q + num_left_non_q) and (num_right_q + num_right_non_q). Since each pair must take one from each side, the maximum possible pairs is min( (num_left_q + num_left_non_q), (num_right_q + num_right_non_q) ). However, since the only compatible pairs are those involving at least one '?', but how does that affect the count?\n\nBut in reality, all pairs that can be formed between the remaining left and right boots are allowed, because any pair where at least one is '?' is compatible. So, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum between the total number of left and right remaining boots. Because even if you have a left non-? and a right non-? of different colors, but that's impossible because in the first step, all same color pairs have been removed. Wait, but if there are left non-? and right non-? of different colors, they can't be paired. So, the maximum number of pairs isn't just min(total left, total right), but something else.\n\nAh, here's the problem. Suppose there are 1 left non-? (say 'a') and 1 right non-? (say 'b'). They can't be paired. So the maximum pairs here is 0, even though min(1,1) is 1. So the previous assumption is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the approach needs to account for that.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis complicates things. Because the second step can't just pair any left and right boots. So, how to proceed?\n\nAlternative idea: After the first step, for the remaining left and right boots, the only compatible pairs are:\n\n- left '?' with any right (including '?')\n- right '?' with any left (including '?')\n\nBut since the left and right non-? boots have different colors, they cannot be paired. So, the only way to pair them is to use the '?'s.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs in the second step is:\n\nnumber of left '?' + number of right '?' - number of pairs where both are '?', but wait, no. Because if you have a left '?' and a right '?', you can pair them. But also, a left '?' can be paired with a right non-? and vice versa.\n\nSo, the total possible pairs is equal to the number of left '?' plus the number of right '?' minus the number of pairs where both are '?', but that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\nnumber of left '?' and right non-? (but each such pair uses one left '?' and one right non-?), plus the number of left non-? and right '?' (each such pair uses one left non-? and one right '?'), plus the number of left '?' and right '?' pairs (each uses one left and one right '?'). However, since the left non-? and right non-? can't be paired, and the rest can be paired only if they have a '?'.\n\nBut how to compute this optimally?\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nA = number of left '?'s remaining.\n\nB = number of right '?'s remaining.\n\nC = number of left non-?s remaining.\n\nD = number of right non-?s remaining.\n\nSince C and D can't be paired with each other, the only way to pair them is:\n\nEach left non-? can be paired with a right '?', and each right non-? can be paired with a left '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nmin(C, B) + min(D, A) + min( (A - min(D, A)), (B - min(C, B)) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think:\n\nFirst, pair as many left '?' with right non-? as possible. That's min(A, D).\n\nThen, pair as many left non-? with right '?' as possible. That's min(C, B).\n\nThen, what's left is (A - min(A, D)) left '?' and (B - min(C, B)) right '?'.\n\nThese can be paired among themselves. The number of such pairs is min( (A - min(A, D)), (B - min(C, B)) )).\n\nSo total pairs is:\n\nmin(A, D) + min(C, B) + min( (A - min(A, D)), (B - min(C, B)) )).\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the left non-? can only be paired with right '?', and the right non-? can only be paired with left '?', and the '?' can be paired with each other.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs is the minimum between (A + C) and (B + D), but only if the sum of the left non-? and left '?' can be matched with the sum of right non-? and right '?'.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of pairs is the minimum between (A + C) and (B + D), but with the constraint that:\n\nEach left non-? must be matched with a right '?', and each right non-? must be matched with a left '?'.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nThe number of pairs is:\n\nthe number of left non-? that can be matched with right '?' (let's say x = min(C, B)), plus the number of right non-? that can be matched with left '?' (y = min(D, A)), and then the remaining left '?' and right '?' can be matched (z = min( (A - y), (B - x) )).\n\nBut this seems like the same as before.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me take an example.\n\nExample:\n\nA = 3 (left ?)\n\nB = 3 (right ?)\n\nC = 2 (left non-?)\n\nD = 2 (right non-?)\n\nSo, the maximum pairs would be:\n\nPair left non-? (2) with right ? (3). So x = min(2,3) = 2. Then, pair right non-? (2) with left ? (3 - 2 = 1 left ? left). So y = min(2,1) = 1. Then, remaining left ? is 3 - 2 (used in x) -1 (used in y) = 0? Or wait, after pairing x and y, how much is left?\n\nWait, initial A is 3, B is 3, C is 2, D is 2.\n\nFirst, pair left non-? (C=2) with right ? (B=3). So, x = 2. This uses 2 right ?. Now, B becomes 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nThen, pair right non-? (D=2) with left ?. A is 3, so y = min(2, 3) = 2. But after x, A is 3 (since the left ? were not used yet). So pairing 2 of them with D=2. Now, A becomes 3-2=1. D becomes 0.\n\nNow, remaining left ? is 1, and right ? is 1. So z = 1.\n\nTotal pairs: 2+2+1=5.\n\nWhich is the min( (A + C)=3+2=5, (B + D)=3+2=5 ), which matches. So yes, the total pairs is min( (A + C), (B + D) ), but the way to get there is via that combination.\n\nAnother example:\n\nA = 1, B = 1, C=1, D=1.\n\nThen, pairing x = min(1, B=1) = 1. Then, y = min(1, A - x = 0) = 0. Then, remaining A is 0, B is 0. So total pairs 1 + 0 + 0 = 1. Which is min(2, 2) = 2. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, this example shows that my previous approach is wrong.\n\nWait, in this example:\n\nA = 1 (left ?), B = 1 (right ?), C=1 (left non-?), D=1 (right non-?).\n\nSo, the left non-? can be paired with right ?, and the right non-? can be paired with left ?.\n\nSo, x = min(C=1, B=1) = 1. Then, B becomes 0. Then, y = min(D=1, A=1) = 1. Then, the total pairs is 1 + 1 = 2. Which is min( (A + C) = 2, (B + D) = 2). So why did my previous calculation get 1 instead of 2?\n\nBecause I think I made a mistake in the steps. Let me redo it:\n\nx = min(C, B) = min(1,1) = 1. So, pair the left non-? (C) with right ?. Now, B becomes 0. Then, y = min(D, A) = min(1,1) = 1. So, pair the right non-? (D) with left ?. Now, A becomes 0. So total pairs is 1 + 1 = 2, which is correct. And the remaining left ? and right ? are 0 and 0, so no more pairs. So the total is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\npairs = x + y + z, where x is min(C,B), y is min(D, A - x?), no. Wait, after pairing x, the A remains the same, because x is pairing C (left non-?) with B (right ?). Then, for y, we have D (right non-?) and A (left ?). So y = min(D, A). But after pairing x, B is reduced by x, but A is not changed.\n\nSo in the previous example, after x = 1, B is 0. Then, y is min(D=1, A=1) = 1. So yes, 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nx = min(C, B)\n\ny = min(D, A)\n\nz = min( (A - y), (B - x) )\n\nWait, no. Because after pairing x and y, the remaining A is A - y, and B is B - x. But since x uses B's resources, and y uses A's.\n\nWait, but in the example above, after pairing x=1, B is 0. Then, y is min(D=1, A=1) = 1. So after that, A becomes 0, and D becomes 0. Then, the remaining is B - x = 0, and A - y = 0. So z = min(0,0) = 0. So total pairs is 1+1+0=2.\n\nBut how to compute this in code.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCompute x = min(C, B)\n\nCompute y = min(D, A)\n\nThen, the remaining A' = A - y, B' = B - x.\n\nBut then, since after x and y, the remaining A' and B' can be paired as min(A', B').\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, after x and y, the remaining left ? is A - y, and the remaining right ? is B - x.\n\nSo the number of pairs is x + y + min( (A - y), (B - x) )\n\nBut since the remaining left and right ? can be paired with each other.\n\nSo total pairs is x + y + min( (A - y), (B - x) )\n\nBut how to compute this in code.\n\nBut since x and y are computed as min(C, B) and min(D, A), perhaps this can be done.\n\nBut how to find x and y.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs in the second step is:\n\nx + y + z = min(C, B) + min(D, A) + min( (A - min(D, A)), (B - min(C, B)) )) \n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut perhaps, the total pairs is the sum of:\n\nmin(C, B) + min(D, A) + min( (A - min(D, A)), (B - min(C, B)) )\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, since the total number of pairs is min( (A + C), (B + D) ), but that's only if we can pair all of them. But in reality, the pairing is possible as long as the constraints are satisfied.\n\nIn the first example, A + C = 3+2=5, B + D = 3+2=5. So min(5,5) =5. Which matches the 5 pairs.\n\nIn the second example, A + C = 1 +1=2, B + D = 1 +1=2. So min(2,2) = 2. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: A=2, B=1, C=1, D=1. Then:\n\nA + C = 3, B + D = 2. So min is 2. So the maximum pairs is 2.\n\nHow?\n\nx = min(C=1, B=1) → 1. Then y = min(D=1, A=2) → 1. Then z = min(2-1=1, 1-1=0) → 0. Total is 1+1+0=2. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the total pairs in the second step is min(A + C, B + D).\n\nSo, regardless of the values of A, B, C, D, the maximum possible pairs in the second step is min(A + C, B + D).\n\nBut how to achieve that pairing? Because even if the total is possible, how to find which pairs to choose.\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid pairing, perhaps we can proceed greedily.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each color c (not '?'), pair as many left and right boots as possible. For example, for each color c, take min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs, and mark those boots as used.\n\n2. Then, collect all remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired). Let's call them left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\n3. Now, for the second step, pair as follows:\n\n   a. For each left boot in left_remaining that is '?', try to pair it with a right boot in right_remaining that is not '?'. Once all such pairs are made, then:\n\n   b. For each right boot in right_remaining that is '?', try to pair it with a left boot in left_remaining that is not '?'. Once all such pairs are made, then:\n\n   c. Pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps we need to track the indices of the left and right boots, and for each step, pair them as per the above logic.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used.\n\nSo, here's an approach:\n\nWe can have two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False. Then, for each pair found, we mark the corresponding indices as True.\n\nNow, for the first step:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   count_left = number of left boots with color c and not used.\n\n   count_right = number of right boots with color c and not used.\n\n   pairs = min(count_left, count_right)\n\n   for each such pair, we can pair them. But how to find which ones?\n\nBut to do this, perhaps we can collect for each color c, the list of left boots and right boots. Then, for each c, pair the first 'pairs' left and right boots.\n\nBut how to collect them.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c (not '?'), we can iterate through the left and right strings, and for each position, if it's c and not used, add to a list. Then, for each color c, pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs.\n\nBut for large n (up to 150,000), this approach could be O(n * 26) which is acceptable.\n\nOnce the first step is done, we collect all remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired).\n\nThen, for the second step:\n\nWe need to pair the remaining boots. For this, we can:\n\nCollect all the left boots that are not used and are '?', and all the left boots that are not used and are not '?'. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo:\n\nleft_q = list of indices of left boots that are not used and have color '?'.\n\nleft_non_q = list of indices of left boots that are not used and have color not '?'.\n\nSimilarly for right_q and right_non_q.\n\nThen, the steps:\n\nFirst, pair left_q with right_non_q. For each left in left_q, pair with a right in right_non_q. Take as many as possible. So, for i in range( min(len(left_q), len(right_non_q)) ), pair left_q[i] with right_non_q[i].\n\nThen, pair left_non_q with right_q. Take as many as possible. For i in range( min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q)) ), pair left_non_q[i] with right_q[i].\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q. Take as many as possible, pairing left_q[i] with right_q[i] for i up to min( len(left_q), len(right_q) ).\n\nBut how to collect the lists.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as [False] * n.\n\nFor the first step:\n\nWe can create a dictionary for counts of each color in left and right, but perhaps we can process each color.\n\nBut perhaps for each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used.\n\n   then, pair them up. For each pair, mark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect these indices.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n\n   pairs_num = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(pairs_num):\n\n       left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\n       add this pair to the answer list.\n\nBut this approach would be O(26n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 150,000.\n\nBut for Python, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nOnce this is done, for the second step:\n\nCollect left_q, left_non_q, right_q, right_non_q.\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nleft_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nThen:\n\npair between left_q and right_non_q.\n\nTake the first k elements where k is min(len(left_q), len(right_non_q)).\n\nFor each i in 0..k-1:\n\n   pair left_q[i] with right_non_q[i]\n\nMark them as used.\n\nThen, pair between left_non_q and right_q.\n\nTake the first m elements where m is min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q)).\n\nFor each i in 0..m-1:\n\n   pair left_non_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\nMark them as used.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nTake the first p elements where p is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nFor each i in 0..p-1:\n\n   pair left_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\nMark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect the lists.\n\nBut in code, after the first step, we can generate these four lists.\n\nBut in practice, after the first step, the left_non_q and right_non_q have colors that are not compatible with each other. So pairing them with '?' is the only way.\n\nNow, the problem is that the code must collect the indices of the remaining boots and pair them accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle the order. For example, when pairing left_q and right_non_q, we can pair them in any order, as long as each is used once.\n\nBut the code can proceed as follows.\n\nOnce the first step is done, collect the four lists.\n\nNow, for the second step:\n\nWe can process the left_q and right_non_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_non_q))):\n\n   add pair (left_q[i]+1, right_non_q[i]+1) to the answer list.\n\n   mark left_used[left_q[i]] = True\n\n   mark right_used[right_non_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, process left_non_q and right_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))):\n\n   add pair (left_non_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) to the answer list.\n\n   mark left_used[left_non_q[i]] = True\n\n   mark right_used[right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, process the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_q))):\n\n   add pair (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) to the answer list.\n\n   mark left_used[left_q[i]] = True\n\n   mark right_used[right_q[i]] = True\n\nWait, but after the first two steps, the left_q and right_q may have some elements left. For example, after pairing left_q with right_non_q, the left_q may have some elements left. Similarly for right_q.\n\nSo, in the code, after the first two steps, we need to collect the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut perhaps, in code, the lists left_q and right_q are modified during the steps. Alternatively, we can generate the lists once, and then process them.\n\nBut in code, the lists left_q, left_non_q, right_q, right_non_q are generated once, and then we process them.\n\nBut during the pairing steps, the indices are marked as used, so in the next steps, they are not considered again.\n\nWait, no. Because the left_q and right_non_q lists are generated before any pairing. So when we pair the first k elements, we need to mark them as used, so that in the next steps, they are not considered again.\n\nBut in code, the lists left_q and right_non_q are generated once. So, for example, during the first step of pairing left_q and right_non_q, we can iterate over the first k elements, and mark them as used.\n\nBut in code, for example:\n\nleft_q = [indices of left boots not used and are '?']\nright_non_q = [indices of right boots not used and are not '?']\n\nthen, for i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_non_q))):\n\n   pair left_q[i] with right_non_q[i]\n\n   mark left_used[left_q[i]] = True\n\n   mark right_used[right_non_q[i]] = True\n\nBut then, after this, the remaining left_q elements are those not processed in this loop. Similarly for the right_non_q.\n\nBut in code, the lists left_q and right_non_q are not modified. So perhaps, after this step, we need to create new lists of remaining elements. However, since the left_used and right_used arrays are updated, the subsequent steps will not process those elements again.\n\nBut in the code, for the second step, the lists left_q and right_non_q are generated once. Then, when pairing, we can process them in order, and mark them as used. Thus, in the next steps, when processing left_non_q and right_q, the elements that were already paired are already marked as used, so they won't be considered again.\n\nWait, no. Because the left_q and right_non_q lists are generated once. For example, after generating left_q, which is all the left boots not used and are '?', then during pairing, we pair some of them. But the left_used array is updated. However, the list left_q is not modified. So, when we process the next steps, the code may attempt to pair elements that have already been used. But since the code checks whether they are used, perhaps not.\n\nNo, because the lists left_q, right_non_q, etc., were generated before any of the pairing steps. So, for example, the left_q list contains indices that were not used at that time. But after some of them are paired, the rest are still in the list. However, in the next steps, when processing the left_non_q and right_q, the code will not process those elements again, because they have been marked as used.\n\nWait, no. The code for the second step is:\n\nleft_q is the list of left boots that are not used and are '?', generated before any pairing in step 2. Then, during the first pairing (left_q and right_non_q), some of the elements in left_q are marked as used. But the list left_q is not modified. So, when the code proceeds to the next steps, it will still have the entire list of left_q, including those already used.\n\nThis is a problem. Because when we process the next steps, we need to make sure that we don't pair already used elements.\n\nAh, right! So this approach is incorrect. Because the lists are generated once, but during the pairing steps, the elements are marked as used, but the lists are not modified. So, when processing the next steps, the code may process elements that are already used.\n\nSo, how to avoid that?\n\nAlternative approach: during the pairing steps, collect the indices that are available and not yet used.\n\nBut this requires generating the lists again for each step. Which is not efficient, but for the problem's constraints, perhaps acceptable.\n\nBut for large n, this could be expensive.\n\nAlternative idea: when generating the lists for the second step, we can generate them once, and during the pairing steps, keep track of the current indices to process. For example, for the first step (pairing left_q with right_non_q), we can iterate over the first k elements of left_q and right_non_q, and mark them as used. Then, for the next steps, we can process the remaining elements of left_q and right_non_q.\n\nBut how to track which elements are already used. Well, since the left_used and right_used arrays are updated, when generating the lists, we can generate them again. But that would be O(n) time for each step.\n\nAlternatively, for the second step, we can generate the four lists (left_q, left_non_q, right_q, right_non_q) once. Then, during the pairing steps, we can process them in order, and for each element, check if it is already used. But this would be O(k) for each step, which could be acceptable.\n\nBut that's not efficient. For example, in the first pairing step, when we have left_q and right_non_q, and we want to pair as many as possible, but some elements may have been used already. However, since these lists were generated before any of the pairing steps, they should not have used elements. Because during the first step, we have already processed all the pairs that could be made with same colors. So, during the second step, the lists left_q, left_non_q,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to pair left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. A color is compatible if both are the same specific color or if one of them is a wildcard ('?').
