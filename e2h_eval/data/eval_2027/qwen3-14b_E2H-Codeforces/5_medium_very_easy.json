Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The colors can be specific letters or question marks, which are wildcards. \n\nFirst, I need to think about how to maximize the pairs. Let me think about the approach.\n\nThe key idea here is to match the boots in such a way that we use as many specific color matches as possible, and then use the question marks to fill in the remaining spots. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me break it down. For each left boot and right boot, there are certain compatibility conditions. For example, if a left boot is 'a' and the right is 'a', they can be paired. If left is 'a' and right is '?', they can be paired. Similarly, if left is '?', and right is 'a', same thing. Also, two question marks can be paired.\n\nBut since each boot can only be used once, we need to find an optimal way to pair them.\n\nHmm. One approach could be:\n\n1. First, match all left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same specific color. For example, for each color c, count the number of left boots with c and right boots with c. The minimum of these counts would be the number of possible direct matches. Then subtract those from the counts.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. Because after matching specific colors, we can use the question marks to cover the remaining ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should first process the specific color matches, then use the question marks to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nWait, but how to handle the question marks optimally? For example, if there are left question marks and right question marks, pairing them together is better than using them to pair with specific colors. Because if you have a left '?' and a right 'a', you can pair them, but that uses up the '?' and the 'a'. However, if you pair the 'a' with another 'a' on the right, then the '?' can pair with another '?'. So maybe it's better to first pair the specific colors, then use the remaining question marks to pair with other question marks, and then any leftover question marks can be used to pair with remaining specific colors.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStep 1: Match all left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same specific color. For example, for each color c (not '?'), count the number of left and right boots. The minimum of left[c] and right[c] is the number of pairs here. Then subtract those from left and right counts.\n\nBut how to track which positions are used? Well, perhaps for the actual pairing, we need to track the indices. But for the initial step, perhaps the counts are sufficient, but when building the actual pairs, we need to track which ones are matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by:\n\n- First, create a list of left boots with specific colors (non-?) and right boots with specific colors. Then, for each color, match as many as possible between left and right. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which include ? and unpaired specific colors), pair them using the ?.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nAnother approach: for each color c (excluding ?), we can pair left[c] with right[c], but since the question marks can be used as wildcards, perhaps it's better to pair as much as possible between specific colors, then use the ? to pair with whatever is left.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the data structures. For example, for the left and right boots, we can have:\n\n- For left, a dictionary that counts how many of each color (excluding ?) there are.\n- Same for right.\n\nThen, for each color c (not ?), we can take the minimum of left[c] and right[c], and add that to the total. Then, subtract that from both left and right counts. Then, for the remaining left and right boots, which may include ? and some specific colors, we can pair the ? with the remaining specific colors, and also pair ? with ?.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, after the first step, the remaining left boots are:\n\nLeft has some specific colors (those that couldn't be matched) and some ?.\n\nSame for right.\n\nSo, for example, suppose after step 1, there are some left boots with color 'a' that couldn't be matched because there were not enough right 'a's. Similarly, some right boots with color 'b' that couldn't be matched with left 'b's.\n\nNow, the ? can be used to pair with these remaining specific colors. Also, the ? on the left can pair with ? on the right.\n\nSo perhaps the next step is:\n\n- Take all the remaining left boots (specific colors and ?) and all the remaining right boots (specific colors and ?).\n\nWe can collect all the left specific colors (non-?) and right specific colors (non-?), and try to match them with ?.\n\nFor example, for each left boot with a specific color, we can pair it with a right ?.\n\nSimilarly, for each right boot with a specific color, we can pair it with a left ?.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nAlso, the ? can be used as either left or right. So, for example, if there are more left ? than right ?, then after pairing them with right specific colors, the remaining left ? can be paired with right ?.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\nAfter step 1 (matching specific colors):\n\n- Collect all the left ? and right ?.\n\n- For the remaining specific colors, we can pair them with ?s from the opposite side.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nLet left_specific = number of left boots with specific colors (non-?) that are not yet matched. Similarly for right_specific.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to collect all the left boots that are not matched yet (they can be specific colors or ?), and same for right.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally.\n\nAnother approach is:\n\n- For each left boot (that's not yet matched), if it's a specific color, we can look for a right boot that is a ? and hasn't been matched yet. Similarly, for each right boot that's a specific color, look for a left ?.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the number of left ? is Lq, and the number of right ? is Rq.\n\nAfter step 1, we have some left boots with specific colors (say, Ls) and right boots with specific colors (Rs).\n\nBut these Ls and Rs can't be matched with each other (since they were already processed in step 1). So for example, if there's a left 'a' and a right 'a', they were already matched. But if there's a left 'a' and a right 'b', they can't be matched unless they are paired with ?.\n\nSo, to match the remaining Ls and Rs, we can pair them with ?s.\n\nSo, for example, the number of left specific boots (Ls) can be matched with right ?s (Rq). Similarly, right specific boots (Rs) can be matched with left ?s (Lq). But how much can we do this?\n\nLet me think of this as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs between Ls and Rq is min(Ls, Rq). Similarly, the maximum between Rs and Lq is min(Rs, Lq). But wait, no. Because Ls is the number of left specific boots (non-?) that are not matched yet. Each of them can be paired with a right ?.\n\nSimilarly, the number of right specific boots (non-?) that are not matched yet can be paired with left ?.\n\nBut once we pair these, the remaining ?s can be paired between themselves.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Pair specific colors between left and right. This gives us a certain number of pairs.\n\n2. Then, pair left specific colors with right ?s. How many? Let's say the number of left specific colors is LS, and the number of right ? is RQ. Then, we can pair min(LS, RQ) of them. Similarly, pair right specific colors with left ?s: min(RS, LQ). But wait, after pairing left specific with right ?, the remaining right ?s can be used to pair with left ?s.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, after step 1, let's have:\n\nleft_counts: a dictionary with counts of each color (excluding ?) for left boots not yet matched.\n\nright_counts: same for right.\n\nBut perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n- For all left boots that are not matched yet and are specific colors, collect them into a list. Similarly for right.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of counts.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nAfter step 1, the number of left boots that are not matched and are specific colors is Ls = sum of left_counts[c] for all c != '?'\n\nSimilarly, the number of right boots not matched and specific is Rs = sum of right_counts[c] for all c != '?'\n\nThe number of left ?s is Lq = left_counts['?'] (but wait, perhaps I need to track the counts of ? in left and right after step 1.)\n\nWait, perhaps during step 1, we process the specific colors. For example, for each color c (not ?), we can take the minimum between left[c] and right[c], and add that to the answer. Then, subtract that from left[c] and right[c]. Then, the remaining left[c] and right[c] are those that couldn't be matched.\n\nBut the question marks are not processed here. So after step 1, the left and right have:\n\n- For each color c (not ?), left[c] is the number of left boots of that color not yet matched.\n\n- Similarly for right[c].\n\nAdditionally, the left has left_q = number of ? in left string not yet matched.\n\nSame for right_q.\n\nSo, after step 1, the left and right have:\n\n- Some specific colors (non-?) left, and some ?.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair as many as possible between left specific and right ?.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nTake the left specific colors (sum of left_counts[c] for all c != '?') and pair them with right ?.\n\nBut how many can we pair? It's the minimum between the total left specific (LS) and the right ? (Rq).\n\nSimilarly, take the right specific colors (RS) and pair them with left ? (Lq).\n\nBut after that, the remaining ?s can be paired between themselves.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nLS = sum(left_counts[c] for c in left_counts if c != '?')\n\nRS = sum(right_counts[c] for c in right_counts if c != '?')\n\nLq = left_counts['?'] (assuming that we have tracked ? in the counts)\n\nRq = right_counts['?']\n\nWait, but initially, the counts for left and right include the ?.\n\nBut during step 1, we only processed specific colors. So for example, the left_counts for ? is not modified during step 1.\n\nSo, during step 1, for each color c (not ?), we take the min between left[c] and right[c], and add that to the total. Then, subtract that amount from both left[c] and right[c].\n\nBut what about the ?s? They are not processed here.\n\nSo after step 1, the left_counts and right_counts contain the counts of each color, including the ?s.\n\nSo, for example, left_counts['?'] is the number of ? in left boots that haven't been matched yet.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair the remaining left specific (non-?) with right ?s, and vice versa.\n\nLet me think:\n\nThe number of left specific is LS = sum( left_counts[c] for c in left_counts if c != '?' )\n\nSimilarly for RS.\n\nSo, for the first part, we can pair LS with Rq. But how? For example, for each left specific boot, we can pair it with a right ?.\n\nSo, the number of pairs here is min(LS, Rq). Let's say we take that number. Then, after that, the Rq becomes Rq - min(LS, Rq), and LS becomes zero (since we used all of them or whatever is possible).\n\nWait, no. Suppose LS is 5 and Rq is 3. Then, we can pair 3 left specific with the 3 right ?. Then, LS is 5-3=2 left specific left, and Rq is 0.\n\nSimilarly, then, for the right specific (RS), we can pair them with Lq (left ?s). So, the number here is min(RS, Lq). Let's say we take that number, and then subtract.\n\nAfter that, the remaining ?s on left and right can be paired with each other. The number of such pairs is min(Lq_remaining, Rq_remaining).\n\nSo, adding all these steps gives the total.\n\nBut how to implement this, and also track the actual pairs?\n\nBut the problem requires not only the count but also the actual pairs. So, the challenge is not only to compute the maximum number but also to generate the pairs.\n\nThis suggests that the approach needs to track which indices are used for pairing.\n\nSo, perhaps the plan is:\n\n1. For each color c (not ?), collect the list of indices in left and right where the color is c.\n\n   For example, left_dict[c] = list of indices (0-based or 1-based?), same for right_dict[c].\n\n2. Then, for each color c, pair as many as possible between left_dict[c] and right_dict[c], taking the minimum of the two lists' lengths. For each pair, we can take the first elements from each list and pair them.\n\n   Then, remove those elements from the lists.\n\n   For example, if left has 3 'a's and right has 5 'a's, we pair 3 of them. So, for each of the 3 left 'a's, we pair with the first 3 right 'a's.\n\n3. Then, collect all the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired) into separate lists. For example, left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\n   But how to collect them? For left_remaining, it would be all the left boots that are not yet paired, which includes those with specific colors and ?.\n\n   Similarly for right_remaining.\n\n4. Now, process the left_remaining and right_remaining to pair as follows:\n\n   a. Pair left specific (non-?) with right ?. For each left specific boot, pair it with a right ?.\n\n   b. Pair right specific (non-?) with left ?.\n\n   c. Pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the data structures. After step 1, for the left and right, we have:\n\n- For each color c, we have a list of indices that are not yet paired. For example, left_colors[c] is a list of indices for left boots with color c, not yet paired.\n\n   Similarly for right_colors[c].\n\nBut during step 1, for each color c (not ?), we paired the left and right as much as possible. Then, the remaining left_colors[c] and right_colors[c] are the ones that couldn't be matched.\n\nBut for the question marks, they are not processed in step 1.\n\nSo, for step 2:\n\nWe need to process the left and right ?s and the remaining specific colors.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nCollect all the left non-? boots (i.e., those that are still in left_colors for c != ?) into a list called left_special.\n\nSimilarly, collect all the right non-? boots into right_special.\n\nThen, collect all the left ?s into left_q_list, and right ?s into right_q_list.\n\nNow, for step 2a: pair left_special with right_q_list.\n\nFor each element in left_special, we can pair it with an element from right_q_list. The number of such pairs is the minimum of len(left_special) and len(right_q_list).\n\nSo, for example, if there are 5 left_special and 3 right_q, we pair 3 of them. The left_special list will have 2 remaining, and the right_q_list will be empty.\n\nSimilarly, for step 2b: pair right_special with left_q_list. The number of pairs is min(len(right_special), len(left_q_list)).\n\nThen, for step 2c: pair the remaining left_q and right_q. The number is min(len(left_q_list_remaining), len(right_q_list_remaining)).\n\nBut how to track which indices are used in each step.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nSo, during step 1, after processing specific colors, the left_colors and right_colors for each color (including ?) will have the remaining indices.\n\nSo, for example, after step 1:\n\nleft_special = [indices for left boots where color is not ? and not yet paired]\n\nright_special = same for right.\n\nleft_q_list = [indices for left boots where color is ? and not yet paired]\n\nright_q_list = same for right.\n\nBut how to collect these.\n\nOnce we have these lists, the steps are:\n\nPair left_special with right_q_list:\n\nTake as many as possible. For each left index in left_special, pair with a right index from right_q_list. Once that is done, the remaining left_special and right_q_list are updated.\n\nSimilarly for right_special and left_q_list.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate the actual pairs. So, during this process, we need to collect the pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the left_special and right_q_list.\n\nSo, let's think about code structure.\n\nFirst, read n, l, r.\n\nThen, for each left boot, we can collect their color and index. Similarly for right.\n\nWe can create dictionaries for left and right, where for each color, we have a list of indices (1-based or 0-based? Well, the output requires 1-based indices.)\n\nFor example, left_dict is a defaultdict(list), and for each i in 0..n-1, left_dict[l[i]].append(i+1) (since the output is 1-based).\n\nSame for right_dict.\n\nThen, for step 1: for each color c in left_dict (excluding '?'), check if it exists in right_dict.\n\nFor each such color c, the number of pairs is min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c])).\n\nWe can take that number of pairs. For example, take the first x elements from left_dict[c] and first x elements from right_dict[c], and pair them.\n\nThen, remove those elements from left_dict[c] and right_dict[c].\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, but for the code, perhaps we can process each color c in left_dict and right_dict.\n\nBut the problem is that after pairing, the left_dict and right_dict for c will have their lists reduced.\n\nBut perhaps for code, the steps would be:\n\nInitialize a list of pairs.\n\nFor each color c in left_dict (excluding '?'):\n\n   if c is in right_dict:\n\n       num_pairs = min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c]))\n\n       for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n           pair (left_dict[c][i], right_dict[c][i])\n\n       then, remove the first num_pairs elements from left_dict[c] and right_dict[c].\n\nBut wait, but the color c may be present in both left and right. However, for example, if we process all colors, but for each color, we pair as much as possible.\n\nBut this approach would miss some possibilities. For example, if a color c is present in left and right, but after pairing, some of the left and right colors could be paired with ?s.\n\nBut perhaps this is okay. Because the first step is to pair the specific colors as much as possible.\n\nBut the code for this step may need to iterate through all possible colors, but perhaps it's better to process all colors except '?', and for each, pair the left and right as much as possible.\n\nBut how to avoid processing the same color multiple times. For example, if we process color 'a' and pair left and right, then later process 'a' again. Wait, no. Because after processing, the left_dict[c] and right_dict[c] would have their lists modified. So, perhaps we can process each color once.\n\nBut perhaps the code would be:\n\nfor c in all possible colors (a-z):\n\n   if c is not '?':\n\n       if c in left_dict and c in right_dict:\n\n           pairs_possible = min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c]))\n\n           for i in range(pairs_possible):\n\n               add (left_dict[c][i], right_dict[c][i]) to the answer list\n\n           # now, remove those elements from left and right\n\n           left_dict[c] = left_dict[c][pairs_possible:]\n\n           right_dict[c] = right_dict[c][pairs_possible:]\n\nBut how to loop through all possible colors. Since the colors are lowercase letters, we can loop from 'a' to 'z'.\n\nBut in Python, we can loop over all possible letters.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n   ... process ...\n\nBut this way, for each color, we process it once.\n\nOnce this is done, the left and right dicts have the remaining boots.\n\nThen, we can collect the left_special (all left boots not in '?') and right_special (same for right).\n\nBut how to collect them. For example:\n\nleft_special = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n   left_special.extend(left_dict[c])\n\nSimilarly for right_special.\n\nThen, left_q_list is left_dict['?'], and right_q_list is right_dict['?'].\n\nThen, step 2a: pair left_special with right_q_list.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can take the minimum of len(left_special) and len(right_q_list), and pair them.\n\nFor example:\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_special), len(right_q_list))\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n\n   pair (left_special[i], right_q_list[i])\n\nThen, remove those elements from left_special and right_q_list.\n\nBut wait, since left_special is a list of indices, and right_q_list is also a list of indices.\n\nBut in reality, the left_special is a list of indices of left boots that are not ? and not yet paired. Similarly for right_q_list.\n\nOnce we pair them, we need to remove them from their respective lists.\n\nBut since we are processing them in order, perhaps we can just take the first num_pairs elements from left_special and right_q_list.\n\nBut how to manage this in code.\n\nBut perhaps, for code, after collecting left_special and right_q_list, we can do:\n\npair_count = min(len(left_special), len(right_q_list))\n\nfor i in range(pair_count):\n\n    add (left_special[i], right_q_list[i]) to the answer list.\n\nThen, left_special = left_special[pair_count:]\n\nright_q_list = right_q_list[pair_count:]\n\nSimilarly for the next step: pair right_special with left_q_list.\n\npair_count = min(len(right_special), len(left_q_list))\n\nfor i in range(pair_count):\n\n    add (left_q_list[i], right_special[i]) ?\n\nWait, no. Because right_special is the list of right boots with specific colors (non-?), and left_q_list is the list of left ? boots.\n\nSo, each right_special element (a right boot with specific color) can be paired with a left ?.\n\nSo, the pair is (left_q_list[i], right_special[i]).\n\nYes.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_q_list and right_q_list can be paired between themselves.\n\npair_count = min(len(left_q_list), len(right_q_list))\n\nfor i in range(pair_count):\n\n    add (left_q_list[i], right_q_list[i])\n\nSo, this seems manageable.\n\nBut how to collect left_special and right_special.\n\nIn code:\n\nleft_special = []\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_special.extend(left_dict.get(c, []))\nright_special = []\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    right_special.extend(right_dict.get(c, []))\n\nleft_q_list = left_dict.get('?', [])\nright_q_list = right_dict.get('?', [])\n\nBut after that, we can process step 2a, 2b, 2c.\n\nBut what about the order? For example, when pairing left_special with right_q_list, the order may affect the total. However, since the problem allows any correct pairing, any order is acceptable.\n\nBut how to handle the lists.\n\nOnce all these steps are done, the total pairs is the sum of:\n\nstep1_pairs + step2a_pairs + step2b_pairs + step2c_pairs.\n\nBut how to track these steps in code.\n\nNow, the problem is that when we collect left_special and right_special, the left_dict and right_dict are modified during step 1.\n\nBut during step 1, the code for processing the specific colors would have modified the left_dict and right_dict for each color. For example, after step 1, the left_dict[c] for each color c (not ?) contains the remaining boots that could not be paired with the same color on the right.\n\nSo, in code, after step 1, the left_dict and right_dict for each color (including ?) contain the remaining boots.\n\nThus, the code steps would be:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_dict and right_dict as defaultdict(list).\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    left_char = l[i]\n\n    left_dict[left_char].append(i+1)  # 1-based index\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    right_char = r[i]\n\n    right_dict[right_char].append(i+1)\n\nThen, step 1: process all specific colors.\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    if c in left_dict and c in right_dict:\n\n        # get the number of pairs possible\n\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c]))\n\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n            pairs.append( (left_dict[c][i], right_dict[c][i]) )\n\n        # remove those elements from the lists\n\n        left_dict[c] = left_dict[c][num_pairs:]\n\n        right_dict[c] = right_dict[c][num_pairs:]\n\nThen, collect left_special, right_special, left_q, right_q:\n\nleft_special = []\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_special.extend(left_dict.get(c, []))\n\nright_special = []\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    right_special.extend(right_dict.get(c, []))\n\nleft_q = left_dict.get('?', [])\nright_q = right_dict.get('?', [])\n\nThen, process step 2a: pair left_special with right_q.\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_special), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    pairs.append( (left_special[i], right_q[i]) )\n\nleft_special = left_special[num_pairs:]\nright_q = right_q[num_pairs:]\n\nThen, process step 2b: pair right_special with left_q.\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(right_special), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_special[i]) )\n\nright_special = right_special[num_pairs:]\nleft_q = left_q[num_pairs:]\n\nThen, process step 2c: pair left_q and right_q.\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_q[i]) )\n\nThus, the total pairs is the length of the 'pairs' list.\n\nBut wait, this approach may not capture all possibilities. For example, perhaps pairing some of the right_special with left_q and then some left_special with right_q would yield more pairs. However, since the order is arbitrary, the code may work.\n\nBut how to make sure that this approach is optimal. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose we have:\n\nleft_special has 2 elements (say, 'a' and 'b'), right_q has 1 element.\n\nThen, pairing the first left_special (a) with the right_q gives 1 pair. Then, the remaining left_special (b) can't be paired with anything else. Alternatively, if we had paired the 'b' with the right_q, same result. Either way, 1 pair.\n\nSimilarly, for step 2b, pairing right_special with left_q.\n\nBut what if after step 2a, there are left_special and right_q, but after that, there are right_special and left_q that could be paired. But the code handles that.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple options. For example, if there are left_special and right_q, and also right_special and left_q. Which to pair first?\n\nBut in this code, step 2a is pairing left_special with right_q first, then step 2b pairs right_special with left_q. But perhaps there's a better way. However, since the problem allows any valid maximum pairing, the code's approach is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python.\n\nBut what about the data structures. For example, in Python, defaultdict(list) can be used for left_dict and right_dict.\n\nBut for the step 1, when processing each color, we need to check if both left and right have that color. For example, if a color is present in left_dict but not in right_dict, then nothing is done.\n\nNow, the code for step 1 is:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    if c in left_dict and c in right_dict:\n\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c]))\n\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n            pairs.append( (left_dict[c][i], right_dict[c][i]) )\n\n        left_dict[c] = left_dict[c][num_pairs:]\n\n        right_dict[c] = right_dict[c][num_pairs:]\n\nBut in Python, checking if a key is in a defaultdict may not be straightforward. Wait, no. Because for a defaultdict, even if a key is not present, accessing it returns an empty list. However, in our code, we are using left_dict.get(c, []), but during step 1, the code checks if c is in left_dict and right_dict. However, this is not correct. Because in the defaultdict, even if the list is empty, the key exists. So, for example, if a color c was processed in step 1 and all elements were removed, then left_dict[c] is an empty list. Thus, checking if c in left_dict would return True, even though there are no elements. But in that case, the code would process it again, but the min(len(...)) would be zero.\n\nBut that's not a problem. Because in that case, the code would generate zero pairs and then truncate the lists to zero.\n\nBut in the code above, the code is checking if c is in left_dict and right_dict. But in reality, the defaultdict will have all keys from the initial processing. For example, if a color was not present in the original l or r strings, then during the initial processing, the left_dict[c] would be empty. However, during the initial processing, when building the left_dict and right_dict, the code adds entries for each character in l and r. So, for example, if a color is not present in l, then left_dict[c] is empty. So, during step 1, when checking for c in left_dict and right_dict, it would check whether the key exists. However, since the defaultdict automatically creates entries for any accessed key, perhaps the code is not correct.\n\nWait, no. The code for building left_dict and right_dict is:\n\nInitially, left_dict is a defaultdict(list). Then, for each character in l, we append to left_dict[left_char]. So, for example, if a color is not present in l, then left_dict will not have that color as a key. Because defaultdict will create entries when accessed. Wait, no. Because for example, if we have a defaultdict(list), and we do left_dict['a'].append(...), then 'a' is added to the keys. But if a color is not present in l, then left_dict will not have that color as a key. Because we are only appending to the keys that are present in l.\n\nWait, no. The code for building left_dict is:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    left_char = l[i]\n\n    left_dict[left_char].append(i+1)\n\nSo, for example, if l has no 'x's, then left_dict does not have a key 'x'. Because we never access left_dict['x'] in that case. However, defaultdict will create the key only when accessed. But in this code, the for loop appends to left_dict[left_char], which is the character in l. So, for example, if l has 'a's and 'b's, then left_dict will have keys 'a' and 'b', but not others.\n\nThus, during step 1, when looping over all letters from 'a' to 'z', for each c, the code checks if c is in left_dict and right_dict. But for a c that is not present in l or r, the left_dict or right_dict may not have the key. Thus, the code would skip them.\n\nBut in Python, checking 'c in left_dict' is True only if the key exists. So, for example, if the code has not added any elements to left_dict for 'x', then 'x' is not a key in left_dict. Therefore, the code for step 1 would correctly process only those colors that are present in both left and right.\n\nBut this may not be the case. Because, for example, if a color is present in left_dict (because there are elements in l) but not in right_dict, then the code would not process it. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code for step 1 is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the 'in' operator for a defaultdict checks whether the key is present. So, for example, if a key was added to the defaultdict (even if the list is empty), then 'c in left_dict' returns True.\n\nBut in our code, during the initial building of left_dict and right_dict, the code adds entries for each character in l and r. So, for example, if a color is present in l, then left_dict has that key. If not, then it's not present.\n\nThus, during step 1, the code loops through all letters a-z. For each, it checks if the color is present in both left and right dicts. If so, then process.\n\nNow, the code for step 1 is correct.\n\nOnce that is done, the code proceeds to collect left_special and right_special.\n\nBut during the step 1 processing, the left_dict and right_dict for each color may have empty lists. However, when collecting left_special, the code loops through all letters a-z, and for each, adds the elements in left_dict.get(c, []). But since left_dict is a defaultdict, the get(c, []) would return the list even if c is not present. Wait, no. The get method for a defaultdict would return the default value if the key is not present. However, in the code, left_dict is a defaultdict(list), so left_dict.get(c, []) would return the list for c if it exists, else the empty list. But since the code is using left_dict.get(c, []), even if the key is not present, it returns the empty list. Thus, the code for collecting left_special is correct.\n\nBut perhaps, in Python, the get() method for a defaultdict returns the value associated with the key if present, else the default. But in this case, the code is using get(c, []), which for a defaultdict would return the value for c if present, else the default value (the empty list). However, for a defaultdict, even if the key is not present, accessing left_dict[c] would create an empty list. But in this code, the get() method is used, which does not access the key. Thus, for a key not present in left_dict, get(c, []) returns the default empty list. So, the code for collecting left_special is correct.\n\nOnce all that is done, the code proceeds to pair the left_special with right_q, etc.\n\nNow, testing this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output is 5, with some pairs.\n\nBut let's not get into that now. Let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All boots are ?.\n\nIn this case, step 1 would process nothing, since there are no specific colors. Then, left_special is empty, right_special is empty. left_q and right_q are all the boots. Then, step 2a and 2b do nothing, and step 2c pairs all possible. The maximum pairs is n, since each left can be paired with a right.\n\nEdge Case 2: All left are 'a', and all right are 'a'. Then, step 1 would pair all of them. The rest steps do nothing.\n\nEdge Case 3: Left has some 'a's and some '?', right has some 'a's and some '?'. Step 1 pairs the 'a's. Then, the remaining left 'a's (if any) are paired with right '?', and the remaining right 'a's (if any) are paired with left '?', etc.\n\nNow, the code should handle all these.\n\nBut what about the indices? For example, during step 1, when we take the first elements of the left and right lists. For example, if left_dict[c] is [1,2,3], and right_dict[c] is [4,5], then step 1 pairs (1,4), (2,5), and leaves left_dict[c] as [3].\n\nSo, the code is correct in that.\n\nNow, the code for Python.\n\nBut for large n (up to 150,000), the code must be efficient. However, the code is O(n) time, since for each step, it's processing the lists once.\n\nBut the problem is that, for each color in step 1, the code is looping through all 26 letters. For n up to 1.5e5, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nWe need to read the input. However, the input format is a bit unclear. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots, where each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that their colors are compatible, with the constraint that each boot can only be used once in a pair.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Specific Color Matching**: First, we match boots with specific colors (non-'?') on both the left and right sides. For each color, we pair as many left boots with the same color right boots as possible.\n2. **Indefinite Color Matching**: After handling specific color matches, we use the remaining indefinite ('?') boots to pair with any remaining specific color boots. This is done in two steps:\n   - Pair remaining specific color left boots with right '?' boots.\n   - Pair remaining specific color right boots with left '?' boots.\n3. **Remaining Indefinite Color Matching**: Finally, pair any remaining '?' boots from both sides with each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    left_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    right_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        left_char = l[i]\n        left_dict[left_char].append(i + 1)  # 1-based index\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        right_char = r[i]\n        right_dict[right_char].append(i + 1)\n    \n    pairs = []\n    \n    # Step 1: Match specific colors\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        if c in left_dict and c in right_dict:\n            left_list = left_dict[c]\n            right_list = right_dict[c]\n            num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(num_pairs):\n                pairs.append((left_list[i], right_list[i]))\n            # Update the lists\n            left_dict[c] = left_list[num_pairs:]\n            right_dict[c] = right_list[num_pairs:]\n    \n    # Collect left_special, right_special, left_q, right_q\n    left_special = []\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        left_special.extend(left_dict.get(c, []))\n    \n    right_special = []\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        right_special.extend(right_dict.get(c, []))\n    \n    left_q = left_dict.get('?', [])\n    right_q = right_dict.get('?', [])\n    \n    # Step 2a: pair left_special with right_q\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_special), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        pairs.append((left_special[i], right_q[i]))\n    left_special = left_special[num_pairs:]\n    right_q = right_q[num_pairs:]\n    \n    # Step 2b: pair right_special with left_q\n    num_pairs = min(len(right_special), len(left_q))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        pairs.append((left_q[i], right_special[i]))\n    right_special = right_special[num_pairs:]\n    left_q = left_q[num_pairs:]\n    \n    # Step 2c: pair remaining left_q and right_q\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        pairs.append((left_q[i], right_q[i]))\n    \n    print(len(pairs))\n    for a, b in pairs:\n        print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Dictionary Initialization**: Two dictionaries (`left_dict` and `right_dict`) are used to store indices of boots based on their colors.\n3. **Specific Color Matching**: For each color from 'a' to 'z', we match as many left boots with the same color right boots as possible.\n4. **Indefinite Color Matching**: After handling specific color matches, we use the remaining '?' boots to pair with any remaining specific color boots from the opposite side.\n5. **Final Indefinite Matching**: Any remaining '?' boots are paired with each other to maximize the number of valid pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently use all possible compatible pairs, leveraging both specific and indefinite color matches to achieve the optimal solution.",
