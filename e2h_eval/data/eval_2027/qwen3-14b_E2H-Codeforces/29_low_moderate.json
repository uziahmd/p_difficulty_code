Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we have a string of digits and perform multiple substitution queries. After all substitutions, compute the number modulo 1e9+7. But the problem is that directly applying substitutions might be computationally expensive, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. So, doing it naively by replacing each occurrence every time would be too slow. Because for each query, if the string is large, replacing each occurrence of di would take O(len(s)) time, and with n queries, that's O(n * len(s)), which could be 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if substitutions are done in order, then later substitutions might affect previous ones. For example, if first we replace 2 with '00', then replace 0 with '1', then the original 2s would become 00, which then becomes 11. So the order of processing the queries matters. So the key is to process the queries in the order they are given, but find a way to represent the transformations efficiently.\n\nHmm. Let me think about modeling the substitutions as a transformation for each digit. Suppose that for each digit d, we track what it gets replaced with. However, when a substitution is done, it's possible that the replacement string contains digits that have already been substituted. Wait, but the substitution is applied in order. So for example, if we first replace 2 with '3', then replace 3 with '4', then the original 2s would be replaced with 3, then those 3s would be replaced with 4. So the order of processing the queries is important, and each substitution affects future substitutions.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe we can track for each digit, what it expands to. But since substitutions can overwrite previous ones, we need to process them in the order given. So, for example, if a query replaces digit d with some string, then any subsequent substitution on d will overwrite that. However, when we process a query, we need to consider that the current expansion of d is whatever was set before. But how do we handle that?\n\nWait, here's an idea: Instead of modifying the original string each time, we can represent the transformations as a mapping from each digit to its replacement. However, when a replacement is made, we need to expand the replacement string using the current mappings. Wait, no. Because when you perform a substitution, you replace all instances of di in the current string with ti. But if ti contains digits that have their own substitutions, those substitutions haven't been applied yet. Wait, no. Because the substitutions are processed in order. So, for example, suppose the first query is 2→00, then the second query is 0→1. Then, the original string's 2s are replaced with 00, and then the 0s (which were part of the 00) are replaced with 1s. So the order is important. Therefore, when we process a query, we need to replace the current digits in the string, and the replacement strings may contain digits that are not yet processed. But if we model this with a mapping, perhaps we can track for each digit what it is currently expanded into, considering all previous substitutions.\n\nBut how can we model that? Because when we have a substitution for a digit, say, d → t, then any occurrence of d in the current string will be replaced by t. However, during this replacement, the t may contain other digits which may have their own mappings. But those mappings would have been processed earlier. Wait, but if we process substitutions in order, then when we process a substitution for d, any prior substitutions for other digits would have already been applied. So, for example, if we have a substitution for 2→00, then substitution for 0→1, then the 2's expansion is 00, which would then be replaced by 11. However, if we model this with a mapping, then when we process the 0→1 substitution, we can update the mapping for 0. But when we process the 2 substitution, the expansion is 00, which would have to be replaced with the current expansion of 0, which is 1. Wait, no. Because when the substitution is applied, the replacement is done at the time of the query. So when we process the first query (2→00), the current string is modified by replacing all 2s with 00. Then, when we process the second query (0→1), we replace all 0s in the current string with 1s. So the order is sequential. Therefore, the expansion of a digit depends",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly applying each substitution can be computationally expensive due to potential large string sizes and many queries. Instead, we can use dynamic programming to track the transformations for each digit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Mapping**: Maintain a mapping for each digit from '0' to '9' that represents what it expands to after all previous substitutions. This mapping is updated as we process each query.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo $10^9 + 7$, we use modular arithmetic to keep numbers manageable and avoid overflow.\n3. **Efficient String Replacement**: Instead of modifying the entire string for each query, we use the DP mapping to compute the value of each digit in the original string, considering all previous substitutions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize the mapping: for each digit, what it expands to\n    # Initially, each digit maps to itself\n    mapping = {}\n    for d in '0123456789':\n        mapping[d] = d\n    \n    # Process each query\n    for q in queries:\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1]\n        # Update the mapping for d to t, but using current mappings for characters in t\n        # However, since we want to process the replacement in the order of queries, we need to\n        # expand t using the current mapping.

However, the substitution is done at the time of the query, so t is taken as-is.\n        # Wait, no! The substitution replaces d with t. So the t is used as is, regardless of any\n        # future substitutions. Because the query is processed in order. So when we replace d with t,\n        # the t is fixed at that moment. So we need to store t as is, and during the final calculation,\n        # expand all digits according to the current mapping.\n        # So the mapping for d is set to t. But then, when processing subsequent queries, if another\n        # digit is replaced, it's handled separately.\n        # So, the mapping is updated directly with the t string, not expanded.\n        # Wait, no. For example, if we have a query 2->00, and then a query 0->1, then when processing\n        # the first query, we set mapping['2'] = '00'. Then, when processing the second query, mapping['0'] = '1'.\n        # Then, when we compute the final value, we need to expand the original string by replacing each\n        # digit according to the current mapping. So, for the original '2', it would be replaced by '00', which\n        # then each '0' would be replaced by '1', resulting in '11'.\n        # Therefore, during the mapping updates, we must not expand the t string, because the substitutions\n        # are applied in order. So, for example, when we process the query 2->00, we set mapping['2'] to '00',\n        # and later, when we process 0->1, we set mapping['0'] to '1'.
