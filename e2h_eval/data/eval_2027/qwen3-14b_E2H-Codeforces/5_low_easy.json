Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The colors can be specific letters or question marks, which are wildcards. \n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Let's break it down.\n\nThe main idea is to match left boots with right boots in such a way that their colors are compatible. Since each boot can be used once, we need to maximize the number of such pairs.\n\nLet me think about possible steps:\n\n1. For each left boot and right boot, check if they are compatible. But since n can be up to 150,000, checking all possible pairs is O(n²), which would be way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, what's a better way?\n\nLet me think about grouping the boots by their color. For example, for the left boots, count how many of each color (including ?) there are. Similarly for the right boots. Then, try to match them optimally.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think about the following: For each color c (excluding ?), the number of left boots with color c can be matched with the number of right boots with color c. Because those pairs are compatible. Also, the ? can be used to fill in the gaps where there's a mismatch between left and right colors.\n\nWait, but the ? can be matched with any color, including other ?. So perhaps we should first match the non-? colors as much as possible, and then use the ?s to cover the remaining.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\n- For each color c (from 'a' to 'z'), find the minimum between the count of left boots with color c and the count of right boots with color c. Add that to the total pairs. Then subtract those from both counts. Then, handle the remaining left and right ?s.\n\nBut wait, after that, the remaining left and right boots would be those with ? or colors that couldn't be matched. For example, if there are some left boots with color 'a' and right boots with color 'b', but after matching same colors, there's leftover. But those can't be matched unless they have ?.\n\nWait, no. The remaining left and right boots after matching same colors would be those that have colors that don't match. But maybe some of them are ?. So perhaps after handling the same-color matches, the remaining left and right boots can be matched using the ?s.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nFirst, process all non-? colors. For each color c (not ?), match as many left[c] with right[c], and add that to the total. Then, collect all the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't be matched because their color didn't match). These would be the ones with ? in either left or right, or colors that couldn't be matched.\n\nBut then, the ? can be matched with any of the remaining. However, how to pair them optimally.\n\nWait, but after processing the same-color matches, the remaining left boots could be:\n\nFor example, left boots with color 'a' (but no right 'a's left), and right boots with color 'b' (but no left 'b's left). But these can't be matched unless one of them is a ?.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way is to first match the same-colored pairs, then for the remaining, match the ?s with any available boots.\n\nBut how to track which boots are left and which are not.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is not only about counting but also about selecting which specific boots to pair. Because the output requires the actual indices of the boots.\n\nSo the initial approach of counting is not sufficient. We need to track which boots are used.\n\nHmm. So the problem is more complex than just counting. Because we need to select the actual pairs.\n\nLet me think again. How to model this.\n\nLet's think about the steps required:\n\nStep 1: Match left and right boots with the same color (non-?).\n\nFor example, for each color c (not ?), we can pair as many left boots with color c and right boots with color c. For each such pair, we can select a left and a right boot, mark them as used, and add to the result.\n\nBut how to efficiently find which left and right boots to pair. For example, for each color c, collect all the left indices with that color, and all right indices with that color. Then pair them in some order (like first left with first right, etc.)\n\nOnce that is done, we can proceed to Step 2: deal with the remaining boots (those not matched yet) and use the ?s.\n\nNow, the remaining boots can be:\n\n- Left boots with color ?, and/or right boots with color ?",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The goal is to pair each left boot with a right boot such that their colors are compatible, using the constraints provided.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Same Color Matching**: First, match left boots with right boots that have the same specific color (excluding '?'). This ensures direct compatibility without needing any wildcard.\n2. **Wildcard Matching**: After handling same-color matches, use the remaining '?' characters from both left and right boots to form additional pairs. '?' can be paired with any other color, including other '?'.\n3. **Track Used Boots**: Maintain sets to track which boots have already been used to ensure each boot is used at most once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # For each color, store the list of indices (0-based)\n    left_color_map = {}\n    right_color_map = {}\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        c = l[i]\n        if c not in left_color_map:\n            left_color_map[c] = []\n        left_color_map[c].append(i)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        c = r[i]\n        if c not in right_color_map:\n            right_color_map[c] = []\n        right_color_map[c].append(i)\n\n    # Track used indices\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    result = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match same color (non '?')\n    for c in left_color_map:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        if c in right_color_map:\n            left_list = left_color_map[c]\n            right_list = right_color_map[c]\n            min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(min_len):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n                    result.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                    used_left[left_idx] = True\n                    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    # Step 2: Handle the '?' in left and right\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]:\n            left_q.append(i)\n        if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]:\n            right_q.append(i)\n\n    # Now pair left_q with right_q\n    min_len = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        left_idx = left_q[i]\n        right_idx = right_q[i]\n        result.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    # Step 3: Try to match remaining '?' with non-? boots\n    # For left's ? that are not used\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]:\n            # Find any right that is not used\n            for j in range(n):\n                if not used_right[j] and r[j] != '?':\n                    result.append((i + 1, j + 1))\n                    used_left[i] = True\n                    used_right[j] = True\n                    break\n\n    # For right's ? that are not used\n    for j in range(n):\n        if r[j] == '?' and not used_right[j]:\n            # Find any left that is not used\n            for i in range(n):\n                if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?':\n                    result.append((i + 1, j + 1))\n                    used_left[i] = True\n                    used_right[j] = True\n                    break\n\n    print(len(result))\n    for pair in result:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Color Mapping**: We map each color to the list of indices where that color appears in both the left and right boots.\n3. **Same Color Matching**: We first match boots of the same specific color (excluding '?') directly.\n4. **Wildcard Matching**: After handling same-color matches, we handle wildcards ('?') by pairing them with other wildcards or non-wildcard boots, ensuring all possible compatible pairs are considered.\n5. **Output**: Finally, the results are printed, showing the maximum number of compatible pairs and their respective indices.",
