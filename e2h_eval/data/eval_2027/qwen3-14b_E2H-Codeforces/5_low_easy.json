Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to pair left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The colors can be letters or question marks, which are wildcards. The goal is to find the maximum number of pairs possible. And then output those pairs with their indices.\n\nHmm. So first, how do I approach this? Let's think about the steps.\n\nThe main idea is to pair left boots with right boots in a way that their colors match. The question marks can match anything. But each boot can only be used once.\n\nLet me think about the strategy. Maybe we can first try to pair specific colors. Like, for each color (excluding '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. Then handle the question marks.\n\nWait, but how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\n1. For each color c (from 'a' to 'z'), count the number of left boots with color c (excluding ?), and the number of right boots with color c (excluding ?). The minimum of these two counts would be the number of pairs we can make for that color. Then, subtract those from the counts for both sides. Because those boots are already paired.\n\nBut wait, but what about the question marks? Those can be used to pair with any remaining boots, either specific or other ?s.\n\nSo maybe the steps are:\n\n- First, process all specific colors (non-?) and pair them up. For example, for each color c, take the min of left[c] and right[c], and add that to the total. Then subtract those from left and right counts.\n\n- Then, process the question marks. The remaining left ?s and right ?s can be paired among themselves. Also, the remaining left ?s can pair with any remaining right specific colors (but those have already been processed?), no. Wait, no. Because after the first step, the specific colors have been paired as much as possible. So the remaining specific colors on left or right would be those that couldn't be paired because there were not enough on the other side.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the first step: for each color c (not ?), we pair left[c] with right[c], taking the min of the two. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, we pair 3 of them. Then, the left 'a's are all used up, and the right 'a's have 2 left.\n\nBut then, those remaining right 'a's can't be paired with any left 'a's. However, they could be paired with left '?'s. Similarly, left '?'s can pair with right specific colors.\n\nSo the second step is to pair the remaining left '?'s and right '?'s. But also, the remaining left '?'s can pair with any remaining right specific colors (those that weren't matched in the first step) and vice versa.\n\nWait, but how to maximize the total pairs.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFirst, for each color c (non-?), pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either ? or some colors that couldn't be matched), pair the ?s with whatever is left.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nWe can have three types of pairs:\n\n1. Specific color pairs (both non-?).\n\n2. Left ? with right specific.\n\n3. Right ? with left specific.\n\n4. Both ?.\n\nSo the optimal way is to first pair the specific colors, then pair the ?s with whatever is left, and then pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother approach: Let's collect all the left boots and right boots, and for each, track their positions. Then, for pairing:\n\nFirst, pair left and right boots that have the same color (non-?).\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots, pair the ones with ? with others.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n- Create two dictionaries: left_counts and right_counts, which count the number of each color (including ?) in the left and right strings.\n\n- For each color c in a-z (non-?), pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, the number of pairs for color c is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). Then, subtract that from both left_counts and right_counts. Then, add that to the total pairs.\n\n- After that, the remaining left and right boots are those with ? and any colors that couldn't be paired (but for those colors, they have zero in one side or the other). Now, the remaining left and right ?s can be paired. The number of such pairs is min(left_counts['?'], right_counts['?']). Add that to the total.\n\nBut wait, this approach may not",
