The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine if a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake graph as defined. Let's try to understand what the snowflake structure looks like.\n\nFrom the description, the snowflake is built in a certain way. Let me rephrase the construction steps:\n\n1. Start with one vertex.\n2. Connect it to k new vertices (k > 1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices. But wait, the initial vertex is connected to k new ones. So the total is 1 + k.\n3. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those new ones added in the previous step) must be connected to k more new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. \n\nSo, the process is like building layers. The first layer is the initial node. Then, the second layer is the k children of the root. Then, each of those nodes in the second layer gets k children, which forms the third layer. But this step (adding layers) must be done at least once. Wait, the step where you add k new vertices to each leaf is done at least once. So, the minimal snowflake would be when you have two layers: the root and then its k children. But wait, the step says that after adding the initial k children, you have to perform the step where each leaf (which is the k nodes) adds k new children. So the minimal snowflake would have three layers: root (layer 1), k nodes (layer 2), and each of those k nodes has k children (layer 3). So total nodes would be 1 + k + k*k = 1 + k + k². But wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me think again.\n\nThe construction steps:\n\nInitially, one vertex. Then, connect to k new vertices. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so the ones added in the first step) are connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the first step is adding the first layer (k nodes), then the second step (adding another layer). So the minimal snowflake is when we do this step once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k * k. Because the first step adds k nodes, and the second step adds k * k nodes (each of the k nodes adds k new ones).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the step \"should be done at least once\". So the initial step (connecting the root to k nodes) is mandatory. Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf (which are the nodes from the first step) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has three layers: root, first layer (k nodes), second layer (k² nodes). So total n = 1 + k + k². But maybe there are more steps. For example, after adding the second layer, you could do the same step again. So each time, the leaves are expanded by k children. So the total number of nodes depends on how many times this expansion is done.\n\nSo, the general structure is that the snowflake is built in layers. Let's think about the number of layers. Let me think of the process as follows:\n\nLet's say that the construction starts with the root. Then, for m steps, each step adds a new layer. But the first step is adding the first layer (the root's children), and then each subsequent step adds a layer. However, according to the problem statement, the step of adding new children to the leaves must be done at least once. So the number of layers is at least 2. Because the first step is the initial addition of the first layer (k nodes), then the second step (adding another layer) is required. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of layers minus 1. Wait, maybe I need to model this differently.\n\nAlternatively, the snowflake is constructed in such a way that the number of nodes is of the form:\n\nn = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{d-1} )\n\nwhere d is the number of times the expansion step is done. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again.\n\nLet me think of the process as follows. The initial node is layer 0. Then, the first expansion (step 1) adds k nodes to layer 0, forming layer 1. Then, each node in layer 1 must have their own k children. So that's step 2, which adds k * k nodes (layer 2). Then, if we do another step, each node in layer 2 would get k children (layer 3), and so on. The problem says that the expansion step (the step where you add k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So, the minimal case is when we do this step once. Which would mean that there are two expansions: the first expansion (adding layer 1) is mandatory, and then the second expansion (adding layer 2) is done once. So the total number of nodes would be 1 (layer 0) + k (layer 1) + k^2 (layer 2) = 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut if we do more expansions, then for example, if we do three expansions (i.e., the expansion step is done twice), then the total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe initial step is creating the root (layer 0). Then, the first expansion is adding k children (layer 1). Then, the second expansion is adding k children to each node in layer 1 (so layer 2). Then, the third expansion is adding k children to each node in layer 2 (layer 3). Each expansion is done once. So the number of expansions is d, where d ≥ 1 (since the expansion step must be done at least once). Wait, the initial step (adding the first layer) is part of the construction. Then, the expansion step (adding new children to the leaves) is done at least once. So the first expansion (adding layer 1) is part of the initial step, but the expansion steps (adding layers beyond that) are done once or more.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so those k vertices) are connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, the expansion step (adding k nodes to each leaf) is done once. So the total is 1 + k + k^2. But if the expansion step is done multiple times, then for example, after adding the first expansion (layer 1), then doing expansion step once (layer 2), then again (layer 3), etc. So the number of layers is 1 + d, where d is the number of times the expansion step is done. Since the expansion step must be done at least once, d ≥ 1.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{d} ), where d is ≥1? Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial step is adding k nodes (layer 1). Then, the expansion step is done once: each node in layer 1 adds k children (layer 2). Then, if we do another expansion step, each node in layer 2 adds k children (layer 3). So the total number of nodes is:\n\nFor d expansion steps (d ≥1):\n\nTotal nodes = 1 (root) + k (layer1) + k^2 (layer2) + ... + k^{d+1} ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think for d=1 (one expansion step):\n\nInitial step: 1 node.\n\nThen, add k nodes (layer 1). Now, 1 + k.\n\nThen, expansion step (done once): each of the k nodes in layer 1 adds k children. So adding k * k nodes (layer 2). Total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nIf d is the number of expansion steps, then the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d). Because:\n\nThe first expansion step (after initial step) adds k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k^m nodes, where m increases. Wait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nTotal nodes = 1 + k * ( (k^{d+1} - 1)/(k - 1) ) ?\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k^m nodes where m increases. Let me think:\n\nAfter the initial step (layer 1), the number of nodes is 1 + k.\n\nThen, the first expansion step (d=1) adds k^2 nodes (layer 2). So total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSecond expansion step (d=2) adds k^3 nodes (layer 3). So total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo for d expansion steps (each expansion step is done once), the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{d+1}? No. Wait, the initial step is adding k (layer 1). Then, each expansion step adds k^m for m starting from 2?\n\nWait, the initial step is 1 node. Then, after adding the first layer (k nodes), that's 1 +k. Then, each expansion step adds k^m nodes. For example, the first expansion step (adding layer 2) adds k^2 nodes. The second expansion step adds k^3 nodes. So if there are m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nWait, no. Let me count the number of expansion steps. The problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, the expansion step (adding new children to the leaves) is done once. So in this case, the expansion steps is once. Then, the total is 1 +k +k^2. Which is 1 + sum_{i=1}^2 k^i.\n\nSo, for m expansion steps (each expansion step is adding a new layer), the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i ?\n\nNo, because for m expansion steps, the number of layers is 1 (initial) + m steps. Wait, the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. So for m expansion steps, there are m layers added beyond the initial one. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1} ?\n\nWait, no. Let's take m=1 expansion steps. Then:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node (root)\n\nLayer 1: k nodes (added in the initial step)\n\nLayer 2: k^2 nodes (added in the first expansion step)\n\nTotal is 1 +k +k^2 = sum_{i=0}^2 k^i.\n\nWhich is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So for m expansion steps, the total is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i ?\n\nNo, because m expansion steps would generate m+1 layers? Or m layers?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes is 1 + k * ( (k^{m} - 1) / (k - 1) )) ?\n\nWait, let's think again. The initial step is adding k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k * (number of nodes in the previous layer). Because each node in the previous layer adds k children. So, the initial layer is layer 1 (k nodes). Then, layer 2 has k * k = k^2 nodes. Layer 3 has k^3 nodes. So if there are m expansion steps (after the initial step), the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i ?\n\nBecause the initial step is adding layer 1 (i=1), and each expansion step adds a new layer. So for m expansion steps, the number of layers is m+1. So the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nBut that seems to be the case. So for example, m=1 expansion steps (the minimum required), the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut then, the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So m ≥1. Therefore, the possible n values are numbers that can be written as 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} for some k>1 and m≥1.\n\nBut how can we check if a given n can be expressed in such a form?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes can be written as:\n\nn = 1 + k * ( (k^{m} -1) / (k-1) )) ?\n\nWait, because the sum from i=1 to m+1 of k^i is equal to sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i -1 = [ (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) ] -1. But perhaps that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the sum of k^0 + k^1 + ... +k^t = (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1). So, if our total nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{t} k^i, where t ≥ 2 (since m ≥1 implies t = m+1 ≥ 2?), then:\n\nn = 1 + sum_{i=1}^t k^i = sum_{i=0}^t k^i = (k^{t+1} - 1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but that's only true if the sum from i=0 to t is (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1). So if the total number of nodes is that sum, then for example, when t=2, that's 1 +k +k^2. Which would be the case when m=1 expansion steps.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^{d} - 1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 2 (since t+1 = d, so t = d-1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me rephrase.\n\nLet me think of the total number of nodes as S = (k^d - 1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 2. Because for d=2, S = (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. But that's not matching with the earlier example where for d=2, the total was 1 +k +k^2. Wait, no. Oh, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nIf the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2 (since m is the number of layers after the initial step, but perhaps that's not the right way). Let me think again.\n\nIn the example of the minimal snowflake, the total is 1 +k +k^2. Which is equal to (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So for that case, d=3. So S = (k^d -1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 3? Because when d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. But then, if d is the exponent, then the sum is from i=0 to d-1 of k^i. So S = sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i = (k^d -1)/(k-1). \n\nSo in that case, for the snowflake to be possible, n must be equal to (k^d -1)/(k-1), where k ≥2, d ≥3. Because the minimal case is d=3, which gives (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. \n\nWait, but why d ≥3? Because in the minimal case, the expansion step is done once. Let me see:\n\nThe expansion steps are done once. Which adds the layer 2 (k^2 nodes). So the total is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So d is 3.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^d -1)/(k-1) for integers k ≥2 and d ≥3. \n\nBut wait, what about other possibilities? Like, suppose there are multiple expansion steps. For example, if we have d=4, then n = (k^4 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. Which would correspond to adding three layers (layer 1, 2, 3). Which requires that the expansion step is done twice (after the initial step, adding layer 1, then adding layer 2, then adding layer 3). So yes, that's allowed. So the general condition is that n can be written as (k^d -1)/(k-1) where k ≥2, d ≥3. \n\nSo the problem becomes: for a given n, check if there exists integers k ≥2 and d ≥3 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nBut how can we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, note that (k^d -1)/(k-1) = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nSo for each possible d ≥3, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that this sum equals n. \n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check this.\n\nThe idea is that for each possible d (starting from 3 up to some maximum), we can check if there's a k that satisfies the equation. \n\nBut what is the maximum possible value of d? For example, for d, the minimal value of (k^d -1)/(k-1) is when k=2. So for each d, the minimal n is 2^d -1 (since when k=2, (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1). For example, d=3 gives 7. So for n=7, it's possible. But for larger d, the minimal n grows exponentially. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible d is around log2(1e18) + 1. Let's compute log2(1e18) is about 60, since 2^60 is ~1e18. So d can be up to 60. So for each test case, we can iterate d from 3 up to 60, and for each d, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck if there exists d ≥3 and integer k ≥2 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nBut how to check for each d?\n\nFor each d, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for fixed d, the function f(k) = (k^d -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing with k. Because as k increases, the sum increases. So for each d, we can find if there's a k such that f(k) = n.\n\nBut for each d, how do we find k?\n\nLet me think about the function f(k) for fixed d. For example, for d=3, f(k) = 1 +k +k². For fixed d, the function is strictly increasing with k. So for a given d, we can perform a binary search on k between 2 and some upper bound. The upper bound can be found as follows: since f(k) increases with k, and for k ≥2, f(k) ≥ 1 +2 + 2^2 + ... +2^{d-1} = 2^d -1. So for a given n, if n < 2^d -1, then there's no solution for this d. Otherwise, we can binary search for k.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k for a given d?\n\nWell, since f(k) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1} ≤ k^{d-1} * d (since each term is at most k^{d-1} and there are d terms). So for a given n, we can set the upper bound for k as something like n^(1/(d-1)) + 1. Because for k^d >= n, but perhaps that's not precise. Alternatively, since for k ≥2, f(k) is at least 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} (since all terms are positive). So if n ≥k^{d-1}, then k can be up to n^(1/(d-1)).\n\nSo for each d, we can binary search k in [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound is something like n^(1/(d-1)) + 1. However, since n can be up to 1e18, and d is up to 60, this seems feasible.\n\nSo the steps for each test case:\n\nFor each possible d from 3 to 60 (since for d=60, the minimal n is 2^60 -1 which is about 1e18, so for higher d, the minimal n would be larger than 1e18, so we can stop when d exceeds log2(n)+1).\n\nFor each d, perform a binary search on k in [2, ... , upper_bound] to see if f(k) = n. If any such k exists, return YES.\n\nAdditionally, there's another possibility: when d=2. Wait, earlier analysis said that d must be ≥3. But why? Because for d=2, (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. So the total number of nodes would be k+1. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem says that the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So for example, the minimal case is when the initial step (adding k children to the root) is done, then the expansion step is done once. Which gives us 1 +k +k² nodes. Which corresponds to d=3 in the formula (k^d -1)/(k-1) = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². So d must be at least 3.\n\nBut what if d=2? Then (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would be the case where the snowflake has only 1 +k nodes. That would correspond to the initial step (adding k children to the root) and no expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. Hence, this case is invalid. So d must be ≥3.\n\nTherefore, the code must check for d ≥3.\n\nSo the code will loop for d from 3 to up to say 60. For each d, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how to compute (k^d -1)/(k-1) without overflowing? Well, in Python, big integers are handled, but for efficiency, perhaps we can compute it as sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i. However, for large d and large k, this may take O(d) time per check. But since d is up to 60, and per test case, this is manageable.\n\nBut during binary search, for a given k and d, we need to compute the sum and compare to n. However, for large exponents, even calculating k^d may be expensive. But perhaps we can compute the sum incrementally and check if it exceeds n, to avoid overflow. Wait, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search for k, for a given k and d, compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} and check if s ==n. However, for large d and k, this can be computationally intensive. For example, if d is 60 and k is 1e5, then k^d is way larger than 1e18, but since n is up to 1e18, we can stop early if the sum exceeds n during calculation.\n\nSo, for each k and d, we can compute the sum incrementally. Let's think of it as:\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to d-1:\n\n    sum += k^i\n\nif sum ==n → yes.\n\nBut computing k^i for each step may be expensive. However, for small d (like up to 60), and for each binary search step, this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum using the formula (k^d -1)//(k-1), but only when k !=1. But since k ≥2, that's okay. However, for very large exponents, calculating k^d may be time-consuming. But in Python, exponentiation is optimized, and for d up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, during the sum computation, we can check if the sum exceeds n, and break early. For example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut for the binary search, this would allow us to compute the sum without overflowing. For example, if during the sum calculation, the total exceeds n, we can return early.\n\nThis approach would be efficient for checking whether the sum equals n.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n    if n is 1 → no (since the minimal is 1 +k +k^2, which is at least 1 +2 +4=7)\n\n    else:\n\n        for d in 3 to max_d:\n\n            low = 2\n\n            high = ?\n\n            find if there exists a k such that compute_sum(k, d) ==n.\n\n            if yes, return YES.\n\n        also check if n can be written as k + 1 (but this is invalid as per the problem constraints, since expansion steps must be done once. So no.)\n\n        if none found, return NO.\n\nBut what about other possibilities? For example, the snowflake could have different structures. Wait, according to the problem statement, the snowflake is built by adding layers. So the only possible forms are the ones that can be written as (k^d -1)/(k-1) for k ≥2 and d ≥3. Are there any other possibilities?\n\nWait, another possibility: suppose that the expansion steps are not done for all layers. For example, maybe the expansion steps are done for some layers, but not others. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So the process is: after adding the first layer (k nodes), you must do the expansion step (adding k children to each of the leaves) at least once. So the minimal is two layers (after the initial step). So the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2. But if you do the expansion step once, then you have two layers (layer 1 and 2). If you do the expansion step again, you add layer 3, etc. So the total nodes is always the sum from i=0 to m of k^i, where m ≥2. Which is equivalent to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So m+1 is d ≥3. Therefore, the formula holds.\n\nSo the code can proceed as outlined.\n\nNow, the next question is: what is the maximum possible d to check?\n\nFor example, for n=1e18, the minimal value of (k^d -1)/(k-1) is when k=2, which is 2^d -1. So solving 2^d -1 ≤1e18 → d ≤ log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60. So for d up to 60, we can check.\n\nThus, for each test case, we can loop d from 3 to 60. For each d, perform a binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound].\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k for each d?\n\nFor a given d, the minimal value of the sum is when k=2: sum is 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^{d-1} = 2^d -1. So if n < 2^d -1, then no possible k for this d. Else, we can find k.\n\nThe upper bound for k can be determined as follows: for the sum to be equal to n, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} =n. Since each term is positive, the sum is at least k^{d-1} (since there are d terms, each at least 1, but for k≥2, the largest term is k^{d-1} and the rest are smaller). So k^{d-1} ≤n → k ≤ n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nThus, for binary search, the upper bound can be set to n^(1/(d-1)) +1.\n\nBut in Python, we can compute this as int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2. However, for very large exponents, this might not be precise due to floating point errors. So perhaps, for the binary search, we can start with low=2 and high= some upper limit, say, 2, and keep doubling until the sum exceeds n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut for the purposes of code, perhaps the following approach is better:\n\nFor each d:\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = 2\n\n   while compute_sum(high, d) <n:\n\n       high *=2\n\n   then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut this may be time-consuming for some cases. However, given that d is up to 60 and t is 1e4, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each d, compute the upper bound as n^(1/(d-1)) + 1, but with care for integer precision.\n\nBut perhaps the first approach is easier to code.\n\nSo, the code outline for checking a particular d:\n\ndef check(n, d):\n\n    # find if there exists k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i ==n\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    while compute_sum(high, d) < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # now binary search between low and high\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, d)\n\n        if s ==n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif s <n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut how to implement compute_sum?\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, for very large exponents, this may be slow. However, given that d is up to 60, and for each test case, it's manageable.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nWe need to handle t test cases. For each n:\n\nif n is 1: output NO (since the minimal is 7 for k=2, d=3)\n\nelse:\n\n   for d in 3 to 60:\n\n       if check(n, d) is True → output YES and break.\n\n   else → output NO\n\nBut also, there's another case: what if the snowflake is constructed with multiple expansion steps but not all layers? Wait, no. Because the expansion steps are done until the required layers. So the formula holds.\n\nBut let's look at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1 → NO\n\n2 → NO\n\n3 → NO\n\n6 → NO\n\n13 → YES\n\n15 → YES\n\n255 → YES\n\n10101 → YES\n\n1000000000000000000 → NO\n\nSample Output:\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nLet's check for example n=13.\n\nCheck for d=3:\n\nWe need to find k where 1 +k +k^2 =13 →k^2 +k +1 =13 →k² +k -12=0 →k=( -1 ± sqrt(1 +48 ))/2 → sqrt(49)=7 → ( -1 +7)/2 = 3. So k=3. So yes. Hence, YES.\n\nAnother example: n=15. Let's see:\n\nFor d=3: 1 +k +k² =15 →k² +k -14=0 → roots are (-1 ± sqrt(1 +56))/2 → sqrt(57) is ~7.5 → ( -1 +7.5)/2 ~ 3.25 → no integer k.\n\nFor d=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ =15. Let's try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 → yes! So for d=4, k=2. So YES.\n\nHence, 15 is valid.\n\nAnother example: n=255.\n\nCheck for d=3: 1 +k +k² =255 →k² +k -254 =0 → sqrt(1 + 4*254) = sqrt(1017) ~31.9 → ( -1 +31.9)/2 ~ 15.45 → not integer.\n\nCheck for d=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ =255. Try k=4: 1 +4 +16 +64 = 85 <255. k=5: 1+5+25+125=156. k=6: 1+6+36+216=259>255. So no.\n\nd=5: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ +k^4. Let's try k=3: 1+3+9+27+81= 121. k=4: 1+4+16+64+256= 341>255. So no.\n\nd=8: for k=2, sum is 2^8 -1 = 255. So (k^d -1)/(k-1) = (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So d=8, k=2. So yes.\n\nSo 255 is valid.\n\nSo the code should find this.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplement the check for each d from 3 to 60.\n\nBut what about when d is larger than log2(n) +1? For example, for d=60 and n=1e18, 2^60 is about 1.1e18. So for d=60, the minimal sum is 2^60 -1 which is about 1.1e18. So for n=1e18, it's less than that, so no solution for d=60. So the code would not check further.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n < 7 → output NO (since minimal is 7).\n\nElse:\n\nloop d from 3 to 60:\n\n   check if there exists a k for this d.\n\n   if yes, output YES and break.\n\nif none found, output NO.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 7? For d=3 and k=2: 1+2+4=7 → yes. So code returns YES.\n\nBut what about n=6? It's less than 7 → output NO.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for n=1, 2, 3, etc., we need to return NO.\n\nBut how to handle n=1?\n\nBut in the code, for n=1, the loop for d from 3 to 60 will not find anything, so returns NO.\n\nBut for n=7, the code will find for d=3, k=2.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for the compute_sum function, perhaps we can",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single vertex and expanding in a specific manner. The key insight is that the number of vertices in such a graph must be expressible in the form $(k^d - 1) / (k - 1)$ for integers $k \\geq 2$ and $d \\geq 3$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands in layers. Each layer adds vertices such that each vertex in the previous layer connects to `k` new vertices. This structure leads to the formula for the total number of vertices being $(k^d - 1) / (k - 1)$ where `d` is the number of layers and `k` is the number of children each vertex connects to.\n\n2. **Constraints Check**: For each test case, we check if the given number `n` can be represented in the form mentioned above. We iterate over possible values of `d` (from 3 to 60, as higher values would exceed the maximum possible `n` of $10^{18}$).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Valid `k`**: For each value of `d`, we use binary search to determine if there exists an integer `k` such that the sum of the geometric series up to `d` terms equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(d):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return float('inf')\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef check(n, d):\n    low = 2\n    high = 2\n    # Find upper bound\n    while compute_sum(high, d, n) < n:\n        high *= 2\n    # Binary search\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n        if s == n:\n            return True\n        elif s < n:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if n < 7:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        # Check for d from 3 to 60\n        for d in range(3, 61):\n            if check(n, d):\n                found = True\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series for given `k` and `d`. It stops early if the sum exceeds `n` to avoid unnecessary calculations.\n- **check**: This function uses binary search to determine if there exists a valid `k` for a given `d` such that the sum of the series equals `n`.\n- **main**: Reads input, processes each test case, and checks for valid configurations using the above functions. If any valid configuration is found, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations within the constraints, ensuring that we handle very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$ effectively.",
