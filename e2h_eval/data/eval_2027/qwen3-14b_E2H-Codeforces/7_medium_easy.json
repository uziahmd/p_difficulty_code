The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) get connected to k new vertices each. And this process is repeated at least once. Wait, the description says that each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. And this step should be done at least once. So the process is like building layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's consider the construction steps.\n\nLet me model the process. Let's say we have a certain number of layers. The initial step is layer 0: 1 node. Then layer 1 adds k nodes connected to the root. Then, for each subsequent layer, each node added in the previous layer (which has degree 1) gets k new nodes. But wait, each such node is connected to k new ones. So each layer adds more nodes.\n\nLet me think of it as a tree. The structure is similar to a tree where each node (except those in the last layer) has exactly k children. But the way the layers are built is such that each node in a layer has exactly k children in the next layer. However, the process requires that after the initial step, each node that is a leaf (connected to only one other) must have k new nodes added. And this step is done at least once. So the minimal case would be when we have two layers. Let's see:\n\nFor example, with k=4:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node (root)\nLayer 1: 4 nodes connected to root. Now, each of these 4 nodes is a leaf (degree 1). So we add k=4 new nodes per each of them. So layer 2 adds 4*4 = 16 nodes. Total nodes is 1 + 4 + 16 = 21. But the example in the problem says that the minimal snowflake for k=4 is shown, which perhaps has 1+4 + 4*4 = 21 nodes? But in the sample input, for n=13, the answer is YES. Let me check.\n\nWait, the sample input includes n=13. How can that be possible?\n\nHmm, maybe the process isn't strictly requiring all layers to be built. Wait, the problem says that each time you add new nodes to the leaves, and this step is done at least once. So the minimal steps are:\n\nStart with 1 node (layer 0). Then add k nodes (layer 1). Then, since each of the layer 1 nodes is a leaf, we add k nodes to each of them. So that's layer 2. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But the problem says that this step (adding new nodes to the leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when you do it once. So the total is 1 + k + k^2. For example, if k=2, then the minimal is 1+2+4=7 nodes.\n\nBut in the sample input, when n=13, the output is YES. Let's see: 13 could be 1 + k +k^2. Let's solve for k. 1 +k +k²=13 → k² +k -12=0 → k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 48)] / 2 → sqrt(49) is 7. So ( -1 +7 )/2 = 3. So k=3. Then 1+3+9=13. So yes, that's valid. Hence, for n=13, answer is YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample is n=6. The output is NO. Let's check: 1 +k +k² =6 → k² +k -5=0 → discriminant is 1 +20=21. sqrt(21) is irrational. So no integer solution. So for k>1, there's no solution. Hence, n=6 is not possible. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be expressed as 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since the step must be done at least once). Wait, no. Wait, the process is that after the initial step (layer 0 and layer 1), we perform the step of adding new nodes to the leaves. The step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when you have two layers (after the initial step). So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. But what if you do more steps?\n\nFor example, after adding layer 2, you can add another layer. Each node in layer 2 is a leaf (degree 1), so you add k nodes per each. So layer 3 has k^3 nodes. The total would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. And so on. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1? Let's think again.\n\nWait, the initial step is creating the first layer. Then, the step of adding new nodes to leaves is done at least once. So the initial step is adding k nodes (layer 1). Then, the step is done once, which adds k^2 nodes (layer 2). So the total is 1 +k +k^2. So the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i where m ≥ 2? No. Because sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). For m=2, sum is 1 +k +k^2. So for the minimal case, m=2. But if we do more steps, then m increases. So the total number of nodes can be written as S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 1. Because m is the number of layers beyond the initial step. Wait, maybe I need to re-express the formula.\n\nLet me think: the process starts with 1 node. Then, each time, the current leaves (those with degree 1) are each expanded by adding k new nodes. The initial expansion is the first step. Then, the second step is expanding the leaves again. So the number of layers is m, where m ≥ 1. For example, m=1: the initial step (adding k nodes) and then one expansion (adding k^2 nodes). So total is 1 +k +k^2. For m=2, we have another expansion step, adding k^3 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the total is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i? No. Let me think again. The initial step is adding k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k times the number of leaves. The number of leaves is k^d, where d is the depth. So for each expansion step, the number of nodes added is k multiplied by the number of leaves from previous step.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes is 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m}) ), where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, maybe not. Let's think:\n\n- Initial node: 1.\n\n- First expansion (step 1): add k nodes. Now, the leaves are those k nodes. Then, each of those leaves is expanded by adding k nodes. So for the second expansion (step 2), we add k *k nodes. Then, for step 3, add k *k^2 nodes. And so on. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... +k^{m+1} }, where m is the number of expansion steps (each expansion step adds a new layer). But since the expansion steps must be done at least once, m ≥ 1. Therefore, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i, where m ≥1. Wait, sum_{i=0}^{m+1} is 1 + k + ... +k^{m+1}. But when m is 1, that would be 1 +k +k^2. Which is correct. So the total is S = (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, the formula for the geometric series sum_{i=0}^n r^i = (r^{n+1} -1)/(r-1). So if the sum is up to exponent t, then it's (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1). So in our case, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^t k^i, where t ≥ 2 (since m ≥1 implies that t = m+1 ≥ 2). For example, when m=1, t=2, sum is 1 +k +k^2. So the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^{t} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and t≥2. Wait, because t is m+1, and m ≥1 implies t ≥2.\n\nWait, but the formula for the sum from i=0 to t-1 of k^i is (k^t -1)/(k-1). So if the sum is up to exponent t-1, then the sum is (k^t -1)/(k-1). So in our case, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Let me rephrase: for the sum to be S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 2. Because when m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2, which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So yes. So the problem is equivalent to checking if n can be written as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and t≥2. Because t is m+1, and m ≥2 implies t ≥3? No, wait m is the number of layers. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal problem: the initial step is adding k nodes (layer 1). Then, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So for example, adding one expansion step (layer 2). So the total is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So t is 3 (since the sum is up to exponent 2, which is t-1=2 → t=3). So the formula is (k^t -1)/(k-1) with t ≥ 3? Or t ≥ 2?\n\nWait, for the sum up to exponent 2, the formula is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So for the sum to be S, we have S = (k^t -1)/(k-1) where t is the number of terms. Let me think: for sum from i=0 to m, that's m+1 terms. So for the sum 1 +k +k^2, that's m=2, which is 3 terms. So t is m+1=3. So the formula is (k^{t} -1)/(k-1) where t ≥3. Because m ≥2 implies t ≥3. But wait, what if the expansion steps are done once. So m=2 (sum up to 2), t=3.\n\nBut then, what if the expansion steps are done twice. Then the sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. Which is sum from i=0 to 3, which is t=4. So the formula is (k^4 -1)/(k-1). So for any t ≥3, the sum is (k^t -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut wait, for example, when t=2, the sum is 1 +k, which is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = (k-1)(k+1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would correspond to the case where the expansion steps were done zero times. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal t is 3, leading to sum 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: check if n can be expressed as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1, t≥3.\n\nBut also, note that for t=2, the sum is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. So for example, if n=k+1, but this would require that the expansion steps are done zero times. Which is invalid. Therefore, for our problem, the allowed values are t ≥3.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem statement again. The initial step is adding k new vertices (so that's the first step). Then, the step of adding new vertices to the leaves is done at least once. So the minimal case is adding one expansion step. Which gives sum 1 +k +k^2. So the allowed values are t ≥3. So the problem is to find if n can be written as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and t≥3.\n\nBut there's another possibility. What if the expansion steps are done once, but then some layers are not fully filled? No, the problem says that each time you add new nodes to the leaves. So the expansion steps are done in full. So for example, if you have a snowflake that is built for t=3 (sum 1 +k +k^2) or for t=4 (sum 1 +k +k^2 +k^3), etc. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for a given n, determine if there exists integers k>1 and t≥3 such that n = (k^t -1)/(k-1).\n\nNow, the challenge is to check for each n if such k and t exist.\n\nBut n can be up to 1e18, so we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, for each test case n, we need to check whether there exists some t ≥3 and k ≥2 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nk^t - 1 = n (k-1)\n\nk^t - 1 = n*k -n\n\nk^t - n*k + (n -1) = 0.\n\nNot sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (k^t -1) = (k-1)*n.\n\nBut for each possible t, we can try to find k such that this holds.\n\nBut for large n, trying all possible t is feasible? Let's think.\n\nFor example, for a given n, the maximum possible t is log_2(n). Because for k=2, the minimal value for t is 3, which gives (2^3 -1)/(2-1) = 7. For larger t, the value increases. So for example, for t=60, 2^60 is about 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum t is around 60.\n\nSo for each n, we can iterate over possible t from 3 up to log_2(n) (say up to 60), and for each t, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nSo for each t in 3..60, check if there is a k such that this equation holds.\n\nHow to check for a given t?\n\nLet me think for fixed t. Let's denote f(k) = (k^t -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nWe need to check if there exists k ≥2 such that f(k) =n.\n\nNote that f(k) is strictly increasing with k. Because for larger k, the sum increases. So for a fixed t, the function f(k) is strictly increasing in k. Therefore, for a given t, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there's a k that gives f(k)=n.\n\nBut what's the possible range of k for a given t?\n\nFor example, for t=3, the equation is 1 +k +k^2 =n → k^2 +k +1 =n → solving for k. Since k must be ≥2, for each t, we can compute the lower and upper bounds for k.\n\nBut for a given t, the minimal possible value of f(k) is f(2) = 1 +2 + 2^2 + ... +2^{t-1} = 2^t -1. Wait, no. Wait f(k) for t is sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i. So for k=2, it's 2^t -1. For example, t=3: 1+2+4=7=2^3-1=8-1=7.\n\nSo for a given t, the minimal value is 2^t -1. If n is less than that, then there's no solution for this t.\n\nSo for each t, we can check if n >= 2^t -1. If not, skip this t.\n\nOtherwise, we can perform a binary search for k in [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound can be determined. For example, since f(k) = sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i < t *k^{t-1}. So for n = f(k), we have t*k^{t-1} >n → k^{t-1} > n/t → k > (n/t)^{1/(t-1)}. So upper bound for k can be something like n^(1/(t-1)) + 1. But since t can be up to 60, for large n, this is manageable.\n\nBut for each t, how do we find k?\n\nLet me think for a given t, and n. We can binary search k between 2 and some upper limit.\n\nBut for example, for t=3, we have 1 +k +k^2 =n → k^2 +k +1 =n → solving for k. The upper limit for k is sqrt(n) (since k^2 < n → k < sqrt(n)).\n\nBut for larger t, the upper limit for k is smaller. For example, for t=60, even if n is 1e18, the k would be small, since 2^60 is about 1e18, so for t=60, k=2 would give sum 2^60 -1 ≈ 1e18. So for higher t, the possible k is small.\n\nSo for each t, we can perform a binary search on k. Let me outline the steps:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n is 1: answer is NO (since the minimal is 7 for t=3 and k=2).\n\n- Else, for t from 3 up to max_t (like 60), do:\n\n   - Compute the minimal value for this t: min_val = 2^t -1. If n < min_val → skip.\n\n   - Else, perform a binary search for k in [2, ... upper] where upper can be something like n^(1/(t-1)) + 1.\n\n   - For each candidate k during binary search, compute f(k) = 1 +k + ... +k^{t-1} and compare to n.\n\n   - If found, return YES.\n\nIf after checking all t, nothing is found, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute f(k) efficiently? For large t and k, computing k^t may be expensive. However, since t is up to 60, and k can be up to something like 1e6 (for t=3 and n up to 1e18, sqrt(1e18) is 1e9, but binary search would take log2(1e9) steps which is manageable).\n\nBut wait, for t up to 60, and k up to say 1e6, calculating k^t would be O(t) time. But with t up to 60, that's acceptable.\n\nBut there's a problem with overflow. For example, when k is large and t is large, k^t can be way bigger than 1e18. So during the calculation of f(k), we need to check for overflow. Because for example, if during the sum, the value exceeds n, we can stop early.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow.\n\nLet me think about how to compute f(k) for given t and k. The sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nWe can compute it as follows:\n\nInitialize sum = 0.\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to t-1:\n\n   sum += current_term\n\n   current_term *= k\n\nBut during this process, if sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that the sum is larger than n. Also, if current_term overflows, but since n is up to 1e18, and k is up to something like 1e6, for t=60, even k=2, the term would be 2^59 which is 5.7e17, which is less than 1e18. So for k up to 1e6 and t up to 60, the maximum term would be (1e6)^60 which is way larger than 1e18. So during the calculation, we need to check if adding the term would exceed n. If so, we can break early.\n\nBut in code, we can compute the sum step by step, and if during the calculation the sum exceeds n, we can return early.\n\nSo for example, during the sum calculation for a given k and t, we can check:\n\nsum = 0\n\nterm = 1\n\nfor i in 0 to t-1:\n\n   if sum > n: break\n\n   sum += term\n\n   term *= k\n\nBut even better, since we can compute the sum as (k^t -1)/(k-1). However, calculating k^t can be problematic for large k and t. So perhaps using the incremental approach is safer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n == 1: output NO\n\n   else:\n\n      for t in 3 to max_t:\n\n         min_val = 2^t -1\n\n         if n < min_val: continue\n\n         low = 2\n\n         high = ?\n\n         find upper bound for k. Since for k >=2, sum is increasing with k. So for the upper bound, we can compute an approximate value. For example, since the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{t-1} <= t *k^{t-1} <= n → k^{t-1} <=n → k <= n^{1/(t-1)}.\n\n         So high can be set to n^(1/(t-1)) + 1. But how to compute this in code?\n\n         Well, in Python, we can compute it as int(n ** (1/(t-1))) + 2. But for very large exponents, this might not be precise. However, for binary search, even if the upper bound is a bit higher than necessary, it's okay.\n\n         So perform binary search between low=2 and high=upper_bound.\n\n         For each mid in binary search:\n\n             compute the sum s = 1 +k + ... +k^{t-1}\n\n             if s == n: return YES\n\n             elif s <n: need to search higher\n\n             else: search lower\n\n         So during the binary search, for each mid, compute the sum and compare to n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum without overflowing? For example, when k is large and t is large, the sum can be very big. However, since in the binary search, we are checking if the sum equals n, and during the computation, once the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo in code, for a given k and t, the function to compute the sum and check if it's equal to n can be written as follows:\n\ndef check(k, t, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return 1  # sum is larger than n\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return 1\n\n        current *= k\n\n    if total == n:\n\n        return 0  # found\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # sum is less than n\n\nWait, but for t steps, the loop runs t times. For example, for t=3, the loop runs 3 times, adding 1, k, k^2. So yes.\n\nSo for each mid in binary search, we call this function. If it returns 0, then we have found a k and t, and return YES.\n\nBut how to handle the upper bound for k?\n\nIn Python, for the upper bound, for a given t, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{t-1} <=n. Since the sum is increasing with k, we can set high to something like n. But for large t, this can be too big. However, given that t is up to 60, and for each t, the binary search is O(log n) steps, and for each step, the check is O(t) steps, the overall complexity for each test case is acceptable.\n\nBut for example, for t=3, the upper bound for k can be up to sqrt(n). For n=1e18, sqrt(n) is 1e9. So binary search would take about 30 steps, each with O(3) operations. So manageable.\n\nBut for t=3, the minimal value is 2^3 -1 =7. So for n=7, it's possible. For n=7, t=3, k=2.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = input value\n\n    if n == 1:\n\n        print NO\n\n    else:\n\n        found = False\n\n        for t in 3 to 60:\n\n            # compute minimal value for this t\n\n            min_val = 2^t -1\n\n            if n < min_val:\n\n                continue\n\n            # now, find k such that sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i =n\n\n            # find upper bound for k:\n\n            # since sum >=k^{t-1} (since 1 + ... +k^{t-1} >=k^{t-1})\n\n            # so k^{t-1} <=n → k <=n^(1/(t-1))\n\n            # but in practice, we can set high to n, but that would be too slow for large t.\n\n            # better to compute high as n^(1/(t-1)) + 2\n\n            # but how to compute that in Python?\n\n            # use exponentiation with fractional exponents.\n\n            # but for cases where t-1 is large, n^(1/(t-1)) can be small.\n\n            # for example, when t=60, t-1=59, n=1e18, then n^(1/59) is about 1e(18/59) ~ 1e0.3 ~ 2. So high can be 2 or 3.\n\n            # So in code, we can compute high as something like 2, but perhaps better to use binary search with high starting as 2, and doubling until the sum exceeds n.\n\n            # Alternatively, use binary search with high as n, but that's not efficient for large t. But given that t is up to 60, and for each t, the binary search would take O(log n) steps, it's manageable.\n\n            # So let's proceed with setting low=2, high=2, and while the sum for high is less than n, multiply high by 2.\n\n            # This is called exponential search to find upper bound.\n\n            low = 2\n\n            high = 2\n\n            while True:\n\n                # compute sum for high and t\n\n                s = compute_sum(high, t)\n\n                if s >n:\n\n                    break\n\n                else:\n\n                    high *=2\n\n            # Now, binary search between low and high\n\n            # perform binary search between low and high\n\n            left = 2\n\n            right = high\n\n            while left <= right:\n\n                mid = (left + right) //2\n\n                s = compute_sum(mid, t)\n\n                if s ==n:\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                elif s <n:\n\n                    left = mid +1\n\n                else:\n\n                    right = mid -1\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        if found:\n\n            print YES\n\n        else:\n\n            print NO\n\nBut how to implement compute_sum(mid, t) efficiently, with early termination?\n\nYes, as discussed earlier. Let's code that as a helper function.\n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, even with 1e18, the sum can be computed as long as we check for overflow during the steps.\n\nSo the helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return 1  # sum exceeds n\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return 1\n\n        current *=k\n\n    if total ==n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1\n\nWait, but for example, if after adding all terms, the total is less than n, return -1. If equal, return 0, else return 1.\n\nBut in the binary search, when we call compute_sum, we can check the return value.\n\nBut for the case where the sum exceeds n, we can return early.\n\nNow, considering that for each test case, the maximum t is 60 (since for t=60, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is the maximum n. For t=60, the minimal sum is 2^60 -1, which is 1,152,921,504,606,846,975. For n=1e18, which is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, that's less than 2^60-1. So for t=60, the minimal value is larger than n=1e18. Hence, for t=60, the code would skip. So the maximum t to check is up to log2(n)+1.\n\nBut for n=1e18, log2(n) is about 60. So t can go up to 60.\n\nSo in code, for each test case, we can iterate t from 3 to 60.\n\nBut wait, for example, for t=3, the minimal sum is 7. For n=7, it's valid. For larger t, say t=4, the minimal sum is 2^4 -1 = 15. So for n=15, it's possible with t=4, k=2. 1+2+4+8 =15. So yes.\n\nSo the code needs to check for all t from 3 up to 60.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nSample Input 1: n=1 → output NO.\n\nSample Input 2: n=2 → output NO. Because for t=3, minimal is 7. So no possible.\n\nSample Input 3: n=3 → no.\n\nSample Input 4: n=6 → no.\n\nSample Input 5: n=13 → yes (t=3, k=3 → 1+3+9=13).\n\nSample Input 6: n=15 → yes (t=4, k=2 → 1+2+4+8=15).\n\nSample Input 7: n=255 → let's see. For example, 2^8-1=255. But that's for t=8, k=2. Because sum_{i=0}^7 2^i = 2^8 -1 =255. So t=8, which is ≥3. So yes. So output is YES.\n\nSample Input 8: n=10101 → need to check. Let's see. For example, for t=3, 1 +k +k^2 = 10101 → k^2 +k +1 =10101 → k^2 +k -10100 =0 → discriminant is 1 +4*10100 = 40401 → sqrt(40401) is 201. So k = (-1 +201)/2 = 200/2 =100. So yes, k=100, t=3. So output is YES.\n\nSample Input 9: n=1e18 → output NO. Because for example, let's see if there's any t and k. Let's see for t=3: 1 +k +k^2 = 1e18 → k^2 +k +1 =1e18 → approximately k^2 ~1e18 → k ~1e9. Let's check for k=1e9: k^2 is 1e18, so 1e18 + 1e9 +1 is much larger than 1e18. So no solution here. For t=3, the minimal is 7, but for larger k, the sum would be larger than 1e18. So perhaps there's no solution. Hence output is NO.\n\nNow, code-wise, let's think about possible optimizations.\n\nBut first, the code needs to handle very large exponents. For example, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn = input value.\n\nif n ==1 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for t_val in 3 to 60:\n\n       min_val = 2^t_val -1.\n\n       if n < min_val → skip.\n\n       else:\n\n           find k such that sum_{i=0}^{t_val-1} k^i =n.\n\n           to find k, perform binary search.\n\nBut how to compute min_val? For t_val up to 60, 2^t_val can be computed as 1 << t_val, but for t_val=60, 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976. So for n up to 1e18, for t_val=60, min_val is 1.15e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for n=1e18, this t_val is skipped.\n\nSo code for min_val:\n\nmin_val = (1 << t_val) -1 ?\n\nBut for t_val up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nBut for t_val=60, 1<<60 is 1152921504606846976. So for n=1e18, which is 1000000000000000000, which is less than 1.15e18, so for t_val=60, min_val is larger than n, so we skip.\n\nSo for each t_val in 3 to 60:\n\n   compute min_val = 2^t_val -1.\n\n   if n < min_val → continue.\n\n   else:\n\n       find k via binary search.\n\nNow, the code for the binary search part.\n\nBut for the binary search, the initial high can be found by doubling.\n\nBut for code, perhaps the following steps:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, t_val, n) < 0:  # sum is less than n\n\n   high *=2\n\nOnce high is found such that compute_sum(high, t_val, n) >=0 (i.e., sum is >=n), then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut compute_sum returns -1 if sum is less than n, 0 if equal, 1 if greater.\n\nWait, in the helper function, compute_sum returns:\n\nif total ==n → 0\n\nif total <n → -1\n\nif total >n → 1.\n\nSo during the exponential search phase, we can check:\n\nInitially, high is 2. compute_sum(high, t_val, n) returns:\n\nif returns -1 → sum is less than n → need to increase high.\n\nif returns 0 or 1 → sum is >=n → stop.\n\nSo code for finding high:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile True:\n\n    res = compute_sum(high, t_val, n)\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and our task is to check if such a structure can exist for the given `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers where each vertex in the previous layer connects to `k` new vertices. The total number of vertices after `t` layers can be represented by the formula for the sum of a geometric series: $ \\frac{k^t - 1}{k - 1} $.\n\n2. **Constraints Check**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists integers `k > 1` and `t ≥ 3` such that the number of vertices `n` matches the formula derived from the geometric series.\n\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each possible value of `t` (from 3 to 60, since higher values would exceed the maximum possible `n` of $10^{18}$), we check if there exists a valid `k` using binary search.\n\n4. **Binary Search for k**: For each `t`, we use binary search to find a valid `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`. This involves checking if the sum of the series for a given `k` and `t` matches `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        if total > n:\n            return 1\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return 1\n        current *= k\n    if total == n:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return -1\n\ndef check_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_t = 60\n    for t_val in range(3, max_t + 1):\n        min_val = (1 << t_val) - 1\n        if n < min_val:\n            continue\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Exponentially find upper bound\n        while True:\n            res = compute_sum(high, t_val, n)\n            if res != -1:\n                break\n            high *= 2\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        left = 2\n        right = high\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            res = compute_sum(mid, t_val, n)\n            if res == 0:\n                return True\n            elif res == -1:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if check_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Validity**: For each test case, the function `check_possible` checks if the number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph.\n3. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible number of layers `t` (from 3 to 60), the code checks if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n4. **Binary Search**: For each `t`, a binary search is performed over possible values of `k` to efficiently determine if a valid configuration exists.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations within the constraints, leveraging mathematical properties and binary search to handle large values up to $10^{18}$.",
